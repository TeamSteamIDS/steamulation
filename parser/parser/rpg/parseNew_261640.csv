												Since the opinions on this game are really mixed, I decided to compare it to BL2. And make an acutal review about it with that. Obviously these points are my opinion, so don't judge it.Pre-Sequel Pros:- Classes are more interesting- Cyro is probably better than Slag (in game design)- Cars are faster- Early game is more fun- Vault hunters actually say things to the story- Butt SlamsBorderlands 2 Pros:- Longer story- Better DLCs- Not as much walking- More guns- Maps are more colorful- Better characters and humor- No annoying oxygen mechanic- More types of enemies- More Bosses/post story content- Better side quests- Less expensiveSo, overall I'd say BL2 is better. If you already played BL1 and BL2, buy TPS if you liked them. Even though you might wanna wait for a discount.As for people who are new to the series, I'd play BL1 or BL2 first, since this one is more expensive, and probably the worst one of the three.			"

												I would recommend to buy this game during a sale if you liked Borderlands 2, but this game isn't nearly as good as Borderlands 2.			"

												NOTE; Most of the other reviews are outdated. They were right at one point, but the game has taken a turn for the betterIf you haven't played Borderlands 2 yet, I highly recommend at least playing through the main story of that game before picking up this one.The game takes place on Pandora's moon, Elpis, and just like the games before it, you take control of one of four Vault Hunters, and you shoot your way through waves of bandits, psychos, hostile wildlife and an entire military force to open a vault. However, this game does have many different features to it that make it unique, and a lot of returning features.Pros;+Lazer weapons. A very welcome tool for your arsenal. They range from rapid fire assault rifles to shotguns to railguns+Cryo weapons. I wanted these very badly in 2, and my wish got granted. They restrict affected enemies movements and makes them vulnerable to melee attacks (mind that it does the same to you)+Vending Machines are now somewhat relevant. In 1 and 2 I didn't even bother looking in gun vending machines, but now that you're able to buy purple and orange rarety weapons, they actually have a purpose now+Manuverability. This is what really defines this game out of the series. The low gravity on Elpis allows acrobatic gunfights and more importantly; butt slams (or ground pounds. But butt slam is more fun)+Grinder. You can grind lower rarety weapons into better weapons of a higher rarety. Not an 100% chance of a higher rarety, but its a good way to get rid of some of your white and green guns+Classes. Skill trees are the same setup (I mean that as a good thing), and the classes are very unique... hopefully they'll have enough ideas for threeCons;-Side Quests. While the main quest's dialouge is interesting, and the gameplay is great, most side quests are just flat out dull in speech and gameplay. Too many fetch missions, that lead to more fech missions. Granted some do reveal how things came to be in time for 2, and others are funny enough to be redeemed, most aren't worth the EXP.-Lazy Raid Boss. Bosses now respawn (that was an issue for a while), but the first and only raid boss of the base game is the final boss with more health and higher damage output. While I still did enjoy murdering it, I would much rather prefer something new and fresh.-Shorter than 2. It has 13-14 chapters versus the 18 chapters 2 had. -Terrain. The game has many cool areas, with multiple ways to kill you. The only problem is, falling to your death is a little too easy at times. The manuverability I talked about before helps this, unless you're in a vehicle.Neutral things*Oxygen. When in a vacuum, you must rely on your oxygen supply to live (surprising right). Oxygen also allows you to double jump and butt slam, so be sure to keep an eye on it.*Many returning weapons. A lot of weapons are similar to 2, so it should be a somewhat familiar experience with the loot.*Moonstones. The new Eridium. Used for ammo upgrades, moonstone chests (spend them to get purple rarety weapons/gear) or that lame raid boss I was talking about earlier. So mostly ammo.If you loved 2, you'll love this game. I love this game, so it pains me to say this; buy it on sale. Sure the gameplay is great, but the quests seem tedious and lack luster, and while the Claptastic Voyage DLC redeems this, a game shouldn't rely on DLC to fix itself.(This is my first review, so please give me some feedback on how I could improve my writing, or any spelling or gammatical errors.)

												Edited on 03/29/2015: The changes are made to reflect the most recent patch released on 03/24/2015, focusing on respawnable bosses.I DO NOT have Claptastic Voyage, so this review still only covers the base game.I thank the 2000+ readers who have given their time to rate my review.  More thanks to those who left comments.I don't want to write lengthy reviews since they take a lot of time; time that could be spent on playing my backlog of games.I love Borderlands.  I want to continue loving it.  The Pre-Sequel (TPS) is the 3rd game, and I have expectations.  At $60 I would expect more creativity, more risks, further embrace what BDL2 did successfully and remedy the areas that needed correction. What TPS offered, however, seemed to be a mediocre effort on the fronts that mattered that warranted a detailed review.TPS does do some things right:Classes: Although it still follows the archetypes of assault, offense, support and general purpose, there is enough variation and changes to make the classes feel different.  For instance, meleeing in BDL2 was very unsafe; Zer0's Deception covered too many areas to make melee effective (Slag, movement speed, dashing attack, damage output and more.) TPS introduced a much more flexible melee style through Athena, where she could close in distance very quickly, dashing across the area and capable of surviving through firefights.  TPS also expanded the use of stacks in all characters and eliminated overpowered damage increases from the likes of the Gunzerker.Money and Vending Machines are relevant: In BDL2, money was useless on any mode.  Vendors continued to sell white items even at OP8.  I rarely saw Purples and Legendaries never appeared.TPS vendors have Purples and Legendaries much more often, so money does play a role to help you gear up, and you'll want to treat death seriously to prevent being unable to afford said items.Moonstones: The eridium equivalent and this resource is constantly used. Players will be using it on multiple things, such as the Grinder to enhance the chance of improving the rarity of the weapon generated and adding an additional effect on the final product.Grinder: All weapon have a use. You can recycle unwanted weapons in hopes to get something new. Given that the vendors have better gear often, there's a bit of resource juggling where there's a choice to sell the item or craft a new one.Slamming: A crouching mechanic, for all classes, used in midair to drop quickly to the ground to create an AoE slamming strike.  This opens up new combat tactics and variations.  It should be a new staple.Lasers: A very welcome addition to the player's arsenal. All barrels function differently (with varying strengths and weaknesses,) and combining with the weapon brand gimmicks, lasers are the most varied weapon in the game. Different brands could enhance the strength AND negate the weaknesses.The rest of the game is where it starts falling apart:Writing: I wasn't impressed with the writing. Censoring profanity is fine to a degree, given that profanity shouldn't be the dictating factor to provide humour. But when you replace the profanity with words that don't even seem to match the harshness, the potential seriousness of the Borderlands world, it sounds weak.   Many characters seem to lack impact due to the limited influence they play throughout the story, and when a lot of the humour from the predecessors is also ripped out, the game fails to make a good lasting impression.  More often than not, I found myself being bored of the tales I was presented because the game couldn't make me care.Terrains: Lots of death pits.  Auto-save beacons were rare.  It's almost designed to ensure players died often.Side Quests/Main Quests/Padding: There are game designs that are generally despised; RPGs fail to make Charisma have impact; obscene amounts of QTE's that add nothing to spark interest; poor autosave location etcs.  There are also bad quest designs.  TPS embraced one of the least liked quest designs and amplified the worst aspects of it.TPS adores Fetch Quests, but it's done in a way that quickly loses its welcome.  You have a fetch quest that midway branches to another fetch quest, then this branch opens up to another series of fetch quests.  The objectives have objectives within the objectives to reach the objective!  Multiple fetch quests in the span of only ONE quest, effectively doubling to tripling this dull experience.  Rinse and repeat multiple times in multiple quests.  The experience becomes infuriating when you add in the poor terrain, killing legions of enemies that drop no good loot to show for your efforts under agitation, painfully dragging yourself through this boredom all in hopes of there may be something better later on.This is padding in the worst way -forcibly lengthening a game with minimal effort and creativity.  The game acts like it hates and mocks your free time.Lack of Creativity: For a $60 game, I expected that 2K Australia (2KA) came up with more content with BDL2 as a foundation. Hyperion could have their own Assault Rifles again.   Atlas could have hid a stash of guns to preserve their brand.  How about a new gimmick in existing brands? Instead, 2KA did little, if anything, to the existing BDL2 weapon pool, thus all weapons felt exactly what I expected without additional testing.TPS uses 90% (estimation only) of BDL2's legendaries, creating very few originals for a new experience.  No praise should come from this lack of effort. DLCs: DLC business practices are judged very unfavorably when the game is threadbare. It puts me at a moral standpoint where I am morally unable to want to buy the DLCs when more work needed to be focused on the main game. DLCs are welcome additions when the main game has substance, but in TPS's case, these DLCs may serve as the surgery needed to revive it. So why not put more energy in the main product? Why must I feel cheated of a better experience?And the very worst:Bosses are now Respawnable: For 161 days until March 24th 2015, bosses didn't respawn.  Players had to ""ALT+F4"" their game to prevent saving or duplicate their save files to fight minibosses.  Despite that this is remedied, that does not excuse the incompetence of 2KA for removing the said feature of to begin with.161 days.2KA knowingly took out a crucial feature that effectively killed the game's longevity.  2KA doesn't understand Borderlands.  The spirit of the franchise is noticeably absent.  2KA deliberately made a choice to make the game less fun for players, making the already hollow game offer even less.  Why?  Who approved of such a thing?Raid Boss:  The raid boss is the final story boss that has more health and deals more damage.At best, the raid boss is a lazily slapped together effort that lacks any innovation and originality.  At worst, it's open contempt to the fans who had any expectations.This is 2KA's way of saying that the players, who paid them $60 for this game, aren't worth their time to create a brand new boss fight.  2KA is giving no respects to the players who love the franchise, as if poorly reusing an existing boss meets the requirements of having a new boss, arrogantly attempting to justify that this mediocre amount of effort is suffice.This is taking incompetence to a whole new level.  2KA has taken a new step on to directly insult players.  It took out the middle man that is the gameplay and questing, and found a way to get players to feel shocked, appalled and disappointed just by looking at the boss. Final Verdict: 5/10 at the very best.2KA has offered us a game that meets the minimum expectations that fans have come to expect from a Borderlands game. This plays like a $30 DLC that costs $60. I cannot justify the $60 value with the experience TPS provided.  I do not pay money to feel insulted.  I do not reward such contempt and incompetence.If you must give TPS a try, buy it on a steep sale.			"

												(Updated review. Went from about 9 hours gameplay when I first wrote this to 30),Well I guess I'm just not having the same experience as most of the top commenters. So far I've really enjoyed the game.Does it feel like it is a huge DLC? Yes. The menus are the same thing, the main screen when you start the game is the same thing (Your character, Claptrap doing stupid stuff in the background, same layout exactly just a different setting).Does driving suck? Sorta. I've had issues with not making jumps and I've had times where occassionally my car decides to keep going straight while I'm turning. Yes I've fallen off the map multiple times, but it hasn't been that bad. Just something to get used to. I think the issue is more so that the jumps you have to do to get to other parts of the maps are very exact. There's not a lot of room to undershoot even with a perfect take off.Is AI bad? Not really. I feel like it's about the same as BL2, which wasn't perfect, but was pretty decent. If you see a guy and he doesn't see you he tends to walk around aimleslly. If you shoot they notice you 98% of the time, and when they don't, I just kill them and keep moving. No sense in standing around looking for reasons to not like the game.So now I'll move onto things that I've noticed:In BL2 you could find any weapon at any time. Not so here. Want a shotgun or a sniper rifle early?  Do some side quests then. You won't find them randomly. Want to play with the new ice weapons? Too bad, they don't start showing up for a long time. The loot system is definitely less randomized in this game. I got an Anshin Oz Kit from a side quest from Janie at level 3 and it's still the only one I've seen by Anshin and I've gotten two characters to level 12. I've seen Orange level rarity weapons and items a bunch from vendors but I've had white level equivelants that were better from a lower level. Also selling and buying prices are DRASTICALLY different in this game. Buying the Item of the Day costs me around $2000, If I were to sell pretty much the exact same item back I get like $60. This leads to me wanting to use the vendors less and less because money seems harder to come by and buying one or two things depletes my reserves for a pretty long time - and  I loot ALL the things. I wish higher rarity weapons truly showed that they were better in this game like they should be.The Oxygen thing is honestly neutral for me. It doesn't add to the game much, but it doesn't take from it either. I hardly notice it as almost every enemy drops oxygen tanks. If you're running low, kill something and there's an 80% chance it'll drop a tank. If one isn't enough that's what Kraggons are for.To sum everything up though, I have really enjoyed my experience so far. Things are a little less polished than I'd like, but I'm sure it'll be fixed in patches. There were no beta testers for this game and I'm sure most play testing was done on limited varieties of hardware. You cannot expect it all to run exactly the same on 20,000 different computer setups as well as the consoles it was released on. I'd recommend the game if you enjoyed the previous ones. If you are worried about these issues though, wait until it hits a sale. This is Steam, there's gonna be sales.EDIT: I've hit about 30 hours of gameplay now and I think I've grown to like the game more. I played through first as Athena and really didn't like her, then started as Wilhelm and enjoyed him but found he seemed to be underleveled and I got killed a lot. Now obviously the level is up to me to move, but I like to play through games without doing side quests first to experience the story, and then I play again and do achievements and sidequests. You can get through a really large chunk of the game this way, and then I got stuck around level 20 fighting level 25+ enemies. Restarted as Nisha because I figured if I had to grind I may as well try the last character! She's definitely my favorite, though her ability is a bit underwhelming on multiplayer haha. I find that once you get farther into the game and do side missions the issues I had with loot and money seem to go away for the most part, so I think I can mostly retract that. Still not a fan of vendor gouging though; I've seen orange level rarity weapons at vendors for well over 35,000 while everything else they're selling is around $1000. It feels like they're taunting you! I hadn't even FOUND that much money at that point in the game!I've also gotten more used to the different gravity and while I originally thought it made you a bit slower I find that I can get around really fast by using the oxygen boost (double jump). There are oxygen geysers everywhere so it's not a big deal to burn that extra few O2.  I still stand by my recommendation for this game. If you like Borderlands, you're going to like this game.Also, thanks for the rates and comments.			"

												Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is the follow up to Borderlands 2 and fallows on the rise of Handsome Jack. But will you want to play it ?Borderlands TPS takes place after the events of Borderlands and before the events of Borderlands 2 and follows on four new vault hunters. Athena, Wilhelm, Nisha and Claptrap get a message from a hyperion worker who happens to be Handsome Jack. After the Dahl soldiers take over the space station they try to destroy the moon of Elpis and it's up to you to stop them.Gameplay is identical to Borderlands 2. The only new thing is the new Oxygen system. You have a bar which starts to drain when you are outside the oxygen field for too long. Then you start to suffocate. You can also use the double jump to get on higher platforms. You can avoid the oxygen system by picking Claptrap as your character. The new abilities are awesome and all of them are very fun to use.Graphics are stunning as ever. They look awesome and all the colors are very nice to look at. The textures are kind of mediocre and some of the character models look very bad. Overall the game looks great apart from minor flaws.Audio is pretty bad. The game's audio for me stopped during firefights and I couldn't hear anything the characters would say to me and sometimes the Echo Com screen didn't transfer the dialogue and I couldn't hear anything which wasn't a problem in Borderlands 2. The soundtrack is alright, there are some great songs but a lot of them are kind of mediocre.The game is pretty easy for the most part until the final chapter where there is a massive difficulty spike and the final boss solo is incredibly hard. The boss fights are very team oriented meaning the game expected you to play with people from the start. Level Design in some parts is abysmal it took me massive amounts of understanding where my objective was and where the side quest start. This by far the worst level design in a borderlands game.The game took me 22 hours to complete every quest and to get to level 27. The game like other Borderlands games has tons of replay value with different vault hunter modes and trying out other characters and of course not to mention the DLC which I will have to check out one day.The game is pretty stable from the most part. There where some parts where the game wouldn't open a certain door to progress through a quest but a quick reload always fixed the problem.Overall this game is not as good as the other titles in the series and without a doubt not worth it at the full price. I am a massive Borderlands fan and Pre Ordered this game once I saw it and I can safely say it wasn't a bad game but it's not as good as the other Borderlands games. For other people only buy this on a sale. It has a lot of horrible side quests but this is an overall good game and I highly suggest you to check it out on a sale. I give Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel a 7/10For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												EDIT: Season Pass content has been completely revealed, updated review to reflect that.If you know me, you know I'm a Borderlands maniac. This game simply just did not deliver. Gearbox handed the reigns off to 2K Australia and it seriously suffered. Lemme give you the run down:POSITIVE+ Buttslams and low gravity are fun as hell, and make combat in this game incredibly satisfying and borderline addictive+ 4 new(ish) vault hunters with great skill trees and little to no skills that absolutely suck (lookin' at you More Pep & Flicker from BL2)+ Each vault hunter is more chatty and has unique dialogue to chime in with during story and side mission conversations+ The Grinder is a great tool for helping you get that specific gear you're looking for by putting in the correct ingredient weapons+ Laser weapons are friggin' sweet! Pewpewpew!+ New vehicle, the Stingray, is unique in being the first solo-rider-only+ Vending machines have significantly higher chances to have an orange item as the item of the day (like BL1 chances)NEGATIVE - 90% of orange items in this game are DIRECT PORTS or RESKINS of guns from BL2. Some are even clones with very small mechanical changes as if to pass it off as something brand new. There are a VERY SMALL handful of completely new orange weapons- As a cherry on top of that issue, a large group of bosses and mini-bosses that have specific orange weapons tied to their loot drops NEVER RESPAWN. You get one shot to get their loot. Good luck or have fun Alt+F4ing- Don't forget the chocolate sauce for this sundae of dissapointment! The Grinder WAS cool until you find yourself rely on it nearly completely as a source of oranges during end-game because you got no BOSSES TO FARM.- As if finding ported oranges wasn't bad enough, welcome back a few freakin' direct port quest uniques! REALLY 2kAUS?? They burn you on the oranges and then even get too lazy to make UNIQUE quest rewards for this game- Areas of the map include lots and lots of long uninteresting treks across the moon until you unlock the vehicles- The soundtrack in this game is not very interesting. It's all just kinda bland space trancey stuff. BL2 (especially the pirate dlc) had some absolutely sick music- enemies are very watered down in variance. Basically you have bandits in space suits (but much less variety of them), dahl soldiers, kraggons (they're cool), shugaraths (only on 1 map though) space spiderants and eridians. They cut out badass psychos, nomads, goliaths, varkids, bullymongs and crystalisks completely. The amount of new enemies is very much out-weighed by what you lost- enemies don't really say anything memorable. In  BL2 the bandits and hyperion personal said some hilarious things in the middle of battle. Scavs on the moon just say a lot of aussie mumbo jumbo. I mean it's lightly amusing, but the delight of the accent wears off soon and the dialogue itself is not that funny.- Once you hit 50 there isn't a lot to do. With all the recycled oranges from BL2 and the issues of their bosses never respawning why do you even bother farming? Oh that's right so you can take what you do from farming vending machines and put it in the grinder. gee thats fun, whoopee!- The season pass is very pail compared to BL2's pass. It includes 2 characters (Handsome Jack's doppleganger and Hamerlock's sister, Aurelia) 1 arena dlc called the Holodome (also comes with +10 levels) and 1 campaign dlc (+10 more levels included, so max level cap will be 70). So in total that's 2 characters, 1 arena and 1 campaign. Let me remind you BL2 had FOUR campaigns in their season pass and still had 2 characters dlc you could get serperately from the pass (Gaige was even free with preorder of BL2)- The story isn't all that impressive, and leaves some pretty big questions unaswered for the viewer. But you form your own opinion on the story, if anything the unique dialogue from each vault hunter is very fun to listen to.In summary, this game is not woth the $60 price tag. I would reccommend waiting for a sale that drops it to $45 or lower.The pre-sequel is a fun game for the first play-through for fans of the franchise and newcomers. Play-through 2 and endgame will largely dissapoint the hardcore fans that enjoy the series so much, though.7/10 PSYCHO MIDGETS (wait, we call them little people on the moon now)			"

												IMPORTANT: Before you think about buying Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel I recommend you play through Borderlands 2 a few times. If you still want more after that, then play the campaign expansions and upgrade packs. If you still want more after that, then, and only then, can I recommend Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. INTRODUCTION: I've been a fan of the series for a few years now. Though I only played Borderlands in anticipation for Borderlands 2, it still quickly became my favorite game. Until Borderlands 2 came along that is. Borderlands 2 is still my favorite game to this day, and here's why Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel doesn't even come close. Before Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel even came out I heard statements describing it as more Borderlands 2 or an expansion of Borderlands 2, but I wouldn't even go that far. It definitely feels shorter than Borderlands 2, but that probably wouldn't have been a problem if it weren't for the level design. The areas in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel are generally pretty small compared to the vast environments in previous games, and the areas that actually are vast environments just feel empty. I get it; it's the moon. It's kind of supposed to be empty. But that doesn't make it any less dissapointing(to me at least). Personally I think Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel has the best story in the series(yes, I do realize that's not saying much), but probably the weakest cast. Or I suppose I should say new cast. Because the player characters and all of the other characters who had appearances in previous games are great, but all of the new characters don't really have anything going for them other than various British or Australian accents. Even Janey Spring's charisma wears off in time. The vast majority of missions in the Borderlands games have been fetch quests or thinly disguised fetch quests, but it has never been more apparent in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. I remember I would dread time trial missions in previous games, but in this game they're the only ones I look forward to doing in new game ++ simply because I know it's the closest thing to a breath of fresh air I'm going to get. All two of them that is. It's even more of a shame, because the playable characters in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel are the most fun to play as in the series. For the first time ever the character classes are completely different than those in previous games. But unfortunately we can only play as them in the underwhelming environments of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, and only while doing its boring missions.I understand that the games in the Borderlands series don't have much going for them, and the only reason to play them longer than it takes to play through their missions with a few friends is this: loot. The prospect of obtaining one-of-kind unique or legendary items has a certain appeal to those of us who are more magpie than man(such as myself). In the previous games a few missions would award rare, unique items with special abilities. But in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel almost every other side mission awards one so it doesn't feel special when the player receives one anymore. In the previous games many bosses and unique enemies had a small chance of dropping a certain legendary item upon being killed, and  if the item didn't drop the player could quit to the main menu and then the enemy would respawn the next time the player loads his or her save. This allowed these items to be ""farmed"". But not anymore. Now most of the enemies that drop legendary items never respawn, and the player is expected to literally grind weapons together to obtain legendary weapons. I don't know about you, but I don't think feeding guns into a slot machine and hoping I will get a legendary gun in return is nearly as exciting as fighting a giant monster or an evil mech warrior and hoping a legendary item will fly out of their back pocket as it dies. And even farming from enemies gets tedious after the thirtieth fruitless attempt. So hats off to you Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel! You managed to make farming more boring than it already was.  Lastly, I just want to add that yes the vehicle handling in this game is somehow even worse than Borderlands 2.			"

Borderlands: The Pre-SequelReleased: Oct 2014Developer: 2K Australia, Gearbox Software, AspyrPublisher: 2K, AspyrImpressions:Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel (TPS) is Borderlands 2 (BL2) again, and as one who really enjoyed both BL1, BL2 and pretty much devoured all the dlc for those games it is a very enjoyable game to play.  However, for those who didn't for any reason enjoy the previous releases, you can stop reading here, this game will not get you hooked.New in this version is that you're playing on a moon, meaning in large parts of the game there is low gravity, and no oxygen.  You're given Oz kits that allow you to boost for extra jump height as well giving you much more speed and maneuverability, as well as the ability to slam down onto enemies on the ground. Oh, and they let you breathe which can also be handy sometimes.Most enemies you fight will also be wearing space helmets to allow breathing that can be shattered, making them suffocate.  This is actually a significant gameplay change from BL2, since these helmets are much larger critical spots and easy to hit, unlike headshots in BL2 which could at times be tricky to land on erratic moving enemies.  Another difference is that unless you're fighting in areas with oxygen, fire weapons can not cause burn damage, funny how that works.Other gameplay changes include a new laser weapon type, the removal of Slag damage from BL2 (thank you!), the inclusion of cold elemental damage which can freeze enemies solid allowing you to shatter them with a quick melee strike, and relics being replaced by the aforementioned Oz kits.  Last but not least TPS stars 6 new character classes, making TPS feel fresh despite its many similarities with BL2.As someone odd enough to have actually enjoyed the stories told and the lore from the previous games, TPS delivers.  The writing is hardly award winning material, but the story from the perspective of mercenaries hired by Jack before the events of BL2 has him starring as the main villain is an interesting one.  TPS also features the usual humour and puns, for which the appreciation will of course be very hit or miss.  Personally I've had quite a few laughs and will at least give a sympathetic smirk each time the game throws a funny at you.If you're in the mood for more Borderlands, and haven't had a go at TPS yet, it is a fairly easy recommendation for me to make.  Well worth picking up during a sale along with the season pass which includes a couple characters and a story dlc.Pros: Slag is gone, and all is well! Better PhysX optimization compared to BL2.  I very rarely see fps drop below 60 even during hectic firefights on my trusty old GTX 680 2GB. While I was sceptical at first, the moon environment works quite well, and changes up the gameplay a bit from BL2. Enjoyable story and humour in the same style of previous games. New 'Grinder' machine in the main town that lets you combine weapons and gear into new, possibly improved ones.  A smart move, meaning there's always going to be something to spend your money on. The cashmoneys in BL2 quickly lost any real value outside of buying ammo.Cons:  Diehard BL2 grinders beware, TPS does not offer the endgame raid challenges and OP levels of BL2, because....  Not long after release, the dev studio that released TPS closed its doors.  Some of the DLC released was actually produced in house at Gearbox, just so there could be enough value in the season pass.  It is looking extremely unlikely that there will be more DLC or other updates released for TPS.  There's a few bugs.  One particularly annoying bug is that your character sometimes gets perma-slowed after taking cold damage, forcing you to restart the game to be able to move around at normal speeds.  Largely forgettable soundtrack.  Some areas don't even have a music score, just ambient background sound. Re-uses quite a few uniques and legendaries from BL2. "

												I've wanted to do a review of this game for a long time.. But, I don't really know what to say about it.  Did I have fun playing? Yes.  Was there anything about the game that bothered me? TONS!...Do I recommend it?  Absolutely!I have a lot of hours spent playing the previous two Borderlands titles.  Nearly 100 hours in the first game, and I'm 2 hours shy of 500 for Borderlands 2.  My opinion may be a bit biased, because I am a huge fan of the series.  If you didn't enjoy the previous games, don't bother with this one.. it's not going to be any better for you.If you find yourself disappointed in the price, or the length of the game, or the fact that it is a 'reskinned Borderlands 2'.. You shouldn't be.  They were absolutely transparent about these things.  They said right from the start that the game is built off of Borderlands 2.  They said right from the start that it would not be as huge.  If you're new to the series.. this may have bothered you.  But if you followed this game at all before it was released, you knew exactly what you were getting long before it came out.As far as the pros and cons go, I do not find that there are many of either, meaning that most the game is a double edged sword- but even given that, I find the balance to be well done most of the time.For example...  The whole low gravity and oxygen system.  I love the low gravity, I think it adds a whole new aspect to the game.. the whole ""How the hell am I going to get over there?"" thing.  But it has a downside as well.  When you kill enemies, whatever they drop doesn't always just fall to the ground.  It often flies into places you cannot easily find it, or worse, places you cannot get it at all... like, off the map.As far as the oxygen system goes, I love the double jump mechanic and the butt slams you get with the Oz kits.  I love how you can shatter enemy masks and cause another type of DOT.  But actually having to manage an oxygen level is more of an annoyance than anything.  Even that has 2 edges though.  Many Oz kits have perks based on your oxygen levels.  But when you're just trying to wander across a map for a quest.. having to stop what you're doing periodically and refill is a pain.Lazer weapons.  Some of the best guns in the game are lazer weapons, so are some of the worst guns in the game.  Some have excellent damage, excellent aim, and a good continuous damage bonus and will just absolutely shred everything you come across.. unless of course the enemies are beyond the range of what your weapon can do or you are outside of an atmosphere.Driving.  The stingray is actually really fun to take out and drive around and once you get the hang of it you will find you can get it into some pretty creative spots.  The car though, I find to be horrendous to navigate around with.  It's a combination of the low gravity, and the tons of little 'invisible walls' you can hit.Bosses and loot.  This was one of the things that bugged me the most about this game actually.  Many of the bosses do not respawn, and the majority of the legendary items don't really have that one baddie that has a higher chance to drop them.  But, vending machines have a much higher chance of having legendary items in them, and there is the grinder.  It may be easier, but farming bosses was a huge thing for me in Borderlands 2.  Of course, the update coming with the claptrap dlc includes a pleasingly large list of bosses that will respawn now, and the loot pool of one that doesnt, being moved to one that will.Anyway.  There are some bugs.. there are some really annoying things, like 'invisible walls'.. some parts of the floor or rocks or whatever that are not solid when you're trying to navigate to tricky areas or just randomly exploring the edges of the world.  But personally, I find stuff like that to be part of what Borderlands has always been.  When I fall through a rock, sure it's annoying.  But, I can't help but think to myself, ""Of course I would fall through that.""It doesnt seem like I mentioned many good things about this game does it.  It's there.  I really enjoyed the story, and watching Handsome Jack become what he is in Borderlands 2.  I was completely immersed through my first play through, I enjoyed exploring the completely new areas.  I really like the new player classes.  The humour was there, and that Borderlands feel was there.  If you liked the previous games in this series, and realize that this is not 'Borderlands 3', I think you will enjoy it as well...			"

												I was initially skeptical about this game... then as I played it more I came to like it more... but in the end, I've only completed one playthrough and feel little desire to go back. At the same time, I am going back to BL2 actually, that's still a great game even though I have 10 times as much playtime in that already than in TPS.I'm not going to write a very elaborate review, there are enough. I'm just going to say that if you can get it cheap than it may be an okay buy (the story of Jack is good, even if a lot of the stuff around it is boring), but as a whole I'm going to not recommend this game because it is just so much worse than Borderlands 1 and 2 were. From the beginning this felt like it should have been a DLC for BL2 (if it should have existed in the first place). Now it turns out that the season pass for this is a joke, with so far two characters and one arena and not a single campaign addition yet even though 3/4 of the season pass content has been released? It's a joke and an insult.I've come to like 2K/Take Two a lot lately, but with this they've shown that they're just as much of a moneygrabbing company without integrity as EA/Ubi. I just hope they wont F up Borderlands 3.			"

												Opening statement? errr.......how about...... ""Australia......in SPACE !""Pros.+Good port, runs well, even has a colorblind option.+You have an identity now: NPCs don't call you Vault Hunter all the time anymore (In the main quests at least.),they call you by name of your character and sometime they have unique dialogues with you base on that. (Like how Jack hits on Nisha right off the bat 5 minutes into the game) and your character can replies back to them. +Good gunplay, the same as Borderlands 2, but not as good as Call of Juarez: Gunslinger+Slamming is fun and satisfying.+Funny characters (It's a given, I know.)+New weapon and equipment types.+Moxxtails (Drinks that give you temporary boost) are fun and helpful to use, if you have Moonstones to spare.Cons.-In early game, it's possible that you just won't get the type of gun you want and there is nothing you can do about it (Can be remedied by adding Weapon Vendors in starting areas.)-You can only have one quest marked on your map at the same time (The game should have allow 2 or more, or have the game tell players that they're close to a quest objective of another quests)-Dat padding though-Is it just me? or do some of the human enemies have smaller hitbox than their model?-The menus are still the same, They're not broken, but they can be improved, especially the inventory menu (I prefer Diablo 3 inventory menu: everything you need on the same screen, and you don't need to scroll through list of loots, press Shift to compare weapon, etc.)-""How am I going to get over there?"" moments.-Invisible walls: There are places that look like you can just walk or jump over but you can't because of the invisible walls, which can be really annoying.Mixed bag#Vacuum of Space: Your O2 doesn't last very long which can turn a firefight into a frantic search for O2 pockets and canisters, but those things are common enough that you're more likely to die from enemy attacks than running out of O2, making it feels like an annoyance rather than an actual hazard.#The Side Quests: There are lots of sidequests to do, but the rewards are not scale to your level (Or not scale well enough) which makes the quests less rewarding when your character level is higher than the quest level.#The game is very short: on one hand, the game doesn't overstay its welcome and make it easier for you to start a newgame+ or trying a new character out, on the other hand, it can also feels like you don't get enough bang for your bucks.Things I want Developers to see, my humble wishlist.*Beastmaster-type playable character, tame beast, ride beast. etc. (In the game there are enemies that ride a beast to fight you, I wanna ride one too!)*Long press to open all Containers near you.*Costumes for playable characters, not just color schemes. (Admit it, you wanna see Nisha in a Latex,and Claptrap in R2D2 costume)*Reworked Inventory menu, makes everything display on the screen without having to scroll though a list.*Selectable third person camera.*Steam Workshop support, and modding tools*More Fast Travel stations.

												So, good news and bad news. The bad news is that Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel plays pretty much like a big expansion pack for Borderlands 2. The good news on the other hand is that Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel plays pretty much like a big expansion pack for Borderlands 2.In other words, if you liked Borderlands 2 and you want some more of that (with some fun new additions like laser weapons, new elemental effects, low-gravity fun and all-new environments) this should be a no-brainer.

												Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is the third installment in the Borderlands series. This game offers an insight into the events that take place during the period between Borderlands 1 and Borderlands 2. The game was developed by 2K Australia and published by 2K games.  Releasing on PC, PS3 and 360 in October 2014. The gameplay is as expected, similar to that of the previous games in the series. You can choose one of four classes (in the base game), Athena; a gladiator, Wilhelm; an enforcer, Nisha; a law bringer and Claptrap, the loveable robot mascot of the series. Each of these classes has different skills. I’ve played through the game twice so far, once with Wilhelm who is definitely the more run and gun sort of approach, and Athena who adopts a more of “Tank style” gameplay. One new element of gameplay which has been added into this release is the use of oxygen. The game takes place on the moon of Pandora. You have an additional oxygen bar to keep an eye on when you are roaming a zero atmosphere area; you can replenish your oxygen either by entering an area that has an atmosphere, catching your breath in an oxygen stream or by collecting gas cylinders from enemies and loot boxes scattered around the world.  Most people that have played The Pre-Sequel often complain that the oxygen element of the game is poor and unneeded; however I do not believe it is as bad as they are making out. At no point did I ever feel like I was being hindered throughout the game because of this feature, it just added an extra challenging aspect of the game which I thought was a welcome addition to what is essentially a run and gun game anyway. TPS also welcomes some new weapon types, lasers. A cool thing about this weapon type is that it will adapt to whether you are firing it in an atmosphere or out of one. I thought this was a really neat way of representing the environment and makes for some interesting battles nonetheless.  One of my more favourite additions to TPS is the weapon grinder. This is found roughly halfway through the story mode; you are able to put looted weapons into a grinder and combine them to make usually a higher quality weapon which may be of some use. I found this to be a nice way of making sure your character was always equipped with the best weaponry at all times as you’ll find tons of loot and often get plenty as rewards for missions anyway. The art style is identical to Borderlands 2. The same comic book style looks of the series.  However, there are some small changes given that you are on the moon. The environments are colourful and vibrant when they need to be, and dark and eerier when they need to portray that too. The level designs are spot on and leaves the player with plenty of chances to explore every corner of the map.  The voice acting is all done via an Australian accent, given that this game was developed by 2K Australia, that is to be expected but it is all done to an extremely high quality too. I actually found TPS to be more of a challenging experience when comparing it to the other games in the series. At the beginning of the game, I found myself dying countless times on some boss fights simply because I was far too under geared; whereas the later boss fights are simply a huge skill check and you should count yourself lucky to be able to get past the last few bosses.  The game also has the New Game+ mode enabled once you complete your first run, which gives the game plenty of replayability along with the co-op gameplay also on offer too. A full run through of the story mode took me 20 ish hours. Much like the other games in the series, you can easily push this past the triple digit mark with ease if you get really into it.  The only technical issue I had when playing, is the menu design is still quite clearly laid out for a control. The mouse controls in the UI seem clunky and unresponsive. I suspect if you opt to play with a controller this won’t be such a huge issue but the game is definitely better off being played with a mouse and keyboard in the grand scheme of things. I was happy to see I could get a steady 60 fps at 4k resolutions too. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel may not be as fleshed out in terms of the amount of content as Borderlands 2, and whilst I somewhat agree that this could have been a larger DLC pack for Borderlands 2, it is still a great title with the legendary Borderlands gameplay we all have learnt to love over the years. The game is easily worth its £29.99 price tag, but as you know with Borderlands, it will get cheap very quickly whenever we hit sale season.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel takes place between the events of the first two games. The original Vault has been opened, and there are rumors of another Vault on Elpis, the moon of Pandora. Elpis is a barren place, rocky and lacking in gravity, but Jack, a low-level programmer working for Hyperion, the evil corporation from Borderlands 2, has hired a new team of Vault Hunters to head to the moon and look for the Vault..In fact, The Pre-Sequel basically centers around Jack, who isn’t quite Handsome yet. Instead, he’s toiling away on the Hyperion Helios space station, trying to make a name for himself. If you’ve ever played Borderlands 2 and wondered how Jack ended up the crazed, slightly mad psychopath that he is, this game answers that question. To avoid spoiling any of it, let’s just say that the Jack you meet early on in the Pre-Sequel is not the same man you see later in the game. Events will change him.The Vault Hunters in The Pre-Sequel are much more well-rounded characters than their counterparts in the previous games. 2K Australia had said they wanted the characters to have more interaction and dialogue, and they’ve accomplished both of those things in fine fashion. It’s not unusual to have your Vault Hunter actually carry on a conversation while accepting a quest or receiving an ECHO call, rather than just mutely acquiescing and carrying on.The additional dialogue is a really nice touch, as it gives you more of an insight into the character that you’re playing. Rather than the nearly-silent protagonist of past Borderlands games, you get a glimpse of what each Vault Hunter’s motivations are here, and it adds immensely to the experience. There’s always been an incentive to replay Borderlands in the “True Vault Hunter” modes and beyond, and this new dialogue actually makes me want to replay it with all the different characters as well.The Pre-Sequel doesn’t tamper much with the ludicrous number of guns you usually get access to in Borderlands games. Instead, it adds to it with two new types of weapons: Cryo and Laser. Cryo guns will freeze enemies solid if you deal enough damage, allowing you to then shatter them into tiny pieces with a well-placed blow. It also acts as a bit of crowd control in some situations. Laser weapons come in in both the Star Wars-style repeating blasters, or the Star Trek-style continuous-beam variety. Both types are fun to use, and of course offer the full range of elemental damage bonuses.Also added to the mix in The Pre-Sequel are the O2, or “OZ” Kits. You’ll always need one of these equipped, as it provides you with oxygen to breathe when you’re out on the moon’s surface. In addition, the kit provides a number of effects, depending on what stats you have. Some kits might increase you damage with a certain elemental type, while others let oxygen canisters also act as healing. Managing your oxygen becomes a bit of a game within the game, although there are so many places to recharge that you’ll rarely have to run far if you run out. Oxygen also powers one of my favorite mechanics in the game: boosting.When you jump, you can vent your oxygen to jump farther, higher, or even change directions in midair. This, coupled with the complete lack of falling damage in Borderlands, opens up a world of possibilities for exploration, and 2K Australia has wisely chosen to reward that instinct. You’ll find lore stored on ECHO recorders, crates and weapons caches in the out-of-the-way places you can access with this newfound mobility.Despite looting a ton of weapons in my playthrough, though, I constantly felt like I was struggling to find upgrades for my gear. I ended up using the set same weapons for far longer than I was really comfortable with, simply because I couldn’t find appropriate upgrades — which is something of a problem for a franchise whose primary draw is the ever-present hunt for better loot. It’s hard to knock the game for that, though. A random system that generates the huge number of weapons that Borderlands uses will sometimes result in getting a lot of loot that you just can’t use. Still, it can be frustrating when it happens.The biggest change in The Pre-Sequel is the most obvious — the setting. We’re on the moon now, and 2K Australia has nailed the low-gravity feeling that such a setting demands. Even running animations look strange in the lower gravity environments as characters take longer, floatier strides. As mentioned above, the lack of gravity contributes to a greater verticality in the game, and it’s a good thing.Another nice touch is how the new environments can be used against your enemies. If you’re out in a vacuum, you can shoot the oxygen masks off baddies, leaving them to take constant damage until they reach an atmosphere or suffocate. You can activate oxygen field generators to allow your fire weapons to burn targets. Most amusingly, you can drop a grenade at an enemy’s feet to literally blow him off the ground — and into orbit.Outside of the setting, all of the changes in The Pre-Sequel aren’t really new features, so much as they’re fleshing out and expanding on things already within the franchise. 2K Australia really didn’t monkey around with Gearbox’s Borderlands formula very much, and while some might wish they’d done more, this is very much a case of “If it isn’t broke, don’t try to fix it.” As a result, The Pre-Sequel is that rare game that gets handed off to a different developer and manages to avoid a massive drop in quality. Instead, it builds on the system and successes of its forbears.Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is exactly what fans of the series wanted in a new installment — more Borderlands. It keeps everything that made Borderlands 2 great, and adds a few new tricks of its own. It might not be innovative, but it’s damn fun to play. Honestly, isn’t that what really matters?			"

												This is an In Progress Review:6/10I initially had this as a recommend because I thought it may open up, but after dumping half a day into this, sadly I'm going to have to change my review to ""Not Recommend""TL;DRPros:Its a Borderlands titleIts extends Borderlands 2 and closes the Gap between the two gamesIts newThe voiced Playable CharactersCons:Its boringIts buggyIts expensiveIts reskinned BL2The soundtrack, areas, names bosses and NPCs are forgettableIt will be a slow crawl to complete itMany thing just wont make senseI'm going to start off by saying if you're new to the series DO NOT BUY THIS. Buying this now is like jumping into the 3rd installment of a trilogy. You have no idea whats going on and it will leave a bad impression which can taint you to playing the predessors. Go and pick up Borderlands 2 GOTY, get two, even three times the content, at half the price.If you are not new to the series, and are a fan, I would recommend you WAIT, because $60 is a god awful price tag for what seems like a lackluster Stand Alone Add-on. I would price this at max $40, due to the fact that it is just reskinned BL2, with a few (not so great) additions. It has the same UI, the same skills, the same HUD, the same guns, the same enemies, and the same gameplay mechanics. Yes it has a new story, yes it will close the gap, but you will crawl through this bored and sick of fighting through hordes of forgettable enemies and bosses.Do not let all the positive reviews and fanboys sway you either, if you've played Borderlands 2, and Tiny Tina's Assault, you'll understand why this isnt worth the Price Tag. The Fanboys will cry ""It has new everything, new classes, new skills, new areas, new enemies""No, its Borderlands 2 with 4 new classes.You found New areas and New enemies in Tiny Tinas DLC, just as you'll find new enemies and areas here, only difference is most of these enemies are just reskinned Bandits and remodeled Skags and Spiderants.Why werent we charged $60 for Tiny Tinas? You got the same ""New Content"" there as you do here??At release, you will find many bugs, some game-breaking. The ones talked about most are quest items flying into unreachable areas, or NPCs getting stuck in walls causing a restart. These of course will be fixed, but right now be aware they are present.The Low-Gravity and Oxygen aspects are a nice experiment, but let me tell you the sheer amount of oxygen thrown at you when you dont need it, and the lack when you do, makes it such a god damn chore, you wonder why its even in the game. Oh and BTW you are the only one with a limit on your oxygen, the enemies and NPCs can wander around infinitely without having to replenish theirs. So while you're scrambling to find that O2 they're floating towards you following you whereever you go. Oh and pretty much every enemy has a jetpack and always follows so theres no more hiding and using cover.The Low Gravity makes traveling the world quicker, and engaging enemies faster, which is counter balanced by fighting off enemies by the hundreds. The firefights get so tedious and boring you'll find yourself frequently hitting ESC to take a break. Forget about using the Low Gravity to reach neat and cool areas, because theres nothing to find, no hidden chests like in the older titles, what you will find however, are invisible walls, random spots that instant kill you, getting stuck somewhere you cant jump out and even falling through the world. The Butt-Slam is also a nice little experiment but in actuality, it does more harm than good. You deal more damage shooting enemies in mid air for some reason, and can manuever more easily gliding around in the low gravity. The Second you Butt-Slam down to deal minimal damage to your enemies, this makes you a prime target from all the melee and jet-pack 'Scavs' and you'll find yourself fighting for your life frequently after butt-slamming.Just about every quest is some kind of Fetch-Quest and will drive you across the world to flip a switch, then have to cross to the other side to flip another, with many boring and slow fire-fights between. Sometimes you'll flip a switch only to find that for some reason it didnt work, and to resolve it, is to go somewhere else and flip another, but wait that didnt work either, well guess what theres one more switch back at the other side of the world you can flip that may get it going. You'll enter an enemy stronghold only to find they locked the door, forcing you to crawl your way through what is now  a maze of a base to unlock that door, return, and enter it. Once inside, guess what, another locked door causing you to crawl through.The bosses, are boring, and forgettable. Really all you have to do is shoot them from a far and avoid their attacks. They dont have much life to them either, some even lack animations. They're like a floating statue that talks and shoots at you, they dont even move. Atleast with borderlands 2, the opening scenes were very interesting and well designed. Boom Bewm, Bad Maw, the Bunker, Flynt. They were all interesting, unique and had amazing opening scenes. In TPS, every boss is like fighting Wilhelm in BL2. Lame, boring, no animations, nothing unique about it, you do it because you have to to progress. Oh and the Memes, cant forget that internet driven humor that will make you cringe every time you hear and see it. Borderlands 2 was bad with the forced memes, but this takes the cake.Honestly, I'm disappointed with this title. I am forcing myself to play it because I am a big fan of Borderlands. I've sunk hundreds of hours into BL2, and Hundreds more into BL1 for both PC and Xbox 360. The fact that they are charging $60 for reskinning BL2 and adding lackluster and forgettable enemies and features, is a slap to the face.They built Borderlands 1 from scratch and charged you $60They built Borderlands 2 off a heavily modified and upgraded BL1, with massive content, and charged you $60They built Borderlands TPS by reskinning BL2, with little ""content"", and charged you $60Why?Because Greed.

												It's fun, but not quite as fun as Borderlands 2. The story is a bit weak, the NPCs are a little flat, and the humor feels meh. I'm just guessing here, but a lot of it is because 2k Australia created it. They went heavy handed trying to infuse the game with Aussie-ness. Pickle, one of the NPCs, feels like such a terrible caricature. Cor! Blimey! He's one step away from Crocodile Dundee. (Edit: Scratch that. Apparently it's a Cockney accent. Still a bit much either way.) And sadly, because we're in space, incendiary just doesn't feel useful anymore. Some of the mechanics are terrible too. Trying to jump some of the gaps require more precision than necessary. And Deadlift, the second boss, is a lot tougher than he should be. So why am I recommending the game? Because all the playable characters are well built. I've played everyone, including the expansion characters, save for Claptrap and loved each of their skill trees. In BL2, I didn't care much for Salavdor, Zer0, Gaige or Krieg. But the PS skills are nailing it. Also, cryo as an element is an awesome replacement for slag, which really only worked in teamplay anyway. And while jumping/boosting feels a little gimmicky, it's still fun to float around and bring down a butt-slam.In short, as part of the series, it's a bit of a letdown. But if you can overlook that and pretend it's a one-off, it's still fun. Here's looking forward to Borderlands 3.			"

												Warning, because a comment called me out: light spoilers in this review.I love Borderlands. I've got 260 hours on BL2, and it's one of my favourite games. I love the combat and the leveling system and the art style and the world and much of the writing. So I did enjoy Pre-Sequel. It was fun. But it has it's problems and it's easily the worst in the series.The main issue is the writing. Most of the jokes don't seem to land. A lot of the characters are annoying, and not in the jokey way that Claptrap has always been. The main example I would bring up is Janey Springs, who's only two character traits are that she's enthusiastic and gay. Like they really drive it home that she's gay. Like it would be great to have a character that just happens to be gay, or who has some interesting plot conflict related to them being gay, but this... it's like it's a punchline. Like she just throws in some line about how obsessed she is with Moxxi, and it's not funny, it's just sort of creepy. No means no, lady.Then there's also so much standing around waiting for dialogue to finish so you can move on to the next objective. It's tedious. I got to a point where I just turned the dialogue volume to zero and just listened to podcasts instead. The game has much less content than the others, you can pretty easily finish every sidequest, and there's very little opportunity to grind for experience even if you wanted to. Some of the bosses felt a bit unfair and poorly designed if you're playing single player.It also annoyed me that this game was made. They pawned it off to a lesser studio, and made it a prequel so they could re-use Jack. Jack was a great villain in BL2, and his popularity seems to be the whole reason this game was made. Just more cashing in on that character. I don't like the idea of going back just so they can use a dead villain, but the least they could have done is make the story make sense. Jack goes from wannabe hero to a complete lunatic on a dime, with no real progression. When we finally see why he has the mask, it just ends up being Lilith saying she's going to kill him, punching him in the face and leaving. Why? Why would she leave? Why didn't she kill him? WHY WASN'T LILITH A BOSS FIGHT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO COOL. Very disappointing.BUT, it is Borderlands. The same core combat system. It's the same kind of loot drops. The things they added are mostly nice. The oxygen management is a bit annoying, but flying around with air jets is a lot of fun. I really love that the player characters talk, and I hope they bring that back in BL3. The new characters have really cool abilities, and I hope I will see some of them again in later entries (the ones that aren't dead at least).So basically, if you already love Borderlands this is probably worth picking up, dispite it's disappointments. But this is a really bad introduction to the series and the weakest of the three, and I'm giving it a non-recommendation for that reason.Edit Jan 5: Fixed some typos.			"

												Having only recently played through it, I don't regret taking so long to do so.  It's just... bland.  Much of the Borderlands feel, humor, and heart was twisted for the worse, in terms of everything - level design, most of the writing, gun creativity, humor, skills and specs, all of it was subpar in comparison to the previous games.  The bosses and legendaries were also sort of forgotten about, bugging one of my friends much more than myself.Nearly the entire game was just fluff to provide a game around 2 major events concerning Jack.  Really, anything that didn't involve him or Fragtrap was just kind of null and dumb.  I didn't find many other characters memorable or really cool, just one-off gags and/or tools to progress the plot.  Plenty of forgettable and annoying landscapes, characters being pushed along by a forced ""you're working for me"" and ""we have to save the world"" theme instead of their own motivation, and no new mechanics since Borderlands 2  (except Ice and oxygen) didn't help.The oxygen system is beyond unnecessary.  Like... there's no way to put it other than it's dumb and useless.  It takes forever to drain, and when it does drain you just have to find some bubble or geyser to refill it, and if it does run out you don't even die that fast.  Imagine, while playing (for example) Far Cry, you just have to hit the Page Up button on your keyboard every 5 minutes or you start to lose health slowly.  That's not interesting or fun, it's just annoying and a waste of time.There's 3 major plot points that I found to be the only reason to care about this as a Borderlands installation.  MAJOR SPOILERS AND MY OPINION ON THEM :   Felicity's end was a bit emotional for me, really making me regret some of what was going on, and giving insight to the constructor bots.  The manufactured black hole was amazing, really hammering home that Jack was never truly evil until he was downright betrayed by those he was trying to work with and save, just a little too ambitious.  The ending sealed the deal, showing that he was in essence turned mad by outside forces, perhaps more of a victim of circumstance than just a mustache-twirling villain. Aside from that, there were only a few other small events that were really interesting and fun(ny).  It was just recycled Borderlands 2 stuff but not as exciting.  It's not an awful game in itself, but definitely a letdown compared to its predecessors.			"

												TL;DR - It isn't worth it. BL2 is larger, better and costs less. Either buy BL2, or wait for at least -50%This review will be more comparison-style, so you're supposed to be familiar with series.I don't remember Borderlands 1, just remember that I liked it, I love Borderlands 2 and I really, really want to love Pre-Sequel. But I don't. Here's why.- Price. It costs twice as much as BL2, but it has way less content in base game than BL2 had. We got less plot, less side-quests, less locations. Season Pass doesn't look good too, instead of 4 plot DLC, expanding the story, world and bla bla bla... It includes 1 story, 2 characters and arena DLC. Shock Drop Slaughter Pit is another one-map arena, that lacks any interest. BL2 Pre-Order bonuses were - golden keys, 3 starting weapons, one relic and Mechromancer DLC. TPS Pre-Order includes a map. Thanks, I guess... It's a little more than nothing... - Plot. Well, it's cool to go through it, just to learn what happened between BL1 and BL2. And that's it.- Bosses. Most bosses are somewhat forced, you don't see their motivation, why are they against you. The only character that really made me feel something was Felicity AI, this was the most emotional character. The main antagonist, colonel Zarpedon was pretty badass. Everyone else were just boring, I just felt like I was putting them out of their misery.- Raid Boss. I killed it in singleplayer on 28 LVL as Athena. So either Athena is OP, or boss is pretty meh... (not mentioning what is this raid boss and how lazy devs became)- Customization. BL2 had nice, badass, cool, funny, even cute heads. I was choosing what I liked most, often changing head, because this one was cool too, and that is awesome, and this is funny. Here, in TPS I was choosing what I disliked least. Often it was just default head. Heads are pretty hard to acquire. I mean you need to grind, farm bosses, because heads drop rarely and if they drop, it's 85% not for your character. BL2 had more heads as rewards, ensuring class match.- Vehicle controls. Okay, that's pretty old topic about Borderlands. But this is a third game, and not only they didn't make usual vehicle controls, but they added some strange modifications of their unique controls, such as ""reverse steering"". That means whenever you press W your car will move in your facing direction even if it's backwards. Who needs this? And why in the world does it exist? Why don't we get optional controls where W is throttle, S breaks, A-D is turning, allowing us to watch and shoot sideways? That's what all games have - HL2, UT2004-UT3, BF2-Hardline... It's the third game in franchise. Third. It's about time.Okay, time for bright side. Not everything is bad. This still is an expansion to history. We still got cool classes, main characters, soundtrack, atmosphere, Grinder(tm), lasers, Butt Slams(tm), mayhem, CL4P-TP Units, Unreal Tournament's Manta (basically). Many things make this game fun, and main thing is a coop. So this is a nice way to spend time with friends. But $60? That's too much, I think.			"

												An overall inferior game to Borderlands 2, which relies too much on its predecessor's establishment and fails to add anything worthwile to the franchise. Aside from the lack of new content, from combat mechanics to the guns themselves, the entire structure of the game is extremely repetitive, both due to the lack of a meaningful story (it's just a malfunction/obstacle one after another) and a map design too reliant on markers to be of any interest: it forces the player to just mindlessly run to the next objective while clearing out fixed groups of enemy spawns.Even classes are a step back compared to Borderlands 2, featuring not-so-interesting action skills and somewhat boring/plain customization. New mechanics like oxygen, slam, lasers and cryo (which actually replaces ""slag"") are simply not enough to warrant a rehash of a game with less interesting story, less fun classes and more meaningless ""quests"" (that is to say, ""follow the marker on you map and press Enter"").The main point of the game seems to be the showcase of Handsome Jack's descent into madness, and while his development comes out a bit lackluster and forced, Jack does manage to stand up to its name and amuse the player with endless humor and vibrant dialogues.If you miss Jack's personality and absolutely need to have more, then you at least have one reason to play the game. Don't expect this to be a good game in its own right, though.			"

												Edit 17/12/14: A surprising number of people have rated my review so I thought it would be worth adding an update. I've now completed the game in normal mode and TVHM, but my view of the game hasn't changed much. TVHM felt slightly more challenging and combat was a bit better as I could use Athena's skills which I unlocked in my first playthrough, plus I could do the majority of the side quests at a suitable level and didn't find that most of the missions were marked at trivial difficulty, which was the case all the time in my first playthrough. I still can't recommend the game at full price however, and I'll explain why. Some players may have really enjoyed their first playthrough of this game, but in my opinion I found it disappointing (for lack of a better word) that I had to endure an experience which was mostly pretty boring before the game actually got interesting. This was disappointing for me because I personally found the previous games, particularly Borderlands 2, to be enjoyable from pretty much the start, and it only got better as I progressed. As it's been said in other reviews, the game feels unpolished and not worth its price tag - the main story is short and can be tedious at times, and not many of the side quests are all that enjoyable. Plus there are a fair few irritating bugs which do stand out, and this is something that I'm hoping 2K will address before they start pumping out DLC. If you spot this game in a sale and you want to give it a try, it's worth a shot - this review is only my opinion after all, but for me, the full price still feels excessive considering what you get for your money. Now to the main review:I really did want to enjoy this game. First off, I'd call myself a fan of Borderlands - I've played and completed both of the previous games, I've clocked nearly 300 hours on the second one and purchased almost all of the DLC. I told myself I would wait until I had completed this game before leaving a review, but the more I play it, the less likely it seems that I will even bother finishing a single playthrough.This game started off fairly fun around the point where you first get to fiddle around with some of the new stuff like low gravity, butt slamming, and laser guns, but as I progressed through the story, it became more and more repetitive and tedious, with little signs of it getting any better. The main issues for me are combat, missions, and what you get for your money. Anywhere I go in this game, I don't feel sufficiently challenged, even when I take on missions where the recommended level is a level or two higher than my character, I still get through just fine and I wouldn't put this success down to skill. There's certainly none of the thrill of giving it everything you've got and feeling satisfied when you succeed or ready to try again if you did not - a feeling that I experienced many times in the second game playing as Krieg. In this game, I couldn't decide whether to play as Claptrap or Athena, not because I was spoiled for choice, but because the other two characters, particularly Nisha, have actions skills which are essentially ""press F to win"". While I gladly would have chosen a character who had an action skill consistently similar to Krieg's skill from BL2, Athena was the only character who appeared to be bringing something new and moderately appealing to the table. Her action skill sounds and looks cool, but the problem is I find it to be almost useless, as the majority of enemies have such poor aim that the shield barely gains any charge from their ranged attacks, and melee attacks from enemies hardly seem to charge it either. On top of this, the skills available for Athena don't seem to improve combat at all. From the characters I played as in BL2, you could access something new for Krieg (e.g. Light the Fuse, or Hellfire Halitosis) and Zer0 (e.g. Execute) from a relatively low level, giving you plenty of game time to try them out and have fun in the process. Compared to Athena's skill tree, any significant game changing skills can't be unlocked until around level 25, and it seems highly likely that waiting to reach this level before you take on the end game missions would only make them far too easy and just as tedious as the majority of other missions in the game.Finally, this leads to my main issue with the game, being what you get for your cash. At full price, this game is £30, and it already has DLC out. I'd have to argue that this game shouldn't even be close to £30 as it is. I wouldn't mind it if for this price, you got a bit more variety and a chance to test out the skills you unlocked during the main story in something other than just a slightly harder repeat playthrough. It's clear that DLC will be on the way for this game and while some of it might end up being fairly good, it still won't justify the cost of the base game and it's unlikely it will redeem where the base game went wrong, particularly if the DLC itself has yet another hefty price tag to match.Overall, this game is OK, but I can't justify a positive review nor the price of this game, as it seems far too much like a poor and rushed attempt by the developers of an otherwise revered series to acquire a load of quick and easy cash at the expense of the fans who were expecting something a bit different.

												Is this a bad game?NoIs it worth $60?Hell no. Buy on sale for 50% off, or buy BL2 if you haven't yet.This review is going to focus more on negatives since this is basically BL2 with a new coat of paint.First off the Voice Acting. I remember an episode of Family Guy where Peter was creating a cartoon about Handicapped Ducks and when recording voicing, Cleveland gives one of the characters an Australian accent which Peter gets angry because the character is from the Moon and has a Moon accent. Well in BL:TPS all characters on the Moon have an Australian accent. While this was developed by an Australian company, you'd think they'd put some diversity in there.Think about the worst mission-line in BL2. Go on take a few minutes before reading ahead....If you thought about the Cult Following mission-line in Frostburn Canyon, you were right! If you didn't say Cult Following mission-line then you did a good job suppressing the memory of doing this side mission. Well, if you suppressed the memory, let me remind you how it goes.After you complete the story mission in Frostburn Canyon, you now out-level the zone, and Lilith sends you back to the zone to deal with fire cultists. This leads you running around the zone for a while killing non-challenging things till you get to the part where you have to burn the midget. You then have to go back to the starting zone, run past 15 minutes worth of beginner level trash and a boss till you reach Captain Flynt and burn the midget, which you have to trek back across the starter zone to get back to FrostBurn Canyon which all the trash has respawned in, and you have to fight your way to the end of it to finish the mission. Wow such a fun mission, but why have I brought this up? INSTEAD OF REALISING ""HEY PEOPLE HATED THIS ANNOYING MISSION, LET'S NOT DO IT AGAIN!"" THEY INSTEAD MADE EVERY SINGLE SIDE MISSION WORK EXACTLY LIKE THIS MISSION.Get ready to go back to zones after you've finished them all the time. I wish I would've counted how many missions send you to the area outside the main city, that places has side missions for level 6, level 11, level 15, and level 25, and it's a freaking level 10 zone. My favorite is the Veins of Helios zone. This is the most pain in the♥♥♥♥♥zone in any borderlands game. It's full of platforming, has 2 giant space areas, and contains no fast travel points so you have to trek across another zone to reach it. After you complete the story mission here, you get a side mission to go back oh joy! Then you trek back to do the mission, complete it, trek back to the start point to turn it in and you're given 2 god damn ♥♥♥♥ing more missions to go back there in almost the exact same damn area of the zone. DIDN'T ANY OF THE PLAYTESTERS NOTICE HOW BAD THIS WAS?!?!?Speaking of platforming, who the hell said, ""Man you know what Borderlands 2 is missing? Platforming!"" No one did, yet the whole o2 system and double jumping was basically built for this. The platforming is down right annoying especially in the Veins of Helios area, and pretty much any mission that involves you finding the right dumpster to jump on just so you can reach the roof of a building. It's just not fun.Cryo and Lasers do add a lot to the game, but they're both extremely overpowered. Found a legendary cryo smg at level 12 and used it all the way to the final boss (and it'll still be good starting vault hunter mode) because of the massive dps boost cryo gives due to frozen headshots. Then, lasers are usually 193x5 damage with 210% weapon continuality bonus on them so you can use them to 1-2 hit Badasses or burn through a boss in record time.All this put together just makes it a tedious game. Buy this when it's on sale, and play Borderlands 2 for the best experience.			"

												In my honest opinion, this game really wasn't worth it. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the game with each of it's components, the playable vault hunters in the game are satisfying, and are very rewarding at times! If you would just want to see the overall statement, scroll all the way down to the final two paragraphs.First off, this is my own opinion. I'm sure others have their own aswell, and I'm fine with that. For me, the game could have more potential in it. It started out sweet, but ended up rough. I felt like the game could've used more of one thing every now and then, but it just wasn't there. And if it was there, it was either screwed up or realy buggy.The game feels unbalanced. I went on to True Vault Hunter Mode, did every side quest up to one of the bosses, and he was 37. I was 34, even with the challenges done from all the side quests just to get up to a boss that is still higher than you. I felt like the leveling system could be more adjacent and more tweaked. That being said, the side quests in the game are done properly, but some of them were unforgiving, some of them were downright challenging, and some of them were completly boring. Atleast a few side quests were entertaining, one of them was able to get the grinder, which is able to pop up better quality stuff if you put in 3 of the same quality. That being said, most of the time the grinder will pop out the same quality it was when you put the three weapons in. So even if you put 3 white weapons in, you still have a chance of getting a white weapon.I was displeased with the main story. Sure, being on Pandora's moon was really a blast, the low gravity was entertaining, and the functions of slamming down on your enemy for a good amount of a damage, but that doesn't change the fact that there were a lot of things missing. They explained Jack's backstory, but not entirely. Some of the dialogue in this game was either too bland, needed more clarification, or just didn't fit in. It also felt cheesyand rushed. The Vault Hunters you play have a lot better things to say other than most of the dialogue slapped into this. There were also important questions unanswered. How did Jack get a hold of his siren, Angel? How did Jack acquire the Destroyer's Eye?The Vault Hunters, Athena, Nisha, Wilhelm, and Claptrap, were arguebly the best part about this game. Most of the stats seem very nifty, very thorough, and well put. Athena's skill can be used as defense, offense, or even support, making her very valueable for the team. Nisha's skill was probably the most fun I've had out of this game, walking into a room full of badasses, pulling out dual revolvers (if you chose Fan the Hammers) and literally aimbotting everyone you see. Wilhelm's skill was the most complicated, but also was fun to play. He can send out two surveyors, Wolf and Saint. One of them attacks, and one of them supports you. Claptrap was also very fun to play as, his ability can either help the team, or screw the entire team over.I felt like the game needed more new content. The story felt short, very little new dialogue from the vending machines or the hyperion new-u stations, and the enemy design still feels pathetic in my opinion. Getting one-shotted, or taking massive damage for no reason will be your questions after fighting the levels of enemies either two levels below you or are on the same level as you. Fight for your life mode really is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ it really puts you in a position that tells you that you are too low for one area, or that you need a different strategy. If you fall into the mode again, you have a lower time to kill an enemy. If you fall into it once more, you have lower time to do it. And if you fall into it again, it feels instant. This is something very irritating for players to lose their money, because they couldn't get out of a spot, or some enemy AI got an extremely lucky with a sniper rifle across the map.Speaking of the enemy design, even if it is tweaked so that it doesn't aimbot you like the threshers in borderlands 2, it still feels buggy. You are bound to get shot 3 times and fall to the ground. It's like the game's development got rough in between and they added difficulty to the game to spice it out. Unfortunally, the game feels a lot easier when you have friends, soloing it makes the game too difficult for you, so it forces you to have friends to help. But what if you don't have friends that can communicate?Bugs. No, not torks, damn you, actual game bugs. I've seen enemies walking through walls, shooting through walls, hell, I managed to find an engineer throw their turret through the floor and that turret shot me through the floor. A couple times I was in fight for your life mode, killed a guy, but it didn't get me back up on me feet. Nisha's ability that is capable of aimbotting people does not work on mobs far away from you, and screws up 100.0 accuracy by making the gun that would be accurate, innaccurate.There are some new things in the game. Ice. Yes, you can freeze your opponents, shatter them, and laugh in front of them as you shoot their head off. Grenades will now beep so you know where they are, making it a huge plus, but doesn't really do that much damage to you unless you are TVHM. There is a new weapon type, the laser. Well, there are a couple different lasers, other than the fact that they are from different manufactor, and different element, some lasers you can hold down and channel some kind of energy like you would see from Ghostbusters, some lasers are like snipers, but less accurate, and some lasers can split like a shotgun. Some of these lasers are fun, especially with Nisha's ability.Bosses were unrewarding. One of the most irritating things that most boss fights in this game has is the fact that he or she has friends, and most of the times the regular enemies you fight are a lot harder than the boss. This makes the game even more unbalanced, due to the fact that boss fights should be entertaining to kill, challenging, and very rewarding, more rewarding than your average bad guy. If there were very little enemies on the battlefield on the boss, then this game would be a lot better in my opinion. Even on solo, fighting 20 enemies left and right along with a boss fight can be very frustrating. What could've been done better is if there were more stages, and having more abilities when the player count has increased, and less enemies on the field when there are only one or two people playing on the field.Overall, the gameplay does not have full potential. It felt harsh, and very little of Borderlands 2 gameplay returns here. I understand that fire does not work unless you have oxygen, but it's very hard to set people on fire because most of the time you are fighting in a non-oxygen zone.At this point, I feel like if I give a rating right now, there will be things fixed left and right. My final verdict isn't high, but it isn't low. There really isn't a real definition to challenge to this game, you either die or outlevel enemies some way. But really, I felt like there should be more potential here and there, the game just didn't feel like what a Borderlands game should be, and there were other ways to have the story change. The begining of the story was awesome, the ending was awesome, but the middle of the story just really tore me apart, where most of the things you would've seen in Borderlands 2, didn't come into this game, like Angel.If I was asked to rate this game out of 100, I would probably say 74/100. Maybe an 7/10. The game just needed more new content, if it did, the game would've had better potential on certain things. They may have tweaked the functions around, but they kinda made it more challenging for players to face. Still, I enjoyed the story at the best, but it's basically a large expansion to Borderlands 2.			"

												I was too harsh on my other review. While this is the worst Borderlands game out there, it is still a good game, not worth the $40, however. Borderlands: TPS takes place after the 1st game and before the 2nd game on Pandora's moon, Elpis.PROS: Get to learn the backstory of Jack, Moxxi, Athena, and a few othersSome of the new skill trees are funGood soundtrackMore dialogue than the 2nd, especially between the player and NPCsCryo element and Laser weapons are effectiveGrinder can make new weapons that can't be found anywhere elseNEUTRAL:Humor is AustralianLow gravity can be fun or tediousThe HUD is identical to BL2CONS:Story is shorter than the 2nd game (for double the price, too)Not very memorable side charactersColor scheme is somewhat dullSome of the main missions are tedious as hell (walking back and forth with very little action)The writing is weaker here (although they still pull off a few good jokes here and there)They removed the Slag element7.5/10, Get GOTY Borderlands 2 instead of this, same price with at least triple the content.Old review for the people who are interested.

												I really wanted to like this game. I am a huge Borderlands fan and have logged hundreds of hours playing the Borderlands games. Hundreds. Thousands, even. But I just can’t seem to be able to find a way to like the Pre-Sequel or even get a bit absorbed into it. Not even a bit.   First thing is….I hate platformers. I hate them. I do not find them fun in any way at all. Sadly, the Pre-Sequel has so many platformer style elements in it that it made me crazy. Jump here, jump there, shoot while jumping, slam down from jumping, etc, etc, etc. They devs want you to jump so freakin much in this game that I found it really frustrating.    There are devices in the game where you get bonuses for shooting while jumping; you get bonuses for throwing grenades while jumping; and so on. There’s “jump pads” all throughout the game that propel you into the air so you can jump some more, because the devs felt that you can never freaking jump enough for their liking in this game evidently.   And because a great portion of the game is played in a low gravity environment, your jumps take on a floating/flying/falling sort of feel where you have only a small bit of control over your character while you are in the air. Yuck.   There are side quests that you cannot complete unless you find just the exact right spot to jump to get an item to complete the quest. I abandoned those quests after jumping wrong and falling to my death (and therefore losing some of my cash) so many times that it made my head spin. I died a hundred times by misjudging stupid jumps in this game and it made me sick. And beyond that, there are sections of the game where you MUST make blind jumps, where you can't see where the heck you're going to land. And you die. Boo.   There are places in the game that you can jump to safely......but you can't jump out. And you die some more. Boo. It sucked all the fun out of the game for me. Maybe this sort of jumpy thing is your cup of tea, but it sure isn’t mine.   Apart from the stupid jumping aspect of the game, I found the characters boring and dull, with action skills that were rather boring and dull, too. And the soundtrack music blows. Dreadful. Awful.   The story line was kinda cool, though. It really gives you some insights into the whole Borderlands tale. Other than that, I am just broken hearted about this latest Borderlands installment.   So, anyone have any ideas what else I might consider playing now that I am through playing the PreSequel? Oh, by the way, no platformers, please.Peace.			"

												I had avoided this game for so long upon hearing the initial reactions. Tremendous fan of the series, and after the quality GAMEPLAY of Borderlands 2, I didn't want to tarnish the franchise in my own mind. Having recently gone back to Borderlands 2 to play some of the DLC I never got around to, I felt the itch to pick up the pre-sequel too. It was a review that I read here on Steam that motivated me. It was a negative one that claimed the pre-sequel didn't have the 'humor'. The reviewer claimed that Borderlands is 'all about the humor.' I was sold right then and there.When Borderlands launched, it was a fast paced fps with awesome co-op, a unique art style, and extremely dynamic gunplay that kept you on the loot hamster wheel for ages. The plot of the story was succinct, well voiced, and it packaged together into a well written little sci-fi adventure that puts a bright color pallet and cheery bow on what is otherwise a very Lovecraft-ian tale. The humor was a flourish; icing on the cake. The snide remarks, pop-culture references, and light-hearted take on insomnia, insanity, grief, and death matched the entire attitude of the game, but it was hardly the driving force. Borderlands is NOT 'all about the humor.'Borderlands 2 perfected what Borderlands had in the mechanics department, but there were so many times that I had to go to the audio options and turn the subtitles and dialogue off completely. Ignoring the fact that most of the 'comedy' in Borderlands 2 involves cashing in on mediocre memes, the delivery is non-stop screaming. You just plain get internet garbage hollared at you for the entire game. Between Tiny Tina, Handsome Jack, and the host of bandit bosses you encounter throughout the experience, it's hard to play with the sound on. If you happen to miss a joke or two, don't worry! It'll be explained to you multiple times; beaten into submission by repetition. Or even better still, don't worry about cringing and sighing at a failed attempt at humor, because another NPC will gladly cut in to the ECHO feed and react negatively to the joke FOR YOU! Thereby saving you the trouble, and making the joke even more hilarious in an appeal to the metaphysical.Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is not a departure from the trademark Borderlands humor. It is instead a return to the style of   the original Borderlands itself. The screaming still occurs from time to time, but it is pleasantly subdued. Despite reviews that would claim otherwise, side-misisons are not simple, and they do add tremendous garnish to the story. The comedy of the game is simply experienced alongside the story telling, and it isn't relentlessly crammed down your throat or shouted down your ear canal. The combat is fluid, with even more dynamic gameplay given the addition of low gravity environments and the slam mechanic. Finally, the story is rewarding and open-ended. The DLC is novel and appealing, and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is a perfectly justifiable and strong stand alone game in the series. I love it.If you enjoy the gameplay mechanics (and then some) of Borderlands 2, but preferred the story and dialogue environment of the original Borderlands, I highly recommend the Pre-Sequel. Invite me to a game, even, or I'll see you in Borderlands 3!			"

												Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel tells the story of how Handsome Jack progressed from being a corporate lackey to becoming the villain we know in Borderlands 2. It’s not a journey I asked to take, but since it’s here, I played it and had a good time – but with no camraderie, no Angel, minimal Claptraps, and little environment variety, much of the charm is missing. Gameplay is the same as previous games in the franchise, but now with oxygen tanks and low gravity. Worth a purchase for fans of the series and its co-op loot-and-shoot gameplay (which is as good as ever). New-comers to the franchise should look at Borderlands 2 instead; it is the better game.Total size installed on my hard-drive (base game + Season Pass): 10.4 GBThe story tells the tale of Athena, an assassin encountered in the first Borderlands game, and how she was employed by Jack to save Pandora’s moon from the evil Captain Zarpedon who has taken over the Helios space station and is firing the station’s laser at the moon to destroy it because reasons (whew, that was mouthful). Zarpedon actually does have reasons, and you can find some Echoes lying around that tell more of her story; she’s actually a really interesting character. But like so many of the characters in the Pre-Sequel, she’s barely there. Mordecai and Brick only appear in cut-scenes, while Roland and Lilith stand around in the Up Over Bar doing nothing (with two lines of dialogue apiece when clicked upon). Tiny Tina provides some voice-over in True Vault Hunter mode, but otherwise only has one or two lines. Jack tells jokes constantly, but is never funny – not even in a “I’m ashamed of laughing but I’m laughing anyway” approach. And apparently it’s impossible to have a Borderlands game without Moxxi or Crazy Earl. Marcus is NOT present, but his vending machines are everywhere, even in the most unlikely of places. In place of Scooter is Janey Springs, and she is a bright, cheerful addition to a cast that is frequently far too glum. Unfortunately, the Pre-Sequel’s attempts at fun and funny is mostly meh.The areas feel smaller. Unlike Borderlands 2, which featured a great variety of environments, the Pre-Sequel features one style of terrain – the rocky surface of Pandora’s moon – and any variety happens in the in-door levels. The low-gravity was fun, and allowed for some really creative jumping puzzles. The oxygen requirement was limiting, though. It discouraged random exploration, because I was frequently checking my air amount to make sure I didn’t run out. This concern is somewhat mitigated by plentiful air pockets in every level, but still annoying. Most enemies are recycled from other games (and re-spawn very quickly). Now we have Torks instead of Skags, and they’re animated differently, but their function and hitpoints feel the same. There are fewer bosses than in previous Borderlands games, but the final boss is awesome, taking place in more old Eridian ruins. Design and atmosphere is great, even if it was easy to slice through all the enemies (I finished my first run at Level 26). As in previous Borderlands games, there are tons of things to loot, but few of them are useful. All the beam weapons are OP; they even helped me to wipe out the Zarpedon boss in less than five minutes – SOLO. Find one (or more!), organize your build around it, and proceed to plow through enemies. A nice addition to the gameplay is the ground-slam. Suddenly, facing hordes of creatures doesn’t seem like a fruitless endeavor. Jump, boost to a greater height (which uses oxygen!), then slam back into the ground for area-of-effect damage. The slam can be customized and upgraded like everything else. I found myself avoiding fire-based elemental weapons because fire needs an atmosphere in order to burn – making their use situational at best. Ice weapons + ground-slam (which shatters frozen enemies) was a more than viable substitute.At the heart of any Borderlands game is the co-operative experience, and that is as good as ever. Getting four people together to save Pandora’s moon makes for a great time, with easy drop-in, drop-out. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is easily the lesser game of the trilogy, but it’ll scratch that loot-and-shoot itch. Recommended if you’ve just got to have more Borderlands.On DLC (I only have what is included in the Season Pass): - Two character classes, Handsome Jack and the Baroness. Seriously, Gearbox, stop cutting character classes out of the game to sell for an extra $10 apiece. Sheesh.- The Holodome Onslaught adds 10 more character levels and holographic horde mode. Having the character levels is nice, but the rest is like the holographic simulator in the Pinnacle Station DLC for the first Mass Effect. Remember that DLC? That’s right, no one does.- Claptastic Voyage is a great piece of story DLC – IF YOU ARE A FAN OF CLAPTRAP (there are claptraps everywhere). Go inside Claptrap’s mind, visit his memories, and try to find something for Handsome Jack. Some of the memories allowed Gearbox to re-use levels from the previous Borderlands games, and while it is done creatively, it just made me want to go back and replay those games. Decent story and the final boss is hard as hell to solo (I did manage it after grinding to level 38 and lucking into one heck of a shotgun).			"

Product received for free
												Underrated, Overhated, and persona non grata of the Borderlands Francise; Don't let the naysayers turn your interest away from this game if you want to have fun. I personally find Borderlands 2 to be a very unforgiving title with pleanty of issues, most of which (Like enemy HP scaling and loot drops) are FIXED in Pre-sequel. Yes, there is Social justice ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t tossed into the story[and it's NOT SUBTLE], but if you let 5 lines of dialogue define your entire experience, you're asking to have a bad time. Dispite that, the story is 15 LIGHTYEARS ahead of the narcoleptic pace Borderlands 2 goes at certian points [ie. Overlook's 'defend the beacon' section, Oppertunity's 'hunt the body double' and the entirety of Sawtooth Caldron]. I feel that Pre-sequal get's a tad bit TOO much hate and should be judged on it's own merits. Pre sequal get's more right than it does wrong, therefore, I recommend it.			"

												This game gets a lot of hate.  Depending on how you play Borderlands, it might be justified.  Since it's impossible to talk about this one without comparing it to the other games in the series I'm going to assume if you're reading this, you've played the other ones.  If you don't already like Borderlands, I see little reason why you'd like this one over the others.While there were minor graphical and engine improvedments between BL1 and BL2, this one had made effectively no improvements over BL2 from a technical perspective.  The main draw here is the different environments and characters.  As far as characters go, TPS offers easily the best skill trees in the series yet -- very few skills do something boring like ""x% less recoil"", or those that do offer it as an additional effect on top of something else.  Skills synergize together to create different ways of playing the same character.  Each action ability feels functional right away, whereas in BL1 or 2 it often felt as though you needed to spent points in certain things before they felt worth using.  Similar to later DLCs in BL2, the characters will talk to quest givers and other NPCs, giving them some badly needed personality aside from ""likes to shoot guns.""The moon makes for a fantastic change of pace.  The low gravity makes for much higher (and floatier) jumping, and you can spend your oxygen to give yourself a boost.  And you'll notice I said oxygen -- unless you're in air bubble or other enclosed area, there is an air meter.  This sounds tedious, but it's not.  You'll usually have somewhere around 2 minutes of air, enemies drop oxygen canisters and there's a lot of interiors, air bubbles, or air vents.  You have to go out of your way for it to become an issue.  Low grav also gives you a slam attack as well.  All in all, the lowered gravity makes for a higher emphasis on movement and active play.The game falters when it comes to end game.  BL2 sported multiple DLCs, high end bosses, and multiple playthroughs with different mechanics.  While TPS has a Playthrough 2, it's not too different from the first playthrough, and there's very few high level bosses.  There's not a whole lot of DLC either, and one of them is arena style and is completely forgettable.Ultimately what this comes down to is what is the draw of the series to you?  If it's the character building, the humor, and wacky guns, it's all here, in an admittedly smaller but more focused campaign.  If it's the raiding and brutal difficulty of a third playthrough, you're not going to find that in the Pre-Sequel.			"

												Borderlands 1: 350 HoursBorderlands 2: 537 HoursBorderlands POS: 85 hoursI am a rabid voracious fan of this series.  I initially had no interest but got the first one on a steam sale at the recommendation of a friend.  It instantly became my new favorite surpassing the Zelda series, Doom series, and a few classic others.  I still vividly remember my first fight against bone head, nine toes, walking into Liar's Berg then fighting Boom Bewm with childlike fervor, and above all the masterpiece that was Handsome Jack!  The most awesome villain ever.  Borderlands PS however has been such an insulting let down. The game is short.The levels are not very fun.The jokes are not funny.The vehicles are frustrating to steer.The season pass was a blatant rip off. In #2 I spent hours just looking for vault symbols and it was exciting to find them, this time it was just annoying platforming to find them and I just quit looking.The humor was awful this time.  Not sure if since this game was sub contracted to 2K Australia if I just don’t have their same sensibilities as the Aussie’s, or if they were truly just lame flat jokes(this one, it was this one).I absolutely had a stalker type lover for #2, but I didn’t care for the DLC.  I FREAKING LOVED the DLC for #1, all of it.  I believe Gearbox sub contracted the DLC for #2, but that’s ok, the main game was enough to carry itself easily since the DLC stunk.  They screwed their fans when it came to DLC for the PS.  Charging $10 a piece or 2 season pass slots for skill trees?!?  The game isn’t good enough to charge that much for another play through with a new skill tree.  In summary the borderlands franchise is still my favorite of all time.  However the Pre Sequal was so bad I will be waiting for reviews of Borderlands 3 before I make a purchase to see if they turned it around or have truly jumped the shark. "

												Borderlands The Pre-Sequel isn't very different from it's later installment, Borderlands 2, which is a very good thing for a guy like me who ♥♥♥♥ING LOVED BORDERLANDS 2. It does have some new features such as the low gravity, giving the ability to butt-slam your foes, new NPCs (Maniacs, Torks, Lost Legion etc) And new Vehicles so you can better & faster travel the distances on the moon.It took me about 25 hours to complete, having to deal with a few side-quests in order to get in the required level before proceeding with the main-quests. Borderlands The Pre-Sequel is a must-own game for every Borderlands fanboy, and I can definitely recommend it at it's current price (50Euros/$60) But if you didn't care much for Borderlands 2, you should probably wait for a sale somewhere, sometime.The humor of Borderlands 2 is copy-pasted perfectly into Borderlands The Pre-Sequel, even though it felt more original in Borderlands 2, nonethless it's great fun to listen to the various dialogues within the game.Borderlands The Pre-Sequel, or any Borderlands game in fact, is best enjoyed with friends in co/op mode, I happenend to play the main quest 100% solo and it's defiently not bad either. Do prepare to get downed alot by the horde of enemies you are facing.I encounted 0 bugs or flavs in my 1st playthough of the game (22/10-26/10) very well optimised game from launch.I rate this game 8/10 - a must buy if you're a fan of the franchise. Borderlands The Pre-Sequel is one of my favorite games of 2014.I hope this review helped you decide what to waste your money on.			"

Posted: December 15, 2014
												Basically this game is Borderlands 2 (B2) in space. It feels like an extra long DLC. If you haven't played B2, go back and play it. While I do recommend the Pre-Sequel (PS), B2 is better and I would advise grabbing the PS during a sale. If you loved B2 then I definitely recommend this game.Since the PS is very nearly like B2, I'm going to highlight the differences for this review. SPACE GAMEPLAY : The biggest change is the space gameplay: low gravity, oz kits, and butt slams. Low gravity allows you to jump higher and in midair you can glide to change your direction with an oz kit. Jumping and gliding is my preferred mode of travel. At first I was annoyed with the low gravity, but after going back to B2, I found myself trying to glide and wishing I could jump higher. Oz kits are the new relics. They allow you to glide and provide you with oxygen in no oxygen environments. They have a surprising amount of effects. Running out of oxygen is not a problem at all: there are frequently placed patches with cracks in the ground and Oz domes that refill your oxygen. Butt slams are as fun as they sound. They provide a new tactical maneuver that pushes enemies away creating some breathing space. Since I have the maturity of a five year old, I love using the oz kit that farts every time I perform a butt slam. I used it for most of the game and I'm still not tired of it. Butt slams are fairly powerful and can be performed every time you jump in the air. ENVIRONMENTS : About half the game is inside oxygen-rich areas and the other half is in low-oxygen areas with low gravity, which is a nice balance. The environments on Elpis are beautiful and the view of space and Elpis from Helios is fantastic. The interior environments are sort of boring, resembling other Hyperion structures from B2 (think Opportunity). With the introduction of low gravity comes the tendency for maps to extend vertically. While B2 maps were flat and spread out, many locations in the PS are designed for moving up or down. Provided jump pads launch you across the map or vertically straight into the air, allowing faster travel and setting up butt slams. Most maps that are flat end up being convoluted. Generally, looking at the map for an interior area is useless. Vehicles are almost worthless: locations either lack Moon Zoomy stations or are better traversed on foot. The Moon Buggy often clips with the environment, but the Stingray is fun. The worst thing about the environments is the sparse placement of checkpoints and fast travel stations. Nearly every time I die, I wonder, ""This is the closest checkpoint?"" Most locations have fast travel stations but there are some key places that don't. The PS is definitely smaller than B2. ENEMIES : The enemies lack variation. B2 has a wide variety of enemies; just for humanoids you have bandits, psychos, midgets, rats, nomads, nomads with shields, bruisers, goliaths, etc.. In the PS, you basically get a guy in a space suit with midget and bigger guy variants. The creatures on the other hand are interesting but they don't make up for the lack of enemy variation elsewhere. The bosses are all interesting and unique. You never feel like you're fighting a boss that's similar to another. My one gripe with them is that they aren't farmable by any means. For most bosses, it's like trying to get to the Warrior from Hero's Pass in B2. MAIN CHARACTERS : Low-level gameplay sucks with the new characters. You start earning skill points at level 3, but it takes about 15 levels until you can get a middle-tiered skill that really changes the game for you. Playing as Claptrap, I became far more lethal at level 14 once I got friendship novas, which emanate from any enemy you kill and heal you and your teammates. I've tried all the characters and my favorite character to play as is Claptrap (no joke). One great addition to this game is the fact that your character responds in a unique way in dialogue, sort of like the characters did in Tiny Tina's DLC for B2. I really enjoy this feature because it gives life to each character. By far Claptrap's lines are the funniest. Athena tends to be serious; Nisha is provocative; Wilhelm plays the calm badass.  NPCs : The NPCs in this game get very little treatment, with only a handful getting a backstory. Obviously this story is about Jack so he gets plenty of attention but most new characters are relegated to the side. Remember seeing the nurse Nina in previews of the game? If you play the main campaign you interact with her once. If you do the sidequests, you get one mission from her. Where's the backstory? You only get a small indication of her personality. Also I was also hoping to see more of Angel's relationship with Jack prior to B2's events, but she is absent from the game. Most of the characters in B2 received significant additions to personality from the first game. You really get to know them from their echos, dialogue, and missions. Don't expect the same in the PS. STORYLINE : (In general there are spoilers in this section, so to be safe, skip it if you don't want the story spoiled.) On the whole, the story of Jack's descent into the man he is at the beginning of B2 is a decent one. It's slow at first but picks up in the middle. However, Jack's transformation feels rushed. SPOILER ALERT (Last warning.) At the beginning Jack seems entirely like a good guy. He wants to protect Pandora and Elpis from the deranged Zarpedon. Yet his methods are questionable and fall into a morally gray area. By the end he's the delusional and power hungry Hyperion CEO. Although the story felt rushed, I definitely enjoyed seeing Jack's transformation. The biggest issue I have with the story is the premise: Athena is captured by Lilith, and Lilith forces Athena to relate her entire experience with Jack. Except, as we come to find out, Lilith and Roland are there with her and Jack for most of the game and they know most of what Athena knows. In a nutshell, it feels forced. Also I dislike the ending with Lilith and Jack's final encounter---Lilith's actions were pointless and stupid. (SPOILER END.) Luckily I don't play Borderlands for the story. Comparatively, the plot in B2 is better than the plot in the PS. MISCELLANEOUS : The Grinder is a welcome addition to Borderlands. It allows you to turn unwanted guns and gear into potentially better items. It's great for turning low level legendaries into higher level legendaries. Lasers and cryo guns are entertaining and powerful. Freezing enemies and meleeing them into pieces is really effective. Lasers come in a variety of types such as single shot, continuous beam, and rapid fire. Overall these gun types are useful and fun. Now in multiplayer, you can view your teammate's inventory and skill trees by just walking up to them and pushing a button. It doesn't even require the teammate's approval. The trash button has been tossed---now there are just non-favorite items and favorite items. I don't like this system because the auto-sell button sells any non-favorite items. Since Borderlands is all about finding better loot, I'm constantly upgrading my gear and selling the old stuff. It's easier to have non-favorite items and trash items, and auto-sell trash items. I wish they kept the three-tiered system that was in B2.  BOTTOM LINE : Definitely recommend for those who love the series. If you're unsure, purchase during a sale. While my review seems generally negative, it's because those things stood out the most. For me B2 did almost everything right, so the negative things in the PS are noticeable. But overall I love Borderlands, so I give this a thumbs up.			"

Since you spend most of your time in Elpis (Pandora's moon).- Play as CLAPTRAP.The bad:- The campaign is short.- Only 1 raid boss to fight.I recommend to buy this game when it's on sale though.7 / 10			"

												Price paid: $80 USD (Australian steam store)Gameplay Hours: Around 30 (all sidequests finished)Play-through: SoloRecommendation: Only buy at a discountAs I came towards the end of Borderlands; The Pre-Sequel I was disappointed and relieved.This game had so much potential, and after seeing the review scores on an Australian games show of 9.5 and 9.0, I bit the proverbial bullet and bought the full price release.What an idiot.About 5 hours into the game, I consciously noted that I hadn't even so much as smirked the entire time.ContentThe writing was uninspired. Living in Australia, I can appreciate a few of the references (eg. “Red Belly” instead of “Ned Kelly”)…But as a whole, I just didn’t get it.Even I couldn’t understand what they were trying to say, so good luck if you're an international buyer.I didn’t get the humour, didn’t appreciate the forced Australian accents, and certainly didn’t enjoy the characters. AT ALL. Borderlands 2 was amazing due to its memorable characters, but I couldn't tell you who these new ones are even if you paid me. Handsome Jack (aka “Jack”) is a shadow of his future self.There was one thing that particularly annoyed me. Indigenous relations’ has always been a problem here in Australia. There is only one obvious Aboriginal character in the entire game, and he stands there getting drunk while incoherently sending you on a side-quest. While I normally find cultural stereotypes and mild racism amusing, it’s done in such a cheap and demeaning way that even I am offended.GameplayBorderlands 2 – except less enjoyable. There’s no point using fire weapons as 70% of the time there's no atmosphere for them to be useful in. Cyro is ridiculously powerful. The Oz kits don’t change anything, and changing Oz kits doesn't change movement.There's so many invisible walls it'll drive you insane. So many fake rocks you'll die while trying to jump on them.THEY COPY AND PASTE SIDE-QUESTS. There is literally a quest that has the same character, same horde-mode style gameplay, and SAME FREAKING DIALOG. What a joke, how lazy can you get?Loot:I found an Oz kit at level 3 which I still use at level 31 – it heals you when you pick up O2 canisters, so I’ve never had to heal, ever. Practically every enemy drops an O2 canister. The series has never been about balance, but seriously? Weapons given through quests are uninspired. The progression of loot is slow – you’ll still be playing with the same basic ones throughout your first play-through.And that’s where I stopped. One play-through was more than enough for me, thank goodness I didn’t spend $30 on a season pass, especially being shafted for $80 USD.TL;DRWhat a step down in quality. This writing can f*** right off. Take all the fake Australian colloquialisms, gibberish and shove it. I feel like I need a shower after all this crap.4/10(updated the score from a 3 to a 4. It functions, but for a game that the same requirements as BL2, same engine, same everything, I find it hard to accept the numerous bugs.) "

												This game is really good.A new hud and new visuals doesn't make a game, content does. And this game has a ton of content.First of all, let me start with one thing. This game is surprsingly DARK compared to the last two Borderlands games. Prepare your morality.Now that that's done, let's carry on.PROS+Borderlands The Pre-Sequel does not disappoint. I have to admit, at first I was super worried about dying of oxygen loss, but the devs were able to make it so losing your oxygen doesn't really make you worry. Oxygen is every where, and if you DO run out, your health depleted at around less than 1% per second, so it isn't a threat to you at all.+The low gravity also helps a lot. The use of buttslams makes it more fun to flank enemies, and makes the combat even more fast-paced. Slams also work in places with oxygen, as long as the area doesn't have aritifcial gravity. This also helps for easy second winds. If you were to jump accross the area, and get shot down, chances are you'll land right close to another bunch of enemies. This gives you an indirect and accidental edge against enemies, which is also good. Additonally, certain oz-kits can make your low-g experience more fun and fluid, I personally use the air control ones.+Now about lasers, one of the most advertised parts of the game. Let me put this straight, they're awesome, and really powerful. They also act as psuedo-gun types for each brand. You want Dahl Shotguns back? Have A LASER ONE THAT FIRES AROUND 3 LASER BOLTS PER SECOND. There are also different types such as the railguns, beams, and repeaters, but different manufacturers can give each weapon type an edge due to their special attributes.+Cryo weapons are also fun, and not just in the visual kind of appeal. It's more tactical than slag. Slag was just like ""shoot enemies with this and then hit them with this"". It even stole corossion's power, which made it even crappier. But cryo is super fun to use. The simple charm of butt stomping a single enemy ( EVEN MORE FUN WITH A TEAM) just puts a smile on my face.Also, A LOT OF  unique weapons with red text can compete with legendary weapons. Like AN EXPLOSIVE JAKOBS SHOTGUN.Now we have the CONS. Every game has them.-Let's start with a really annoying one, the checkpoints aren't kind. The maps are bigger for verticality purposes, but some checkpoints can be too far enough that they end up stingy and unforgiving. -Next, the vehicles. While the stingray is a pretty fun vehicle to use, I can't help but feel disappointed in the lack of variety. The moon buggy is okay at best, although it's more of the same with classic Borderlands vehicles.-Nisha's whip is terrible, unless you get the Law and Order skill tree capstone. Don't expect to melee a lot with her.-The side missions are the same with past missions, where you have to go and kill the thing while getting the other thing. Personally, I don't mind this since Pre-Sequel has the best combat in a Borderlands game so far, but other people might not....Overall, Borderlands TPS is a great time. Unless your emotions will get the better of you SINCE THIS GAME IS PRETTY DARK.An 8 out of 10.			"

 Introduction                    I have been playing borderlands since the first one. I have a huge love for this game and was very skeptical when i heard gearbox was not heading the prequel.            The game has lost some of the original humor, but still maintain the amazing shoot and loot concept with a few new addition to the gameplay.   Pros      The new story is very interesting being on Handsome Jack’s team  The Oxygen/Zero Gravity system is integrated with original gameplay very well  The new Playable characters are all from previous games and that creates a neat atmosphere for them. (If you know the stories to what happens to the in the next game)  Still an amzing pick-me-up co-op comedy FPS to play with any friends   Cons     The Story is short compared to the second Borderlands game  The original humor is a bit lost from previous games  Basically the same gameplay   Conclusion             If you can get Borderlands The Pre-Sequel for around $30 USD (half off), It is completely worth it; It's not completely worth the for asking price for the game. If you are a fan of the previous games you will still love the new one.-HiPFiRED If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

												Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel:So far I have enjoyed this game and have completed the entire campaign on both normal and true vault hunter mode for every single character. I have also done 80% of side missions for every character and have farmed for almost every single farmable legendary.One of the most common questions asked about this game is ""Is this game all just a big DLC?"" and the answer to that question is yes. All of the menus , weapon brand names and also certain legendary weapons from the previous Borderlands game have been used here. The games campaign and all side quests will give you around 18 hours of solid gameplay. You will then have the choice to enter true vault hunter mode which strengthens enemies and bosses etc. There is also the farming side of the game with many legendaries to find.New Additions:Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel have added some extras too. The oxygen system is new to the series which means you can only survive in space with an ""Oz Kit"" Oz kits allow you to perform a ground slam and also to breathe. Oxygen in the Oz kit also depletes the more you are outside an oxygen bubble. This whole mechanic never seems to be a problem and oxygen isnt scarse or isnt hard to find. Enemies have about an 80% chance of dropping on oxygen tank to fill up your Oz Kit. Another small edition to this game is the Grinder. The Grinder is found in ""Concordia"" (The equivalent to Sanctuary in Borderlands 2). This allows players to grind 3 of their unwanted weapons (Usually the same quality) and gives them 1 weapon of a higher quality. This is a great addition to the game as it allows players who may not want to farm to try their luck on the grinder. I have grinded for legendaries many times and have saved a lot of time looking for the legendaries myself.New Characters:The new characters in this game are very unique all in their own ways. All of their skill trees are very in depth and all do different things depending on which skill tree you choose to route for. These characters however do not go together as well as the previous characters from Borderlands 2 as all of their skills dont exactly fit together. Almost every single character you can choose from fits into the story well and you can see how they got into the state they were in Borderlands 2.Setbacks:Although the game has a lot of good things there is always going to be something bad about a game. First of all the AI are exactly the same as the AI from Borderlands 2 which arent exactly the best. Ive seen AI run into walls, jump off the map and just generally being idiotic. Maybe they could update the AI in some sort of patch? I dont know probably not. The driving in this game is also quite a struggle if you're new to the franchise, especially the new stingray vehicle.  Moving your mouse to change direction takes the vehicle a lot of time to realise and has often made me fall off the map multiple times.Getting a weapon you want at the start of the game is also quite a challenge. There are many vending machines placed around the map at the start but getting a weapon from one costs money (The money you dont have). On my playthrough Ive spawned with some sort of SMG whereas my friends have spawned with shotguns and snipers. This random weapon is selected based on what character you choose which in my opinion should be changed.Summary:Overall I think this game is a well developed and well set out game for either long time fans are new players. I highly recommend this to people who enjoy playing RPG games with friends and like to farm and collect certain items. I also recommend buying the season pass as from the past Borderlands game we were given way more than what we payed for. This game is 100% worth the £30 it costs and I highly recommend you take a look at this game! Overall Rating - 9/10			"

												Basically the same as Borderlands 2 except with low gravity and jetpacks. If you haven't played Borderlands 2 yet, play that instead. It's cheaper, just as fun, and more polished.There's some over the top characters that just aren't funny, and the game just tries too hard at some points. For example, Torgue was funny the first time you met him. He's loud, obnoxious, and down right insane. But when he make regular appearances, it stops being funny. I already had my fill of him after his DLC, and yet they kept bringing him back. Over, and over, and over. And then of course there's characters like Pickle. He's just annoying. That's all I can really say about him. I'm not sure what they were thinking when making some of these characters.The writing is also a bit worse. I get that they had to link Borderlands 1 and 2 together, and they did that pretty well, but the main bad guy is just poorly made. Jack was a good enemy because he made you want to hate him. This time, you get some other character who's constantly trying to reason with you and act sympathetic.And then of course there's the lack of end game content. Most bosses don't respawn, so you can't farm them for their legendaries. And even though this is almost an exact clone of Borderlands 2, the level cap has been reset to 50 (<--- has been fixed after a recent update) and overpower levels are nowhere to be seen. Making a sequel with the same engine and assets as the last game is fine as long as you move forward, but what they've done is take some things out and add some other things instead. It's not a step forward, it's a step sideways.So would I recommend it? Unless you're a huge fan of the series, no. Wait for it to come down in price, because it mostly feels like an expansion. A very big expansion, but an expansion nonetheless. I say that as someone who already put a lot of time into the game. I don't mean to sound like I'm hating on the game. I'm just trying to be honest. This isn't for everyone, and unless you've played Borderlands 1 and 2, you're going to miss a lot of things. And unless you just can't wait for more, then the small changes aren't going to be enough. Pick it up on sale for $20 or so if you're not dying for more.			"

												I'm going to compare this game with Borderlands 2 of course.1. First thing you notice is that there is less time spent exploring - probably because of your ability to freakin' fly. Maybe it's the lack of content? 2. Second is the difficulty - the Pre-Sequel seems much easier. Be it enemies that miss you from arms distance, or your overpowered slam damage, etc... it just seems and is easier than Borderlands 2. (less tactics)3. It still has that great humor as the previous game - it makes me laugh, it's true to it's predecessor in this aspect.4. Graphics, Performance - I'm not an expert but i noticed the Pre-Sequel works a bit better on my PC than Borderlands 2. Could be many reasons..5. The Game is shorter than Borderlands 2 - and i'm not including the DLCs. It just seems freakin' short. It took me little time and I finished every mission and explored everything (at lvl 30). The DLCs for the Pre-Sequel so far are♥♥♥♥♥♥ but hopefully they will add some story content soon instead of just new characters and arenas. Where is my Dragon Keep-like DLC??6. Playable Characters - I like them! And their skills. I had fun so far playing Nisha, Athena and Claptrap. All of them are a unique style of play.7. New possibilities, and old ones that are missing - I love the Grinder, it's usefull, expecially if you don't need to sell stuff anymore. But i miss the target practice, I wish they would bring it back in some form! It is so much easier to test a weapon on a target in the city.8. Price - It is overpriced for the experience you get. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the game but it's just not worth 60$. It offers less than Borderlands 2 in many aspects.9. Overall rating - I really enjoyed playing it despite it's flaws, and I recommend the game to anyone who liked Borderlands 2. But, better wait for the price to be more reasonable (on sale f.e.), because you don't get the experience you paid for. It's an important and interesting part of the Borderlands story, so it would be a shame to miss out on it. Just, don't expect too much from it and certanly don't pay too much for it. Even though it seems like a franchise rip-off, it is enjoyable and interesting.Thanks for reading, hope this helps.			"

												In complete honesty, this game is more of a long expansion pack from Borderlands 2.  It's irritating where BL2 was endearing, and obnoxious where BL2 was funny.  I'd say skip it if you haven't already played BL2, and if you have, there's not a lot here for you any way.			"

												Developed by 2K Australia in cooperation with Gearbox, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel! fills the gap between Borderlands and Borderlands 2 by taking the player to Pandora's moon Elpis and telling the story of Handsome Jack's rise from lowly software developer to CEO of Hyperion and his transformation from being a somewhat likeable jerk trying to save Pandora's moon into a complete jerkwad.Players of Borderlands 2 will feel right at home as the Pre-Sequel uses the same engine and interface as Borderlands 2.  This can give an impression that the game is more of the same and those impressions would not be entirely incorrect.  The Pre-Sequel does a lot of things safely and does not attempt to stray too far from the traditional Borderlands formula of rediculous humor, face-shooting action and lots of loot.  Along with a shortened experience, this makes the impression of a very long expansion pack for Borderlands 2.Even with the similarities, the game does offer quite a bit of new content and features to the Borderlands experience:We get a new story which details the events between Borderlands and Borderlands 2 and get to see Jack transform from a fairly likeable guy to a complete jerk by the end.  The story plays on moral ambiguity and veterans of the franchise may find themselves actually having a liking of the ""villains"" and a despising of the ""heroes"" from the other games.  The story definitely plays on matters of morality and perspective that can have the players questioning who are the true heroes of the series.  Voicing for many of the moon's inhabitants is done from an Australian perspective which makes the environment feel like a ""Land Up Over"" Pandora.  There is a lot of Australian humor embedded in the game, especially in the various side-quests which can be a plus or minus depending on whether one ""gets"" the jokes.  The ending of the main story was a tad perplexing but was a clear setup for the events coming in Borderlands 3.There are 4 new vault hunters in the Pre-Sequel and they are all characters which fans of the franchise will recognize.  Claptrap is finally a playable character and his skill tree is very unpredictable and fun in a Claptrap sort of way!  Wilhelm the Enforcer has a pair of drones named Wolf and Saint which provide a balance of offensive and defensive capabilities.  Wilhelm also has a cybernetic tree which actually changes the character's appearance and voice based on the selected abilities.  Athena the Gladiator is a bit of a tankish class with a shield that can absorb attacks and be thrown at enemies.  Nisha the Lawbringer has a gunslinging capability that works much like an aimbot and grants a lot of weapon buffs.  In addition, the player characters are now fully voiced and have a part in regular conversation with NPCs outside of combat which is a very nice change.New weapon types have also made it into the game.  Cryo weapons replace slag from Borderlands 2 and you can now freeze (and shatter) your opponents.  Laser weapons are also included and are a replacement for e-tech weapons from Borderlands 2.  Lasers come in different elements and varieties like bolts, beams and continuous beams.  I found the continuous beams to be especially powerful effects and favored those weapons.  Lasers generally come with an incidiary elemental type, but could also less-frequently take the form of other elements. In addition to the new weapon types, an upgrade system in the form of a grinder permits the player to discard 3 weapons in an effort to get a single weapon of better quality or attributes.  This grinder requires some experimentation to determine which recipe of discarded weapons are required for a desired outcome and will probably appeal to those who like to experiment and tinker in-game.The low-gravity environment on the moon is perhaps the biggest feature change to make it into the game.  The low-gravity environment extends jumping greatly and gives the game a more vertical combat mechanic.  Artifacts are now replaced with O2 kits which supply the characters with oxygen on the moon's surface.  This adds an O2 management feature to the game where the player needs to be mindful of O2 levels to avoid suffocation, but some of that O2 can be sacrificed to allow for extended double-jumps and the ability to do a ground slam attack which will damage enemies in a radius.  Overall this feature felt pretty good and oxygen management was not too much of a burden as there were plenty of places to refresh the player's oxygen supplies before they ran out.  Players who do not want to worry about suffocation can play as Claptrap, who does not need to breath, but can still equip an O2 kit for the advantages of double-jumps and ground slam attacks.There are some interesting changes that appear to have made it into the game at the requests of fans.  The enemies appear to scale more gradually than they did in Borderlands 2 which helps with difficulty spikes between playthroughs of the game.  Another benefit is that vending machines now finally scale to the player's level!  More frequent legendary drops and legendary gear in the vendors should be a welcome change for many.  Also, the appearance of more legendary gear in the vendors has a side benefit of actually making money important again.  Many of these changes harks back to the days of the original borderlands and reverts back some of the less popular changes that made it into Borderlands 2.There are a few annoying items that I experienced while playing the game:Veterans of Borderlands 2 will notice the lack of a couple of features in the Pre-Sequel, most notably the ability to do a reset of mission progress as well as the ability to reset challenge progress.  I personally find these omissions confusing since they were already part of Borderlands 2 and the inclusion of those features do much to extend replayability of the game.  I only hope that these features will be added into the game via a future patch.Another annoyance is that the raid boss is an upscaled version of the same boss that was encountered at the end of the main story.  This feels like a pretty lazy raid encounter and I am hoping that more creative raid content will be included with future updates.I did find a few bugs during my first playthrough of the game.  I had a crash to desktop at character creation of all things, though I could not reproduce that crash and did not experience any others during the course of the game.  There are some small graphical issues like clipping and some of the laser effects remaining on the screen when they should have long dissapeared.  There was a door to the first boss that would not open for me since it was waiting for other players, but I was running solo at that time.  I was able to get the door to open by simply backing away and reapproaching the door, so there appears to be a slight glitch with that as well.  Other than the single crash I did not experience anything completely game-breaking.Overall the game is a competent, although brief, entry in the Borderlands franchise.  Fans of the series may have a feeling that the Pre-Sequel is much-of-the-same and does not offer enough to warrant the $60 price of entry.  DLC and content patches may help fill in the gaps where the game is lacking, but I am not one that approves of the practice of using post-release DLC to fix issues with the release version of a game.  The game is definitely worth a look for existing fans of the franchise, though I would recommend getting it during a sale if possible.			"

Overall score: 7.5/10Did I get my money's worth?: Yes, tons of potential play time hereRecommended input: Keyboard/mouseIt pains me to see all the hate for The Pre-Sequel. It's a good game that's a lot of fun, but people don't like it because it's not as good as Borderlands 2. Truth be told, they're right, but this is no less of a good game.TL;DR: Yes, I recommend this game, but no, it's not as good as its predecessor while being all too similar and almost anyone else will tell you the same thing. If you're new to Borderlands and are looking for a good game to start with, start with the second one. If you already own the second one, consider TPS. With that said, the remainder of this review will be focused on those who have already played the second one.There's plenty that I like about TPS, even in comparison to BL2. The new characters are fun and each have more fufilling stories than previous playable characters (as long as you don't count BL1's characters being major parts of BL2's story, but that's besides the point). The characters are all very different from each other and all the characters we've had in the past. Characters like Roland and Axton are very similar, as is Mordecai to Gaige and Brick to Krieg, and although they all played very differently, characters in TPS felt more fresh than those in BL2, albiet guilty of some similarities as well. Overall, I feel that the characters were thought out well in terms of story, personality, design, and functionality. The story itself was satisfying, filling the information gap between Borderlands 1 and 2, the Pre-Sequel delivers on the name that it's sold on. It was great to not only learn about the new characters but the old ones as well - Handsome Jack, particularly. Unless I'm missing something, all questions that I had were answered without any plotholes, paradoxes, or anything else to ruin the story. It fits like a glove and I commend Gearbox on letting this new chunk of story slide seeminglessly into place. They may or may not have had TPS's story in mind when making BL2, I might never know, but they've gotten me to believe it anyway.Being a bit of a grinding game after the first playthrough, TPS made it more enjoyable to play through it the second, third, and fiftieth times by having the characters interract more with what's going on and have entire changes of NPC dialogue based on who you're playing as. This may seem minor, but it's a breath of fresh air for those who have made it through the gauntlet of maxing out past characters. As much as I love Borderlands, the same dialogue becomes daunting after playing through the story so many times and I was pleasantly surprised to see that this has been remedied. As far as everything else that is entirely new, the oxygen boost jumps are great and the butt-slams are really fun and change the pace of righting hoardes of enemies. Together, these are two things I actually miss when I play BL2 and something that I hope stays in a smiliar state for Borderlands 3. Cyro is okay - it's a replacement for slag that better suits the story, but it's a downgrade overall for those who relied on slag in BL2. While I liked the idea of ice and felt that BL2 would have been better with it included, I don't like it as a replacement. Admittedly, it makes much more sense to have than slag, both with the environment and story considered, so I'll have to let this slide. Lasers were a decent new addition, but nothing that wowed me. Glitch guns, on the other hand, were really satisying to get and experiment with and I enjoy them a lot more than Seraph and Pearlescent guns. I wouldn't argue for a moment that TPS is better than BL2, but let's be honest, it didn't need to be. BL2 gave everyone what they wanted and TPS is still a good game and an excellent addition to the Borderlands franchise for all of us who wanted more.			"

												A big step backwards for the Borderlands franchise.  While a few things were quite well done, particularly class design, bugs were a much bigger problem than in previous installments of the series, and gameplay suffered in multiple ways.  Side quests were badly written and often tiresome, attention to making them feel cohesive was lacking, and boss fights were the worst in the series, with the possible exception of the final boss.  Both previous Borderlands games, I finished, did my second playthrough, and jumped on the campaign DLCs.  In the case of Pre-Sequel, I had to force myself to finish it, and I'm not sure if I want to get DLC in the hopes that it'll be better than the base game, or just buy Tales from the Borderlands, to make clear to Gearbox that my fondness for the franchise is intact, but that shoddy work won't be rewarded.

												Borderlands 2: Moon Edition is an expansion to Borderlands 2 that comes with its own expansions. It managed to take the questionable pacing found in its predecessor, and make it even worse as the pendulum swings back the other way. You will likely need to find a zone to farm before endgame just to reach the level cap. Fortunately, all the reloading that comes with resetting a zone will introduce you to the best gameplay mechanic to farm legendary items: the vending machine. In addition, you will also find fan service in the form of some familar faces, such as items clipping through the floor, automated pickup still failing, and slag 2.0.Overall, I give the game a solid 4/10			"

												If you like borderlands 1 and borderlands 2 but haven't gotten all the DLC for them. Spent your money on that rather than on the pre-sequel.I played through the Pre-Sequel with a friend and we both came to the conclusion that the pre-sequel is inferior to BL1&2:- The story felt shorter, predictable and forgettable- The jokes fell flat a lot of the times for us.- The engine used for the Pre-Sequel is the same as BL2's and it shows.- The enviroments are very similar. The moon is the moon and it looks mooney. The other Borderlands had more variety.- The low gravity causes problems sometimes.- The oxigen really doesn't add much to the game.- Apparently the season pass will only have 1 story  DLC, compared to the 4 of BL1 and 2All in all I am dissapointed in Borderlands the Pre-sequel. It doesn't live up to the expectations set by part 1 and 2.I cannot reccomend buying this game at full price. Maybe at like €7,50 it's worth your money but not at the current price. I hope Borderlands 3 or whatever the sequel is going to be will be much better than this. And have proper 4 story DLC addons as well. But yea, this game dissapointed.			"

												This is an early impression review.I'm 6 hours into the game and rather disappointed. I've played the dickens out of Borderlands 2, so when Borderlands: The Pre-sequel went on sale for $20, I decided to finally take the plunge.Cons:Political correctness and censored vulgarity seem to be the new order of the day. Mr. Torgue's censored speech was always good fun in the previous game but now all characters eschew bad language in odd ways. Darn, dang, etc. It rings hollow. It seems like Gearbox and 2K were trying to make this more family friendly in the hopes of turning Borderlands into a wider media property and in doing so betrayed a portion of the game's heart which had previously made the game stupidly fun. You fail when you need to preach at and brow beat your audience into submission rather than presenting a multi-dimensional situation which allows the player to decide what, if any aspect, is right.Writing & voice acting are limp and seemingly inept thus far. These areas were always great in previous incarnations yet they are amazingly bland in this game. I know the actors can deliver great performances, as we've all heard before, but they seem to have been given terrible or careless direction when performing, then again, they weren't given much to work with from what I've heard so far. Some characterizations seem to have entirely changed. Moxxi isn't flirty, she seems annoyed or disinterested in everything at best, etc.Humor, or lack thereof. This goes to the previous points, writing, voice acting, and characterization. I don't need meme-laden reference humor all the time, and that is absolutely in here, but there doesn't feel like there is any meat here. The wit, zing, and bite of the previous jokes are gone. We're left with something barely tepid.The game engine is virtually the same, not that I expected them to overhaul the entire thing but there isn't much in the way of new visual wizz bang doohickeys.Items, including moon rocks, seem to disappear entirely. I'm not sure if this is a bug or a ""feature"". In BL2, items seemed to stay put until you got round to collecting them. Items do disappear from crates you've opened, if they are vented into the vaccum of space. Also, be prepared to lose a lot of items when killing bad guys, especially when they're flying over the inummerable areas you can't get to unless you want to instakill yourself.The moon buggy is horrid to drive. Get ready to repeatedly kill yourself when trying to make some radical jumps, dude. :P I'd compared it to Mass Effect's Mako, but at least the Mako could jump over obstacles properly.Oxygen as a constantly depleting vital resource, it's annoying. There are many chances to get the O2 you need to survive but this is an aspect of games that I personally hate. It limits exploration and that may be intentional due to lack of game content.Seemingly less content overall. The hard disk footprint is about 6GB smaller than BL2, that's with all DLC for both installed. Some have complained about the story, I assume length is a major factor, I'm not far enough to judge that or narrative.Pros:The music is pretty great.Some grindy challenges seem to have been done away with, finding vault symbols, collecting all echo recorders in odd locations, etc. I could be wrong as I'm not too far into the game but it seems slightly less grindy in this area.Moon rocks seem more plentiful than eridium was, thus slightly less grinding.That's about it so far.Conclusion:There is no polish to be found here. Borderlands: The Pre-sequel is little more than a quick buck cash grab, or so it seems at this early juncture. Add a new location, and a couple new elements, then mix it up with all the old BL2 concepts, reskin it, and they have a ""new"" game. They had a hit with BL2 and tried to remake it as fast as they could for another win on the scoreboard, it didn't work too well.This would have been more fitting as a large expansion pack for BL2. DLC outside of the Season Pass, for that game.It seems like reheated cafeteria food. You can eat it but I'm not sure anyone is salivating for it.			"

												*sigh* Sad to say it but this game is pretty much bl 2 in space.It's short, repetative and generally boring. Pros-Some fun guns-Pretty good voice acting (mostly Austrailian because of the devs)-A few cool locations, Concordia is a pretty good substitute for sanctuary-good action skills, Nishas is quite OP but fun as hell :PCons-shorter than 2-not the best of stories-likes to make you sit around listening to people speak-boring mechanics-vast amounts of just moon rock-too many recycled legendaries-and more that I cant be bothered to type out xDSo in short do i recomend this? No not at full price, this would've been better off (as many have said) as a big expansion to 2. However in a sale definatly, if you liked 2 you'll like this one. If you havent played borderlands before go buy 2, alot more fun :)			"

												Honestly, I was disappointed. I am a big fan of the Borderlands series and have played the last few games quite a lot. (On xbox.) And this game felt mediocre at best. The game is riddled with bugs and glitches, which sometimes makes the game unplayable. It is smaller and just less value for money than Borderlands 2, and heck, even Borderlands 1. The only value I find in this game are the few new features and the backstory of Borderlands 2. In the end, this feels more like a good DLC, not a full-priced AAA game.Gearbox could've done so much better. (Yes I know it was 2k Australia who made this game.)6/10 - ""Feel more like a good DLC.""			"

												- Assault Rifles are finally useful- Lazer weapons have close to no bloody recoil- Legendary weapons drop almost all the damn time- Moonstone is better, screw Eridium- CL4P-TP has the saddest story for the most annoying thing in the game- Cryo destroys everything- Badass Jacks can complete the game while you eat your prata- Cryo Storm can complete the game while you eat ice cream- Pay $10 for seasonal pass so you can  complete the game while eating ice cream prata- SH4D0W-TP cannot be beaten at all- Bosses always have 2 phase because this isn't their final flipping form- Money is as hard to get as real life- Game makes you walk more than you ever did in Borderlands 2- Wait for sale before buying because who the hell buys full price anyways9/10 The vehicles make you want to press e and just walk anyways			"

												After some thought I've had to change my original review of the game.Originally I started playing the game and loved it. Now, however, I no longer feel the same way.I can no longer recommend this game, especially for those who are looking to play borderlands for the first time. It would definintely be better for players new to the series to start off with borderlands 1 or 2, essentially buy borderlands TPS if you are in search of additional, yet not up to par, borderlands content.I rate this game 5/10.In comparison to past borderlands, this game seems less innovative, less memorable, predictable and drawn out at times, and more difficult (in an annoying sense, not as a fun challenge).Much of this post will be negative, so I will quickly mention that if you have enjoyed borderlands 2, this game is very similar and will probably satisfy your basic needs for new borderlands content much as it did for me. However, IMHO, it is definitely not worth the 60$. Borderlands TPS truly seems like a lengthy DLC, at times, one that is lengthy and boring. Although the game itself is not long, the story appears to offer very basic objectives that are then drawn out by some other event in the game. (I.e. much of the game is straightforward yet suddenly an obstacle occurs to prevent one from completing the objective and therefore a new lengthier path must be taken to perform the simply objective). Additionally, this game has proven to be, at least for me, that hardest of the borderlands so far. Not only have I found it harder to aquire a weapon that I like, but I also find that the weapons and characters are generally weaker than the enemies or that the enemies in this game are very strong. As another reviewer put it, often you will have to backtrack to former areas and complete quests that do not offer as much exp as they should or spend an hour grinding just to level up and be able to continue with the story quest. This is extremely prevalent in playthrough 2. In fact, the quest exp in playthrough 2 is horrendously bad.Again, the story seems boring and forgetable.The most dissapointing thing I've found, however, has been the 'raid boss' at the end of the game. Without spoiling anything, the raid boss essentially shows VERY minimal effort and is overall a huge dissapointment. If you thought, like me, you were going to (at least if the story was boring much like it is) quickly boost through the game and enjoy thinking of ways on how to beat an impossible raid boss, you will be deeply dissapointed. I can no longer recommend this game, at least not until the DLC comes out. I hope the DLC in this borderlands can come to offer more than the initial game. I plan to complete playthrough 2 and will add more as I see fit. Thanks for reading.--------------------------------------------------Additional findings------------------------------------------------------------Pros:Cons: Ammo seems to be very sparce when it comes to those seeking to use a single weapon type. For example, ammo chests that are supposed to carry 6 different stacks of ammo will usually be filled with only 3, generally of the kind you do not need. No longer to chests seem to prioritize ammo the player is drastically low on like in borderlands 2. Additionally, ammo is EXPENSIVE in the machine.For example, weapons, at my level,  will sell for 1,000--2,000$ in a vending machine.To fill my laser gun, I need to spend $15,692. As laser guns burn through ammo very quickly I am finding it difficult to sustain use of one of the few guns I have enjoyed using in the game so far.			"

												This game is a serious step back for the series.First, there is a near complete lack of difficulty. Obviously Borderlands 2 needed Ultimate Vault Hunter mode to be enjoyable, to not include that at launch for this game was a huge mistake. Normal mode and True Vault Hunter modes are complete wastes of time- they offer no challenge at all, other than possibly boring the player to death. In addition to a lack of difficulty, there exists almost no endgame to speak of at all.There is less gun variety than there was in Borderlands 2.  In Borderlands 2, every manufacturer of a type of weapon had a legendary weapon for that type at launch. For example, Maliwan made pistols, so there was a legendary Maliwan pistol- the Thunderball Fist. This is not the case in Borderlands the Pre-Sequel. There is also a lesser number of total unique guns in general as well. Of the unique weapons that do exist, a great many of them are simply remakes of the Borderlands 2 variants, some of them retaining even the same names and skins.Character design has also taken a step back, in my opinion. This is debatable, of course, and would depend on your personal perceptions of each character from both games. However, I find Borderlands 2 character design to be much more diverse and fun to play than in the Pre-Sequel, and I would imagine a majority of people feel the same.The campaign is shorter as a whole, but with a fairly interesting story. The dialog has become more “Social Justice Warrior” based though, as Anthony Burch’s head ascends further up his own rear. It’s almost as if you can smell his colon when playing the game. This is not to say the game is without its funny parts, however- they do still exist, albeit more rarely. Map design is perhaps the greatest regression in this game compared to its predecessor. Whereas Borderlands 2 has several great and replayable maps in the vanilla campaign, the Pre-Sequel has nothing I find worth playing for fun. Borderlands 2 had maps that drew players in just for the gameplay and scenarios they presented, the Pre-Sequel does not. Many maps are just plain irritating to even explore, feeling empty and dead. Gameplay is slower and enemies are less varied.The game lacks SLI and Crossfire support. PhysX implementation is still horrible. It still runs off DX 9. It still lacks multicore and threading support, running less efficiently on AMD processors. Basically, it’s easy to see that this game was made to fit on the entirely obsolete Xbox 360 and PS3 and is lack luster tech wise as a result.Overall, I would not recommend this game to anyone at the moment, and it is a very big letdown. I have over 1500 hours in Borderlands 2, and am a huge fan of the series.			"

Note: if you are new to the series, get Borderlands 2 as it offers much more than this installment. Read review for more information.Just a couple of months ago i decided to get Borderlands 2 on the steam summer sale after hearing much of its critical acclaim; being one of the most fun multiplayer game to have graced our generation. Such is true, and it is only one of the many reasons what makes it a very great game. Very quickly, I fell in love with the game.After it ran out of content for me, I turned my head towards the series' next installment; The Pre-Sequel. Naturally since i was extremely into BL2 I pre-purchased a copy of TPS right away.Now, TPS runs the exact same engine as BL2 so much of its banes and boons are similar to it. This review will essentially compare TPS to BL2.One of the main selling points that has been heavily advertised in TPS's trailers is the setting that is Elpis, Pandora's moon, has zero gravity and oxygen (aka vacuum). This leads to the game incorporating a couple of new gameplay elements; zero gravity jumps, oxygen kits and butt-slamming.Zero gravity jumps are pretty self explanatory, when you are in vacuum you will jump higher than you would in atmosphere. It also feels more 'floaty' and movement midair is much slower.Oxygen kits, or dubbed in-game as oz kits, are also pretty self explanatory, you need them for travelling in vacuum. As you travel in vacuum, the amount of oxygen of your equipped kit slowly depletes over time and if it reaches zero it will eventually inflict a DOT(damage over time) unto you, so it is important to always keep your oxygen levels up. There are also other ways to consume your oxygen. Now in TPS you could sacrifice your oxygen to revive your multiplayer pals much quicker than reviving them conventionally. Another way to consume your oxygen is by double-jumping, which is yet another new gameplay element introduced in The Pre-Sequel. Butt-Slamming is basically crouching when you are midair, once you hit the ground while crouching you deal an AOE(area of effect) damage which depends on the oz kit you have equipped and is also directly proportional to the height which you begun crouching midair(or if im wrong, then its basically the height you jumped before buttslamming).Personally, I love these new game play elements. I am not an avid FPS gamer and by no means one with deadshot aim, so these unique mechanics move a step closer towards to being another 'unique' gameplay-oriented FPS which i just can't get enough of.So other than the new gameplay stuff whats different about TPS? Have they fixed the issues that has been addressed for their 2 year old predecessor? No, not really.What really irked me in BL2 is the audio placement of the dialog amidst the mess when players go guns blazing, you could hardly hear the dialog. Also, dialog gets cut off way too often without us knowing that new dialog would be triggered after entering a certain area. Yes, this issue is still in TPS which really, really infuriating. Gearbox fix this already please.Story in TPS is good but by no means fantastic, as we all know it tells the story of BL2's famed, fantastic villain, Handsome Jack's rise to power. Development is as expected and there really isn't much of a 'wow' factor in it.Elpis is a joy to be in with its vacuum and atmosphere setting but honestly there really isn't much else going for it compared to Pandora mainly because its size is way smaller. Different areas feel too similar and some segments are really a pain. There are some questionable level and quest design structures which really makes the game boring at one point. Pacing in the game is also quite problematic in the game. The first few hours have extremely boring missions and little to no development of story. Thankfully, once TPS's pacing finds its grounds, it gets really exciting and fun.EDIT: I previously said that the difficulty of the game is nigh impossibly hard but after the recent update I will amend it. So turns out the newest update that was rolled out really 'balanced' the game and right now it kind of feels like TVHM (new game+) has really not as much difficulty as it did before, and that is a bad thing. Too much of its difficulty is abolished and now the game feels like an utter cakewalk. Hopefully Gearbox will address this issue and raise the difficulty higher. Also since it is guaranteed that UVHM (new game + +) is going to be rolled out with the latest DLC/update (i vaguely know about this so forgive me if i am wrong) perhaps it is then that the difficulty would be raised. During this DLC/update, i hope that the difficulty would be raised significantly but more importantly, it has to have a plausible difficulty curve unlike what i found to be an insane difficulty curve when entering TVHM before the 'balancing' update. Again, this talk about difficulty is fairly relative and I apologise if any of you find it otherwise.Everything else in TPS is simply the goodness of BL2, witty dialog (although alot feel kind of too reused), interesting characters, exciting loot, and of course, an unparalleled multiplayer experience.All in all, BL:TPS is a great step towards the 'unique'-gameplay FPS genre with its new mechanics and has alot of what made BL2 great, but also thats what makes it feel all too similar. There is/are less content, pacing issues, familiar settings all over and tad overused humour which makes it feel alot more inferior than BL2 since TPS is asking for a full fledged price of 60 bucks. Like most have said; it is essentially a massive BL2 expansion and by no means does any better than BL2 as a standalone game. The price of the game as it is currently would only be justified by how much you loved its predecessor and so it is not recommended that you get this game until it goes on discount to say, 30 bucks. It is a step back from BL2 but objectively speaking, it is by no means a bad game.7.5/10			"

★★★☆☆I loved Borderlands 1 and 2. Borderlands 2 is one of my favorite game. I played it when it came out and I bought it on xbox 360, PS vita and on PC, on xbox I have all DLCs and Played the game with all characters (6).I was really optimistic when I bought Pre-Sequel with two of my mates.Lets get into the pros and cons:Easy part, the negative stuff:- Boreing story.- S?#t map design.- No interesting playable characteras.- Me and my friends hate the ""low gravity jumping puzzle"" aspect (fun but to much).- yoyo missions (go somewhere then back go there come back do stuff) they tried to add length to the game.- Its rare to go back ""home"" for opening crates or sell/buy stuff.- Weapon vendors are useless.- voice acting is just irritateing.- forgetable characters (like the girl at the 2nd mission).- Hard to find competent gear. Like really hard. (Played last mission w/ LV. 14 SMG vs. Lv. 26 Boss).- Really bad car handleing experience.- Rare fast travel points.- No creative skills. base skill is useful but you cant evolve it.- Rare boss fights.- Boring sidequests.- No motivation for any sidequests or echo tapes.- Same graphics. (Borderlands 2 (2012)- Game chrash or freeze in every 3-4 hours (i5-6600K / GTX 970 Srix / 16GB DDR4 / SSD)- Boring conversations.- Few funny jokes.- Same enemy types. (like br2)- Laser weapons has no point.- Vertical map is not fun at all.- Beginning is caotic.AVG things like:- Low price at 3rd party sites. (6 eur)- Same gameplay.- Same  gunplay.- Game lenght is not so bad compared to the price range.- HUD could be updated.Positives:- Grinder (throw in 3 same grade weapons and you get a sort of better one)- Fast loading time.- ""Floating car"" called stingray is a lot of fun.- Moxxi's booster drinks ar useful but its rare to go to the base.- Oxigen mask is cool.- Slam is useful. (smash into the groung)- Boost jump or double jump is a great element.- Ice elemental is kinda cool.(really struggleing to gather some positive aspects)I played a lot of games in the past 12 years, its rare but I must say that this game is really disappointing for me and my friends. If you inspect it as a standalone game without other borderlands games its not that bad.On the other hand If you compare it with BR2 u can clearly see that the game is made by an other team and its just terrible. You can see there is 24 cons and 13 average and pros together and I was sweating to get some pros. (as you can se there is a lot of irrelevant positivities).Verdict:If you really like the borderlands series and played the first two games you CAN buy it when the price is low. But if you dont want to spend money to ruin your love towards the Borderlands series just read the story at the internet.If you are new to the series go and buy the Borderlands 2 instead. More content for 10 bucks (Game of The Year edition), fun characters, interesting story, well designed map and great missions.In my opinion this game is a: WEAK ★★★☆☆ (2,6/5) I really cant recommend it.Thank you for reading my review! I hope it was helpful.			"

												Ok, i want to say, i REALLY wanted to like this game. I even spent a long time trying to convince myself it was good, or worth the 60 dollars. But it's just not. It's worth 20-30 dollars, not 60. Here's why. It's a bit of a rant, but I think its' better than the ""OMG BORDERLANDS OMG GUNS BUY"" reviews with 1,4 hours played.The graphics and guns are exactly the same as borderlands 2. No improvements at all. The gameplay is basically the same too, except they added ""oxygen,"" a new consumable resource. Instead of being fun, however, this basically turns into you standing on top of a vent once every 2 minutes for a few seconds. That's it. Basically, you just have to arbitrarily run to the nearest one to recharge, then go back to what you were doing. It doesnt ADD anything from a gameplay standpoint, it just makes you have to do a pointless backtrack.The maps are at best poorly designed. I've never fallen off a map to my death so many times. And it's not because it's challenging or fun. It's because the damn things were obviously not gameplay tested. Ive gone off lifts that just killed me. You can't control anything when you're on a lift, but i still got thrown to my death. I've gone off ramps 4-5 times before i successfully completed the jump. This isn't fun, its brain damage.Similarly, the AI is terrible, and the balancing is way off. They all stand around like morons, but when they actually do shoot you, you die nearly instantly. The boss fights are forced, and don't fit in with the storyline (which IS good.)Finally, I've yet to find a single weapon that's fun to use. Either it sucks, or it burns through tons of ammo and you're constantly out of ammo. No legends, no ""cool"" effects. Just balancing going out of ammo with doing damage.And worst of all is the bugs and the lack of save points and fast travel stations. I include this in one paragraph because they all group together to just be FRUSTRATING. So, at least 3 times i've had to reload because i just had a bug. One time, i couldn't move. I had to restart my computer. Another time, my special attack glitched and my crosshairs got stuck on the bottom left of my screen (wtf??). Another time my gladiator shield just stayed up forever so i couldn't see. This kind of thing is extremely common. I've been caught in invisible walls at least 3 times, and just had to reload. This is already annoying. But there's NO DAMN SAVE POINTS. frequently, my having to reload means i have to do the ENTIRE LEVEL OVER. and since there's no fast travel stations (so far, i have THREE) you have to WALK the entire way. Accross that map, which - guess what? - TENDS TO HAVE YOU FALLING OFF. Here's an example which happened to me. I got the end of a level, it took about an hour. it was a very long level. In this level, i fell off the map twice. whatever. I finally reach the room before the boss level. This is full of vague descriptions like ""shut off the valve"" This room has 4-5 levels, and the objective is not clearly marked. After about 15 minutes of frustratingly running in circles, i realize its ABOVE me, even though there's no reason for it to be there - there's not even a floor there, etc. And it's tiny, and it blends in. Whatever. I try to jump up there -- and get stuck inside an invisible wall. Reload the map, have to do the ENTIRE LEVEL over. all the enemies have respawned. Another hour, another 3 deaths falling off the map. This game isn't fun, its frustrating.All in all, this game just isn't worth the 60 dollars. It's worth 20 dollars on sale, sure. You can have fun playing it. You can play with friends. And hey, if you like borderlands 2, you'll probably like this game too! Buuuuut...it's just not worth 60 dollars. Wait until it goes on sale for 20-30 dollars, then try it. Maybe by then they'll patch some bugs, too.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: 2K Austrilia, Gearbox Software, AspyrPublishers: 2K, AspyrInitial release: Oct 2014Genre: RPG, FPS#Worth/NotWorth: #NotWorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationI haven't been able to drag myself back into this. I tried and tried even using multiple characters trying things I don't normally do. This game just feels like a chore. Its almost lifeless. I played the previous Borderlands games incessantly making multiple characters playing the same missions going to the same locations over and over while listening to podcasts and music and I loved it. I even bought multiple packs of DLC because I just couldn't get enough. What happened Gearbox?I should mention I've only ever played co-op once. I'm sort of the proverbial lone wolf in games like this as well as MMO's. Really anywhere I guess. So if you're super into anything co-op this does that.But lets get to the crux shall weThe game feels inherently different than previous iterations. Its slower, but somehow manages to not be as methodical as the two ideas typically go hand in hand skipping down the street all the way up to the moonbase of Hyperion. Its just as chaotic as Borderlands has ever been but you move slower and have more meters to manage as being on the moon.. oxygen is helpful to our species well being. Because you're constantly monitoring your oxygen, while easy to refill, you to still HAVE to do it. Which makes exploring things outside on the surface this thing that now takes effort instead of just having the joy of discovering things. The characters are all sort of what you expect from borderlands style of humor but somehow, maybe its the location, they manage to be completely innocuous, uninspired and uninteresting. Just keep playing Borderlands 2 instead.Follow my curation for more "

												Not what I expected or hoped for.  It's gone from bazzilions of guns to about 5 from each manufacturer of each type, Pistols, Assault Rifles etc.  Alot of your guns will roll with identical stats if they are the same make/level/type.  The new mobs to fight are terribly underwhelming.  The ability of mobs to jump clear across the map and land behind you is just stupid.  Even unsuspecting foes will walk behind cover and stay there if you put your crosshairs on them.  Laser weapon are just a joke, your firing a beam weapon.  This is a ray of light.  Lasers produce NO kick, but these lasers kick like a bloody mule.  You can't hold your crosshairs on a target and incinerate them.  Pull the trigger and your weapon jumps 6 feet up to the right. 90% of the weapons in game are recycled weapons from Borderlands 2.  Only weapons that I can honestly say were new were the laser weapons, and they are pretty much useless.  Your most powerful weapons in the game are still the Torgue weapons with added explosive damage.  They rip and shred the end boss faster than any other weapons in the game by about 75% faster kills.  Torgue weapons are cool and all, but try taking out the end bosses with a fire/cold/electric/corrosion set of guns and you are headed for one place.  OUT OF AMMO! Take in one Torgue Assault Rifle loaded with ammo and you will wipe the end bosses all six phases with one gun.The quests are terribly tiresome.  Go here, get this, bring it back.  Or it's go here, kill this, come back.  That and the fact that many of the zones don't even allow you to ride the new vehicles.  You have to walk.  Many of the quests send you through areas where you have to dismount and walk (Pickle quests in particular).  That and the fact you can't speed the dialogue up.  You are forced to sit there and listen to there useless rants until they are done.  On my second playthrough, I found myself trying to headshot many of my allies, just because their dialogues were so lengthy and stupid.This game is no borderlands 2 remake, it is a shadow of BL2.  Definately not worth the $60.  Playing it I kept wondering when it was going to get exciting, it never did.  The only fun quest really is the race event, that one is a hoot.  Then you get to off the punks Dad every time you revisit the zone.  That's fun.  He's an idiot, but it's still fun removing his♥♥♥♥♥♥from the future gene pool.Legendary drop rate appears to be about 2 to 3 every 1,000 kills.  Don't expect a huge range of legendaries to choose from, there's only like 50 or 60 guns, and 1 to 2 Class mods, maybe 10 shields (some of which you never want to use because they will kill you faster than any mobs ever will)  add in a couple of ""oz"" legendaries and that's all you are going to see.   Endgame is totally underwhelming, the secret boss Iwajira is a bit of a joke.  Explosive weapons chew him to shreds in mere seconds.  3 to 4 clips from your Torgue assault rifle and he's worm bait.  If he does spawn a couple of little runts you have to kill them off fast or they climb the wall and go above world where you cannot hit them and thus the only way out will not spawn.  Your only option then is to reload.  Even killing ""Raid Bosses"" is no guarentee of a good loot drop.  You may have to kill them a dozen times or more to even see a legendary and even then theres a 70% chance it will be a stupid grenade mod.As it sits now, there's maybe 200 to 300 guns in the game that get new affixes and damage as a player levels.  It's still the same gun, same model, same maker, just with level rated stats and maybe a new affix.  BL2's guns were nuts.  TONS of different guns.  Not so in this offering.Grinder is pointless really. It's cost to moonstone grind are just ridiculous.  Grind 3 greens to make a blue and get charged 70+ moonstones.  Save up your useless junk legendaries and grind 2 of them into 1 legendary of your gun class for 130 Moonstones.  Chances are, you will get a tediore weapon  with low damage and a elemental effect.  Get used to your bullet passing through an enemy and doing no damage.  That and enemies all want to run/jump behind you.  (The jumping clear across the map gets old very fast.  So much for sniping.  Sure you'll get one, but the rest of his buddies instantly dive for cover or jump clear across the map and butt slam you taking out your shields)  As a sniper you may get the benefit of one shot from an amp shield, then mobs are set to jump at you and keep your shield from ever getting back to 100% untill they are all dead.  Get a shield that boosts explosive damage and use that.  Amp shields are pretty much a waste of time.Melee is a bit of a joke unless you use a frost based weapon.  Turn them into an ice cube and shatter them.  Mobs run in, take a couple of swings then run away and dodge behind cover.  Don't look for a Brick type toe to toe slug fest, you will be disappointed.  Many of the mobs will NEVER melee, they just keep back peddling faster than you can move and shooting your♥♥♥♥♥all the while.  That and while in combat mobs seem to have a sixth sense about when to dodge.  Pull the trigger on them at point blank range, but before the shot goes off miraculously they dodge out of the way, THEN the shot goes off.  This effect will happen several times every fight.  Between this and having mobs jumping 1,000 yards, bullets passing through enemies with no damage, gets annoying very fast.Once again, this is not BL2, it's not even a good DLC for BL2.  It's bland, boring, unimaginative, characters lack all depth, story line is pointless and simple.  There's little or no comedy value.  It's just a ""go nowhere do nothing"" title.  Terribly terribly boring and monotonous. Almost no replayability, with the quests the way they are, it's more like work than fun.			"

												The content of a Borderlands 2 DLC being marketed and sold as a separate game.  It may be worth half the price, but that is still only half the asking price!  In addition, they intend to sell DLC on top of this DLC, making it a clear cash cow.  Perhaps it would be worth the money if this future DLC were a part of the package, but it is not.Several issues from Borderlands 2 are addressed, others left as-is, and new issue are introduced.  The content is nice, but not terribly deep --- similar to the Torgue or Tiny Tina DLCs.  The maps are, franky, proorly organised and oftentimes frustratingly buggy, with invisible walls more prevalent than past Borderlands experiences.  The side-quests are also horridly arranged, often having to reclear an area to get the mission, return to a second area you need to reclear to undertake the mission, then back fo the first location to, yup, reclear it again to turn in the mission!Cryo replacing Slag makes for a more interesting mechanic and Lasers are an interesting new weapon, though I could take or leave them personally.  The new vault hunters are interesting and seem well designed.  The plot fills a few gaps from Borderlands 2 and has a few laughs, though the humour is definitely worse than Borderlands 2.  The voice acting makes refernce to different Australian and English peoples, though most gamers will not get these references and many will find the dialogue incomprehensible.			"

												This game......this game.1:No endgame2:Barely any respawnable bosses, those that are you have to go to  place not on the fast travel.3:Too many returning weps for BL24:Very limited legendaries that are found by bosses, most are grinded.5:Base farming tool:Iwajira has been nerfed to his drops, so people cant get the Thingy to drop, to get more crap legendaries from the grinder with that Thingy.6:In Hollow Dome, they promisedd 6 new weapons, and they delivered. But these weps included only uniquest that were all terrible, besides the rocket launcher that is horrible compared to a purple rocket launcher.7:DONT play this game until the cmapagin comes out. They promised a 5 gb dlc. They better deliver by the way their butchering Borderlands. DONT get this, get all the dlc's for Borderlands 2, or go try out The Binding of Isaac.Wait until they fix this endgame missing husk of a game.			"

												So I'm about 4 hours in and it's pretty clear how rushed this game was. Quest items flying away, cars randomly flipping, getting thrown around for no reason, even that inventory glitch from the last game where it would highlight the item on the other side of the screen is here now. They made your characters actually talk to the NPCs now which is nice but it seems like they just kind of added it later in the development as an afterthought. Athena especially has really unnatural dialog. Oh and there's tons of lol funny memes XD XD.A lot of people are saying that the game just feels like an expansion. It definitely feels like a stand alone given the work they had to do to make the new world and dialog and everything but the reused assets are pretty glaring. We once again get the same old buggy with a reskin, though thankfully the turrets are new this time. The Hyperion ammo boxes from the last game are practically the only ones you'll see. The generic human enemy types are still the same with a reskin. Even the jokes are reused, like the medical vending machine run by someone else says ""don't die you good for business."" There's lots of other examples I can't think of off the top of my head.The most obnoxuous part of the game is what the social justice warriors have done with it. Midgets have been renamed to ""Lil people"", Characters have to clarify that their jokes were sexist and that that's horrible. Hell the game has a profanity filter. Every curse word has to be bleeped out. If they were going for a T rating they might have an excuse for that but they got an M so there's no reason to filter out profanity like we're children. Oh and they ruined Moxxi.Overall if you're a die hard Borderlands fan and you're really, really desperate for new content then you'd probably like this but otherwise save your money and let Gearbox learn a lesson from this.

												This game was such a step down from previous Borderlands titles. It didn't even feel like a genuine Borderlands game, there was just so much wrong with it…The writing was terrible, the story created even more plot holes, 90% of the Legendary weapons are reused and tweaked from BL2 (and the tweaks aren't even good, they suck), nothing is farmable (mini-bosses that drop Legendaries don’t respawn), the loot system is very bad (you make too little money and can’t sell weapons for crap), all of the areas look pretty much the same, the unholy amount of side missions overwhelm the main campaign, the awful job of “representation” in the characters is disgusting, there are too many memes, etc.  This game is NOT worth its price. What little content it has is trash. The only good thing about it was Moxxi, but her alone is not enough to reclaim what sorry excuse for a Borderlands game this was. "

												This game gets a lot of hate, mainly because people complain that it ""doesn't have as much content as borderlands 2"". Cool. This game still gives you hours upon hours of content. I'm coming up on 100 hours in this game and I've only played one character, and I'm not even done.PROS:If you're a completionist, like me, you'll spend a lot of time doing every mission and killling every enemy. All the characters actually have personalities (believe it or not). I've seen a lot of reviews slamming Janey Springs, but who else echos you and asks how you're doing? Hello? Some people complain about the legendary drop rate. I don't get why, I've seen 4 legendaries in the vending machines and I've picked up around 5 from bosses. Claptastic Voyage is one of the best DLC's ever. I mean, come on, your inside Claptrap. I've yet to play either DLC character, but I haven't heard anything bad about them yet.The game, unlike BL2, has a lot more skill points that you can use if you're playing in a group, such as having Saint heal teammates and Athena's shield healing teammates in a small circle and giving them second wind when down. CONS:You find that legendary weapon in Stanton's liver and you try to pick it up, but you realize: you aren't badass enough. 10/10 great game			"

												Disappointing if you were a fan of 1 and 2.Characters are weak. Dialogue is all tuned for Australians. Low gravity slows down gameplay. Loot system (as of my last playing) was garbage at the end game. Level design runs the gamut. There's a few decent areas, but a lot of them are poorly done.Story suffers from the ""why see Titanic if you know how it ends"" syndrome.If it seems like the review doesn't make sense because I've put in 90 hours of time, keep in mind that I was a pretty big fan of 2, and I put in 500+ hours on that. I wanted to love this game, but the spirit of it is gone.			"

												Let's get this out of the way. The Pre-Sequel is easily the worst game in the Borderlands series. Design so often falls short of what it set out to do or works against itself. Despite that, it does enough things well enough to give it a cautious recommendation. If you know the gist of the series, you know what to expect here. (If you don't, start with Borderlands 2.) Pre-Sequel makes some changes from 2 but so many of them don't live up to expectations. Class builds are *extremely* synergy-oriented, which allows for some really cool, highly differentiated ways to play when you get them off the ground, but it takes a long time to get those Rube Goldberg machines working, to the point that you're probably most or all of the way through the first run of story mode before your character really ""clicks"" and you play meaningfully differently from anyone else. That's a long time to wait and pretty much pre-supposes that you're going to stick around for True Vault Hunter Mode (new game +) to see how the game is really meant to be played.These kinds of well-meaning design screwups are the norm. It sounds nice not to force each class into a particular gun type, for example, but when everyone on your team wants that cool new legendary that just dropped, you begin to see the wisdom of pigeon-holing each character into a different weapon group. It also causes problems in investing moonstones (TPS's counterpart to Eridium) to upgrade max ammo capacity. Athena, for example, doesn't care about the weapon type as much as the damage type, so you can easily find yourself spending moonstones upgrading shotguns, SMGs, assault rifles, AND lasers, needing a giant heap of stones every time you find a good gun in a previously unused family.The oxygen/slam system feels bolted on. Oxygen kits give you air that rarely matters in a vacuum and make it possible to make large jumps and powerful ground-slams that rarely work in atmosphere. The same vacuum/atmosphere split also makes incendiary weapons a lot more disappointing.And finally, the campaign is a dull slog and loot drops have been tuned to only really be rewarding when you defeat bosses, which makes discovering loot pretty disappointing and kitting out a high-quality murder machine mostly a game of boss-grinding. Lame. The ""loot grinder"" machine was supposed to add some more consistency to it but other than reliably getting you your legendary class mod, it mostly just eats purples for no reward.All that said, TPS shows off the best writing in the series, with a lot to reward attentive players who keep coming back. It does a great job of showing a sympathetic side to Borderlands 2's main foe Handsome Jack without muddying the waters; it's clear he's a bad guy, but we have a better understanding of how he got there. And while synergy-centered builds take *entirely* too long to get off the ground, they can be immensely rewarding. The pure anarchic joy of playing a Claptrap who explodes every time he shoots, hits a target, loses his shields, falls to the ground, or does pretty much anything at all, for example, is something that should delight powergamers and funhavers alike.  Overall, TPS is a deeply flawed game but there's enough moments of true greatness to justify giving it a try. Wait for a sale.			"

												Overall, I would reccomend this game cautiously. Despite the previous sentence, there are a few big things with the writing that are going to cause me to give this a negative review.-The game WILL ACTUALLY LECTURE YOU on issues like friendzoning and why if you think this you are a dark, terrible misogynist. To see this, in the Light Reactor quest in the beginning of the game return the Light Reactor to Janie Springs. Torgue will come in with the friendzoning claim, and then he later interjects how he has seen the light and is a much better person now.-There are many homosexual queer characters (Which is great! More representation is better! All for that!), however the game will rub it in your face constantly that they are queer, as if this is their defining trait. We get it, they like the same gender as they are, stop pushing it in my face constantly.-Game is comparatively shorter, only being 11 Chapters which will take you about 15 hours to beat (including 95% of sidequests)-You will constantly have to find oxygen, as about 80% of the game is outside where there is no atmosphere (speaking of, how are they outside without any suits to protect against the cold? No real explanation for that).There are also a few really awesome things I like about this Borderlands that should be included in all future games.-When doing quests, your character will actually hold a conversation with the quest giver (giving you more immersion as well as giving insight into the character's personality), and for me, this gives me a reason to play all the characters to hear what they all will say!-When doing a second playthrough (True Vault Hunter Mode or Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode), the game actually changes the dialog. The first playthrough is framed as Athena telling a Story to Lillith and company, and the Second playthrough is framed as Brick and Tiny Tina wanting to hear the story again, but more awesome. It makes a second playthrough feel much fresher.-The plot is pretty interesting, as it details Handsome Jack's descent from ""Hero of Elpis"" to ""CEO Psychopath"" in BL2.So with all this in mind, buy if you want. It's not a bad game by any means, but not really a great one either.			"

												Bad game? No.Short Game? Oh most definetly.Un creative and 99% copy pasted? Mhm.I understand that this is the gap between 1 and 2, but the thing is, take away the side missions in this game, its so short it could of been another DLC pack for BL2. and *spoilers* It might as well be considering that its told in a flashback. You go to the moon, shut down a singnal, kill the boss, get betrayed, find a vault and get punched in the face. thats this games story. Besides like, 4 legendary guns, cryo, lasers and low grav, nothing new was added that i could see. All but 4 or so legendaries have been copy pasted or renamed and reskined, oxygen isnt even a problem in this game considering you suffocate so god damn slowly, characters are bland, (aside from athena imo) skills are un interesting and a lot of the characters are just plain annoying. Janey and Pickle are the biggest offenders imo. Is it a bad game? No.Does it feel like a rushed game to meet the crying needs of fans? Oh hell yes.Is it worth the price tag? Not even close. 30$ at most is what i would put this for. Choice is yours.			"

												The game itself is pretty good but it doesn't feel like a true Borderlands game to me, it's kinda hard to explain.Some-what of a break down:-The game has pseudo 3D movement, you can do a pseudo double-jump, or boost jump which allows you to hover for a few seconds, while in mid air, you can slam to the ground, dealing damage to enemies-They scrapped slag and replaced it with cryo, which is more useful being that it can freeze enemies in place and deal DoT-Almost all the vault hunters are recycled characters, Claptrap from the series as a whole, Athena, an NPC in the first Borderlands, then you have Nisha and Wilhelm(spoiler)optional and story bosses in BL2 respectively, then the 2 DLC characters are a Jack doppleganger and (only original one) Sir Hammerlock's sister-The story isn't as good as say, they second game but you see how Jack became the twisted mad-man (or moral grey-area hero) he is when you meet him in BL2-These are more nit-picks but the laser weapons I feel, most of them have to much kick to be lasers and the 'Scavs' aren't as interesting as their bandit counterparts, never got a chuckle from them unlike the banditsAll and all, could have used a lot of polish only pick up if you really like this series and or want to learn more about how Jack a villan and Handsome.

												It's about time that I have done a review for this game.So, as you can see by my insane hours in this game, yes this game is good. I would even say the insides of this game are even better than Borderlands 2. The ONLY problem I have with this game is the lack of content but that is kind of unfixable since 2K Aus. shut down, since they were the ones whom developed the game.But yeah, all the new additions are awesome and all of the DLCs are worth it, maybe not the holodome to a point but the character DLCs are among the best, and the claptrap DLC is one of my favorite DLCs Gearbox has ever made.So if this game is on sale, you should pick it up.

												There's no way I can recommend this for 60€. It's more of an expansion pack and should be priced accordingly. I've only played the first Borderlands but this is literally the same thing with a few new weapon types, locations, classes and enemies (although many of the enemies are kind of reskins). The new oxygen system doesn't provide anything to the game, it's only an annoyance and so is the low-gravity. Sure it's fun to float around for a while but not for the whole damn game. The moon makes me want to return to Pandora so bad. Also Claptrap's ultimate gives a random effect to the whole team and sometimes it's an annoying one like wasting all of the ammo for everyone. What on earth were they thinking when they made this skill in a co-op game? There's also way more backtracking than in the first Borderlands and the moon feels too big for its own good, you often get lost since the environments are confusing and pretty much always the same.

												Being Aussie, even I cringed at the overdone accents and bogan humour.This game reminds me a lot of the Assassins Creed Franchise - Assassins Creed 1 & 2 were amazing with the amount of development time and thought put into them. Then the yearly release cycles began just to give impatient fans a fix, resulting in AC: Brotherhood and Revelations. Whilst not bad games on their own right, they were not memorable either.BL:TPS is like my AC: Brotherhood and Revelations. I prefer quality over quantity and would have been happy waiting a few years for Borderlands 3. If it weren't for console limitations preventing further DLC on Bordrlands 2, I would have preferred to use the money I spent on BL:TPS to support more Borderlands 2 content.			"

She then disappears, leaving Jack behind with the Vault Hunters. Jack, having gone insane from the vision as well as Lilith's attack, swears vengeance on her, and all the ""bandits"" on Pandora.

												When you strip away all the layers of fluff, this game is fun in the same way Borderlands has always been fun. We play these games because shooting stuff is fun. We play these games because looting things is fun. Based on that alone, this game is great. Looking at the game as a whole, however, we basically have an over-priced, low-gravity Borderlands 2 expansion. Pros:+ Shooting stuff.+ Players are addressed by name...sometimes.+ Player characters have dialogue. (Though Athena is like a robot...)Cons:- The humour is realllllly lacking. They're trying way too hard, here. There are some moments you might get a chuckle out of, but for the most part the game isn't all that funny. - Players are still addressed as ""Vault Hunter"" from time to time, and quite often the game just always assumes you're in a group. (When playing single player, being addressed as a group of people just seems weird.)- The novelty of MOONPHYSICS wears off pretty quickly. It makes the entire game feel slower.- There is a LOT of backtracking.- Quality of loot is mostly awful.I want to say ""there's a lot more to it"", but there isn't. If you love Borderlands, you'll find things to enjoy about this game, but wait for it to go on sale, and wait for some DLC to come out. As it is, $90 for the base game and future DLC is far too much to pay for what's there. $60 for Game+Season Pass would be far more reasonable. (Even then, there isn't even $30 worth of content here in the base game.) "

												I really, really want to love this game and give it a thumbs up, but ultimately I have to recommend that you wait to buy this game until it's on a VERY good sale, or avoid purchasing it at all. The game is mechanically almost identical to Borderlands 2--the only new mechanic is mildly interesting, but does add annoyance to the game. You have a slot for an oxygen canister now, and when your oxygen runs out on the moon, you need to quickly find an airvent, or airlock to enter. Since there is oxygen every few feet, this really doesn't add difficulty to the game. However, the plus side to the no-oxygen atmosphere is the ability to jump high with the low gravity and slam back down to the ground, injuring enemies. You can also use oxygen to boost your floating in the air.The game itself feels short, and so I think it should have been a $20 DLC---it is certainly not the quality or length of what we've come to expect from a Borderlands game. The world feels rather empty at times, the enemies repetitive, and there isn't much difficulty even to the bosses. They're just bullet-sponges. There are humorous moments in the game, but not many. The characters are sadly forgettable (not that they can ever top Tiny Tina). There are what I presume to be pop culture references, but this game was made by 2K Australia and as an American player they were mostly lost on me. If you haven't played the Borderlands 2 DLCs, I strongly STRONGLY recommend those over the Pre-sequel. They're the most fun you can find in the Borderlands series and won't set you back $60. Even on sale, I wouldn't purchase this game unless you're comfortable expecting it to be a sub-par continuation to the series.			"

												It's a good game, don't get me wrong. If you liked Borderlands 2, but didn't really reach endgame (IE Max level, UVH OP 8) then you'll like this one just as much. There's not too much difference, save for new mechanics and different characters. But the game hasn't really got any worthwhile endgame content compared to Borderlands 2, so if you like it enough to get through to max level, don't expect to stick around afterwards unless you wanna start over on a new character... It's not worth it. The game has quite a lot of content, albeit less than Borderlands 2, and while it definitely feels like you're playing Borderlands 2 in a new map with some new gimmicks for the most part, it's not quite as good. I've seen people complain about drop rates, but that's just a Borderlands standard - you're pretty much going to have times where you'll have absolutely nothing at your level and are having problems as a result. It's a mainstay of the game and it kinda drives you to actually look around a bit more, take more time to notice things and to find the places where you can actually get loot. But I digress. There's plenty of sidequests, though a lot of them are admittedly 'go here, talk to this guy, go here' kinds of things, with not a lot of them being particularly memorable or giving out very good items. Borderlands 2 was better about it because there were plenty of unique guns you could get exclusively from quests that were really good (fibber for anarchy gaige anybody?) but TPS doesn't do as much of that. I'll say that there's a bit better balancing in this than in BL2, namely in the previously mentioned Gaige build being able to destroy pretty much everything with zero effort. But naturally some characters are stronger in different ways than others. An example, your best tank is a girl who's pretty much immune to damage 75% of the time. And she absolutely destroys things at the same time that she's taking all this damage. Back to the aforementioned endgame, though, because this is what made this game so bad for most of its playerbase. There are only three raid bosses. If you don't count the seasonal raid boss that replaces one of them. Two of them are completely unimaginative in that they're literally EXACT COPIES of the final boss - not even reskinned, literally exact copies - but buffed up with more health, damage, and stronger minions. And even buffed they don't compare to the all-encompassing power of Terramorphous prior to the UVH releases, and how good he was for making friends at the time since the means of cheesing him wasn't discovered yet and he was impressive, both in difficulty and in size. Terramorphous was one of the first bosses in the game that would smack you in the face and tell you to bring friends. There is nothing like that in TPS. The closest thing is Iwajira, and he's not exactly hard even without cheesing him. Which yes there is a place you can go that works much like Terramorphous', but you have to work a bit harder to get to it. But even that guy doesn't compare to the raid bosses in Borderlands 2. With the lore-required removal of Slag as a combat element, given that it predates Borderlands 2, they had to dial things back significantly in the difficulty department because you couldn't abuse the damage buff of slag. So TVH and UVH ended up being 'replay the game with a few new enemies and others buffed, but it's basically no more difficult.' Kinda like old school Diablo 2 and 3. Drops are better, experience is better, but otherwise the game doesn't change much. Which is unfortunate because with the introduction of Cryo damage and how it works, it's very possible to freeze-lock about 90% of the game's enemies with no effort. With the right character, you can do this starting at level 3. There's enemies that can't be frozen or resist cryo, and bosses by and large can't be either, with a few exceptions. But most of the enemies are bandits who like to jump around. And what does an ice cube do when it hits the ground usually? That's right, it shatters. Flying enemies that can be frozen are cake. Bandits that jump around are cake. Bandits that you can see are cake. Cryo makes almost everything far too easy. Especially if you're interested in running a melee build, though admittedly I haven't found any quite as ridiculous as Zero's.			"

												It saddens me how many people dont play this game because of the jumping mechanic, or it's ""boring"", or it's ""short"". This game is not short, my playthrough took about 40 hours, not including DLC. The game has just as many funny moments as Borderlands 2, with the same style of humor (maybe the people who liked the humor in Borderlands 2 have just grown up a bit). It introduces low gravity as a VERY intuitive system to get around the map, and with a quick press of the crouch button, you can be on the ground in an instant, which is definitely not something to complain about. Anyone who enjoyed running around and shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥up with new guns (NOT a bad thing) will love this game, as I feel the sotry is more in depth than Borderlands 2 and gives you sooo much needed backstory. TL;DR LIKE BORDERLANDS 2? BUY BUY BUY			"

												This game is not bad but not really good either. Borderlands 2 was so much better. The missions in Pre-Sequel is not creative, unique and fun like they were in Borderlands 2. In this game it's a lot of running back and forth, pick up a thing and deliver it, go from point a to b and then back to a again. It becomes tedious and boring. The grinding parts are not fun. Pre-Sequel also feels more uptight than Borderlands 1 and 2. But I think that the space-themed setting is great and the graphics are beautiful. Sadly, the story wasn't especially gripping or interesting. I hoped it would get more interesting the longer I played but no. They could have made Jack a bit more ""likeable"". Yes he is the bad guy but come on, give him a bit more depth. He feels one-sided and stereotypical. It's boring and predictable. I don't really see a reason as to why I should help him with his missions. I have played through the storyline as Nisha but she felt one-sided too. Where is the depth?   Is it worth playing? Maybe. It got the same action-filled, hectic hyper-pace as the other Borderlands games. It's open world-ish and a fun co-op game. But I can't recommend it because the quests and story are meh and the characters feels flat.			"

												I'll give the short version: It's Borderlands 2.5 - feels like a Borderlands 2 DLC with 4 new characters, a second jump mechanic and a new weapon type.Positive:+ More 'skills' in the skilltrees compared to 2+ Story gives interesting (and sometimes humorous) insight for 2+ All new characters instead of recycling the old ones over and over againNegative:- About the same amount of content like Tiny Tina DLC of 2!- Absolutely overpriced for what it gives you. 20$? Seems good. 50$? Hell no.- Almost nothing new gameplay wise (Jump boost, Slam, O2 mechanics and laser weapons are rather small). Especially in the FPS corner.- New characters have almost no depth.- Did I mention that this game features almost no content compared to Borderlands 2?Conclusion:a) If you liked Borderlands 2 - wait until it's cheaper and/or for a GOTY version.b) If you didn't like Borderlands 2, don't get it.c) If you're new to the whole series, get Borderlands 2. If you liked it, see a)			"

												Surprisingly unpolished compared to Borderlands 2. There are weird bugs and glitches all over the place. Driving on some of the terrain is really annoying. Making terrain jumps in vehicles is harder than it used to be because vehicle boost works differently and they don't tell you that.It's shorter than Borderlands 2, significantly. The map is smaller, and the area reuse is really noticeable. The side quests are incredibly tedious, especially due to the area reuse. You'll get side quests in areas that you outlevel so much that actually stopping to shoot anything is a waste of time.The gameplay is still good, but this is more like an expansion than a full game, and isn't worth full game prices. Series fans should wait for a sale. People new to the series should get Borderlands 2 instead.			"

												This is one of those games that seems to be a great game at its core but is weighed down by millions of flaws piled on top of it. The combat in this game is great, the low gravity and double jumping makes the combat (especially the boss fights) really cool. It also has the best selection of weapons ever in a borderlands game adding new laser weapons and overall better weapon aesthetics.The bad part? It's poorly written. This game was made by 2k Australia so by extension it was written by Australians. Now I have nothing against Australians but because it was written by people from a different culture with different humour all the funny content from previous borderlands games seems to be replaced with a big inside joke which I'm not a part of. Even humour aside the story is dull and I find myself not caring about any of the characters and it seems neither do the devs because scripted dialog from other sources commonly cuts off the main story. The game quickly turns into a repetative cycle of go here kill this with the story progression and questing that feels straight out of an MMO.So as far as gameplay goes, its pretty good. But the bad writing makes me shut it off after about an hour of playing.edit: It also doesn't like AMD graphics cards, I get frame drops down to 35 on an i7 4790k and 390x so be careful.			"

												I have enjoyed my time playing so far. The writing and humor is a bit lacking compared to Borderlands 2 so far, but there is no argument that the formula works. The setting and locations are good, the music is notably less dubstep (good or bad depending on your tastes), and the new gun/elemental types are a fitting addition to the arsenal. The most interesting change for me is that your character has a voice now. Playing Nisha and hearing her interact with npcs adds a nice bit of immersion.The combat itself makes it hard to ever play the previous titles again. It feels more dynamic and action-oriented. Less cover and more gliding through air to land a fiery buttstomp. The O2 mechanic isn't as stressful as I feared, although you can and will run out at times, It won't spell death. Many forms of refilling exist whether killing enemies or interacting with devices or air geysers. Plus there is nothing more rewarding than shooting an enemies helmet and watching him struggle and suffocate.The loot looks great so far. I found a chest which required 40 moonstone which I paid and got 4 epics. I also found the famed Bonus Package grenade from BL2 at level 10 which is always welcome in my collection. I'm looking forward to testing out the grinder once I unlock it, but I think that will greatly affect how we view the loot. I hope there are a few raid bosses to farm at 50. Happy hunting!			"

												I have pretty mixed feelings about this game. 1. It's more like DLC to Bl2.2. It's not interesting. Shooting at enemies in, again, Bl2 is way more fun.3. No actually new enemies. Tork = Spiderant. Scav = Bandit. Dahl Lost Legion is the same Bandits or Hyperion Engineers. They just renamed pld ones.4. No new weapons. Yes, Laser are cool, but still all weapons are the same. Even Legendaries (Laser Leg do not count).5. They put too much hope on CL4P-TP (aka FR4G-TP). He isn't unique, as the've been saying.6. Short story line. It ends on level 25 (In Bl2 on level 30-31). And we don't have actual base. In Bl2 it's Sanctuary, where we taking most of the quests and buy ourselfs stuff. In Bl: Pre Sequel they tried to make Concordia as Sanctuary, buuut they pretty much failed. We don't have resons to go back there. Only for Black Market. But good thing in history is that it's interesting to watch how Jack turned into maniac, opened the Vault and got these scars on his face.7. It's not worthing it's money. + Season Pass you buy separate.8. Good thing is talking ""beind the scene"". Comments about what's happening on screen.I guess that's it. I could say way more stuff about too huge location's with no vehicle's on them, but i won't. : )I reccomend to buy it on sale or ask someone to buy it as a gift. : )But Bl lovers won't see anything new here. Only Jack's backstory.			"

I still had a fun time playing this game and even though most people just call this game a ''Borderlands 2 expansion'' I still believe that this game has a lot to offer.  It just didn't grab my attention the same way BL2 did.I still recommend buying this game but do it when the price drops (steam sale etc).			"

												The first Borderlands was a surprise for myself. I typically don't like dungeon crawlers but, combined with FPS mechanics and a unique personality, I thoroughly enjoyed Borderlands. When the sequel came out, I thought it addressed most of my complaints with the first game and is still one of the funniest games I have ever played; I played and loved the crap out of it.With the first 2 games, I didn't want them to end. With this game, I couldn't wait for it to be over.This game bothered the hell out of me. I would say it actually tarnished my enjoyment of the series itself. It was such a shadow of its predecessors. It really felt like 2K Australia had no idea what made the first 2 games special. Everything felt like a ripoff of itself – from the vault hunters to the supporting cast to the humor. And it bears repeating: this game is not funny. Some of the lines – as they were written – COULD have MAYBE been funny, but the voice acting (and direction, most likely) was terrible. This has nothing to do with the accents – I think non-American accents are a good change of pace. The problem was that there was no personality in the characters or the delivery; they never felt like characters – just people reading a script. It was like the writers collected a list of funny things from the other games and said, “Lets just do that again! Super funny, right?!” Super disappointing. The gravity mechanics were okay at best. What they did, more than anything, was turn Borderlands into a slow, imprecise platformer. I rarely found the slam damage helpful versus weapons (you can't jump ON people for damage, just next to them?!). I died more from jumping where I shouldn't than I ever did from enemies. Not my idea of a good time. There were so many once-thought-extinct annoyances like invisible walls, tiny inclines that you couldn't walk over, floors that aren't actually solid, and see-though spaces that you can't shoot through. Apparently, this game was designed in 1996. I kept saying/screaming to myself, “Did ANYONE playtest this thing?!?!”While I can't definitively say that all Borderlands fans wouldn't like this game – it's obviously got its supporters – coming from this Borderlands fan, I just can't recommend it. Maybe it's more palatable with 3 other people; I've primarily played solo. If you're a crazy-mega-fan (I'm a fan, but didn't really dabble much in any UVHM/post-game content), you'll likely find things to enjoy here. It's more Borderlands, but mostly in name only. Temper your expectations.			"

												Really disappointing. The lack of fast travel stations will drive you insane- get ready to walk everywhere, all the time. It feels like a lazy attempt to lengthen the game. The missions generally feel like poor copies of the least fun missions from Borderlands 2. There's literally not one thing about this game that is in any way an improvement over Borderlands 2. The stingray vehicle is legitimately broken. The enemies are boring. There is no challenge in playing this game. Just save your money, don't waste your time, and wait for the next real Borderlands release from Gearbox, not this outsourced crap that 2k Australia produced.			"

												Honestly, this is a game I can't recommend to almost anyone. I loved Borderlands 2, I loved the character of Jack, I loved everything about the game. Then along comes the Pre Sequel. I just can't bring myself to like the game, it has so much bland humor, the jokes wore thin after a bit, and the game didn't do anything really different. It feels like a big chunk of DLC except with more Australian NPC's. The gunplay felt even more boring with the slam mechanic, the movement was kinda cool with a bit more verticality, but it was just dull. It was such a drag to the finish, it was almost unbearable. Even the DLC for the game was ""Meh"" at best, two characters, one new full mission through Claptrap, and a slaughter dome, just like 2. The DLC wasn't even close to worth the money, and the game wasn't near worth the price, even on sale.			"

												This is going to be the most difficult review I have ever done, but I belive it will help you to make an educated decision about this game. Please read the full review.The game is great when it comes to the technical side. It is very well optimised, I belive it will run great on any PC (but don't quote me on that). The graphics are great and the sounds and music are on point. Borderlands 1 was felt like a console port however the Pre-Sequel feels great no issues here.However this game is funny and great but it is not for everyone. This game feels like an expensive Borderlands 2 DLC (please just hang on). Most Borderlands fans will tell me ""No, you are worng"", ""You don't understand Borderlands"", ""You are not meant to play alone but with friends"". I know that and I did play with friends the game is great fun. However every minute I was playing the pre-sequel I felt I could have just Pressed new game in Borderlands 2 or just keept playing Borderlands 2. While this game does offer some new features, it just feels like a reskin of Borderlands 2. This is why this review is so difficult for me, I belive this game is great, but I just can't recommend it.I can recommend this game but only for these reasons:- If you really care about the Borderlands narrative/story- If you are a big fan of Borderlands- If you have never played Borderlands 2- If you don't care that you are playing the same game just with a different story and some changes.   E.G. like FIFA or COD games.If you don't fit into one of these categories I advise you not to buy this game. The leap from Borderlands 1 to 2 was pretty significant. However this time it is not. True you get new characters, some more weapon choices, a new Oxygen mechanic, weapon crusher/combiner and a different story. But the game feels the exact same as Borderlands 2. That might be perfect for some people. For others you might just feel like, I could have just saved my money and continued playing Borderlands 2 instead. Because of this I can't recommend the game. However a lot of people will disagree. Therefore before you buy this game ask yourself: ""Do I care if the game is simmilar or do I love Borderlands so much I don't care?"" ""Do I mind playing the exact same game, just with some changes e.g. like COD.?"" If your answer is no to either of the questions you should buy the game, you will most probaly completley love it, if not you might want to reconsider.			"

												This game...I really wanted to like it. I pre-ordered it because I like 1 and 2 so much. That's a mistake I won't be repeating though. The game opens incredibly strong with a great hook in the form of its initial level, and then it opens up into the big wide world complete with vehicles and side quests and quirky characters.This is the moment in the other Borderlands games and good open world RPGs when the game usually becomes awesome. But for The Pre-Sequel it's actually the reverse. This is when the game gets bad. The middle 80% is just...boring. The side quests are mostly simple fetch or kill affairs, with little to no importance related to the main story, and certainly requiring no real decisions or strategy to complete. And the bulk of the main story itself feels like a loosely tied together series of side quests.I found the new characters to be annoying to the point of turning the audio off and relying on subtitles (Pickle in particular). It just seems like the character design was much worse overall than the other Borderlands. And the writing in general was much worse. It wasn't funny. Most of the jokes were just dumb.My single biggest complaint by far though is the leveling system. It was purposefully slowed down from Borderlands 2 to make the game take longer. And wow, it shows. You take longer to level, longer to get better loot. And because weapon quality is related to level it means that for most of your first play through that even just firing a gun is a challenge because you're more worried about controlling the huge amounts of spray than actually hitting anything. I was extremely frustrated by this reduced pacing at every turn.The graphics also do not do well on a modern system. The engine is dated, and it shows.I went into this knowing it was milking the series, but I was still confident it would be that loud, crazy fun experience that the first two games were. There are glimpses of that bookending the game, but it's too little too late compared to all the exhausting hours in the middle.			"

												Not a bad game, but it doesn't quite live up to the success of its predecessor. UVHM is much more fair and forgiving, cryo is superior to slag as in addition to providing higher critical hit damage, melee damage, and explosives, it also freezes or slows those affected by it.There are a few moments where I feel the boss fights were a bit unfair (Deadlift and Zarpedon).The problems: No slaughter dome.Some weapons are locked behind an arbitrary wall that requires either having Borderlands 1 and 2 installed (or rather just save files) some items that require Tales from the Borderlands and/or the season pass.Many enemies are not easily farmable for their special drop requiring several minutes in between attempts, special setups, or simply not possible.Too few fast travel stations.

												That 24.9 hours? That's my total playtime. I've done almost all the quests that the game has to offer (bullet sponge raid bosses aside). I think at 60 hours, I'd done ""most"" of the content in Borderlands 2, a game which, for the same price, has more areas, more story, more quests, everything.It's more Borderlands, yeah, but at $60 for a game that's less than half the size of its $60 predecessor, it's definitely a bit of a letdown. Likewise, most of the DLC is about new characters rather than places to go.I will say that Athena herself is super fun to play as, the butt-slam mechanic is cool, and zero gravity exotifies the gameplay in a cool way. I enjoy the core of what's there, but the shooting mechanics haven't been improved from the previous games (and I personally think there's lots of room for improvement in terms of enemy feedback, etc).Then there's the writing. Pre-Sequel feels like a game with an agenda. I've never felt this way about the series before, but some complaints from one of the writers about how people clearly didn't like a character because of her sexuality or her being a girl, combined with some other stuff in the game, has me feeling a bit off.Personally, I feel that the character in question is a bad character--she constantly badgers the player for attention, yet the game provides no way for the player to give that attention, giving impression that, within the narrative, the player char doesn't WANT to give it. More importantly, a well-liked and trusted NPC from previous games, Moxxi, constantly treats the character with derision and annoyance, confirming for the players that yes, this is a character who engages in unhealthy sexual harassment.That on its own would just be a weird disconnect between the game's author and its audience. But the game takes it further.Most of the insane mission givers in the game are men. Scratch that, I think it's all of them. Whether it's a guy who blows himself up or a guy who wants to kill his wife or a guy who enslaves a female computer 'cause he can't get any, the men of The Pre-Sequel are generally crazy and bad. The only male playable character at launch is a man so obsessed with machines that he becomes one. So the characters the game launched with two white women and two robots.TPS' women fare much better: it's the female computer who rolls her eyes at the men in the game, heck, if I remember right, she's the character who makes the stereotypically huffy ""men"" comments in TPS. The villain, Zarpedon, is the most sympathetic in the series--she is doing something we try to stop, but she's doing it to save the universe. She also wants to pay for her daughter's health. We're the bad guys. The woman trying to rid herself of her psychotic husband apparently runs a gang and, like Zarpedon, runs this gang with matriarchal efficiency.And this could all be accident, but it feels like agenda, and one that downplays equality in favor of the ""women are wonderful"" effect--the idea that women are great and can do little, if any wrong, and men all suck in comparison to them. This game feels as if it disrespects women because it feels the need to put men down, rather than let the women stand on their own. Like... it feels as if the game thinks women aren't good enough to stand up against great male characters, so it has to tip the scales in the women's favor by giving us really crappy men instead.Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel fails to give us any equality, and in doing so, ends up treating everyone like crap. Women with disingenuity, men as targets of aggression.Literally the only ""nutty"" women I could think of were the ones who ran some silly ""people's liberation army"" thing. Borderlands 2 felt a lot more equal than this, with cool women as both psychotic villains and admirable allies. At this point, I'd like to say ""whatever, it's more Borderlands,"" but it's not even that. It's less Borderlands than you're used to. The tweaks feel like they'd be right at home in a DLC rather than something one might expect of a sequel. While I think they're vital additions to the game, I just wish I had a more substantial, better-written game to play than this. Definitely a disappointment.			"

												This really is a ""Meh"" game. Its hard to really think of this as a Borderlands game due to all the ways the game heavy handedly tries to be cleaver, and fails. As a looter-shooter though, it is effective.But first, the start of the game is very, very, very, very slow. Forced to dive into the new mechanic of low grav and O2, you are plunged into Space Australia. A thing the game wants to be abundantly clear about. Its slow, tedious and a chore to get past till you get back on the station. But thats when the game starts to feel better.The characters/classes are all fun to play as. As in previous Borderlands games, there are very clear stronger and weaker characters. However that doesnt deminish the fun of each one. They play as unique as you would expect, and the voice lines and interactions are spot on. The weapons are not as expansive as you would like. Many are just carry overs from Borderlands 2, with the addition of Lasers and the Cryo mod. This really makes the game feel less like an addition to the series, and more of a long, expensive DLC to Borderlands 2. For the story, its solid. Seeing how Jack gets to be the psycho he is, is quite a fun story. As fun as it is, its too short. Much like in the previous games, a lot of your time is spent on side missions. This isnt typically a problem, but the main story is quite short leaving you to complete is sooner then wanted. Overall, 6/10. The game failed to hook me in the first 4 hours of the game, lending itself to poor design. However, once past the first few hours, the game picks up and is much more enjoyable.			"

												*STORIES AT THE BOTTOM*I need to start this review with an apology... an apology to myself.I am sorry that I forced myself to like this game as much as I did... I really am. I really, REALLY, REEEEAAAAAAAAALLY wanted to like this game. Unfortunately, the game is just too bugged and feels too... boring.The low gravity thing is a gimick and makes the game feel slow despite the fact there are low gravity boosters and whatnot. This is Borderlands. I don't play to go slow. I play to kill things mindlessly while mindless things die and drop loot. This mechanic brings out the worst aspects of the game and reveals what the Borderlands series really is; a grindfest. The oxygen management system is pointless and feels like more of a chore than it does a method of survival. The UI is the EXACT same as Borderlands 2, leaving me to wonder if this should have been a major DLC update or not.Oh, and don't get me started on the AI. The AI is just horrible. Too many times have I seen enemies just face eachother while I shoot them. Too many times have I seen them run RIGHT PAST ME while I shoot at them. Again, I have played the game for 3 HOURS while writing this review and so far I have seen so much wrong with the game.Again, I need to stress that I LOVED the second one. I thought the second Borderlands fixed a lot of issues the first one had.As for bugs, I have run into countless nonsense bugs, like quests not starting, quests not triggering unless I do something very specific (for example having to leave the bullet and reenter it despite the fact I was already on the quest marker in the beginning of the game). There were DOZENS of moments where this happened... IN 3 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY! There are graphical issues with the cut scenes, like the cut scenes having these strange lines and deviations throughout the scene.Driving just sucks. It is horrible. I dunno if there was a coding error or what but it's very difficult to drive in this game. You either don't turn sharply enough or you turn too sharply. It's difficult to gain acceleration so you will miss a lot of jumps. In fact, that's the main reason I've died while playing this game, my damn car wouldn't clear the jump despite the fact that I have done it before. The car just won't gain speed. At this point I just completely skip out on driving in this game.I will keep playing, because I feel like there might be something in here worth playing. However, for newcomers to the series, I say play Borderlands 2. Something needs to change. I am not sure what does, but something does. Skip this one until the issues have been fixed. Even after the issues have been fixed I'd still be weary.EDIT:So playing 1 more hour and I've noticed even more bugs. Enemies will literally spawn right in front of you, more horrible AI, invisible walls everywhere, getting stuck in place while running... and just try to watch Jack while he's on an elevator. This game needs to be patched. I am shocked this game was released in the state it is in now.EDIT: STORY TIME (will post as I get them)!I may as well tell stories of the silly things I see. See this section for stories and things I see!-I just had a lunitic stand in front of me and attempt to butt slam me over and over again. I just stood there. I wish I had a capturing software. He did it for a good two minutes until I killed him.-Just saw a Badass Lil Skiv fight other bandits. Bandits didn't respond to it. Go little badass, go.-Walked up to a raider. He walked right past me. Never attacked me. Moved around him. Jumped all over. Shot next to him then he and all the other raiders engaged me.-Hate low gravity. Makes gathering loot a hastle. Kill a badass, everything goes flying everywhere and I need to spend more time than I should picking it all up.-Enemies really seem to hate Kraggons. Whenever there is one nearby, they all focus on them, despite the fact that they're jumping around and I'm shooting at them.-Just had an epic level item fall through the map. Yes. I'm mad. It was a pistol and I'm using pistols.-Shot a guy with a newly acquired rocket launcher in a low gravity room. His body went flying around at about 1000mph and then got stuck in a wall. Shortly after he flew to the other side of the room then went through the world.*MAY AS WELL PUT TIME AND DATES FOR THIS NONSENSE*-October 15, 2014 1520: Just fell through the world...-October 15, 2014 1530: Just realized that Tork Swarmlings (take about one shot to kill) grant 50% more exp than a Skav (takes about 5 shots to kill). BRB gonna farm some Torks.-October 15, 2014 1550: ...Just look at my screenshots... This AI...-October 18, 2014 2022: Your character talks too much and often makes no sense. For example, why is my character talking about looking at a map when I'm in the inventory? Why is my character talking about choosing skills when I'm looking at the map? Why won't my character just shut up?-October 18, 2014 2248: Walked in front of a soldier. He just walked right past me too. I guess they gave up...-October 18, 2014 2253: A Tork jumped through the wall then attacked me though that same wall then jumped out of the wall and attacked me again.-October 20, 2014 1152: There is a mission where you need to download AI into a loader. You need to defend it while it stays in place and downloads said AI. Well, the loader started to walk around after it was attacked. Then it was frozen by an Ice Marine. Now it's permanently stuck and it won't allow me to continue with the mission. Check out the screenshots.-October 20, 2014 1937: An invisible wall just killed me. Like I was jumping from platform to platform and then I just suddenly die. I didn't fall. I just straight up die.-October 20, 2014 2007: So I killed an enemy while I was down and I didn't come back to life. WTF?			"

												Not as good as the previous games.Pro's:--------- New heroes are good and unique. I played Athena and had a lot of fun with her abilities.- The addition of cryo as a new element that freezes enemies is pretty cool.- Laser guns were my go to weapon type, they are a fun addition.- Oz kits were not hindering, very rarely did you actually run out of oxygen.- Slamming is a cool mechanic and I used it a lot.Con's:--------- Main campaign was too short and too easy, we finished the main storyline in 11 hours and I died only 2 times without getting a second wind because of something stupid, not even in big fights. Final Boss fight was really easy even though we were a few levels lower. We finished it first attempt without anyone dying. Killing the final boss made me level 25, spending all points in 1 skill tree I had only completed the tree and got the ability when the game was over. Even though I have 100+ hours in BL2 I do not feel like playing the main story immediatly again in TVHM or UVHM.- I know chronologically it makes sense that slag is no longer in the game, but slag was a really fun element, I miss it. Now we just ran out of ammo in difficult fights.I bought it on sale for a little over $4 and I liked it but I would not pay full price for this one.			"

												Never have I EVER seen a more disappointing, lacking, unoriginal sequel in all of my life (except for ""Banjo and Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts""This game was so lacking of original content. This game was literally an extra large dlc (cash grab)The maps were giant and vacant. I died more falling off of cliffs than in combat. The characters are annoying and forgettable. You can tell that they're trying too hard to be funny.There were alot of things to love. The updated menu systems, the laser weapons, the butt slams, all of that. If it wasnt for the fact that this is literally hyped to be a full fledged game, it might have not been so bad.Bosses are recycled and dont respond. The grinder had ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics. I had to literally convince myself to finish this game due to the fact that all of the quests were literally ""find x to kill y"" or ""defend x from y"" or ""unlock z by using x to locate y while fighting a.""Do yourself a favor and just buy Borderlands 2: GOTY. If you already own the borderlands games and want to play more, WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT BORDERLANDS. Im telling you that there is nothing wrong with skipping this one. If you really want to know what happens just look up the story. Otherwise, prepare yourself for a full-game priced disappointment.			"

												Do I like the game? Yes. Is it worth the full price? Definitely not.Only a few hours in and I've already had to restart the game multiple times - quest markers not showing, NPCs getting stuck so you can't proceed with the quest, not being able to talk to quest givers... and since this is a 'checkpoint save' type of game, you restart and spawn back at the very beginning of whatever you were doing.I was a huge fan of Borderlands 2 and all its DLCs, and while this is still playable (somewhat), I would only recommend buying it at a heavily discounted price.

												Long post, sorry...I tried to love this game. I tried as hard as I have ever tried. As a huge fan of the Borderlands series, This game looked like the best thing to ever happen. I watched every ad with wide eyes, and preordered the second I was able to. I even bought the season pass, as Borderlands 2 more than delivered on its price for its season pass. When the Presequel finally came out, I had booked several days off worked, stocked up on food, and prepared to delve into another adventure into the borderlands universe. Barely an hour later I was standing away from my PC, shaking my head, and regretting my blindness.This game is bad. Not legendary 'bad', just bad. From gimmicky mechanics which interfere with your gameplay (Goodbye rare weapon headed for low orbit!), to ridiculously unintuitive level design (Because instant death pits immediately outside of vehicle spawns are fun, right?), to length padding of the worst kind (Hey, you got the thing! Now go get three more from the other corners of the map!). However, this isn't the worst part, not at all. Both previous games had their glitches and faults. However, what they did have was fun. Hours upon hours of childlike fun, especially Borderlands 2. Even the worst areas in the game (I'm looking at you Sawtooth cauldron, padding based level that you are!) are still enjoyable, although perhaps a bit tedious. This is where Borderlands: The Presequel fails. It simply is not FUN to play. Oh sure, it has interesting gimmicks, such as low gravity, Oz kits, Laser weapons, and plenty of eye candy, but this isn't what makes a game fun. A game is fun when its has honed gameplay mechanics, well designed levels, creative enemies, good music, enjoyable characters, and passable writing. The presequel has none of these. - The gameplay mechanics are pretty much ripped right from borderlands 2, icons and all, with virtually no change at all, bar their gimmick of gravity and air; you control exactly the same on the ground. The mission are padded beyond belief, resulting in grindfests which will last ages. Get used to hearing the phrase ""A few more components"", as it is used a lot, along with ""wait we have to go here first"". Metroid style backtracking in a FPS...- The levels are a bunch of interconnected linear paths of which you will be backtracking along most of during the story missions (cause backtracking is one of FPS gamer's most beloved mechanics!). And yes, I said story missions. Not side missions sending you back to somewhere, but straight up backtracking in th mandatory story missions...- The enemies are almost completely reskins with one or two quirks. The soldiers are just hyperion soldiers with more health and medics, the scavs are just bandits with jetpacks, the Torks are just spiderants with corrosive attacks and wallclimbing, the Rathyds are just Rakk with a more sustained attack, and the infected are just rats with helmets (Because rats weren't hard enough to deal with, and now they have headshot immunity!). The few enemies that aren't reskins, like the Shuggaths, are ridiculous. Huge floating sacks with tentacles with elemental attacks. Then the game begins not even reskining enemies! Yup, straight up throwing Stalkers at you with no explanation other than ""R&D department"" (Because again, everyone loved the guys, right?). Even a thresher makes an appearance!- The music is uninspired, and a very poor followup to the soundtrack mastery of Borderlands 2. The entire score is par for the course in a sci-fi based game, and has no high points, just a mediocre soundtrack to your mediocre journey.- The characters... Oh god... Every lovable trait in any returning characters has been scrubbed away to make room for the Memes, such as Moxxi, who is now only innuendo, instead of the clever character from Borderlands 2, who had surprising levels of depth to her.. There's no originality in the new characters either, just a shallow representation of a single character trait, which is then amplified to truly irritating levels! The Australian character is a mechanic/homosexual/story-writer/blackmarket-dealer, who has almost no relevance past the first few missions, and is a poor followup character to Sir Hammerlock, whose role she fills. The British kid is... British. A pickpocket/junk-dealer/information-dealer/salvager who ends up WELL overstaying his welcome in one mission which has the most padding out of all the ones I played and only serves to remind you that you're not done yet! Jack is the one who has suffered the worst, though, coming across as a jerk right from the beginning and only getting worse as the game advances. Wasn't the game supposed to be his fall from grace, the story of his transformation from decent leader to the tyrannical dictator that we all loved to hate? Well, he starts as an♥♥♥♥♥ and stays that way the whole game.- The writing is uninspired, lazy, and predicable. Plot points are forecast way in advance (Hmmm, an AI companion? Hope shes not gonna go crazy!), are often lackluster, and most often serve to make the game's characters worse. Again, Handsome Jack just become less and less enjoyable, and his actions aren't justifiable in the least throughout the game.In the end, The Presequel is a disapointment. It fails to live up to its hype, and even its previous incarnations. The gameplay is slow, the lootdrops even wors than BL2, the bosses tiresome, the vaunted GRINDER being just another moneysink... The only things in this game that work flawlessly are the elemnts that they ripped from BL2's chest. Heck in some portions of the levels you can see that they would import loot containers, but not change how some of them looked, resulting in a design clash that rips you right out of the experience. My advice? Don't buy this. I know it looks shiny and crazy, but thats on the surface. It is dull grindfest on the bottom that somehow takes the Borderlands Formula and makes it boring. Play Borderlands 2. Play Borderlands. Don't play this. Maybe once the price on a 75% sale, but even then, think carefully.Final veredict: 5/10 (only for the stuff ripped from BL2)			"

												This is my first Borderlands game, and to be honest, I think it's awesome. Now, some people might think that starting right in the middle of something can be confusing, and I agree (I did have to do some reading about some of the characters), but even then, the game does a great job at storytelling, since you get to know the characters and all. While I wasn't too familiar with the Borderlands universe, I did know about Handsome Jack, and it's nice to see how a person with noble goals descends into villainy; and it isn't just a ""he's a good guy who becomes crazy with power"", there's different events throughout the storyline that start showing his true nature.Like I mentioned above, the storytelling is pretty good. The main story seems somewhat short when you think about it, with a few missions that feel like filler; mostly because of all the walking around, not so much the writing, which is great, with lots of hilarious dialogues, and some serious ones when the situation demands it. If there's something I enjoyed about the writing is that; it can easily go from the characters making jokes and such, to a really dark moment, and it still feels natural. The game also has tons of side missions, which unlock as you progress through the storyline, and offer some more gameplay (as well as some great rewards, depending on the mission).The level design is mostly good, with great open areas, and some really cool visuals. Still, there's a few sections (mostly during main story missions) that feel like they were designed in order to extend the game time, as there's lots of going back and forth in order to open a few doors. Also, while most of the large maps have vehicles for you to use, there's one near the end of the game that's really big as well, but doesn't have any vehicle station, which means you must walk around.Now let's talk weapons. From what I know of Borderlands, this game is practically Diablo with guns, or a shoot 'n' loot, as the game says. That means that a great deal of the gameplay involves killing enemies, finding better weapons and gear, and so on, until you can defeat stronger enemies, to get even better loot, all the way up until you finally get a broken♥♥♥♥♥combination of loot, which you'll then proceed to show off on the Internet. It's a good system, I'd say, especially when you defeat some tough boss and see all that sweet, sweet loot dropping from them. And the variety is impressive: from pistols and submachine gus, to laser weapons with different elemental effects, not to mention the legendaries and uniques, which have their own quirks (I love Miss Moxxi's Vibra-Pulse, for example).The soundtrack is mostly ambient sound, which changes depending on the situation (combat or exploration), it's good enough, but it's not something you'll pay a lot of attention to.As far as playable characters go, there's four of them, at least in the vanilla game: Athena, Wilhelm, Nisha and Claptrap. I haven't played Wilhelm and Nisha that much, but their skill trees seem interesting. When it comes to Athena, she's easily my favourite character, her Aspis shield is great for soaking up damage and throwing it back at the enemies, and one of her skill trees greatly improves elemental damage. And Claptrap, well, he's fun to play, but the randomness of his action skill can sometimes be frustrating.Well, I think I've written a fair bit about Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. There's a lot more I could write, but this review looks long enough. To sum everything up: get this game, because it's awesome.			"

Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is a breath of fresh air in the cold vacuum.Some people think that the game feels like a continuation of Borderlands 2 in all aspects, however, we can see a fresh take on combat and exploration, story and quests; Game introduces several new non-playable characters that will help you in your adventure; Four new playable vault hunters will show powerful action skills designed to aid in battles against humans, monsters, and machines; And as without about new picturesque landscape by itself. I think Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel still offers some the best of what the series has to offer: good loot, good laughs and good times for many hours.			"

The humor is lacking, the guns are the same, the low gravity is awful, its buggy as all get out, and well....its just boring. I played for about 2 hours, and I am probably not going back. No worth 60, could've been a dlc, and not even that good of one. But I know how to fix it!Erase all your game files from borderlands 2,  reset all of your badass ranks. Start a new character. Viola!!!!  A new borderlands. Heck, if that isn't good, go in the way back maschine and start a new game of the first Borderlands...steam got the multiplayer workinnnnnn.... :-)			"

												Back when the game was released I was on the fence on getting this. Until it recently went on sale for 70% off that gave me the thought of ""Why the heck not?"" because I like the Borderlands lore. Before playing this game, I already played all 1, 2 and even the Tales from the Borderlands but only when I finished the point & click game I came to realized that Pandora is an interesting world to discover. Additionally, as the credits rolled I got surprised that the supporting actor for Troy Baker[en.wikipedia.org] was Chris Hardwick[en.wikipedia.org]! Then I thought ""That was more awesome!"". It left me wanting more to discover the Borderlands series. So here I am ready to review this game...The presentation never fails to look badass like it always do since the first BL, it just as explosive, bloody, funny & dynamic which is all exciting for me to anticipate another epic adventure! But upon my understandings on what makes it great also gave me the same on the other side of the coin of some sort. What I like the most about the game are…The unchanged elements which made it fun and Borderlands the way it should like gunplay, looting, the hilariousness, the colors, the graphics, the skill trees of each class, the dialogues, the co-op, the phasing & the boss fights. Returning NPCs from two previous titlesSome hilarious missions & side missionsThe traveling time between places does not take that long anymore unlike the two previous gamesAdditional combat elements like the stomping is funZero Gravity controls takes me to some hard-to-reach placesInteresting players like Claptrap, Nasha & Wilhelm (+ Jack as DLC)What I do not like are… The lack of music to set the theme (I miss the western theme-like of the music) The bugs (but I never encountered any game breaking ones)The good plots from the game wasn’t as epic as the previous oneI guess the Borderlands 2 was the peak of its time and where else will you go if and when you reached to the top but down right? I’m not necessarily saying that this game is bad in fact it is fun and a very good one at best. However, it does not have that dynamic impact from Borderlands 2 as well as the music from the game. In the end, this game is worth playing but to those who played BL2 and expect more, please tone your expectations down and HAVE FUN.			"

												As an avid Borderlands fan, there was pretty much no chance of me not buying BL:TPS. However, I cannot in good concience recommend it to anyone who isn't a huge enough fan to have already bought it by this point. Just go grab BL2 for wicked cheap during a sale.When the price drops, you should totally buy the crap out of it, but for $60, absolutely not worth it. Shoot for $20 ($25 with season pass) like it was during the summer sale.Why would a diehard Borderlands lover like myself tell you to avoid this till the price drops?Feels like a big BL2 DLC    Only a few mechanics have changed. Sure, we've got the Grinder and low gravity, but what else is there that isn't just an older concept with a new coat of paint? New vehicles? Scarlett's. Moon rocks? Eridium. Moon chests? Dice chests from Tiny Tina's. The vast majority of the weapons are the same. The same UI flaws exist (including a new one, the 4-vehicle Moon Zoomy interface is terrible, half off the screen). The list goes on and on.Beta quality    With 24 hours of gametime since the release, I've suffered at least 5 crashes. Yes, Borderlands saves often, but not often enough to prevent me having to clear those baddies several times. I also had 2 failable quests instantly fail when going through area-based checkpoints. In one, I killed a special thresher and took the elevator up into a shop. The quest promptly failed, citing my having (not actually) died, conveniently locking me in until I reloaded the game. A release quality game should not have these issues.All that aside, I do rather enjoy the game.Low Gravity    Gravity actually adds a lot to the immersion of the game - variable gravity based on area adds an element of realism to buildings. Low gravity allows for a lot more interesting maneuvering and varied combat. Don't stop there, though, because low gravity allows you to really get into every nook and cranny, really allowing you to appreciate the beauty of the entire world by boost jumping all over it. Butt slams are another great low gravity mechanic, making it easy to deal with many small enemies at once - in my opinion, a rather annoying (and common) situation.The Grinder    Combine, reuse, recycle. Got old or junk gear? No worries, just combine and upgrade. Want a specific legendary? No, you don't need to grind the boss that drops it any more, just any two junk legendaries and a purple of the right type, then repeat till you get what you want. It's great but almost feels too easy, something I'm sure irks many of the BL2 fanbase.			"

												Borderlands 2 is still unto this day the most fun FPS ever made. The Australian team who agreed to make the next one must have been very brave. There was no way to make a better follow up. They made a few good decisions. They made it a prequel on a moon and they added 'air control' and weightlesness. It works for me. It's not as good as 2 but having played the living daylights out of it I really enjoy the Pre-Sequel. The humor is not as good as 2 but the characters and the gameplay are. O, and just like Borderlands 2 the DLC's are very good and fun to play.			"

												-All subject to change-So far this game has been nothing but a dissapointment. It's an unfinished alpha of the game with nothing more than new names and reskins. Literally nothing is differnet besides new gun types and the removal of other gun types. The Oz kit gets in the way more than not because sometimes you find yourself struggling for oxygen and there is nothing you, and the new cars are so horrific that you can't steer barely at all, and the gravity becomes extremely high once you are in a car. Me and my friend had a great time getting stuck in a pit that you have to go in for a side quest, only to find that there is no way out other than jumping off the edge and killing yourself. He also had fun taking screenshots of me walking through walls and pipes and ground pounding through towers. We even found one account of a wire system that cut off in the middle of no where in the air, and the wires were not running through the electric poles, but instead just randomly in the air with no sense of texture at all.Update: The more you go through the game the more you notice these horrible glitches and bugs like a bosses shield drones getting stuck in walls so you can't kill her. Generally, I will keep playing only because I'm a fan of the series. This is not worth any more than max 20 bucks.			"

												Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is the ""third"" installment in the Borderlands series, and personally has to be my favorite. As someone that has completed Borderlands 1 about 14 times on the PS3, completed Borderlands 2 on the PS3 PS4 and PC for a total of about 20 times, and completed Pre-Sequel on the PS4 first, I've become exahusted with the series. It's why I didn't bother trying to 100% the achievements for this game. But why do I say this is my favorite one of the series? I'll explain.Pre-Sequel takes place after the first game and before the second game, and Athena is re-telling the events of the Pre-Sequel. (So it kind of is after the second game...) It shows the events up to how Handsome Jack and how everything came to happening for Borderlands 2, and frankly I think the story is just as good, if not a little better than BL2s story. I will say though that it does take awhile for it to pick up. I find the first hour to be pretty boring and very hard to get interested in the game, but once it starts to pick it I found it easy to play through it and have a blast. What is even better is having what ever character(s) you are currently playing chime in with unique dialog during certain parts of the story. That little feature alone made this story more interesting and enjoyable compared to BL1 and BL2. Even playing on True Vault Hunter the ""Re-telling"" dialog is slightly different, with different characters chiming in about the events. It gives another reason to play through the story again.CharactersThe Vault Hunters this time around are previous bosses from BL2 and characters from 1&2. You have Athena the Gladiator which first appeared in BL1 DLC. She wields a shield that absorbs damage, then thrown to hit/kill her enemies. Then you have Wilhelm the Enforcer, who was a first major boss in BL2, summons drones to help fight/defend him. Cool fact about Wilhelm, any major upgrades you take on his skills, will actually change how he looks/sounds, which is a cool little feature!Next you have Nisha the Lawbringer, who was a minor boss in BL2, who plays as a cowgirl/weastern shooter and duel wields pistols... and stuff...Last but not least, and by far the best character to play as, you play as Claptrap, but is now trained in combat, so hes now called Fragtrap. Claptraps ability is ""VaultHunter.exe"" and is the most entertaining out of the other powers, because it's semi-random on what you can get, based on your surroundings and what is going on. You can get a super useful boost like increase damage/speed/rate of fire, or cause a lazer disco inferno, or you can cause the whole party to start bouncing around. And to top it all off, Claptrap also has some of the best dialog in the entire game. Nuff said!*DLC CharactersThe Handsome Jack Doppelganger is by far the second best character to play as. Also has some of the best dialog in the game. The skills are also tons of fun. You can get frickin lazers on your arms!Lady Hammerlock the Baroness... I absolutly hate. I hate her more than Nisha, so I'm not gonna talk about her.Combat/WeaponsThe new addition for combat in Pre-Sequal is the introduction of Low Gravity and Butt Slams. This makes the combat so much better compared to BL2. This adds in some verticallity and more range of movement to the combat, making it more enjoyable and feel more fast paced and action packed. Now being a Borderlands game, it has the trope of ""It has a bazzilion weapons!"" and frankly, I hate it. Why? Because 98% of the weapons is just useless trash! Just like BL1 and 2, yes it has lots of weapons, but in terms of any ""unique"" or fun weapons, are very limited. This was always a feature that I hate, cause I'd rather have more interesting and fun weapons, instead of being dumped a bazzilion useless trash guns/items. Still there is some great weapons that have special effects or abilities to them that can make things more interesting. With the new addition of lazers there is even more fun weapons to use.I will say though, the Moon Buggie has the WORST driving mechanics I've ever seen. The slightest bump on the road can send you flipping off a cliff to your death. The second I was able to get a hover bike, I never used that pos buggie ever again.PROS:- You play as Claptrap. BEST DAY EVER!- Story is slow to start, but gets great.- Low gravity is really fun.- BUTT SLAMS!- New lazer weapons are fun.- Season Pass does NOT give you ""Shock Drop Slaughter Pit"" (It's not worth it, it's garbage.)- Claptastic Voyage is a GREAT DLC!- Jack Clone is too sexy.- Achievements.- Steam Trading Cards.CONS:- Athena, Nisha, Wilhelm, Lady Hammerlock all have boring dialog.- Jack Clone is too sexy.- Not lots of DLC.- Holodome Onslaught DLC is boring and super short. Only thing worth out of it is the Upgrade pack.If you're a fan of the Borderlands series and wanted something thats the same, but a little bit different, it's a great pick up and is really fun. The Claptrap DLC adds on for even more fun and makes things even more interesting. I highly recommened it!			"

												Rating 8/10Overview: First Person Action RPGThe Good: + 4 characters to choose from, each with 3 skill trees. The skill trees are more robust than previous games. The skills themselves are also more unique. Plenty of different character builds and options. Clap trap being one of the most unique characters to play as in the borderlands universe. + A good story that explains how the events unfolded leading up to Borderlands 2. + Two new gameplay mechanics. The first is the jump pad, this allows you to jump really high or traverse large distances. The second is the oxygen meter. Many environments have low gravity allowing you to jump really high and far which allows for faster traversal over the terrain as well as more interesting gun battles. Running out of oxygen is never a concern because there are so many ways to refill your oxygen.+ Lots of good loot. + Plenty of graphical/audio/gameplay options, very well optimized The Average:The overall map design for most levels feel a bit too condensed. I was hoping for more open spaced levels where I could drive around but that never really materialized here. Like every borderlands before it, side missions are not ""optional"". If you don't complete them you will be very under leveled for the main missions.  The side missions themselves are not the greatest either, many of them are not as creative as Borderlands 2. Humor is very hit or miss. The Bad: -Multiplayer is near dead making it very difficult to get some achievements. The game is also a lot more fun when playing with more people. Conclusion:This game is really good yet never really gained the same attention or critical praise as its predecessors, partly because many people were 'borderlands fatigued' by the time this game came out and the fact it was made by a different studio gave the game the impression it was a quick cash grab. Other than the new characters and new features mentioned above this is almost exactly like its predecessor in almost every way. This isn't bad but those looking for a completely new experience will not find it here.  Is this game as good as Borderlands No, but this game can certainly stand on its own. "

												Wow, Gearbox. I take back almost everything I said about Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel, before I played the latter title. BL2 struck me as very very derivative of the first game and way too impressed with itself -- I mean, it worked as a business idea, the game sold a ton. But I really thought Gearbox was creatively bankrupt after playing most of BL2 a while back, and never planned to get the Pre-Seq.But holy crap, I was wrong. The Pre-Seq is BY FAR the best in the series IMO. They added some ridiculously fun mechanics with the O2 tanks, some very clever (and slightly annoying, but mostly clever) altitude-based environment puzzles, and the LASERS, man. The lasers are FUN. SO much fun. The characters' skills are way way better than 2's -- Athena is my girl all the way, although I also dig Nisha's gunslinger skills. Wilhelm is a pretty amusing character, and I dunno about the robot. Don't care, honestly, but I do plan to fiddle with him at some point. Actually, I'm so glad they finally regulated him to a much more secondary role, because I don't know about you, but that ""ha ha I'm an annoying sidekick"" joke was running damned thin.And they actually wrote a -- so far -- rather decent story that isn't 75% pop-culture jokes, and they manage to give some of the characters some personality, AND the level design & art design blow me completely away. The writing: as much as I love Anthony Burch, the comedy in BL2 got super old after you ran around Pandora for the tenth time, and there's only so much ""look at me I made an internet joke"" I can take, honestly. The Pre-Seq actually puts forth a fairly interesting story and the comedy is mostly derived from the characters and who/what they are, not all the quotes they can spout at you. And that is a HUGE leg up in my opinion.I still get frustratingly lost in some of the environments and the map still sucks, but wow. I'm kind of in love with this one.--Haven't finished the main story yet, so this review may change in the future. But, so far, if you're a Borderlands fan, you'll be pleasantly surprised with the third installment of ""Pithy Punks Populate Pandora: PEW PEW PEW"".			"

												This game was just...a let down. It tried so hard to be a further telling of the backstory to BL2 and to play just like it...but it falls flat on it's face. Got nothing against Australians, but a little less Australia in my SPACE ALIEN GUN LOOT game would have been a nice touch.Also, the main Antagonist was awful, can't believed they even bothered to write lines for her, didn't see a point to someone talking when they are featured for only the entirety of 5 minutes. Bland, boring, overly-Australian characters and no real new gameplay and deceptiveley linear environments made this a waste of money for me. Won't even bother bearing through the Claptastic Voyage after this. Use your money to buy Borderlands 1 and/or 2 and all the DLC's instead.			"

												Space Australia The Game!!! realtalk: just play bl2 - Why are the moon inhabitants australian? (i know this was made by aussies)-being on the moon slows combat -anti gravity seems like a cool idea but just becomes a nuisnace in combat where everyone is floaty-forced platforming with said anti gravity-lame enivronments being the moon essentially makes all the environemnts either some type of rock varient or ship-missions are long and boring fetch quests which was in all BL games except it was more just progressing and not backtracking.-Forced Australian humor nearly every npc/boss falls into ""drunk,dumb,aussie"" heck the most interesting characters were the ones who werent australian. -Shorter than bl2 and less contentThere are slight improvements like getting rare gear in vending machines and the two new weapon types are nice but not enough to warrant a new game, its honestly more like a dlc.Lets not outsource Gearbox mmkay?

-Quick Review-Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is FPS RPG developed by 2K Australia and Gearbox Software, and released in 2014.  Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is pretty much Borderlands 2 but on the moon/station seen over Pandora. If you're not sure if you'll like borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, go give Borderlands 2 a try.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Borderlands: The Pre-sequel takes place between the first Borderlands game and Borderlands 2. If you couldn't figure that out for yourself based on the colorful word-play. (Is a Pre-Sequel even a thing? *googles* well seeing as the only results are Borderlands the Pre-Sequel)To add a bit more clarification or to completely lose you: The story is actually taking place AFTER Borderlands 2, but in story format, as told by Athena (A secret agent-type, gone rogue. You meet her in Borderlands 1's The Secret Armory of General Knoxx).For simplicity sake lets just say it's an ""in between"" game. You play as one of Handsome Jacks henchmen and discover what eventually led to his turning to the dark side. Okay, not star wars, but the ""turning"" aspect or ""corruption"" felt very similar. You start out by working with a cheerful happy-go-lucky employee of Hyperion, and see him slowly descend into a paranoid power hungry shell of his former self.Controls: The controls feel pretty much the same as Borderlands 2, or generic FPS's, WASD to move, mouse to move the camera, keyboard rebinding is available, mouse wheel up or down to change weapons, or press 1,2,3,etc. I've always liked the controls in Borderlands games, simple straightforward, no keyboard piano playing.But wait! There is a few new changes! Namely Gravity! If you're outside of a location that has artificial gravity (inside a ship, indoors, in a base, etc) you will float higher on your jumps. While definitely entertaining, and adding a whole new level of stress when you miss a long jump. (have you fallen into the abyss slowly? It's agony!)There's a new mechanic that you can also press CTRL (or whichever key you bind) to slam down onto the ground, or on top of enemies. A new gear slot will represent an air container which is necessary for all humans to survive in the vacuum of space but furthermore doubles as being used for double jumping in space. (You can jump once, then jump again at the expense of air)Enemies sometimes drop air canisters that will replenish some of your air, there are other locations where you can go to get oxygen filled up, buildings, and specific devices which create a force-field of air you can stand in.Progression: There are several sources you can get a sensation of progression in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. The most obvious representation of progression is by story progression or level progression. After you finish the story you can repeat the story again to continue leveling until you reach the cap.Or you can reroll another character, if you made the mistake of playing Claptrap on your first play through like I did. For those that don't know, even though claptrap is hilariously annoying vocally... he makes a terrible playable character, when you use your special ability you're basically rolling dice and the game tries to judge your situation for whichever vault hunter power to immitate.Unfortunately the game decided my situation required me to blow myself up 9 times out of 10. Yes I'm a bit salty about that. I don't use self destruction abilities in any video game really. So yeah, good times. It was fun hearing his cackling while I bounced on top of people, and it was nice not breathing air. Butttttt... I was a liability.Style/Graphics/Appearance: Borderlands doesn't try to aim for ""realism"" in their game assets, instead they stylize their characters, models, and textures. This is very good in the long run, because it increases the longevity of the games appeal. You don't need to jump into the most recent game to enjoy the newest aesthetics, they start to average out over all their games.Don't get me wrong, there is a sign of improvement from game to game, but the style they use stays very uniformed rough and ""Borderlands-y"".Price/value/game time played:Borderlands: The Pre-sequel is priced at $39.99, and the game with the season pass is priced at $69.99. If you're an achiever you will need to get the ""Holodome Onslaught"" and ""Claptastic Voyage"" DLC to earn 100%. At the time that I'm writing this review I've played 36 hours of Borderlands: The Presequel. That number will definitely change, there is still plenty to do, so you can definitely get your moneys worth out of game time.Conclusion:All in all, I've enjoyed what I've experienced with Borderlands: The Presequel, It's been most fun playing it with friends. I've enjoyed ""flying"" around (okay, it's not really flying, it's 'falling with style'.) and as I so eloquently imaged it ""Mario Butt Pounding"" the NPC's.In a way the game feels shorter then it's predeccessor (borderlands 2, man this ""pre-sequel nonsense is complicated, isn't it?), so if you're looking for the best quality borderland games, this one doesn't have too much to offer outside of a couple new gimmicks and a few new playable characters. Story-wise, it's definitely worth it and very interesting! This game makes me want to own Jacks Hyperion Jacket. (Why doesn't Borderlands have a clothing line?)In conclusion, I'm not sure what to tell people, It's borderlands 2 ...in space! If you like borderlands, if you enjoy FPS, if you like the humor in the game series, you'll love this game just like borderlands 2.			"

												First of, I've seen A LOT of downtalk and ""DON'T BUY THIS"" warnings from other reviews.Which is why I've been hesitant to try this game untill recently, despite having thoroughly enjoyed Borderlands 2.But after having played it for 30 hours, and completed the entire campaign + side missions and DLC, which only took roughly around 30 hours... I honestly found it just as good as Borderlands 2.Story missions feel more interconnected and relevant to one another. Gives a proper feeling of necessity.Unlike some of BL2's missions which felt like they were dragging out the story as much as possible for gamelength, as well as sending you on sidetracked tasks when there is a very obvious and easier alternative.However that does not necessarily mean the story was more well-made. Honestly I cannot say which was the better of the two, as I enjoyed both games equally.Which should not be a surprise, as the Pre Sequel's template is literally a copy+paste of BL2.Though solo-play suffers from the same downsides that every Borderlands game has. Far more difficult (or far too easy) with certain classes and/or builds than others. Singleplayer combat is sometimes very unfair.As is the utterly contrived player-on-player duel system.I consider this game to be neither a step-down nor a step-up from BL2. It is simply the same game, but a different setting, different--and to me, slightly better--story and with a tiny few extra mechanics.Like the oxygen management, gliding and slamming, and cryo element are introduced exclusively in this game and makes things a little more interesting. But ultimately irrelevant to making it the game it is. Would still like the game without it.But I must urge people to avoid buying it (or the season pass) at full price. Though it is just as good as BL2, it is noticably lacking in terms of side content and DLC. Regrettably I did pay the full price of the basegame + season pass.On the subject of season pass, I must once again iterate that it is not worth the full price.The two additional characters were not all that interesting to me. Especially the Doppelganger which feels like just a way to get quick cash from making a popular character playable.And 2 of the 3 playable DLCs are just repetitive 5 rounds Arenas identical to BL2's Fink Slaughterhouse. Which were featured in the game as sidequests, part of the basegame, not an overpriced DLC.The final DLC however, Claptastic Voyage was fantasticly entertaining with a story that connects with its chronological sequel. But as expected, it was also disappointingly short. Buying it standalone however is worth it, unless you already got the season pass.7/10 "

												I can not put my finger on it, but when playing the game it does not have the same desire to carry on playing. Yes there are cool new characters to play, but there is not the same humour or atomsphere like Borderlands 2. I think that this game took most of the bad aspects of Borderland 2, as it constantly has the same enemies but reskined and bullet soaked bosses which take lots and lots of grinding to get beat with ease.

												Borderlands: The pre-sequel is the third installment of the Borderlands series. Unlike the previous Borderlands games, TPS does not take place on Pandora, but on the moon which is called Elpis. If you've played Borderlands 2, you would know that TPS share a heavily resemblence of it with the same graphic engine and UI so many vetaran fans would picked up the game right away. Following the tradition, you have the option to select four playable characters/classes with two more coming on the way as DLCs. You'll discovered some new and old faces NPCs and get to know their story. Get ready to play as the bad guys along with Jack, the man who will eventually becomes Handsome Jack in Borderlands 2.Let's talk about the new gameplay mechanic. There are two enviroment areas that you should be familiar with. They're called Atmosphere and Vaccum. Atmosphere is a area with oxygens. If you're in this area, your O2 gauge won't deplete, but your jump mobility will be limited. Unlike in the previous installment, you can only ignite enemies in an area with an atmosphere.  Vaccum is a area with no oxygens. If you're in this area, your O2 gauge will deplete over time unless you're playing as the Fragtrap, but your jump mobility will be much greater. Once you get a Oz kit, you will gain the ability to ""double jump"". Oz kit also allowed you to do a slam attack by jumping mid-air and holding crouch will do a AoE damage around yourself so it's a good way to get enemies with melee off your back. If you run out all of your O2 gauge , your health will drain over time regardless of your shield, but not to worry, there are oxygen and atmosphere areas that will replenish your O2 gauge. TPS also introduced the Cyro elemental that freezes  your enemy and immobilize them temporary. What's great if you freeze a enemy in the air, watch them fall down and shatter into pieces if they've taken enough damage from the fall. Last but not least lasers are a new type of guns that comes in various forms. They can take many shapes like assault rifles, shotguns, and sniper rifles and they all use the same ammo. Last but not least, you can use the grinder to dispose three of the same quality guns that you don't like and it will pop out a new gun with the same or better quality. What you get is depend on what kind of recipe you've used so becareful on using the grinder. In conclusion, BLTPS is a great game and it lives up to the name of Borderlands, but it does have flaws and many bugs including gamebreaking ones. Some NPCs will take forever to finish up their echo conversation and it's a pain to wait for them to shut up until you could do your next objective. There are time when you have to backtrack many times to complete side quests and you could get easily lost until you become familiar with the areas. If you guys are Borderlands fans, but you're worry about the price and you're afraid the developers didn't put in enough efforts to make a illegitimate game, then perhaps it's better for you to wait for a price drop or the inevitable GOTY edition. BLTPS story ties the knot of the events of BL1 and BL2 really well. You will see and understand a different side of Jack and why he became the vicious villain that we all loved to hate, Handsome Jack.			"

												The game is pretty neat. It's Borderlands 2 and 1/4. There are some new features like oxygen masks and laser guns which enrich gameplay. The world (moon) is a bit boring but if you enjoy the gamplay then it's not a problem. The storyline is alright, we get to know Jack's story and we help him get his army. Big + for 'Claptastic Voyage' which is a very good DLC. Playing inside Claptrap, talking to his consciousness, fighting with bugs and glitches and batling Claptrap's 'bad' side is just awesome. Also there's a tough boss fight which is always goodCan't wait for Borderlands 3!			"

												This game suprised me. I was not expecting it to be as good as it is. The story line is great, asnwering questions you might have had from the Borderlands games 1 and 2, as well as opening up more questions (maybe the DLCs will shed further light).I like the low gravity aspect - I was worried about playing with low grav at first, but it's fun and doesn't impede gameplay. The butt slam is a favourite. Plenty of new weapons, with Cryo being a replacement for slag in some ways. Vending machines have many Legendary items, so it's worth checking them wherever you go. They're in the machines more often than as weapon drops. Lasers are a nice addition to the game too.The characters are interesting to play, each of them have a nice unique blend of options, and I think they're well balanced.Some of the side missions are a pain, causing you to retrace your steps, but there's not too many like that, and a lot of side missions can be skipped if you're not interested in the lowly weapon rewards. Good for XP and Moon Stones (like eridium from BL2). There are way too many bugs in the game, some that were ported from BL2 and some new ones; hopefully these will be addressed though I don't hold my breath.Overall I really enjoy this game, more than I expected to, and am looking forward to Playthrough 3 when it becomes unlocked. Also looking forward to more content in the DLCs.			"

But as a Borderlands fan, I have to say it's not as good as BL2, overall. Here are what I've realized so far. Pros:1. low gravity and jump pad system, which makes combats more flexible and three-dimensional. 2. brand new atmospheric environment3. more interactions between NPCs and your character4. novel laser weapons and cryo element5. better item scaling, which is like Borderlands 16. moral dilemma, no longer good/evil binary boundery7. novel grinder (a new way to get high/rare quality items)Cons:1. Laser weapons are overpowered , which makes other types of weapons more or less useless, which narrows down weapon selection. 2. less extensive contents (main story, enemies and environments)3. limited looting, legendary farming has been swtiched from boss farming to vendor machine farming, which isn't as resonable as BL 2 imo. and raid boss is lack of originality. 4. less dramatic main story5. way less explorable map as BL2, while still much time wasted on covering the mission path (running/jumping from mission spot A to B). Others: 1. The combat is way less intense than BL 2.2. same humors as usual Conclusion:$60 is a bit expensive for it, but it's still a good game compared with many junks with the same price on Steam. Wait and grab it until sales and it'll make you worthwhile.			"

												Would be great game, mabey, I think, except for the glaring Marooned quest that leaves me Marooned waiting for non-existant players in an offline no network game. Try looking aroudn for the magic fudgery to get around it and apperntly it's not even google worthy. Fix your game bwefore you release it.			"

I'm only 3 hours in at the moment of writing this and all the stupid accents, Jokes and other references is really starting to grate on my nerves just the things they say makes me face palm and ask WHY.

To sum things up though I wish there was a maybe button for this game because its not as good as Borderlands 2.			"

												This review is biased. (I enjoyed the first and the second game thoroughly).I would recommend this game. If you enjoyed the 2nd game, it is very similar to that game in regards to play style, weaponry, leveling and difficulty. The new additions in regards to different abilities between our vault hunters, the low gravity, and the ability to grind weaponry were enjoyable editions to the game. Put a good 100 hours into playing 3 of the characters (one of them of course being ClapTrap). I will say the best part of the game was the story in regards to learning about Jack and why he believes himself to be a hero. Knowing that he will become our villain in the seconds. In addition, I thoroughly enjoyed the ClapTrap DLC and how it tries to explain what happens to our favorite annoying robot between his revolution to the beginning of Borderlands 2.Only issue I would say is that there was not much change to the game play. Game play is good, but there are still broken aspects whether being weapon bugs, inability to be able to grind for certain weapons, or easily being destroyed at higher levels by a enemy / horde of enemies on solo when 4+ higher than you. (Part of the exponential difficulty and weapon changes).For me this game is still a 9/10. Because it is Borderlands.  "

												Ok.... well the game feels like the same experience as Borderlands 2, still fun and awesome. This time we know what happens to jack and fight at his side, there are new bosses tons of customizations, secondary missions, etc.The game worth full price? HELL ♥♥♥♥ING NO, and that is only because this game is a HUGE DLC of Borderlands 2, its at the same level at Tiny Tina's DLC, when i play Boderlands 2 and Borderlands 1 i never get bored but this time i do in several missions. If you are lookin for this game try to pick up with a huge discount because only worth $30, nothing more.PD: LILITH IS A F*CKING B1TCH AND DESERVE TO DIE.			"

												Many of you who will go to the comments will wonder whats wrong with the game. May you be a potential buyer or a gamer who has it and wants to see what other people think. let me elborate what is wrong with the game. 1) Humor is dead.- the jokes are flatlined and if its a sex joke the character saying will explain it to you. censorship is also in the game but not bleeped out instead with replacing words like b***h with  ""taint"". Characters will often use the term "" son of a taint"" which will drive you insane pretty damn soon. This is what makes borderlands engaing as it bring character to characters ( not a pun). you see non of that. The citizens of the city you go to as a main hub for suppiles and quest are dull. nothing they say or do is interesting. in bl2 they were amusing at times but annoying. that aleast made them noticable. Character devolpment is slow and empty as they rely one every new characters sense of humor to be the character for them 2) Story.-the story supossedly follows handsome jacks rise to power in the hyperion corpartion to become the CEO, madman and all around smartass we all know and love from BL2. We however see little of that he wants to build a robot army to fight the lost legion and take heilios the station. most of the central story ACTUALLY REVOVLES AROUND YOU DOING FETCH QUEST AND PREPARING TO HELP JACK ROBOT ARMY RATHER THEN ACTUAL FOCUSING ON JACK HIMSELF. Thats right. And guess what? NO ANGEL. Thats the problem with this game as its shows in BL2 that jack used angle to trick roland and co. to open the vault. in this game we see the erdidum explosin on pandora and get to meet liltih and roland on the moon just for them to tell us to♥♥♥♥♥♥off . so where angel in all of this? why did jack trick them into opening the vault when he wasnt even ceo of hyperion? major plot hole. -little time is fousced on jack and we do see his ugly side from time to time but nothing to show his moralty and insights and personality changing to more chaotic or justifying evil with good intenions until the end when he becomes handsome jack. there was almost no character devolepment into jack and more put into the commander of the lost legion as she has over a dozen autologs on elphis to find and several missions on her background. but non for jack unlike in bl2. Jack is also so... so BORING. His jokes arent funny, he only talks when for filler converstations or for objectives and he only had one good moment in the story where he actually made an effort to show emotion. This is frighting to me. Jack was one of the best things in the borderlands series and his writing has been declining since tiny tinas dlc.-Absouletly terrible pacing, the worst ive seen in a games story so far.-rarely any plot twist and all dont have the drama or flare as in the past3) characters-the ruined moxxi by dropping her whole character. no flirts. no intuendos. no charm . just sighs and complaints with one intersing mission with her background.-no new characters are memorable enough-they toke out all the humor and charm in the bl characters are suppose to have and ignored that for new characters.they are just... there. little humor and jokes from them.-pickle. tiny tinas replacement in the game is with you for a good quarter of the game. hes GTG. voice is annoying as heck as hes attmepting to act like a english or british gentlemen with terms like wot and chin wag. non of the zeal of intersesting personality and is devoid of humor( or good humor) gameplay-Sexulaity. Few characters in this game are gay or oversexualized but when they are 2k austrailia is constantly reminding you. Janey springs is consantly stating how "" Shes not into guys"" and is always hitting on athena if you play her. Several other characters do this as well and when you decide to base your characters almost soley on their sexuality, thats just horrible writing.- loot systems sucks as you only get purples on missions and in gold chest- almost the exact same as bl2 this is just the negative and its incomplete. ill post another review to cover more later			"

												Borderlands: Great vanilla game. Gameplay and character ""classes"" were solid, fun, and had obvious roles.Borderlands 2: Great addition to the series. Better story. Each of the characters trees added a slighly different to the character, with some characters able to fill different roles. (range/melee/support/tank). One con to this game was that the non-dps trees felt a little lack luster, like more time was put into designing more ways to mow down foes.Borderlands Pre-sequel: Story pretty good, but not on the same level as Borderlands 2. Low gravity wasn't a bad idea, added some different gameplay elements, but was used way to much. With you either getting way to used to it and try and jump high while inside or being thankful that you are inside for less gimicky gameplay. However, Cyro-elemental weapons were a great addition for crowd control and shatter damage on weaker oponents.I also thought the non-dps trees were given far more love in this game. Tanks getting more than just HP increase and damage reductions. Like being able to increase the resistences  of you and your party when hit with a status affects and splash it back on your enemies.Support trees can help keep the group alive without fully relying on their action skill to heal or rez someone quickly. Overall. Borderlands 2 had a better story. Borderlands pre-sequel had better character class design.Hope for the future of the Borderlands series is to add more active skills. Atm with all three games the there is only the action skill and melee overrides.			"

												So far, Borderlands Presequel did something I admire. It took a risk. Borderlands 0 also illustrates a point I as a gamer, feel fails to be understood by the day to day devs: While we may not like your boss and studios direction, that does not mean we as gamers have a negative view of the people who work on a big studio game. In spite of the handicaps a publisher may lay upon you, it isn't personal when we dislike a work of this caliber.I feel that my/our dislike of forced sequels sometimes comes off as an affront to those that busted their butts in the hellish crunches that make up the life of your average studio employee/work for hire. This is far from the truth. In spite of the system that often squirts out derivative works to cash in on an IP, we do indeed respect and recognize your hard work.2K Australia took a chance on trying to humanize an arguably annoying bad guy in an argubaly annoying and bland story. Many people loved the second game in the series, I was not one of them. It had the coda of being fun* Fun with a friend, and even then it could have numerous low points. One need only look at the works of former designers from this publisher and others to see the difference. As for this game, it is entertaining enough with friends.			"

												Weak follow up Borderlands title but still playable. Gameplay is still smooth even with new game mechanic additions. (Low gravity, Cryo element, Lazer guns)Lazer guns are AWESOME!Story gets stale rapidly. Typical plot scenarios, no twists as story progresses, horrible climax and ending was dissapointing.So much Aussie  references that most people wouldn't understand. Sidequests aren't fun as it used to be in previous titles. They're quite meaningless other than the rewards. Horrible map design. Navigating some maps could be infuriating as heck with the addition of low gravityI would recommend this game to fans of the Borderlands series who's tired of replaying the previous titles while waiting for the next one. TL;DR  It's Borderlands 2 on the moon but with the story written by a monkey and the map designer was an infant child. Also, lazer guns because why the ♥♥♥♥ not?!			"

												A dry husk of repetition.PREFACEThe first Borderlands came out years ago. It was new in tone and gameplay and it was a lot of fun, despite some problems. By today's standards, I think we should know better by now and should have improved. A lot of the problems in the first Borderlands plague its sequels. Play your first Borderlands game. Play a second one for more of the same. Don't play a third. Take the amount of hours you've played in Borderlands 1 and 2. That's how long you've already been playing this game.+++PROS+++If you happen to like Borderlands, then this is more of the same. It's at least that.The new frost element is much funner to use than slag.---CONS---STORYIt doesn't feel very good to play characters who are so unlikably cruel. A lot of people have a taste for sadism, but usually as revenge or justice against wrongdoers; our characters seem unnecessarily uncaring. It also doesn't help that we're helping someone who we know is a jerk, and playing as some characters who we know will die deservedly in the next game. Our characters' motivations seem weak as well. We're there because... we were hired?On a small level, the story drags on and on, with predictable excuse after excuse to lengthen your adventure.On a larger level, we know what's going to happen, and don't even like the side we're fighting for. When you do a movie about nazi protagonists, you watch their side of the struggle, as they truly believe they are fighting for the good of their country, and you portray a new perspective that most people don't consider. This was not done here. The story is always delivered through expository audio dialogue, boring as the only way to get story. Then again, what else was supposed to be done? The story isn't very complicated or emotionally stressing, so there isn't much material for cutscenes with subtle and strong emotional animations, or set pieces showing the lives and personalities of people.The Borderlands series has also taken this bizarre twist in tone, with serious dramatic and political matters at hand while fabricating tragic deaths. This dramaticism clashes harshly with the game's silly dialogue. The dramaticism also feels unearned when crudely force fed through audio dialogue. The game keeps verbally telling me the way things are, not showing me; is this character kind hearted? Why don't they affect my gameplay? It could be argued that I'm being greedy, demanding masterpieces when I suppose audio dialogue could be enough, but I push for story and gameplay melding so that I'm paying attention and I care; I was just absent mindedly following waypoints and killing.The characters are not as memorable as they were in previous games. It seems the strategy was to just make a character with a new accent and a one sentence description. They don't even stick around for very long. I remember the cast of Borderlands 2, because they stuck with me the whole time, the whole city against this evil man.The humor is also getting worse. It seem that as long as you have people saying ridiculous things with no punchline, exaggeration, or surprise, it'll be funny. It's the kind of things you hear when you're playing multiplayer and someone decides to be a radio dj comedian, saying anything desperately hoping to be funny and popular.The recycled assets of Borderlands continue to build an unforgiving wasteland well, but other than that, the sense of the world isn't built very deeply; it's all just a 2d poster backdrop to your adventure. The citizens walk idly and never say much; they're not alive. The buildings themselves are not very memorable either, repeated cut and pasted spaces.GAMEPLAYRepetition, over and over. Shoot, walk, use, shoot, walk use. Pick up guns, sell. The elemental and RPG elements? They hardly matter. Just shoot critical points, pick the thing with the highest numbers, oh, keep a corrosive weapon for robots. It was fun the first game, getting better and better treasure.The open spaces. The maps are sprawling with empty space to lengthen your boring game time. The objectives are often placed in deceptively far off places, like on a super high cliff right next to you. It looks close on the map, bu you actually have to travel all the way around.You can get lost a lot, especially with all the vertical space that is not well represented on the map.The AI is still the same as always. Idle until aggravated, perfect aim at all distances, moving erratically with no turning animations to read movement. They're deceptively hard to shoot, dull, and annoying; flying enemies are worse. The low gravity and oxygen does not really add anything new to the game. In fact, it's just annoying to have to manage them.The design and balance seems sloppy. You can be a little more loose in design in PVE than in PVP, but this is just too sloppy. It feels as if players are just thrown into a mess of complications, without testing, without consideration for gameplay and strategy, and it's expected to be okay because, ""well, if they keep trying, they'll make it."" I've had skirmishes of enemies spawning all around me, sporadic cover, jump pads that didn't help, and enemies with rocket launchers while I still only had two weapon slots.Even the special abilities are less interesting. In Borderlands two, I could wait patiently for my cooldown, then pull out my skill that allowed me to engages waves of enemies. Now, I have to use my skill much more often to kill 1 or 2 people at best. I played as Nisha. Her skill is to, for a brief period, automatically aim at enemies and gain increased gun stats. A lot of her skill tree depends on her being able to get kills during this period; it's so brief and can hardly kill. The skill itself also functioned quite uselessly. As long as enemies were moving, none of my showdown bullets would hit. I would also lock onto enemies behind cover. I would aim at far away enemies rather than the ones right in front of me that I wanted to kill. If the enemy was posed in the right way, their head would be cocked to the side and all my bullets would miss.			"

												This is not Borderlands 3.  This is a very long Borderlands 2 DLC done by the B-Team.  It feels a bit lazy, but it's still a lot of fun.The Good: The story is interesting and there's a lot to do. There's four new playable characters and they're gender balanced (the game, as a whole, is excellent in that respect). Low gravity, butt-slams, lasers, freeze attacks and Australian in-jokes round out the new features.The Bad: There's not really anything bad. There's a few polygon tearing glitches, all minor.The Lazy: It's the Borderlands 2 engine, so if you were expecting something really new, this isn't it. The writing is not up to Borderlands 2 par. Character gestures are rarely customized resulting in them repeating the same generic ones while talking. There's not nearly the variety of enemies and locations as in Borderlands 2.The Weird: You can play as Claptrap!  SOLD!  Why wouldn't you want to play as a murderous, incompetant robot?  [Hint: you hate his voice.]  It's about as fun and stupid as you'd imagine.  His action skill is a random version of other Vault Hunter's powers, except done wrong.  Example: You can get two guns like the Gunzerker, but you never stop firing.  It gets a bit confusing when you're talking to other Claptraps.Compared to most FPS, it's excellent, and this is why I recommend it.  Compared to Borderlands 2, it's not quite up to par, but they set a very high bar.			"

												While the mechanics are slightly tuned from borderlands 2, and to great effect, it doesn't make a satisfying sequel. Positives:-Story does more than expected.  even though there's less than the second, it does a better job than I thought it would, and the humor wasn't bad either.-jump mechanicsthis is the small tweak I was talking about.  Although small, it makes a huge difference, the feel of gliding across a map unhindered, slamming down into opponents, and having more free movement is wonderful.  So much so I feel more games should have it.  If they make a sequel to the series, I hope they bring it back as a jetback or something, but with less of a limiting feature on the oxygen count, which is the only downside to this mechanic.  -charater personailtyanother small adjustment that has done leagues to affect the game positively.  Your character now has things to say, and responds to people, and events.  They even have some quick backstory to most of them that you can find throughout the story.-enemy variety this is something that it's predecessors didn't have, as I often found myself getting bored, or annoyed at the same old callouts over and over again.  Here it seems they bothered to record more dialogue for enemies so that it doesn't grate on you after a while, and it seems that the enemy types are at least as much as the last two games.-co-op gameplayalways a plus in this game, but not necessary to enjoy the game on it's own.  Although it does help quite a bit. Negatives:-Bugs out the♥♥♥♥♥br>You will run into a myriad of bugs in this game, from game geometry not working right, to MORE then frequent game breaking bugs.  When I first started the game I got locked out of one of the very first quests because a gate wouldn't open.  Later on I couldn't proceed in NG+ because a verbal exchange didn't go off so another door locked me out, I gave the game a break for a while when I was asked if I wanted to skip a segment of gameplay that I'd already done, and it gave the game a fatal error that caused it to crash everytime I said yes.-No player basefor a game that has a larger emphasis on online and co-op play, the player base is even smaller than borderlands 2 at release, maybe the pc crowd is waiting for it to go on sale, or maybe they're not keen on buying what looks and feels a bit like a souless cash in. -Game length is shortCompared to the length of the bas game of borderlands 2, I was severely discontented with the length of this game.  It's almost as short as the first game, and pales in comparison to the second. -lack of enviornmentsCompared to the second game, this game's enviornments are not nearly as varied.  Despite the fact that the second and first got more milage out with some really nice dlcs, this game does not even get close to their base game enviornments.  There is, hyperion moon base, the final area (which is really interesting but short), and an icy moon surface.  That's it.-looting systemThe loot system is slightly better than 2 but still not as good as 1, your only chance at finding good weapons and gear is either by grinding raid bosses(3 in the game) endlessly, or getting the items through a cheat device or a co-op partner.  You're not going to see anything of value out on the field, or in the vending machines.  Your only options are to boss fight and get lucky, or grind some weapons and hope you get something decent-mics don't work and connection problemsMics do not work properly in game, and connections will be unstable, despite good internet connections.  Something that was never a problem in the other games-garbage DLCFinally the dlc is lackluster, and overall disapointing, the one thing that borderlands NEVER did.  In the past, the dlc was both interesting, added new enviornments, good dialogue, more items, and SOMETIMES a new character.  In fact the initial game had a huge dlc campaign with a ton of new things, the second game had the same thing, but you were guaranteed four dynamite dlcs AND two extra characters, with other dlcs replacing the characters for the second season.Now for it's outrageous price you get nothing.  So far, we've gotten one good character, one lackluster character, and an arena.  And there's only ONE MORE DLC LEFT before the season is over.  It's probably going to be short and awful as well, and so far, none of these have served to extend the gameplay much more than an hour or two.  All in all, it's not worth full price.  If it goes on sale for 15$ for all of the content, then I'd say it's worth it.  But I wouldn't pay sale price plus the admission fee for dlc.  While I like the game, and think it's a step in the right direction in some ways, I do not believe for a second it should've retailed for this much, and should've sold at a more humble price at release.Wait for a sale if anything.

												After nearly 20 hours with the game, I've found that it's tough to separate the high-quality DLC that supported Borderlands 2 and The Pre-sequel. For most players, it's likely this new separate game will feel like an episodic update to the Borderlands 2 universe. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but the harsh reality is that it's a lot of the same.It's not the best Borderlands experience out there, but The Pre-Sequel is a solid entry that will satisfy Borderlands diehards most. If you've never played a Borderlands game though, try starting with Borderlands 1 or 2.GoodA fun shooter that can be played with friendsSome interesting platforming components with the glide mechanicKeeps the same shoot and loot mechanics we love from previous versionsBadThis game is less revolutionary and more iterative in design.side missions !!My Rateing  ِHints Score   Story 7.5/10   Gameplay 7.5/10   Music and Sound 8/10   Visual 8.5/10 Overall : 7.8 of 10 "

												Check out this new Borderlands 2 DLC. It adds 4 new characters, including Memetrap. I like how it automatically sets the graphics at 480p and turns off V-Sync and AA by default so it looks like a PS2 game. I also like how the collision detection occasionally doesn't work and money and ammo regularly fall through the floor10/10 wouldn't meme ever again. Only reason I have this is b/c it came with my graphics card.UPDATE 1: Against my better judgement, I have progressed a little more through the game and have found great new features, such as missions that completely change. This one time, I had to get some ECHO logs for someone and then before I could finish the mission, she told me to kill some random rock monster. It was great. Speaking of her, I like how progressive this game is and Janey Springs is a good example! Instead of just making a gay character, they decided to make her a creepy stalker and have every other line from her be about how she is gay. That's a realistic portrayal of a gay person. I also like how you only get 2 types of weapons until you enter Concordia and most of the weapons are terrible. What a wonderful game.			"

												It's still a fun Borderlands game, but not as great as Borderlands 2.  If you finished BL2 and the DLC and still want more, grab it.Pros:- Good fleshing out of characters backstories from BL2- Claptastic Voyage DLC has a great story- More vocal characters makes for better story immersion- Low gravity/cryo/oxygen are fun mechanicsNeutral:- Very Australian.  I'm Australian so I got all the jokes/references they were making, but by the same token they made up the majority of the jokes, so it got a bit old after a while.  If you're not well versed in Australiana you may just spend a lot of time wondering why things are in the game.- Broken skill trees:  Really easy to get very overpowered builds in BL:PS.  Can be fun, but might feel like it lacks challenge.Cons:- A lot of classic characters felt shoe-horned in so they could have appearances on Elpis- Only one decent story driven DLC			"

												If you liked BL2 and want more then play BL2 again, don't waste your money on this game.Its not terrible but compared to BL2 the writing is very usatisfactory and the pacing is just horrible. The new gun type, new element type and the Ozygen mechanic aren't tenough to save this basically subpar game.If there is a huge sale it may be worthwhile but even so I am struggling getting through the game as it is just not engaging, the only way I can play for more than one hour at the time is if I have the TV on at the same time so as not to be bored,			"

												This game was a huge dissapointment. How anybody can rate this game in a positive light has never played a Borderlands game before and I would even go as far as saying has never played a game before. There are huge gaps in the story, random invisible walls, stupid mechanics, an extrememly small amount of bosses and unrewarding loot. Let me start with the loot. I played this game with 3 other friends and we all played a different class. We saw 3 legendaries, 1 of them being from a vendor and the latest drop was around level 21. We found ourselves being extremely overwhelmed with the enemies strictly because we had no loot drops. All the crates and loot thingys around Elpis contained commons and greens, sometime an epic or two. But most of all we found ourselves grinding out money to afford to buy a weapon or grenade mods to kill whatever we needed to kill at the time. Next up are all the glitches in the game. There are random invisible walls all over the world in spots where you have a clear line of sight to a ledge or a cliff that will just stop you and make you fall to your death; there are gaps in which you must jump over with your vehicle but even with a boost going top speed youd make it 50% of the time. The rest of the time youre falling helplessly into lava pits. Elevators will randomly glitch out and keep going up and kill you, bosses jetison loot out of their bodies when you kill them only to find yourself chasing the loot into a black abyss of nothingness, thus losing the loot forever. The characters are probably the most disappointing thing to me. Athena and Claptrap by far talk the most, and even then its not that much. Wilhelm and Nisha say next to nothing which is dissapointing because they are Jacks right hand people in Borderlands 2. They never address very important plots holes (I will not say in fear of spoiling it for people), and the end of the game seems extremely rushed. In total there are about 9 bosses. All of which are just point and shoot with no mechanics whatsoever. The typical comedy in the Borderlands series falls short in almost every avenue. The only redeming thing was Claptraps typical quips. Other than that, nothing. Cringe worthy material that is sure to make anyone feel dumb and awkward. There are pop culture references in the game that are just God awful. So awful to the point I almost ALT+F4'd out of the game. Having put in hundreds of hours in Borderlands on 360 and hundreds of hours on Borderlands 2 I can say I lvoe this series. With the exception of this. It is terribly short (we beat the entire series in 16 hours) and that was doing side quests and messing around at some times. The raid boss is just a harder version of the final boss. Overall this was a HUGE dissapointment and I will probably never load this game up again. I am very sad.			"

												Ok the reason I am giving this game a Thumbs Down is for plenty of reason of which i shall List the pros and cons...Cons:-I have followed Borderlands since the beginning and grown accustomed to certain expectations of it, this definately does reach alot of them            -The story isnt quite great as i expected it to be            -Gearbox being a professional company who charges 60$ for a pre-sequel or whatever you expect no bugs and a solid playthrough sadly i run into bugs often-If you played Borderlands 2 or the first you would love characters such as Moxxi well they kill her character in this (not literally just as she acts and such)-The Enemies (minor thing that bugs me they gain health back right after you die even if they are in your spawn and are to op for you) other than that they often glitch run through walls etc. -Jack's character which seems to be the main reason this game was created (when instead they should have moved on) as been throughout the game (as of where i am) just checking off his personalities (random rage, sarcasim, etc.) -Some of the guns such as the lasers are often completely useless outside of iron sights, they shoot completely off to the side (which yes proly is the aiming of the gun) but no instead lets say you shoot a complete stream at someone it will just go completely through them it picks and chooses when it's going to do damage-Missions, Oh my god how it feels like they just copied and pasted half the missions and the pointless running of it all is ridiculous -This game should proly be rated E for Everyone because they not only bleep out cuse words but it just feels like a game i would have my younger sister play (she's like 7) which is ridiculous the humor seems beaten down and worn out like they lost almost all sense of humor. this is the kind of game im ashamed of laughing at the childish moments, it's bad really the humor is anyways-A re-used Engine for the game which really isn't a con just goes to show they were trying to make a quick buck before the next game so it seems (And I bought into it) alot of it is copied just added new weapons and new textures ( a waste of a team instead of working on Borderlands 3)-they bring in replacements for the characters from the first 2 games like scooter and Zed yet they cant replace a villain who is dead already (maybe im just ragging becasue this seems to be a fix for people who cant seem to wait which will proly kill alot of hype for the next game) The pros:-It is off pandora which was beginning to feel old and used up-The characters that you play can actually talk now which isnt that big a deal but its the details that matter to me-The story nonetheless is somewhat intriguing just poorly written-Scenery is a nice change, If you think Borderlands 2 was full of color well this game jesus can hurt my eyes after awhile just of the pure intensities of the color -No matter what to me at least it seems that I can never step away from borderlands no matter how frustrated i can get it has that draw-the claptraps are back now in the first one they didnt talk all as much and all seemed the same (they are robots but hey i like diversity) but in this one it seems every single claptrap has a different personality, Still abused as hell always is a joy to see that XDAs I progress through the game I will post any changes of feelings towards the game, which might just get worse. I am not very far and these are my observations of it so far.			"

												I really tried, but in the end though this just wasn't the Borderlands game for me. I love Borderlands 2 to bits. There are just too many elements here though which don't come together in the same way Borderlands 2 did for me.Perhaps more than anything else, the writing really grated on me in a way that just didn't go away. Rather than adjust to the differences, it felt like it was trying to be another Borderlands 2 but missing the mark by a wide margin. But it was more than that. The environments were just bland. The ""graphics"" were of course at parity with the previous game, but the art and design completely failed to inspire me.Without any engagement in the story, or excitement to explore the environments, I just felt like I was wasting my time with the Pre-Sequel. The jumping and oxygen depletion systems added nothing of value to me, so it was essentially the same shooting in an inferior package.I will say that I've had similar sentiments when it comes to the the Borderlands (1&2) DLCs that I've played, which is admittedly not all of them. But if you liked most or all of the DLCs from previous Borderlands games then my experience with the Pre-Sequel may well be a very poor guide.			"

												Maybe I've just grown out of the Borderlands franchise, having played the two previous releases for hundreds of hours total, but this one is the worst of the bunch. The jokes aren't funny. Many of the quests, hell, most of the quests I've run so far have had really lame characters, sometimes to the point of being insulting. There are some neat dynamics here, like the grinder machine and laser weapons, but I'm just not having fun.I miss the zombies. I miss the heavily armored dudes that required some serious acid and fire. And I stupidly selected a character whose special ability just removes my need to aim. So I *never* use it. But I bought this on sale, so I can't complain too much. And I'll probably keep playing it...			"

												It's just Borderlands 2 with a couple of new things tacked on. While I suppose one could argue that Borderlands 2 is basically just Borderlands 1 with a couple of new things tacked on, effort was actually made to make Borderlands 2 look and feel like a different game.Seriously, this game should have just been an expansion pack for Borderlands 2. While it may technically have enough content to qualify as a $60 Triple-A title, it seriously lacks innovation and thus can't be properly justified as a standalone title, and ESPECIALLY not as one placed on a pedistal next to great video games like Borderlands 1 and Borderlands 2.Unless you are just kinda looking for more Borderlands, steer clear of this title. Really not worth your time.			"

												6/10 - This game feels a lot like just a big addon for BL2, which in and of itself wasn't that bad of a game. This game DOES add a lot of new things to the experience to freshen it up a bit. I feel like the game relies a bit too much on its sense of humor as a selling point. Honestly as a successor to the previous game, I felt as though this was a let down, let alone the price of it. Game play is still solid, shooter at its core. May revise this depending on how the DLCs that inevitably will come out do. All in all nothing too new here, didn't feel like it was worth 60 bucks.EDIT: After having had a chance to more thuroughly play this game and feel it out, I'm revising my previous score of 6/10, I now give this game a 4/10. Between the amount of hindering glitches from the previous game they left in (mostly in the UI), the inclusion of new ones (mostly graphical that I've seen at this point), and the removal of some beneficial ones, it has become obvious to me that they made no honest attempts at playtesting this game outside of the already known bugs that gave us an ""unfair edge on the game"", and giving little to no thought or care of the bugs that impeded us in the previous game (Ex: The UI bug in bl2 where it would jump to the opposite end of the list you are selecting if you attempted to interact with it too quickly). In addition to this, the AI feels the same in how annoying it was in bl2 where their pathing and movement was generally braindead until you got put into fight for your life, at which point every enemy within range would make a direct beeline for cover, sometimes as I've noticed, even clipping through walls and floors to do so, this made the combat feel tedious at times, and outright unfair at others. They also essentially remade the BNK3R fight from bl2 which I had a personal distaste for, if only because there were periods of anywhere from 2-5 minutes at a time where the boss would not even come into range of attack putting you in a deadlock of dealing with enemies and dodging mortar rounds from the boss that you could not hit. While they fixed not being able to hit the boss for this one, they made its attacks much more damaging, gave it more health from the looks, and threw in harder enemies to fight between phases, all of this is compounded with the fact that I found ammo to be scarce in this fight, constantly putting me in a position of buying ammo, or leaving the area to go find more. In general this game offers nothing new that is any good beyond laser weapons, zero gravity, and the cryo element which just feels like a slag that stuns. The story was a decent link between games however, but not enough to make up for its shortcomings.EDIT 2: I feel as though I may have been too harsh with the review. All of these things I still hold to now, however I no longer feel as though they are as much of a detriment to the experience as I initially gave credit for. In all of it's shortcomings, it is still a Borderlands game. That being said, several changes and patches were made to this game to this point in time, a lot of these changes were bad, some were subsequently good to fix them, and public accounts from the devs were made that tweaked some members of the Borderlands community a certain way. Social media stuff aside, these changes IN THE END helped improve the game to a certain extent. With that in mind, what will likely be the final revision in my score is now 5/10. I still do not recommend it over BL2, but if you are looking for a fresh experience, provided you take it with a grain of salt, you may enjoy this game.			"

												It's quite hard for me to give this game a just review.I really enjoy the game, though I don't enjoy it as much as Borderlands 2, maybe after playing that for a couple hundred hours, the gameplay feels a little worn out.I think that's because the game is almost identical to Borderlands 2, don't expect any revolutionary gameplay changes or a lot of new features. It really feels like a big DLC, with a new story and new characters to play as.I don't like the characters (neither NPCs nor playable ones) as much as the ones from Borderlands 2, but then again, maybe that is because I played Borderlands 2 so much.What I did like was the hole space and vacuum atmosphere, it's done quite well, you have low gravity and a ground stomp attack to use against enemies. Downside: You have to make sure your oxigen supply doesn't run out (unless you're Claptrap)You got laser guns to go along with the space theme, which are kinda cool, too.Elements still work the same as in Borderlands 2, though there is no Slag - it has been replaced with Cryo weapons, which can be used to freeze enemies solid which then increases Melee damage, explosive damage and critical damage - not exactly like slag, but similar.I'm not sure about the dialogues (your character talks now, too), but at least when playing Claptrap, it's pretty funny and the humor is definitely still there.Though I didn't enjoy the game as much as Borderlands 2, I can't say that it's a bad game, so I'll definitely give it a thumbs up!

Posted: October 5, 2016
												First, one of the big reasons I put off buying ""Borderlands:  The Pre-Sequel"" for so long was all the reviews complaining that it's nothing but a DLC of ""Borderlands 2.""  Well, after finishing my first run-through, I've got to say that's horse-pucky.  That first play-through took me 90.6 hours (and I'm still slightly less than half-way through the Achievements (though I've got most of the Badass Challenges done)).  Yes, the game plays a whole lot like BL2, but that's not a bad thing since that game was so good.  But, this is a whole new environment with an entirely new story that fills in the back-story for BL2.  It's definitely stand-alone and definitely worth the money.Now, I also have quite a few gripes with the game:- The pacing of the missions needs a lot of work.  The main story missions are excruciatingly long.  Yet, many of the side missions are totally trivial (for instance, closing a window, for goodness sakes).  Slightly shorter core missions and longer side missions would be nice.- The game's suspense factor needs a lot of work.  Very early in the game, we get a type of Sword of Damocles hanging over us.  It continues to hang there for most of the game.  It would have been nice to have the game progress towards that suspense point as we progressed through most of the story.- Some of the major areas are just too darn big.  I suppose if you're a person who just bulls through the game without exploring, that might be OK.  But, for me (who likes to explore and get all those Badass Challenges), it's really frustrating.- There are a LOT of missible Badass Challenges and Achievements.  It's extremely frustrating to get through an area, take a look at the Badass Challenges and see you've missed some and that there's no possibility of getting them until you re-play the whole game with the same character.- It takes far too long to open up the 3rd and 4th weapon slots (27 hours (""Intelligences of the Artificial Persuasion""), and 48 hours (""Home Sweet Home""), respectively)- Similarly to the earlier games, the weapon drops are almost never at my level (usually, they are 4 or more levels below me).  About the only time I ever get decent weapons is from the SHIFT code chest.- A darn high percentage of the Cult of the Vault symbols are really hard to find.  But, that's tolerable.  Unfortunately, one of them is positioned in such a location that it's almost impossible to reach.  It took me two hours and over a hundred runs to do the platforming needed to reach it.- The ""To Arms"" side mission is poorly thought out.  It requires you to fetch a boatload of white-grade weapons.  Unfortunately, I didn't start that mission until I was level 17 and white grade weapons didn't drop all that often at that point.  The mission should have caused the mobs you have to kill for the mission to actually drop them.  Instead, they drop almost nothing.- I don't know if it's an Australian English issue or just an inability to use words, but some of the Badass Challenge descriptions make no sense.  For instance, one says you have to shoot a ""target.""  It's not a ""target.""  It's a circle (perhaps a headlight).  Another wants you to take an ""elevator.""  It's not an ""elevator.""  It's a tram or cable car.  Spending time looking for things that aren't there isn't fun.- And, finally, even though we've got some kind of personal recorder in our inventory (which it turns out we can sell without problem), there's no way to replay ECHO recordings.  I can't count the number of times I missed those recording because some other event caused a conversation to pre-empt it.That's a lot of complaints.  But, still, the game was fun and is certainly long enough to be worth it.  It's not as good as BL2, but it's sure good enough.			"

												Of course you will get those elitists that will say Borderlands 1 was the best and nothing can hold a candle to it (especially this, for how much flak they are giving it now).I'll cut to the TL;DR version.It's not that bad at all, granted it runs off of the Borderlands 2 engine which is why tons of people feel...unsatisfied to say the least. Plenty of new weapons (as well as some fan favorite returning ones), abilities, new playable (but familiar) characters, missions, and elements to be able to have fun with. Witness the rise of Jack as well as his mental downfall.Some wouldn't warrant paying full price for this, I would and I did.BUT, what I would recommend is getting this during a sweet deal (as well as if you can pick up the season pass for a sweet deal). If not and you can't justify paying full price for either Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and/or the Season Pass, then wait for the Game of the Year edition (with all, if not most, DLC bundled) for either full price or during a deal (depending on what you think of the other 2 DLC that has yet to be released at the time of this review).One way or another I recommend this game (elitists be damned if they don't like my review along with this game).

												Well, it's a good game. I've gotten nearly 100 hours out of it so far, so I suppose I can't say I haven't gotten my money's worth. But honestly I would recommend waiting until it goes on a deeper sale and/or the base price drops significantly. It is the weakest of the three Borderlands games so far. A release-day base price of $40 might have been more reasonable based on the amount of content compared to the previous games in the franchise.So far the Season Pass has been a real disappointment. I would unreservedly NOT recommend the Season Pass until it is much cheaper.  In BL2, it was four full story expansions with story missions and side quests. So far the Pre-Sequel's Season Pass has included the Handsome Jack character add-on and the Holodome Onslaught challenge, which I admittedly haven't finished yet. Plans have been announced for the remainder of the Season Pass to be another character and one (and only one) story expansion. Of course they never really promised four massive story expansions...Don't get me wrong - I've had tons of fun playing it, but I think more of that was getting together with my Borderlands buddies online again than the actual game content. It is a good game; if you like Borderlands-style gameplay, it is an eventual must-have, but there are other games to play until this one comes down to a more reasonable price.			"

												I'll keep a TL;DR version up top.  My review in a nutshell...Do you hate Borderlands?  Don't buy this.Do you love Borderlands? KEEP THOSE GOOD MEMORIES. DON'T BUY THIS. SERIOUSLY.(And if you're questioning the 400 ""positive reviews"" - keep in mind this.  At the time of writing this, for GLOBAL ACHIEVEMENTS, 75% of people have the achievement for hitting level 5.  Only 25% have the achievement for hitting level 10.  They aren't even playing the game, just snapjudging.  PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE.)[[-- If you still feel like playing this mess, I'll add some game-breaking bugs at the bottom of this review. Maybe it'll salvage it for you. --]]Waited a long time for this to come out, friends all took off from work and got together to binge this game to death - having loved the first two Borderlands.After the first 3 hours, the characters were forgettable, story was .. whatever and none of us seemed willing to say anything yet.  Scared it was just us.After 4 hours, we all looked at each other and went, ""This kind of sucks."" One of us held out saying, it's still early.After 7 hours, that last person gave in and agreed this was pretty bad.We went to sleep at this point.The next morning we completed this unpolished turd.  None of us want to even try a second playthrough.  It was one of the most unsatisfying experiences we've ever had in a co-op game.  The only fun that was had were the jokes we were making between ourselves.This is an overpriced DLC - and that's being generous.  As a DLC, it falls short of Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep.  That had more interesting writing, varied areas and weapons.The oxygen mechanic is horrible and tacked on.  You get so much oxygen tanks that it doesn't matter, it seems it's only there to be annoying.The ""Butt Smash"" is a nice brake-mechanic, but as an offensive move - it's just tossing you into melee range so you can be killed easier.The damage is horribly balanced.  There are two types of enemies, normal ones and ""Badass"" ones.  The former killing you in 3 hits, the latter killing you before they've seen you.  AND THIS IS PLAYTHROUGH ONE.  It felt like the level range of 51-60 in Borderlands 2. Loot? What loot.  The only decent loot we found were from the automatic purples we got from Shift Keys. (Which were also bugged, seems everytime we stepped up to the machine we got another set of 5.)-------------------Bug 1:  Play Nisha.  Spec middle tree down to having double pistols.  Now equip a pistol so you have two out.  Now respec... to anything.  Ta-da.  You now keep your two pistols!  (Until you log out.)  Unlike before, you can use your Right-Click to fire your second gun instead of Zoom in with one gun.  Seems like they did a bad job modifying Salvadore's active skill here.Bug 2: ONLY WORKS IN MULTIPLAYER, WHEN NOT HOSTING.  It has to do with how the client updates to the host. Anyway ... Any melee over-ride skill while using a free spin scroll mouse.  (This works in Borderlands 2 also, with Maya's Slag Bomb thing. I mean.. it's the same engine and all.)  I've only tested this with Nisha in this one though.Anyway, spec yourself to Lightning Whip in left tree.  Set your melee skill to mouse-scroll-up or down.  Spin that mouse.  Ta-da!  You'll use it like 5-10 times per use.  (It's hard to see with Nisha, but you'll notice a lot more tendrils of lightning.)  It's easier to see in BL2 when she fires out 10 slag bombs at once.Enjoy..  Sort of.			"

												I don't think the game is really worth the current pricing. With a discount though, it's probably worth it. Here's why: Poorly balanced, just as bad if not worse than Borderlands 2. I still play BL2, mostly because I have friends to play with, but nobody I play with thinks that getting downed in 2-4 hits feels fair. In BL:TPS this doesn't seem any different. The higher level you get, the stronger the issue seems to become, especially if you're having bad luck with loot drops, i.e. having less of a fighting chance. Bosses are few in my opinion and they almost don't feel meaningful, even though they're supposed to have a major relevance in the story's development. Bosses are also, again, poorly balanced. They often have minions that join the battle, presumably so you can get second winds if you go down, but they almost do the opposite because of their own individual power. The last and before-last bosses atleast had some ""loot explosions"" but I must have been extremely unlucky because most of it was junk, this despite the fact that I had really crappy equipment, many levels out-dated, which made me struggle to do the actual fights. The story was good for the most part, but it feels rather short and the way the characters evolve is predictable (somewhat understandable) but I just think there could have been - a lot - more character development. Oh, right, and almost everyone that isn't a character of some importance has an australian accent, which seemed to get old a little fast for people who watched me play through. Interface. Everything is the same as BL2, which isn't bad by itself, but the BL2 UI had some ergonomic issues - such as the poor handling of the way the interface ""slants"" and panels block each other - and had a few glitches that haven't been fixed, like one that happens when scrolling through the backpack. In addition, the way Eridium is just translated into Moonstone is a bit unimaginative, as it serves the exact same purpose, and the story explanation doesn't feel good enough to me. Of all the Borderlands games, this has to be one with the worst bugs. Mobs go THROUGH the floors, walls, ceilings, whatever! At certain parts of the game I had to start areas over because of this as they made completing certain sections impossible. I've read that even you, the player, can fall through the ground but I didn't experience this personally. Sadly zones feel too big and vehicles aren't useable in several zones, and in the ones that they are useable in, they have limited areas you'll manage to use them in. Very few fast travel stations in my opinion, considering how annoying it is to trek around. My biggest issue with the size of the zones though, is that if for some reason I needed to quit the game while doing the story bits in the larger zones, I'd get sent back to a stupid point that was possibly quite far from where I stopped playing.Overall the game was fun to play and the addition of the new element was ""cool"" (replaces slag from BL2 though) and the grinder added a bit of variety to the way you can go about getting or upgrading gear, although it feels slow and cumbersome, due to the way you will pile up even more stuff than usual in your backpack.But in the end, it feels more like an expansion of sorts for BL2 than an actual new game, still having ""old"" issues. In addition, the fact that the story content is kind of short makes all of the content in general feel kind of short to me, with all the side-missions being more or less equal to each other than they usually would be in the past. Perhaps things will get better with DLC.I'd like to recommend a ""Yes"" for this, but I can't. Too many little things.			"

												Not recommended if you are a big fan of the series. The story is dry and uninteresting and my buddy and I completed it in 13 hrs (not including the time we messed around in Concordia). Of course there is True Vault Hunter Mode but honestly we couldnt even force ourselves to attempt and go thru the boring story all over again... Just a let down after putting hundreds of hours in on BL1-2 on console.			"

												TLDR: The next installment in the Borderlands Franchise that doesn't achieve the same level of greatness that its predecessor did while asking for a whopping $70 Australian Dollars. Copied the guns straight from Borderlands 2 but none of the humor or storytelling that made Borderlands 2 a masterpiece. Also the Australian Voices feel really out of place.The main issues with this installment of the borderlands franchise is that it feels really lazy and unfinished in comparison to Borderlands 2 and even 1. With Borderlands 2, the game felt complete and it felt like a massive upgrade to Borderlands 1, the classes were crazy, heaps of new weapons and guns and loot, hilarious story and a blast to play through from start to finish and once you got to the end it felt like an awesome and complete experience and once the dlc came out it was like delicious extras on an already excellent game. Then the Pre - Sequal comes along, asking for $70 Australian Dollars which i believe was more than Borderlands 2 was asking for when it came out and fails to come close with the humor or enjoyability of the previous games, and once i pushed myself to endure the crappy australian accents that don't flow well at all with the characters and feels really out of place and the boring quests that require you to go from A to B to C back to A, I found and excellent end boss that was actually fun to fight and felt like old Borderlands and that was it. I believe that the Pre Sequel is much shorter than Borderlands 2 with a lot of the length coming from quests that require you to go to one side of the map and back again and to add insult to injury, a lot of the weapons are taken straight from Borderlands 2 in both name and design. In the end the game feels dull and boring in comparison the Borderlands 2 and feels incredibly unfinished, future DLC may make the game feel complete and enjoyable but no game asking for $70 or any amout should require DLC to make it fun. Save yourself the cash and wait for the GOTY editon to come out or when some dlc is out and the game is cheaper.			"

												Overall, a great game. I believe the hate generated to the game is just from the jackasses that think ""just because Admiral Bahroo didn't like it, that means I shouldn't as well!"". In all honesty, this is a great game, only if you go into the game with a clean slate. I've never watched a preview or had any knowledge of the game before buying it. I played the previous Borderlands, and enjoyed them. When I got TPS, I got it on sale for about $30 (season pass included). The game does exactly what a ""Pre-sequal"" would do. It goes over alot of the characters and events that have been described in the previous games. The character developement is on an outstanding level. For example, one of the characters is Jack's doppleganger. Every skill tree at his disposal, is very unique and masterfully created to be used to force a playstyle that mimics the very personalities of ""the man who would be Jack"". All of the characters are a pleasure to play, except Claptrap (I haven't played him yet). The characters all feel very balanced, and because there really isn't an endgame like in BL2, the characters preform well in combat.The story felt much more rich and deep in a way when compared to BL2. This is because of the effort that was put into the individual characters. As the story progresses, Jack's personality changes, some characters like that, some don't. These small details are what determine the mentioned character's fates in a future timeline. If you pay attention to these small details in all of the games, you will recognize that all these details are well fitted into the game in a storyline that would make sense.I can think of so many good things about the game, however, no game is perfect. One of the flaws would have to be the oxygen mechanic and how it interacts with the fire elemental type. Because logically speaking, fire cannot burn without Oxygen. Alot of the combat is done in zero oxygen enviorments, therefore weapons that are fire elemental are less versitile and very situational. Another flaw to the game is the balance of laser weapons. Laser weapons are great, one of my favorite features about the game. The problem is that they are too good. I am not saying remove lasers because they are imbalanced, but I can't think of any situation where a laser weapon would be inferior to any other type of weapon. Another problem would be the story. I enjoyed the story and thought it was very enjoyable, but after playing it over and over again just makes quests that require you to go ""fetch"" something, that much more boring. The story is amazing, yet it lacks in replay value heavily but in a way, BL2 was the same way, just not as bad. The BIGGEST moment where every logical person claims that TPS loses to BL2, is the endgame. BL2 had better legendaries, it also had better DLC, more raidbosses, and OP levels just to name a few reasons. This is the main problem that people like Admiral Bahroo have with the game. THIS IS OK BECAUSE UNLIKE EVERYONE WITH LIKE 10 HOURS, THESE PEOPLE HAVE MADE IT TO THE ""ENDGAME"". Because they have made it to the endgame, they understand where BL2 was better than TPS. 2K Austrailia was never really able to keep working the game, because the game was scrapped because of all the negative critisism.Overall, a great game. It does use the same engine as BL2 >:( not something I am a fan of, but just imagine it as a $30 DLC for BL2. Completely worth it in my opinion. The reason why this review is because I genuinely liked TPS and enjoyed playing it a lot. It's a shame that no one will give the game a chance....Wowzers! you made it to the end of my review xd.

												Be careful for spoilers.I was so excited for this game. Borderlands 2 was the first Steam Game I bought on my new account and it was so amazing that I even forced my friends to buy the game too. And they LOVED it. We played together for hours and I met some really crazy and fun people to conquer the Legendary Weapons and bosses together. When there was a new DLC out, I knew it was worth the price and I had to get it. Not because the game was unplayable and you needed the DLC to feel like you had a real game now, like EA *cough*, but because it just made the game a complete new adventure and the whole atmosphere was renewed. The Tiny Tina DLC? It blew my mind. It's my favorite DLC and the complete thing is amazing. So yes, I did pre-order Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. The trailer showed nothing too exciting for me, but the game and the way it was played have always made the Borderlands series what it is now. Borderlands 1? Great. Fast. LOOT. Rare loot was rare. The bosses were innovative. Then, Borderlands 2. Amazing. LOOT. RARE LOOT. Legendary LOOT. The bosses? ♥♥♥♥ing art. But Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel? Not so good. Yes, I was disappointed. A lot. Why, you ask? Well, let me tell you.First I thought the game was alright and I was excited to start, but that didn't work out too well. For me, living in Europe, the game was said to come out on the 16th. Didn't happen. Had to stay up until the 17th 1am to get it. I played for one hour, was level five until the first bug arrived and threw♥♥♥♥♥♥in my face.Couldn't shoot anymore, never gained EXP, didn't level. So I restarted. And everything was good. But the game, it just didn't feel alright. It was slow, enemies literally approach you in slow motion, and the fast, colory shooty became slow and grey. The colors kind of vanished from the world (In- and outside) and the only time you find a really Borderlands 1 and 2 feeling atmosphere is in the very last place. Yes, the very last one. And to get there, you had to somehow play your way through the not triggering dialoges, enemies spawning underground and not being able to continue the quest, loot that flies away, getting thrown off the map and dying, jumping way too slow and far and dying, somehow glitching through the round and dying and enemies that do not care if you're around until you shoot. Not even them. Just, shoot. The AI is crap, but after a while you just gloss over that. But why did the game take me 9h to complete the main story?Well, because the quest-markers were♥♥♥♥♥♥ They showed that an objective was right in front of you, same level. Only to find out that you had to go all the way around, up, press some buttons and then jump down to get it. Without mentioning it. Nice. Took me ages. And that wasn't fun. Oh, and one more thing: If you're like me and you accept side quests to do them later, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. Some Side quests give you a mission weapon, like in Borderlands 2. But not all of the, are marked as mission weapons.That way I couldn't do most of them. Accepted them while doing the main quest or just accepting all side quests to do them later. Nope.The Nova Shield? Not even mentioned. The weapon to get the peaceful enemies angry? Ha, na. And the mission weapons you already used?They stay mission weapons. Forever.Then why did you keep playing it?Oh, well. Even tho the game is not like Borderlands 1 & 2, it's still Borderlands. The dialogs are still cheesy and sometimes make you giggle. The characters feel real and all have their own secrets and personalities. The voice acting is good. The world is colorless but still nice to look at, sometimes. The cutscenes weren't unnecessary and helpful and the shooting everything was fun.And what about the weaaaappoooons? They good?That's another point, actually. The weapon drops from enemies are♥♥♥♥♥♥ But the new elements, like laser and frost, are amazing and can actually make the game easier. Just getting them is hard. If they don't fly away. On the very last quest there is a little boss that spawns other and more enemies. My weapon froze him and it took me not even 5 seconds to get his shield and him down. The loot flew off into space and was never seen again. Win.But it's still nice to freeze your enemies (not forever), or laser them, or just shoot them. The way the weapons look is nothing new or special. Like Borderlands 2. And the story? I mean, did you listen to it?Yes, I did. Only after replaying a level for the 6th time I didn't, because the dialouge from the VERY beginning of this level started playing. Like, when you arrived. Even if you have been there for 24h. The story at the beginning wasn't exciting and only when the ""flashbacks"" spoke, you knew somethign would happen. In the middle of the game the story SLOWLY evolved. And the only REAL time I was really soaked into the game and didn't want to stop playing was the end.How the bosses from Borderlands 1 & 2 just came together and EVERYTHING, I mean, EVERYTHING was explained. It all makes sense now. All two games before make sense. Moxxie's secret was INSANE, Jack's growing was SO NICELY DONE, and the old Vault Hunters, like Lilith and Modecai from BL1, actually felt REAL if you played them back in the days, because they ACTUALLY remembered and all that. It was great. And the last cutscene, where Borderlands 2 pretty mch begins, just makes you want to reply Borderlands 2 because now you have so much background, it's just mind blowing.And Pro's con's or what?Pros:- Growing story, which was nicely told, but boring at first.-Growing characters and enemies. (Like, when new kinds of Guardians kept appearing, nicely done.)-The first two games being explained and remembered.-Flashbacks were nicely done.-Old characters that were still evolving, even thos they had beenin 2 games before.-New weapon elements.-New enemies. -The moon. Con's:-Bad loot that mostly flies off into space.-AI mostly doesn't care if you are around or not.-GLITCHES THAT MAKE THE GAME UNPLAYABLE.-Invincible enemies.-Enemies making you or your quest items stuck and you have to replay the whole thing.-Leveling is much easier because there are so many enemies everywhere.-The game feels slow.-Oxygen.-Gravity.And all in one? Would you recommend it?The game was good, but the feeling that you got at the end should have kicked in earlier. The ""I don't want to stop playing"" feeling just didn't exist. Until the last one hour. And then it was over. The story is good and evolving. So are the characters. They feel real and make old memories come back. The loot system is crap, but the new elements make up for it, same with the enemies. The AI is♥♥♥♥♥♥ but the new enemieraces balance that a little bit.The MultiPlayer is again more fun than the SinglePlayer, but that's clear, I guess. /Not anymore.I'd say I would recommend the game, just not NOW. (23.10.14)It's too buggy and I actually stopped playing for some days because it kept killing me for no legit reason. I once had an enemy under the ground and it didn't trigger the next spawn of enemies and I then decided to make my game online for everyone and no one had any idea. Later, some guy threw like a hundred grenades at the ground and he died. Nice.IF the bugs get fixed and you are through the main story line quest, there are TONS of side quests that I have not played yet. But like in BL1 & 2, I guess they will help you make your ingame time worth it.UPDATE: Most of them are bugged or are broken easily and it stops being fun. I didn't like the game until the very end. And that shouldn't and didn`t ever happen in any Borderlands so far. I was disappointed and even stopped playing. But I'd still say that it feels like a Borderlands, just not a complete game. If you are a fan, like me, you need to play it. If not, don't waste your time and money. Wait for a sale.6/10. "

												Borderlands : The Pre-Sequel is a great game; however I don't think it's worthy of being considered a sequel - I've finished the campaign in 35 hours solo using Claptrap -(+) Pros(+) It's Borderlands(+) Gunplay is amazing an even smoother than Borderlands 2(+) Everything is connected to Borderlands 2(+) You get to play as Claptrap ( his action skill is not only chaotic and fun, but extremely useful, though sometimes unreliable )(+) Grinder mechanic is a great way to recycle unwanted items(+) Cryo is a great replacement to slag(+) Stingrays are fun to ride(-) Cons(-) Uninteresting world ; I get that it's a moon, but why does it have to be a moon? Everything from the moon surface to the eye of helios is pretty boring to explore(-) Uninteresting characters ; some even recycled(-) Most enemy designs are pretty much the same as Borderlands 2 ( ex. Scavs = Bandits , Torks = Spiderants )(-) 2nd and 3rd bosses are HARD ; however if you manage to beat them, rest of the game is pretty much a cakewalk(-) Platforming and mission designs sucks ( bad missions designs have wasted about 1 hour of my life )(-) Side missions are all errand boy stuff and becomes a chore to do(-) Moon buggies are a disasterIf you could get past all those cons ( which will sometimes frustrate you ) ; Borderlands : The Pre-Sequel is a great game worth trying out and playing for hours on end. Go for it, especially if you're a fan of the franchise < 7.5 / 10 >			"

												Decent game but nothing like part 2. It's still good though but my main problem I had with it was the legendary items and acquiring them. Keep in mind that I have not bought the DLC for the game so my opinion is strictly on just the base game. Trying to get the legendary weapons and items themselves are to me a bit of a pain. The grinder is a great addition but I feel they should've had more bosses well mini bosses that dropped these legendary items instead of having to make them. That was my main problem with it but other than that I loved the concept and story was good. It shows how Jack became Handsome Jack and was a great setup for a well anticipated sequel or excuse me Borderlands 3. I recommend it when it comes on sale because it's a great addition but can't if full price because to me the game was just a little on the short side.			"

												Low-gravity is a gimmick that overstays its welcome almost immediately, much of the game seems to be played in it and it makes the whole thing feel like a bad TF2 server. The low-grav tends to make loot fly into pits and lava hazards and jumping, floating enemies turns everyone into a Rakk for a short while.  Oxygen is a resource you have to manage now but running out of it is hardly an inconvenience, but you still run out of it and a voice tells you to get more of it which makes for frequent exploration interruptions.  Those are the two big mechanical changes and they're both more of a detriment to the shooting and exploring fun of the series' other games than any meaningful addition to the gameplay- now everyone just hangs in the air for a while and you have to breathe more. The early map feels very sparse and empty, which makes sense for being a moon but isn't as conductive to man-clicking as one would hope.  Aside from bandits the earliest mob you encounter is a type of armored skag which tends to soak up bullets from your starter guns, and the badass variant turns into smaller mobs every time you kill it. It feels more like the grindy sort of combat from late-game BL2 than the fun kinetic shooty combat from 2nd-playthrough BL2. It definitely starts out a bit harder but the hard seems to be the ""waste of bullets"" variety.Overall the mechanics are the same as BL2 with some unwelcome additions and the whole thing feels a lot less fast-and-fun than the actual sequel. Definitely not a $60 game, wait for the winter sale.			"

												So, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. After playing both the first and second games in the series, this one is definitely different. This game changes quite a lot from the first two. First, SPACE! This game takes place in, [SPOILER!], Space. More specifically, the moon and on the giant space station from Borderlands 2(BL2), Helios. So, that being said, the map isn't terribly large. It's definitely not as large as BL2's map, but being that BL2 was Supposed to have the biggest map, that's to be expected. Now, a lot of complaints I see about it is the low gravity and platforming aspects. First off, the low gravity feels floaty but it does Not restrict combat, it makes it fun by letting you get kills in the air. Trust me, losing the fun low gravity happens a few times in the game and you won't enjoy the loss of mobility that low gravity gives you. As for the platforming aspect, you run and jump. I guess that's platforming, but there's not many other ways to get around on foot to begin with. I've also noted that a few people complain about the slamming feature being required to progress, which is not true in the least. I have only played the main campaign, not the dlc, but there's only two quests I can remember that require it, and they're side quests. Alright, so now that those ""problems"" are cleared up, let's get back to the good parts that I love about it. One of my favorite changes to the game is the change from level 5 to level 3 to get your first action point. It doesn't seem like a big change, but that's two extra points to go towards the skill trees. They also added a new type of gun, lasers. I can sum them up really easy: either they're awesome or they aren't. The story is kind of short but fun. I like that there's varied voice actors, or at least varied accents. There's some Australian, some British, and of course the normal American. The story is interesting, albeit a bit short, it shows a different perspective to the character Handsome Jack which is what it was supposed to do. The game is just enough like the old ones to make you want to play and new enough to keep you playing. The price, I will admit, is a bit high. Personally, I was able to catch it on a cheap sale, and I recommend you do the same. I don't feel $40 is worth it, (but really, I hardly feel any game is worth more than $20) but for $15 or $20 you'll feel feel that it was a great buy.			"

												gameplay and mechanics in TPS are miles ahead of Borderlands 2 where it gets boring trekking back and forth over and over again, this is because of a more intuitive map/mission design overall where they tend to give you almost all the missions the first time around rather than sending you back xxx times to a zone miles away.story is not quite as long but i prefer that as it's probably the right length to avoid it becoming a chore. story also feels less contrived to me, while still having it's weak moments, the setting feels a lot more involving. the game world is slightly more linear which leads to it feeling less like a free-roaming game - this would have been very easy to remedy imo.the oxygen and jump boost mechanics are definitely a breath of freshly generated air, making travel on foot more efficient but also more enjoyable as it just gives that bit of extra freedom that allows better traversal of the often jagged landscape that is almost trademark to the Borderlands series. it is very rare for the oxygen mechanic to pose a problem as there are O2 generators everywhere, and when it does, i feel that it adds to the exhilaration, as you desperately sprint to find that precious O2 refill, while your health very slowly ticks down (when O2 is completely empty). i like how managing the jump boost and O2 becomes a balance, as you use O2 to boost and speed your travel whilst trying not to deplete your supplies too much until you see another refill point.new hoverbike plays nicely, brings an alternative utility for a vehicle with it's ability to propel itself upwards for a few seconds. other traditional BL game mechanics such as storage deck upgrades take a more streamlined approach, mostly quality of life improvement to avoid players standing around wasting time for example at the slot machines. new lazer and cryo weapon types are both interesting and effective.the heroes! they are just generally much cooler and more badass in TPS than BL2, and it's not just their look/characterisation, but also the special abilities which definitely pack more of a punch. overall this adds the feeling that they actually deserve their legendary reputations, unlike BL2 where it's more about SAYING how badass they are rather than just simply being badass.by far the worst aspect of this game is the lack of good DLC, as the only real, fully-fleshed DLC is the Claptastic voyage, and while that has novel ideas and style to it, it starts to get dull before too long. this game desperately needs new DLC areas set elsewhere on the moon of Elpis, something i fear it will never receive now.

												A lot of people hate this for various mechanics issues and I can kind of see what they're talking about. The maps involve a lot of running around and it's not THAT bad, but it is inferior to BL2. What is bad is that the story feels forced. It's very difficult to write a villain's descent into madness because readers/players will find it very easy to go, ""Dude, can't you tell you're kind of being a♥♥♥♥♥♥right now?"" And this game does NOT solve that. People have tried to explain it to me saying, ""Well, the characters are flawed."" or ""Well, he [Jack] was pushed over the edge,"" but like, none of it is very convincing. All the characters are still fun to play as in various ways so you can just play it as a shooter. However, it is impossible to play this single-player which ultimately earns my thumbs down. There was only one large DLC which some claim is a great analogy for depression but I feel is inferior to Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep from BL2.			"

												I own Bad Rats and this is still the ♥♥♥♥♥iest thing in my library.This is the type of game that is more of an expansion than proper sequel (like Saints Row: Gat Out of Hell or Far Cry: Blood Dragon for example) that recycles everything that did the previous game and make it a little bit different just to milk some money of the franchise without really bringing anything new to the table. Recycled guns, recycled enemies, recycled jokes, recycled everything.  Which wouldn't mean necessarily a bad thing for somebody who just wants more of the thing he already done many times yet it fails even in that since the writing, level design and whole gameplay lacks anything interesting or fun. Only thing that was newly added was various bugs. I usually try to beat the game and write a review with a cold head but not this time. ♥♥♥♥ this game.			"

												I'll be one of the few to not recommend this game.  Especially for the price tag of 60 dollars.  I would wait until it was on sale for 30 or less to buy it. It is basically a rushed reskin of borderlands 2 in space with more bugs, an uninteresting story, and unfunny characters.Same UI, same quests, same vehicles same items only worded differently or reskinned. Same way of doing everything as borderlands 2.  Oh yeah ""They're moonstones now""The only problem is, if you took all the funny characters and funny dialogue out of borderlands 2, this is what you would get.The writing is not clever or interesting at all.  I guess they think by putting in a bunch of limey australian accents it makes everything more funny.  From the first slightly clever girl to the little runt  tiny tim lad, to the  environmentalist girl that likes to kill things,  to the The Bosun and Skipper dialogue where the character ACTUALLY says ""This guys name is poop deck because he's going to kick your♥♥♥♥♥""  I'm just rolling my eyes by this point.The only saving grace was having torque come back... he is the best.TLDR:  I would rather play borderlands 2.  At least I wouldn't have to find oxygen every 20 seconds.			"

												I can't give a sideways thumbs-up, so consider this thumbs up as tenative as you can find. I'll start with the bad stuff because of that. I'm going to presume you're familiar with Borderlands already. If not, go start with Borderlands 2 the next time it's on sale if you're interested. It'll take you awhile, and when you're done, come back.It still has a lot of the Borderlands 2 issues - most weapon drops are vendor trash, there's no way to level up a favorite item, quests are full of pointless trekking back and forth and back again, it still has MMO-style boss grinding tedium in the endgame, some of the jokes are super dumb, weapons are repeated from previous games (this may be good or bad, depending on the weapon), the story doesn't make much sense and is pretty disposable, guns often lack that kinetic ""oomph"" in terms of sound and SFX, the starting vehicles controls like a brick on springs, etc. The Australian gags may fall flat if you don't know crap about Australia, and the moon areas are sparse and kinda samey as well. It you didn't like previous Borderlands games, this will not change your mind in the slightest.On the other hand, moon jumping and slamming is rad and helps use the 3D aspect of the game to actual effect, the classes are more fun and balanced than previous iterations, the humor does have some really cute gags, leveling is linear instead of quadratic, shops now often offer more rare items (and they're leveled to your character properly), you get a lot more dialogue personalized to your class, the second vehicle you get is pretty handy, lasers are fun, ice weapons are way more fun than slag weapons, etc.It's not deviating much from the formula, but if you enjoyed the previous Borderlands games this is worth a go-round once it drops in price. It's not as great as it could be, but all Borderlands games are a mix of joy and dissapointment, and this one at least erred towards the joy end of things for me.			"

												Despite the obvious negativity from the Borderlands community, stating this ""isn't a full game/feels more like a big DLC,"" this game has its charm. At first, I was disappointed as well, but I found as I played it again, I liked the energy it created. I could even so much as say I like The Pre-Sequel over Borderlands 2.The one thing I love most about this game is that it establishes one major essence of the Borderlands series that I didn't fully comprehend until now: there are no ""good"" guys. Every character has flaws, every character has at least some questionable morals. And they all make mistakes! (A non-spoiler-ish example would be Mr. Torgue, who in this game has absolutely no respect for Janey or for females at all - but you hear present day Mr. Torgue butt in the story to say he apologized for his awful behavior back then. Because people can change, for either the better or the worse--)All the characters, especially the playable ones, are quirky and lovable in their own ways. There are a lot of things in this game that I wished they did in Borderlands 2, either gameplay-wise or story-wise. I hope that they adopt some of the mechanics from this game into their next one (mostly the fact that the characters actually reply with spoken lines, which Borderlands 2 only did in their DLC, because I'm a sucker for banter).Any fan of the Borderlands series should play this game, not only does it add more lore, it adds to the story, the overall gameplay, and to the cast of colorful characters in the Borderlands series. Play it, you won't regret it.			"

												Loved BL2 but this game just doesn't do it for me. I really don't like the jumping around in space (no gravity, slow jumps etc.) which sticks with you throughout. The guns don't feel like they did in BL2 and I seem to die a lot more too. Also not a big fan of the skills the characters have, compared to BL2. The levels also feel quite sparse and there's a lot of running around to get from A to B. It's not a bad game, but I just don't find it as good as BL2, to the point that I've tried a couple of times to stick with it, but lose interest after a few hours.			"

												[NO PLOT-SPOILERS TO BE FOUND HERE]Stupid company. The first Mega-StandAlone-AddOn with DLCs ever. We've never had this before! A bright future we're looking into!This should have been more of a big AddOn or gigantic DLC but not a fullpriced ""new"" game. It's basically BL2 with a new story and some reskinned enemies/cars/weapons/vendormats/etc. It's very hard NOT to see this game as a more-or-less simple cash-grabbing.The good: I can play as CLAPTRAP! (and still there are some claptrap-bots in the game to laugh about) The new story fills some open plotholes Fighting is still funny Bizarre characters and bosses again (""Red and belly sitting in a tree, K I S S....hm, that sounded wrong"") Balance! No matter how good my weapons are, how far i level or how i spend my skillpoints, most enemies (in level-range of course) are still a kind of challenge, yet i'm seldomly overpowered by any enemy Nice soundtrack (again) Characters are now addressed as themselves (not only as ""vaulthunter"") The whole ""low-gravity-thing"" is quite funny, hopping from pad to pad or using your ""jetpack-for-the-poor"" to jump around. Yay! I can play CLAPTRAP! 4 New classes, lots of new skills (some of which are just old stuff renamed though *sigh*) The engine's performance is SLIGHTLY better than BL2. Although PhsyX still is a mess. Looks beautiful, drops fps from >140fps to 15fps in an instant. YUCK! Why even include that feature again if it's unplayable even for console-heads?! ""Nina nurse you!"" (will still get annoying after hearing it for the 1230913rd time) new type of weapons, new type of machine (Grinder, nice...another one armed bandit lol), new misc. equipment new tons of stupid (startled/dying)-enemy-one-liners like ""i should've known better"" and the like. Always love it new bunch of silly humor not taking itself serious at all. Sometimes it's so stupid it becomes clever again. Even the racial-stereotype-dumb-humor like Russian Nina is hillarious. Just don't take it seriously :-) You're in for some nice funny suprises (*cough* Moxxie *cough) A weapon that will cuss at you (even calling you the rude version of the female primary genitalia) and your enemies with every shot. Hillarious! new cars with added third dimension element (up/down) Did i mention i can play as claptrap? EXPLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSIONS! AND LASERSSSSSSsss! Flawlessly included borderless windowed AKA non-exlusive fullscreen (still an issue in 2014 *sigh*) Cooperative online play (what a surprise) Ultimate-Vault-Hunter-Mode is kinda rewrapped in some Tiny Tina-narration. Not THAT much of new content though, but better than just the same thing again.The bad: As said: Way more of an addon than a fullprice game. Screw you Gearbox! Well played Gearbox! First the myriads of DLCs, now that bugger. With DLCs too, and i bet it'll be even more...We'll see. Some missions (or better: the variety of enemies encountered while doing them) become repetitive. Not that it gets boring (if you like the fighting part of BL) but i had wished for some more variety on each map (and overall) Low-gravity-induced bugs. Questitems that comfortably fly right into that lava sea over yonder. Nothing game-breaking yet (considering quitting/reloading is not gamebreaking) Introduction/Tutorial (until first major city like sanctuary) seems quite...boring when done the second time (for testing out the new classes) The engine is pretty much the same. Not the slightest graphical enhancement (beside the performance-improvements). Nothing at all. Even stupid AddOns mostly deliver some enhancements to the graphics. Not here. If you expect a damn nice/interesting/clever/brilliant/refreshing story/plot you'd be dissapointed. Even Tiny Tina's Keep-DLC was way above this generic story which is more of a plothole-filler than anything new. But to be fair, it's not totally uninteresting if you played BL1/BL2 The story will suck if you have not played BL1/BL2. You'd have no clue who is who or why this or that should be funny or is a reference...It's like taking a book with 600 pages and start at page 400. But if it would have been the other way round, fanboys would have been dissapointed. Hard to please them all. Not much settings to really tune the visuals to your machine's capabilities. Should be mandatory for an FPS title, but maybe i'm just picky. This oxygen-thing is quite useless and more annoying than a fun-addition. Mostly you're bombarded with oxygen if you don't need it, but suddenly, while exlporing a secret...Boom! Empty! Meh, gonna search O²... OMG i so much hoped for new one-liners in the vendor-bots, like Marcus' but no, it really started to become annoying in BL2 and now it goes on. But at least there's no more Dr.Zed :-) What really annoys me is the dampened sound if you're in free space. There is no sound at all, why try to be ""realistic"" there? Things that start to annoy really fast are sentences like ""attention, breathable atmosphrere!"" (woooow thanks dude, nearly missed that one) Why the f..ork are the controls for up/down different when in a vehicle? FOR WHAT REASON?! Too few quick-travel points. After a quest is done you basically have to walk the whole fricking way back killing every stupid enemy again. Meh. I'm german so i'm expected to say something totally nit-picky: There are SAMs that target me while i'm on the ground. Walking. Ridiculous!The ugly: PhsyX. No really Gearbox, are you insane in the membrane? A professional company with a decent budget working together with NVidia to deliver what? THIS? ""Best played with NVIDIA""? Are you kidding me? To quote Nina on this: ""No, is joke!"". Keep it on low (off) *sigh* This goddam console-interface from hell. The design-decision-team should be all punished for that. ""Hey why not make this 33-Inventory-Space a scrollable list of, say, 6 items at once?"" - ""Superb idea, what about not including anything important in one simple clickable screen for these PC-Users with more than 2 buttons too?"" - ""AWESOME! Nina nurse you!"" They have not even try to enhance it slightly...""But why do you moron recommend it then he?"" you may ask.Well, it's one of the very few (are there even any at all?) FPS that have a slight feeling of RPG and are yet stuffed with funny elements and self-referenced humor just on the sharp edge between being plain dumb and hillarious. On top of that it delivers a nice story that keeps you going, and most side-missions are funny and interesting to do. And on top of that it's a well balanced shooter with nice COOP-abilities.A) You've played BL1 and BL2:Loved them? GO GET IT! Have Claptrap ruin your party, have fun :-)They were just ""ok""? Wait for the GOTY.B) You've not played BL1 and BL2 yet:If you like FPS mixed with mild RPG-influences (skills, leveling, currencies to buy stuff etc) you should give it a try.But for the love of god (or what's holy to you): Play BL1 & BL2 prior to this. You'll get them for pretty much nothing. BL1 is cool, BL2 is even cooler. If you're in a hurry, just skip the DLCs of both. There's no reason to start with part 3 even though it's called ""pre-sequel"".If you do like FPS, but are more into the ""serious"" kind like Battlefield or CoD or the likes and don't fancy leveling for a long time or managing resources and inventories (oh you will do)? Stay away. This is probably not what you want to play.tl;dr:9/10, will play again more than once and will buy most DLCs even if smart-me says ""NO!"". Haha, screw you smart-me, go read some books!May the Schwartz be with you! "

And it's KINDA cool to see how Jack went bad. So basically, it's moderately entertaining for one playthrough.And then you realize, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ they added practically nothing to this game.I preordered this game after playing Borderlands and Borderlands 2 for endless hours on both the PC and Xbox 360.I was hoping for as many changes to this game as there were from between borderlands and borderlands 2.But there weren't. The game is just one big dissapoitnment and honestly, after playing through it once, you'll never want to play it again.If Borderlands 2 was like your life, and you've maxed it 100% 20 times and you just CRAVE more, for whatever reason, then sure, buy this game. If it's on sale for like 15 dollars. Maybe.But this game is most certainly not worth the whole price. It's just a dissapointment.I'm not trying to be cynical or negative or mean or anything like that. I'm just trying to be helpful here. Save your money and move on with your life.			"

												I can only repeat what everyone else is saying: yes, it has its shortcomings, but if you love the series, you'll probably love this. If you're not a fan, probably nothing here will sway you. I personally love it. The Aussie humour won't appeal to all but I kinda like it. The new weapon-types are pretty cool: laser weapons and cryo elemental damage is well implemented. I like at least something about all the new characters. Athena, Nisha, Wilhelm, Claptrap and Jack (note: at time of writing the final dlc character hasn't been released) all have something going for them, be it tanking, damage or healing. The graphics are pretty timeless due to the nature of the engine and the soundtrack is up to the usual standards. Boss fights are generally fun and the storyline, presentation and dialogue is generally hilarious/appropriately serious but with a few misses. But yes, it does kinda feel like a glorified expansion.To summarise, if you love the series, essential. If it's ""like"" rather than ""love"", you'll probably like it but it's not essential to your life. If you're not fussed about the series you probably won't be swayed. If you really hate the series, well, nothing will convert you, I don't think ;)			"

												It's not a bad game. It's good. It's better than many of FPS games out there. But it's not better or as good as previous Boderlands. There is no endgame. You can't farm 90% of bosses. After beating this game, you'll be like: ""OK...let's go back to BL2 or 1."" Story is great, ending is perfect. But that's about it. First playthrough of normal and tvhm are amazing, after that, dialogs are more repetitive in bl2. Here, before pushing some button or contunue somewhere, you need to listen to long and boring dialog. This was in BL2 too, but not so much like here. Pickle is annoying and he's talking to much. You need to WAAAAIIIIT before going to next area, then go to place, listen to dialog and go to other side of map...Side quests are not as good as in previous ones too - too many talking, not enough killing. Holodome DLC is a Joke.Overall, I still recommend this game !IF DISCOUNTED!, because it's more MOXXI, you can play as CLAPTRAP, buttslam and double jump.			"

												Let's see how much content this game has (Assuming you have all DLC):Around 25 hours for the main campaign if you're doing most stuff.There's 6 playable characters (2 of which are DLC), so 25 x 6 = 150.The Claptastic Voyage DLC adds another 6 hours for each character, so 6 x 6 = 36.And there's New Game+ mode for each playthrough, doubling the time.Let's calculate:(150 + 36) x 2 = 372 hoursThis is an insane amount of content, and I'm not even counting the Holodome and playing it in COOP!The game is highly recommended, not only for the ludicrous amount of content you're getting, but because the gameplay is also excellent.

The game is still nice nonetheless. The new playbable classes are really good, zero gravity is a nice change and beam weapons an interesting addition.. You should think of it as a decent expansion pack and not as a new game. That's why if you are thinking about buying it you should wait for a sale because it isn't worth the price of a new game.			"

												An honest and short review for Borderlands Fans...This game is enjoyable and fun, you got new features and items like:-Laser Weapons-Grinder-Oz Kits-Double Jump-Low GravityThat will make you feel good in a new Borderlands game, which is awesome!When you start to play the game you enjoy at some point, after you beat the game you will get stuck with only 1 raid boss! Which means this game has no endgame like Borderlands 2. It's lack out of content:- Small Maps.- No Rare Monsters- Like Chests monsters, Rank up Monsters etc...- No Loot Midgets.- Only 1 Raid Boss.- Few Side Quests.- No Side Maps- that's not for story line but for side quests.- Small Bosses aren't repeatable.- Specific Legendary Items drop only from specific ""not repeatable"" bosses.- Short Game.( I will not mention any bugs! though there's some annoying ones, every new game starts with bugs)In other words, currently the game is short and no content, this is not the Borderlands we used to love!If you want to compare The Pre-Sequel to Borderlands 2- New release to a new release= Borderlands 2 release was way better than Pre-Sequel, with alot more content and endgame.Final review is 7.0Still, i recommend The Pre-Sequel but not now of course! If you love Borderlands games just wait until there's more DLCs in this game. You better play the ""endless"" Borderlands 2 instead.			"

												Thus far, I've had a very negative experience with this game. Allow me to list a few of the glaring issues I've noticed while playing; - Quest objects frequently get stuck inside walls due to badly designed maps. - The game slows down to 20 FPS during large-scale fights. - The Co-op has broken on frequent occasions; My friend has crashed trying to connect, and on one occasion he connected and the game had removed all of his weapons, with no way to get them back. - If you die and respawn, the AI ""turns off"" until you attack them.  - The game has thought I was playing multiplayer when I was in a singleplayer game, barring me from progressing when I came to an area where all players had to be together. These are only a few of the major issues I've encountered during my time playing. In terms of what this game has added when compared to Borderlands 2, it really doesn't feel like enough content has been added for this game to be worth it. It may as well be a DLC for Borderlands 2. The story isn't very well done either, as well as the fact that it has ruined Jack. Not to mention this game is going for a full $60. Overall I would say this game is half complete and rushed, and is not worth buying. "

												This Game is not as great as Borderlands 2 and you cant put  thousand hours into it like you can in Borderlands 2. But its a really good Game though. Especially as a Borderlands Fan you shouldnt pass this game. Also it has one of the best Story DLCs availabel for the Borderlands Franchise.			"

												Lets make it clear first, despite all the bad review Borderlands The Pre-Sequel is NOT A BAD GAME.People saying♥♥♥♥♥♥because this game is not as good as the previous 2 games and Pre-Sequel feels like a huge dlc for Borderlands 2 due to the same graphic and similar combat mechanic. The main difference between TPS and B2 are :1. Replacing relics with Oz kit, which is an oxygen helmet because well... duh you're in space. There will be another bar below your health indicating your oxygen so this kinda add more challange to your gameplay because you have to keep an eye on your oxygen too while on moon surface and besides adding oxygen it also provides a boost to stat or bonus just like relics in BL2.2. Replacing slag with cryo, which IMO is a good thing because i'm not using slag too much in BL2. Well cryo is a lot better because not only it adds more dmg when enemy is frozen (not as effective as slag though) the fact that the enemy is indeed frozen (meaning they stopped shooting) is what makes it better especially when encountering badasses.Other than that, there's not much notable difference between TPS and BL2 besides the story and characters obviously, there's maybe a slight difference in skill trees but the HUD, weapons, etc. is almost the same.So overall I think this game is good and worth to get but definitely not on full price. My advice is go get it only when the price dropped 50% or higher. If you are a fan of Borderlands and wanted to know a lot more about the stories especially Handsome Jack's origin, then this game is definitely for you.			"

												If you enjoyed any of the previous Borderlands then this is another game that you won't want miss. I have only played this game on solo mainly unlike the other Borderlands. This game was fun to play and completed it on solo but is a lot more pleasureable if you grab some friends. Would recommmed to anyone. Loads to do after the main storyline and lots of rare and unqiues to collect!			"

												As a fan of the franchise I must say that this game mantains that traditional sense of humor of the other titles,  and also the looks and ambient of the game feels great as usual. I played the entire campaign in Co-Op and it was funny as hell. Although,  Unlike the other titles,  this one had a ton of bugs...  Well almost everywhere. Got them in missions, invisible walls,  and even ""falling of the world"". To me is clearly the worst of the franchise in almost every aspect,  but is still very fun to play. Recomended if you're a fan of the series. Give it a try.OVERALL 7.0/10 "

												First off, I’ve always loved Borderlands games and enjoyed playing them. When I decided to buy the pre-sequel, my expectations were the same with Borderlands 1 and 2. I was craving some more Borderlands grinding, cool mobs and fun story/dialogs and boy... The Pre-Sequel surely delivered. First, the good stuff:•	Everything you loved from the previous games grinding, mobs, clever dialogs, good level design, all that jazz… they’re still fun.•	The moon adds a new aspect to the game, new mechanics like O2 levels and low gravity. You always have to be aware of your O2 level when you are in a vacuumed area.  Low gravity is really fun. Jumping puzzles are cleverly hidden and feels fresh coming from Borderlands 2.•	There are more guns with different combinations, like railguns and LASERS!!!!1!1.•	The new Vault Hunters are more likeable and they are written better. They have some kind of character now but still I encourage you the buy the doppelganger DLC to play as Jack. He is one of my favorite Vault Hunter, ever (might be after Brick).•	Handsome Jack’s story explains a lot from the second game and makes you love the previous Vault Hunters even more.Now the bad stuff:•	Some missions are still unbearably booooring. “You have to go here. Oh the door is locked? You need to power it the door. Oh, if you want to power it, you need to find the engine... Damn, to go to the engine, you need a key… To get the key you need the kill this boss.” FML!!!!!111!!!!1•	If you don’t like the Borderlands’ humor, nature, sense, personality… This game won’t convince you and won’t change anything…•	The rare currency is changed to Moonstones from Eridium. And its color is light blue. Guess what is also white blue… THE WHOLE ♥♥♥♥ING MOON. So whenever a moonstone is dropped, it’s very hard to see. But thank god they buffed the drop so moonstones drop far more than Eridium.•	The new vehicle, hovercraft, Stingray handles like♥♥♥♥♥♥ Plain horse♥♥♥♥♥♥ I don’t know why they even tried to squeeze it in the game.At the end, the game doesn’t fall short and delivers a great Borderlands experience. If you liked the previous games and you’re a hardcore fan, the game justifies a full price. But you just like to play it from time to time… wait for a real discount like %50-%75 then buy the game. You won’t regret it. "

												I loved the new playable characters.  This is the best set of PCs yet.  None of them are useless for once.  All of them are fun to play, with more than one correct build.Unfortunately, you can only play those characters in this game.  Which means I've stopped playing them.The presequal's maps are trying and failing to make use of the (not actually that much fun) low grav movement mechanics.  It ends up just making maps hard to navigate.  And the quest's have you do a terrible amount of backtracking.  I hate walking sim crap.The jokes suck.  Maybe I just don't get Australian humor.  I was horribly let down.The best part of 2 was Handsome Jack being a♥♥♥♥♥♥  This whole, let's follow Jack's fall to the darkside thing isn't working.  He sucks as a sympathetic character.  He's just not interesting.  And it doesn't do a good job of telling that story anyway since he just goes nuts all in one scene.  There isn't this gradual fall like they were trying to let on.I was also pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off by the fact that they decided to make money a scarce resource.  I've played several hundred hours of Borderlands 1 and 2.  This is the first time I've ever ran out of money.  Until I started picking up guns just to sell (which is some tedious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t) I actually ran out of money to buy ammo.  This is a huge departure from the previous games, where money wasn't actually that important.  And I don't think this new method is fun.This is the worst Borderlands of the series.  I just went back to playing Borderlands 2.  My verdict is, wait until this gets very cheap before you let curiosity get the better of you.  It's worth 5 bucks just to find out how far you can get before quitting in bewilderment at what they've done.  But boy do I feel dumb for having let my absolute love of 1 and 2 convince me to pre-order.			"

												If there was a mixed choice, I would choose it.This game is particualar bad, but it also isn't the greatest game ever.Like most people would say, this game should have been made a DLC. It seems too short and a waste of money. I only paid $24 + a free Shock Drop Slaughter Pit (cuz I bought the retail ver). This game isn't worth the full price. If you really want this game, buy it during the Steam sales or the retail ver.The story of this game is how Jack rose to power and you help him get to the vault and essentially save Pandora and Elpis. Everything in this game is pretty much like BL2 besides the added cryo element, laser guns & slam damage. The character classes aren't all that great. DLC characters Doppelganger Jack and Lady Hammerlock seem to be better choices. And don't count on new legendaries in this game. They're a direct copy of BL2 legendaries and only a few new ones are added. If you buy the Claptastic Voyage DLC, you get access to Glitch weapons. Which are kinda cool but not really special. The humour in this game is dry, the missions mostly require you to run back in fourth to point A to point B.  Oh and in order to get Vault Hunter Pack up to level 60 (max), you need to buy both Pack seperately. The Holodom is worthless, I didn't buy it but you could just watch the playthroughs on YouTube and the only reason that it worth buying is the dialouge between Axton, Athena and Gaige. Shock Drop is completely worthless, its just another set of slaughter rounds. The game gets boring very quickly becuase of the lack of missions.Its an okay game for people who've played BL2, but if you're just starting out, you're not gonna understand anything the character will be talking about.  /long review, sorry! >_<			"

This is mostly going to be a positive review. I am writing this review after I've reached level 50 with my character and completed almost every quest so I guess I can judge the game as fairly as possible. // 1 //For those who expect too many changes, sorry. This game is very similar to Borderlands 2. Engine, graphics, humor and other key features are very similar to BL2. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. Those who loved Borderlands 2 are definitely going to atleast like Pre-Sequel, if not to love it as well.// 2 //In my opinion, the story was solid, it wasn't too epic, but it was enjoyable. It filed the gaps between BL1 and BL2. Gameplay was amazing, I absolutely enjoyed every aspect of it, especially the low gravity, butt-slams, cryo guns, laser guns, moon surface and much more. They did a great job on this. Soundtrack was solid, but it felt a bit calm in many parts of the maps. Too calm maybe, I sometimes didn't even hear it over the shooting and EXPLOSIONS. The game just keeps doing what Borderlands 2 did great and keeps improving that. Levels are much more balanced, combat is balanced, gameplay improved, etc.// 3 //To not make this review too long, here are my pros and cons about Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel.+ Gameplay+ Story+ Graphics, aesthetics+ Atmosphere+ Shooter elements, rpg elements+ Leveling up, progression of your character+ 4 player coop+ Laser guns of course :D- Repetitive? (for some people, this is a negative thing)- Lack of originality- Lazy re-skinned models of guns from BL2- Soundtrack, not bad, but could be improved much more- PhysX, doesn't work smoothly (60+fps) on majority of high-end computers- No button to autmatically refill your ammo! (ha-ha, iz joke)That's about it, the game doesn't have many negative aspects, nothing that would ruin the game.For a new player to BL series, those negatives won't probably even matter.My score would be 8/10 for this game. It's great, fun and enjoyable, especially with good friends, but could have been much better. It had a lot of potential. But just like any other game, it can not be perfect.~Camper			"

												Genre - Comedy Sci-Fi FPS/RPGI played through the first two games and this one, both alone and with friends. I enjoy the mix of FPS and RPG and the varied guns you find allowing you to always play for new loot. The story fills in gaps between the first and second games and is enjoyable to playthrough and follow. After a normal playthrough you can up the difficulty and go through it again for even more loot and to reach level 50. I assume ther will be more DLC released that will add more missions and stories so I am in no rush to do this yet. I also find the game just as fun in solo on the first playthrough as with friends. You will need to co-op against the raid boss on the final mission though! The cell shaded graphics look cool and the four characters are varied enough that you could go through the game with each (hopefully there will be a couple more of these coming too). I found the game just the right length, if you do all the missions and I didn't get bored considering I have seen something very similar twice before. So if it ain't broke...			"

												I like this game.  It's not completely better than BL2, but it still holds up pretty well.But what I like, is that they can tell a darker story.  Make you think...who is the real villian here?  The DLC goes even further, telling a story of Claptrap, and it gets so dark, so emotional...it doesn't even feel like a Borderlands game anymore.  There is still humor here and there, and that's fine.  It is one of the few games -- few series' that actually had an emotional impact on me.  And this is a game about shooting mooks and looting their corpses (provided they don't fly off into oblivion).  I can't recommend this enough.			"

												This game actually takes place between the first and second game, hence the made-up title of it being the pre-sequel (1.5)The ability to see how Handsome Jack actually become a villain is an interesting and fulfilling story.  The ending, of course, ties up so many loose ends that it is nothing short of spectacular.  Being able to identify with the  villains is an interesting turn of events for this installment in the series.  It, however, maintains the lootsplosion drops of the first and second games.It's a great story and a terrific game.  The only annoying thing about the game is the air requirement (since you're on the moon).  Finding the right set of gear can really make this more bearable, however.			"

												A massive letdown but I couldn't pass on the $5 tag.There's no endgame. Coop (best thing about BL) is gone for good. Loot is scarce and I barely got 4 golds in 4 complete gamethroughs. Skill trees are poorly done and there are way less builds than in BL2 compensated by overpowering one or two skills (stacking ones mostly).If you're a huge fan of the franchise you will enjoy it like I did but otherwise just wait for the $5 sale or the GOTY edition if it ever comes out.Also Gibb the hell out of it as you will never get the gear you want.

												Summary is at the end.After the legend that was Borderlands 2, many people had high expectations for the next game in the series. This has been a consistent problem in the gaming community is that we overly hype a game to such a degree that it would be impossible for the final release to fufill our expectations. Some of this game not meeting the expectations of the fanbase is indeed due to shortcomings of the game/developers. This includes things such as the shorter storyline, lack of a real endgame that made Borderlands 2 have it's incredible replay value, a decent number or reskinned enemies ported over from BL2, bosses not respawn when the game was first released (No longer the case, it's patched now c:), lack of many ""Raid Bosses"" as seen in BL2, and 2k Australia's death causing this game not getting the 2nd expected content update that was expected for Season Pass holders. Yeah the humor is somewhat different from the previous games but it doesn't particularly bother me, and still gave me a chuckle now and again. I really have no feelings towards the Grinder one way or the other.The movement system in this game took me a while to deem as good or bad. What finally got me to decide it was definately an improvement was when I went back to play the previous installment, I couldn't help but try to do the air-boosts when running longer distances, or doing a butt slams to stop airial movement when knocked about (F**k you Terramorphous) I have mixed feelings about the O2 system, but at worst it was slightly annoying when running out of O2 so it didn't really bother me in the end. The pacing (and ending) of the game is MUCH better and more satisfying than the original Borderlands (which felt difficult to play for long stretches when I first got it), and is at least comparable to BL2 in that regard. Playing as a group of character's which are (for the most part) enemies in BL2 gave a greater appreciation for them in the previous game. Going back and replaying BL2 afterwards actually made the run more enjoyable which was probably an unintentional but nice effect nevertheless. In summary, I believe Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel was a good game. It added mechanics which made sense in the setting and which I felt added to the game. It did not match up with the expectations the previous Borderlands game set into motion and it does have some flaws, but I feel it is a good game and simply could never measure up due to how high our expectation were. If you're new to this franchise, I would personally recommend grabbing Borderlands 2: GOTY Edition first as it (and the DLC's that come with the GOTY edition) are in fact the superior experience. But for anyone who had played Borderlands 2 and enjoyed it: this game does a fair enough job with the tools it was given and does enough to add a great deal to previous installments to merrit giving it a go.Grabbing the Season Pass is up to you, main things in there worthwhile are the two DLC character's (which people like) and the content DLC Claptastic Voyage (which people love).

												The dialogue in this game is atrocious propaganda and Anthony Burch is a pathetic excuse for a human being.  Before reaching Concordia, I had to enable subtitles and turn off the game's dialogue.  Once beating the game I disabled subtitles completely.That aside, I played this game for its gameplay and I like its unique aspects such as jump pads and laser guns.  Still, pew-pew gets old eventually.  I cannot find many people to play this game with since it is new.  I certainly will not be purchasing any of its DLC for a long time, if ever.  I actually returned to Borderlands 1 with a friend or two and had more fun with that than playing through this game.  Borderlands 2 is seemingly better with better dialogue from what I understand - go play that instead if you want to play Borderlands with a more active player base than the first game.  As somebody who pre-ordered it, its arena bonus was merely five consecutive rounds as a string of side missions.Most importantly, CL4P-TP is now unfunny and annoying as Hell.  Never play as him unless you want to annoy your teammates.			"

												This is not Borderlands. It's the husk of it. The proverbial dead horse being beaten.The Story ...  ... sucks.I mean, we all know how it ends, right? Jack becomes a murdering psycho who enslaves the entire planet. But he actually starts off as a really nice guy who's willing to compromise, wants to save the world, sacrifices himself for others, and places his trust heavily in his ""friends"".The whole plot revolves around a number of decisions which make little to no sense. Betrayals which the characters lack motivation for, or even worse, is hand-waived based on events which took place ""off-screen"", before the player came along, and are part of the characters history, but aren't shared with us. What the heck, people?A lot of the major dialogs which lead to Jack becoming a murdering ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ actually have me feeling more sympathetic for him than for the so called ""good guys"". His shift to ""evil"" also feels completely unnatural and forced.Even the main characters (3 of whom are not really relevant to the greater story being told - only Athena is) feel very one-dimensional and under-represented. Did you want to find out:  How Wilhelm ended up in that robot chassis?  How Nisha ends up Jack's GF and Sheriff?  How Claptrap ends up stranded in a frozen wasteland, not to mention a completely useless idiot?Well, too bad, folks. The most you'll get to see - if you're patient enough to sit though the credits - are a few sketches poorly outlining those character's story lines. I mean, really? Such wasted potential for DLC content.The Humor ...  ... sucks.No, sorry. It doesn't suck - that's putting it far too mildly. It's absolutely terrible. Obnoxious. Childish. Forced. Over-the-top, and often mired in Australian lingo which simply doesn't resonate with most Western audiences at all.  In short it is disturbingly bad, especially for a Borderlands title.I remember laughing so hard while playing BL2 that my ribs hurt. I had few, if any moments when I even smiled during this game. Mostly I just imagined punching most of the characters into silence whenever they launched into one of their long winded and ""humorous"" monologues. And one more thing. Many of the short captions introducing important NPCs and bosses? Few were good, almost none were funny, and most simply fell flat.Gone is the witty, snappy humor of Borderlands, replaced with a PG13 Australian version (apparently) written by a failed comedian.The Loot ... ... sucks.Seriously? I remember combing through BL2's maps looking for every hidden weapon chest, and being rewarded with pretty decent weapons. I remember switching out guns as a I found better and better stuff. Now? Thank God for Gold Keys  is all I have to say. I stopped opening chests because there was simply no point. Even white loot drops were remarkably rare, nevermind a decent blue or purple weapon. Other than that the guns are what you already experienced in BL2, except for lasers and freeze rays - which, I admit, are sort of cool, but don't make up for all the other crap. The enemies ... ... suck.Not exactly the brightest of the bunch. I was able to run from one objective to another without having to engage most of them because they're slow to notice you, and don't really follow you very far. It was great when all I wanted to do was get to the next way-point - which they bounce around the map in order to force you to kill as many mobs as possible.Another important point: the game's number one progression mechanic is not to actually go places, but be stuck waiting for a door to open while enemies keep spawning on top of you. The grind is real in the Pre Sequel.The Lunar Mechanics... sort of suck.The low gravity and jump packs can be fun to play with. Constantly having to watch your O2 meter gets old within the first 10 minutes. Honestly, this is the first BL game where I had ZERO interest (see what I did there?) in trying to find the hidden content.   As many others have pointed out, driving the buggy pretty much sucks. The other vehicle type is also incredibly clunky and difficult to ""jump"" with, which is funny seeing how that's it's entire reason for existence.ConclusionI picked up this game and all the DLC's for a grand total of $20. I honestly feel like I got ripped off. This is not a Borderlands game. It's a travesty of one. It was seemingly made by people who sort of, kinda, understood what Borderlands is and got the lore somewhat right, yet managed to miss the heart and soul of it. This game is a major disappointment.

												Contains what some may consider minor spoilers.A decent enough sequel (oh excuse me, PREQUEL) to BL2, it removes some major annoyances of the aforementioned game whilst introducing new ones but it's mostly more of the same, so I'll use BL2 for comparison on several occasions throughout the review.As for the graphics and sound effects - it's mostly the same as BL2. Many voice actors have an australian (or fake cockney) accent which is a nice enough change of scenery. Enemy chatter is not as entertaining as it was in BL2, sadly. Combat's not nearly as fun without people shouting ""SEEEEEEEEMEEEEEEENNNN"" while rushing towards you.The story feels like it takes relatively little substance and elongates it forever. The idea of documenting Handsome Jack's rise to power (and descent into psychopathic megalomania) is good but their approach to it is a bit too heavy-handed and melodramatic in places. I do like some of the little foreshadowing references to the events of BL2.There are several new gameplay mechanics which make the game feel fresh even though the core gameplay is still pretty much the same. The new things include:○ Limited oxygen: many areas of the game don't have a breathable atmosphere so your O2 supply will drain at a slow rate there. Boosts and butt slams drain oxygen at a noticably increased rate so you need to ration it well because you'll start taking damage when you run out (unless you're a claptrap). This feature can be very annoying sometimes as it artificially adds a sense of urgency to everything - exploration is not that much fun when you've got a time limit. The good thing is that enemies need to breathe too and they'll start taking suffocation DoT when you break their oxygen masks, allowing you to save some ammo.○ Low gravity & boost: allows you to reach places that'd be impossible to get to in BL2 so it takes a while to get used to the new possibilities. And you're going to have to – some missions require well timed jumps and boosts in order to reach the objective. If you really hate platforming, you might want to avoid this game.○ Butt slam: a quick way to get to the ground from mid-air, plus it does good damage and can inflict DoT effects - invaluable for saving ammo, but costs oxygen.○ Laser weapons: they pretty much replace E-tech, you can get various types which act shotgun-like, sniper-like, automatic or like the lightning gun from Quake 3. They're not bad but I found myself not using them much.○ The Cryo element: replaces slag, feels more satisfying to use - you can immobilise enemies then deal increased damage to them. I really wish the player character wouldn't spout cheap ice puns when freezing an enemy though.○ The grinder: insert 3 weapons, get a randomly generated, usually higher tier one. Basically another form of gambling, I got several legendaries from it.There are also new playable classes (which I think may be better than in BL2) and new enemy types, some of which are a real pain in the bottom. Some BL2 enemies make an appearance, but they're not re-used nearly as heavily as BL1 enemies were in BL2.Overall this is an ok game, it's worth playing but definitely not paying the full price for.

												I really do wish to recommend this game but the issue I'm having is whom I would recommend this game to. It is by no means a bad game! I actually do like it. But it suffers from one MASSIVE flaw...The Pre-Sequel is NOT anywhere as good as Borderlands 2.The two factors that made Blands 2 so awesome were it's entertaining story and it's characters which were (for the most part) entertaining to play. The Pre-Sequel does not deliver in both these areas. The story is only okay, and the playable characters are fairly under-whelming, even compared to the original Borderlands game. So I was tempted to recommend maybe playing this game BEFORE Blands 2, but even that leaves a sour taste in my mouth. The fact is, Blands 2 is cheaper. You can purchase it with it's major expansions for less than this game and it has TONS more content, all much more enjoyable.So who would I recommend this game to? The only players who come to mind would be the Borderlands fans (like me) but those gamers should have already played (and been disappointed by) this game. So who else is there? Maybe, just maybe, the very casual gamer who is taking thier sweet time getting to this game, but even them I'd recommend playing all the expansions for Borderlands 2 first, and then probably just starting yet another character in that game (or the original Borderlands) instead.And just FYI, I do own two copies of this game now. I originally purchased on console to play co-op with my son, and now have it on PC because it's the gaming system I prefer. And I will play even more of this game, but I just can't in good conscience recommend anyone else to do the same.So in conclussion, my feeling is if you haven't purchased this game already, then there's really no need to at this point. Either play Borderlands 2 (and it's expansions!) or just wait for Borderlands 3 instead.			"

												As Borderlands 2 is one of my favorite games ever, I was totally psyched for Pre-Sequel, but unfortunately totally disappointed, and mainly for two very big reasons:Humor. Borderlands is all about humor and this outrageously over the top Australian humor was simply annoying. I liked Springs but even she got pretty annoying and never was actually funny. She's much better in Tales from the Borderlands btw. Borderlands without laughter is no proper Borderlands.Quests. While Borderlands 2 had side quests that sent you to new places and had unique and fun stories, the side quests in Pre-Sequel are all boring fetch quests that send you to the same identical locations over and over and over and over. Nothing makes a game more boring than that.			"

												The Pres-Sequel is an adaptation in another environment of Borderlands 1 and 2.The new are mainly: 1- A modified gravity (very fun), 2-  A new type of vehicle, a semi-air this time, 3-  a new type of weapon (laser), and finally a new element (ice), but the slag has disappeared. I must say that even if they are impact type shields , the disappearance of the famous Bee shield makes me very sad, but the legendary sham always exist. We do not know when Borderlands 3 will be developing, but CEO Randy Pitchford of Gearbox seems impressed by the heaviness of the task at hand. We have no choice but to wait.He remains that a fan like me of the Borderlands franchise, which has several thousand hours of gameplay, will found in The Pre-Sequel the same game mechanics than its predecessors but will appreciate the new environment to explore. The only annoying side is that sometimes the game becomes a maze , out of anything else.			"

												AHGH. This is hard for me. I think Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is alright BUT I think it feels like a DLC of Borderlands 2 more than a standalone.I just personally got a bit bored of it. I expect something ""new"", like how BL2 was to 1. But it felt very sameish, even with the moon atmosphere, new characters, new smaller elements (vehicles etc). ""But those changes sound good?"" You may ask. Yes, well, it really wasn't exciting enought for me. It could just be because Borderlands 2 is such a great game, and this one is only ""alright"" while still being very similar that it just feels more like a disappointment. So maybe my perception is tainted from expectation.But in the end, if you really want more Borderlands than I'd recommend it, it's not thaaaaat bad. But otherwise, it's pretty ""meh"", save your money and play one of those games you've bought in a sale that's just sitting there.			"

												If you like Borderlands 1 and love BL2 you'll likke the pre-sequel. But you really have to like Borderlands to even consider this DLC-like game. You get a whole new location (Elpis, Moon of Pandora) and new little gadgets. But in the core it's not really a full game on it's own. It's more a fleshed out version of a DLC for BL2. If you love BL2 - Get the pre-sequel. Otherwise it's not worth it.			"

												I honestly don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the opinion of other people when it comes to reading the reviews. I bought this game because of my love for the series and willingness to support the company for a possibilty at a future game and the guarentee of new content. Who gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥if it doesn't have the leaps and bounds that one assumes it should?I came for the gameplay, humour, references, and story, not to hear people whine because it isn't what they expected.Yes, this is a recommendation. Play it if you love the series, don't buy it because other people expected much more and are ♥♥♥♥♥ing about it. Support the company and maybe you might get something more out of it in the future.Honestly, enjoy Borderlands for what it is...Pop culture references and witty one-liners with dozens upon dozens of combinations for weapons and tons of things to shoot, instead of whining that there are not huge amounts of additions. Just be glad you got a continuation instead of a huge cliff hanger.Post-note: I don't care if you don't like the swearing, bugger off. I really don't care if you don't like that aspect. Either like or dislike my review. I DON'T CARE. I'm stating my stance on the game and the whiny people that are complaining that ""IT DOESN'T LIVE UP TO THE SERIES AND IT HAS NO NEW FEATURES WAH WAH"".It's a FILLER GAME. It's not supposed to be a main hurrah of the series. It's supposed to clear up the plothole between BL1 and BL2. It's much like Brotherhood and the like in the Assassin's Creed series.Stop fussing. The more you whine and complain, the less likely you'll get a Borderlands 3 or anything beyond.And stop complaining that I curse too much in my review. I don't give a ♥♥♥♥.To quote George Carlin:

												I'll be comparing it to Borderlands 2 and list cons and pros here.+Lazers (but it's kinda clanky in use and not really interesting)+Cryo weapons (fun)+Glitched (DLC) mechanics is great and should be added/expanded in any way in Borderlands 3+You got to see what happend before Jack went nuts and story shows you a different perspective.-Game is short. About 8-10 hours short if you skip most side quests.-Writing is so bad it hurts.-Where's all the humour?! It's gone!-Classes are so immesurably boring after Borderlands 2. After Krieg or Gage the only interesting dude here is...a robot. But it's mostly for coop play.  So out of all characters only Wilhelm and Fragtrap are somewhat okay-ish in terms of skill trees. Athena is really well balanced, but boring in terms of gameplay. Also, she's like Roland, but female. I wanted to say ""she has the same boring personality that Rolad possess"", but you can't use ""Roland"" and ""personality"" in the same sentence.-Season pass is a cash grab. Buy it only on discount.-Unlockable skins and heads are quite bland. Default heads are the best.-Also a couple of words about car controls and quests with time limits: they ♥♥♥♥ing suck♥♥♥♥♥♥ass♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the ♥♥♥♥ who even came up with that ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ idea that it would be great??!You should give this game a try, but only when it's on a discount. For a full price? NO.P.S. Sums up my experience with Claptastic DLC: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198003838639/screenshot/200804344080351901 "

Borderlands The Pre-Sequel ReviewThis is an extremely difficult review to write, because I am very conflicted over this game. On the one side, it's a *fairly* solid FPS shooter with loot in abundance, some good humour and great co-op gaming. One that I am sure you will enjoy playing with a few friends. On the other hand, it feels like an expensive Borderlands 2 DLC and a blatant cash grab (they will be bringing out MORE DLC for this one too, if you are so inclined).ConsAll the little annoyances and bugs from number 2 got carried over, without so much as a look at getting them fixed or changed. I have already experienced sound randomly disappearing for no reason, only to come back after I die (a bug that plagued the previous game as well). I have also had an NPC glitch on the tutorial mission, making it impossible to finish without exiting the game and coming back in. Then there is the horrendous amount of back tracking through the same old levels - surely they could just add more fast travel locations to the game? How about some form of teleport device - since we seem to be able to constantly cheat death and respawn nearby anyway? The menus are still horrendous to navigate - a remnant of it being a console port, no doubt. Boring fetch-this and go-there quests seem as abundant as ever too, I really wish there was a bit more depth to the multitude of side-quests.The new low gravity / O2 mechanic is really just a gimmick and does nothing to improve the game. All it seems to do is make for bunny-hopping gun-fights. The classes are also not that interesting. Claptrap is a completely useless character in single or co-op, Wilhelm is basically Axton from the previous game and the last two characters are nothing special either. Borderlands games have always advertised themselves as a fusion of FPS and RPG, but I was kind of hoping a little more of the RPG side of things would be brought into the games as time went on. This is sadly not the case. Customisation is limited to poor skill trees and throw-away skins that do nothing but change the basic colours of your character. The bad♥♥♥♥♥system is a neat idea, but never really seems to do much for you and I can't help but wonder if more could have also been done here as well.The humour and general feel of Borderlands 2 is here - so it is really just more of the same. This is its biggest problem. It brings nothing new to the table and looks and feels like you are playing Borderlands 2. Most of the points I have mentioned so far could be forgiven in BL2, but 2 years later, to bring out this ""expansion pack"" and try palming it off as a separate game without addressing any of its predecessors issues is just a bit much. ProsMoving on to the positives: it's more Borderlands, which surely cannot be a bad thing in itself. It's still a great co-op game that gets better with more people playing. The graphics look as good as ever and it has Handsome Jack before he was Handsome Jack - who was always one of my favourite characters in the last game. The story seems acceptable but nothing ground-breaking. It is nice to see previous characters making a come-back to fill in some gaps.The game is still great fun to play co-op, where a full-team of vault hunters is much more enjoyable than wondering around alone. The guns and loot is as crazy and fun as ever. There is also a new laser-class weapon, which is a welcome addition. ""Slag"" seems to have been replaced with ""Cryo"" weapons, which is a welcome addition, since Slag weapons became more and more essential as you levelled up in number 2 - and limited your options.SummarySo, to summarise, it's an overpriced, underdeveloped slog through similar territory - a cash-grab by lazy developers. If you can see past this and enjoyed Borderlands 2 then that will be of no consequence and you can ignore most of the cons in this review. If you, like me, expected more, then you have come to the wrong place and should wait for Borderlands 3 instead. Still, this is Gearbox afterall - who gave us Duke Nukem Forever and Colonial Marines - I guess I shouldn't have expected too much from them. It's a fairly decent game that will keep diehard fans of the franchise happy, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done.My Jimbo Rating on this game will differ based on two important factors, shown below.If you wanted more from the new Borderlands game than a lazy, copy-paste clone:Jimbo Rating: 5/10 - ""Not Recommended"" If you simply wanted more Borderlands 2 and are a diehard fan that has cash to throw at the lazy devs:Jimbo Rating: 7/10 - ""Recommended""For me, this game falls in the first category, making it a 5/10.

												""A Sleeper hit from 2k Australia!""One of the most boring, contrived, lazy and agenda-ridden games I've ever played.I feel like I came away from playing this garbage with more questions than answers but I'll try to explain my reasoning to the best of my knowledge.This game is designed to fit in around after the ending of borderlands 1. While this has numerous plotholes already, 2k Australia decided that this couldn't JUST be on the exact same borderlands 2 engine - They needed to add the most aggrivating low gravity jump platforming and useless o2 meters. The Engine is already deliberately slow - for loot hunting and team gameplay. When paired with low gravity it just makes the game so difficult to navigate. All the enemies also jump around to avoid fire within low gravity, massive parts of the game are made up purely by platforming and they even added jumppads for extra jumping - You can tell, they were proud of this mechanic. This is something they looked at during development and thought ""Hey, that is great!"". The o2 meter is useless. I don't really need to say more as it doesn't impact the game whatsoever. The game makes it out as if it is something you should always worry about, however, I can't ever remember running out of oxygen whatsoever.The plot is very bare and riddled with holes, as borderlands 2 provides a pretty concise story of events, via echo-logs, character interaction and inferred dialouge, the pre-sequel decides to throw that out of the window and rushes to make an already standard, unseen plot into a cartoony farce. In an attempt to make a fan favourite villain into some sort of hero fallen from grace.The story is also very, VERY insistant on parroting every outdated and cringey internet meme it can muster and goes to great lengths to make almost every character gay. Well over 50% of the women you find will do nothing but loudly declare their disinterest in men, while noteable male characters in the franchise are suddenly very open about their homosexuality and press it on the player.It really does ruin the immersion of the game, as other games in the series didn't do this and it feels very forced. It also goes to extremes to insult, berate and laugh at certain gender groups. It is very apparent that the writing team is able to run rampant and include their personal internet agendas into this. I don't want your social issues. I just want to do quests and find loot with friends. The playable characters are boring, one dimensional smartasses with nothing noteworthy about them. They try to tie them into the game by making some of them the sub-bosses of borderlands 2, however this just feels stupid as you mostly dispose of them with ease in borderlands 2 without a passing thought.Somehow uglier than it's 3 year old predeccesor, with bland, boring enviroments to slowly run around in. Sometimes I got confused as to where I was just because every area looked the same. The moon's surface is exacly that, with reskinned enemies from borderlands 2 roaming the surface. Insides of buildings and areas are grotty, low res technology factories. Even the main city in the game is amazingly similar. The human enemies are all the same reskinned borderlands 2 enemies but with different names and australian accents. The weapons remain virtually unchanged, however they add in laser-weapons. I can count the number of genuinely unique enemies I encountered on one hand.In short, it feels lifeless. It honestly feels so devoid of content that you could show this to anybody and they would claim it is actually very bad DLC for borderlands 2. Even as a fan of the series, I would recomend to save your money. I Bought this for £3.75, and I still feel ripped off. How depressing.________________________________________________________________________________EDIT:I've had some people personally message me and claim that ""the game gets better at max level!"" Screw that, why can't the game be good from the beginning? Why do I have to slog through this hot mess JUST so I can ""experience the full game?"" people also berated my hours in-game.I've also had a person message me claiming this review is ""sexist and homophobic"" If you feel this way, kindly message me, I can block you so I do not have to know you exist.

												This game made me sad for the Borderlands series. It has a lot of the pieces that were needed for a good Borderlands game but the endgame is just not there. If you only ever played Borderlands 2 through a single playthrough, then you'll be fine with this. If you played hundreds of hours because of the expansions and endgame bosses, you will be majorly dissapointed with this game. All the DLCs and not one raid added. Not even anything up to par with Terramorphous or Vermiverous in the base game. Not even close. They also made the acheivements griefing by making some of the challenges only do-able once per playthrough. I hope the MMOFPSRPG that they are teasing makes up for this.			"

												I can't remember the last time I was more disappointed in a game series I liked. The gameplay was tedious and felt more like a chore than an adventure and it almost completely lacked the soul of the previous games. It had a few moments, but it basically served as a story-telling device/cash-grab for Gearbox, a role that could have easily been filled by a comic series.Overall, the whole game has been completely underwhelming and I'm more or less disappointed in it. The bugs weren't as numerous as say, a Bethesda game, but still omnipresent and still noticeable. The boss fights were a joke and the combat was largely un-challenging. Combat in general was more tedious than enjoyable, though I suppose that fits in with the theme of the game. I've only played as Nisha, but her skills are grossly over-powered and I can't imagine how easy Wilhelm players have it. To top it off, I just went to the ""raid boss"" and SPOILER ALERT: It's just the final boss, only more powerful. They couldn't even be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to make a new enemy. I'm more than a little disappointed I pre-ordered it and even more disappointed that I got the season pass. I hope Gearbox enjoys the money it milked from me, because I sure didn't.Semi-related, ♥♥♥♥ Pickle and his stupid ugly face.			"

												TL;DR: It's not quite Borderlands 2, but it's still a very good game.The writing's not quite as tight. There are some spots that seem to be written by someone that laughed at Anthony Burch's work in Borderlands 2, but didn't really get it, and tried to emulate that. A lot of the writing's solid. Some is downright hilarious. But some falls flat on its face, and that's sad. I haven't had any moments with the writing that really shook me. ""Because that's what heroes do..."" in BL2 shook me to the core. This game just about hits those levels. In fact, I think I didn't get the full value of Jack's arc until the second play through. Unfortunately, some of the quests actually devalue that arc quite a bit, and invalidate some of his most important choices from a ludonarrative perspective. These are fetch quest style problems, which can be a problem in any game, but Borderlands 2 managed to make those work well. In Pre-Sequel, they betray the urgency in fundamental ways that damage the narrative. The level design hits higher points, and lower points. Some of the level design is really quite fun. They way some of the fights are arranged, it's a beautiful chaos and keeps you moving. These moments are the absolute best thing Borderlands has done in this regard. However, those are contrasted by entire areas that are rife with♥♥♥♥♥♥design. The Hyperion base is a huge example of♥♥♥♥♥♥design. The game focuses heavily on the new elements, the air, the stomp, and the double jump. The Hyperion base is a very large segment of the late game play, and it makes all those things completely invalid. There's unlimited air, there's full gravity so double jumps don't work, and stomps are useless. By the time I finally get out of that section of the game, I forget about them, and have to essentially relearn those mechanics. That stinks. True Vault Hunter Mode is... really close to amazing. The problem with the replay modes in BL2 is, they tend to ruin what makes the gameplay fun for me. You can't play balls-out, chaotic. You can't shape the encounters with well-placed sniping at the beginning of a fight. Higher level bosses become pedantic exercises in equipment and skill allocation. I hate that. In Pre-Sequel, it's the same thing as the first play through, only more. It's fun, it's hectic. I don't feel overly stressed, just challenged. My sniping stuff works great. I can rush up to enemies and unload. It's very much ""Borderlands"". Bravo. However, they didn't balance all the game this well, and where they didn't, it suffers immensely. One of the first major bosses is almost impossible in True Vault Hunter Mode, unless you're highly specced out to fight him. You can't level grind to get past him, because he's so early on, you don't have any good grind areas available. There's no opportunities to go find the right loot to make it work, either. So if you get stuck there, you're basically ♥♥♥♥ed unless you finagle getting different equipment into that save file using creative multiplayer ♥♥♥♥ery. ♥♥♥♥ that. This goes doubly so when one of your character choices favors non-elemental weapons heavily, and that boss all but requires an elemental weapon to take down. Sad. Gender dynamics? A++. So good in that regard. Mr. Torgue's friend zone joke was brilliantly constructed. I love hearing the protagonists banter back and forth. I love hearing them react to each others' class skills. I love hearing their different interactions with the NPCs. I worry this is going to make adding new characters to the game that much harder. But who knows? Ice weapons are kind of cool I guess? I don't like them much, outside of shield effects. But then again, Nisha's by far my favorite character, and she heavily favors non-elemental weapons. Stomping is fun. It's a shame they remove the capacity for it in what's probably the single biggest segment of the game. Claptrap's kind of weird as a character. I don't think the benefits of his random effects are comparable to the reliable effects of the other characters, which is sad. Nisha is absurd. Once she gets levelled up quite a bit, she becomes ridiculous and over-the-top, in ways I've never seen Borderlands characters get. I like this a lot. Athena is a fun, solid character. She's got a good range of abilities, and her special supports playing without cover, which I'm a huge fan of. Wilhelm is similarly fun. I like that his support drones kind of take the best parts of playing Axton and Roland, but gives them more complex strategic value and diversity. It's a very solid game. In a lot of ways, it's not quite Borderlands 2. But in a lot of ways, it's better. ﻿			"

												Borderlands the pre sequel simply is a fun, fast place, lootathon (my own word) i had a ton of fun with this game but there is sertinly some isues with it for one it simply is a complete re skin of borderlands 2 exept its a bit more floaty the envirements are repetitive not interesting and all look the same. This game is full of glitchs some ones quest breaking for example in one quest you have to kill small things that are reskind spidernaughts from the second game in the franchise with a laser but unfortunatly when you killed all 7 of them i think it was the mission didnt recognise that it had luckily this was a side quest but if it was a main quest that would have been the end of the game for me also all lasers exept for the beam ones are extremely op it didnt matter if it was a white rarity or a orange rarity honistly this was fun tearing down enemys like there was no tomorow. The characters are where the game shines the most in my opinon i played as claptrap he was very fun although i didnt use his skill all that often because of how unpredictable the thing you wanted to happen would a good thing is all of the side skills were exellent for him the other characters look AMAZING aswell which was fun but it wasnt good enough to play the game over again to try the other characters. The story also is very goodish by that i mean right up intil the last quarter of the game the story lachs good characters, story and interesting missions percinally my favourite part was the end which is so good i dont want to spoil it. All in all i would recommend this game but if you are new to the franchise start on the 2nd the first isnt all to good story wise aswell.			"

												Would I recommend this game? Absolutely, to anyone who likes Borderlands in the first place. Would I say it was overpriced at $60? Absolutely. But then, I'd say most any game is overpriced at $60. But it is about as good a deal as you'll find in a mainstream 'triple-A' game, and way better than all those 12-hour blockbusters that everyone seems to go crazy for.People say that Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel (BTPS?) is just ""more Borderlands."" True. But that's not a bad thing. Innovation is all very well, but once the basic mechanics are in place, what I'm looking for is more content. BTPS uses the familiar Borderlands mechanics, and dishes up a great big helping of new content. I wish more successful games would do that. If already know I like the gameplay, then more levels, more missions, more game world is exactly what I want.It helps that the new content really is good. The characters are just as clever, and just as well-voiced as before. The maps and quests aren't wildly different, but they're well-designed and they take you to parts of the Pandora system that you definitely haven't seen before. As in previous Borderlands games, the plot is mainly an excuse to fight legions of AI enemies, while you level up your weapons and your skills. It's a perfect challenge-vs-reward formula, and BTPS doesn't mess it up. BTPS does add a few novelties: the need to watch your O2 levels in airless areas; the ability to jump way up in the air; the ability to stomp back down, dealing area damage. These add to the fun, and add a bit of freshness, but BTPS  would still be a good game without them.Is BTPS a good value? I'm up to almost 24 hours of game time, with no end in sight. I've got enough new missions in my list to hit around 35 hours, and I'm sure that there are more core missions I haven't encountered yet. Call it a minimum of 50 hours. (I don't distinguish between story missions and side-missions, by the way. It's all good.) I've found Borderlands games to be pretty replayable, too. Come back for some co-op, maybe. Or start a new type of character and see what's different. Add that in and the dollars-per-hour ratio starts to look amazing.Paying full price for BTPS is a personal decision. If you're a big fan, keen to jump in, you shouldn't be disappointed. Everyone else should definitely grab the game when it goes on sale. (As I type this, the game is on for about half price. Definitely worth that much.) Yeah, it's all pretty familiar stuff, but so what? I think of it like ""Season 3"" of a TV series that I'm really enjoying. I know the stars, I know the kind of stories to expect. Familar can be great. It's like coming home.			"

												  10/10   my best (fallout series comes second) RPG game ever and also my first (borderlands 1). the refrences + the amount of guns + abilities.. etc are soooo many! and awesome. everthing in this game is pure perfect i remember when i first got this when i randomly walked into a store in a mall and bought it (first time playing it was on ps3) and boy am i happy i walked into that store. i do RECOMMEND that you start off from borderlands 1 then 2 then play the pre-sequel  if you want to enjoy the story. just so that everything makes sence to you when you finish the game :). now go on and enjoy every penny you put in this pure piece of art.

												Although this is mostly just a rehash of Borderlands 2, I still had a lot of fun with it. It was definitely shorter than Borderlands 2 and most of the humor was just recycled from previous games. It did introduce some new mechanics that I really liked. They made it so you need OZ kits to harness oxygen to breath. You can also use the oxygen as a jetpack to glide around and jump higher. They also added ground pounds where you can smash into enemies after jumping into the air. They added a few new weapon types too. In short, The Pre-Sequel is pretty much just a glorified DLC with a few new additions. That being said, I still had a good time playing it.			"

												Some people have given negative reviews on this game. Let it be known that their reviews are irrelevant and should be ignored, here's why--you can freeze enemies solid with Han Solo style laser pistols! You can glide around in the air like a lubed up moon dwelling Batman! You can buttslam enemies! BUTTSLAM THEM!!!!!!! Now if that isn't considered fun, then you must be a sad, depressed elderly hermit who enjoys playing slow paced, pixellated games from the stone age but then again, my Grandfather even enjoys this game so being elderly is no excuse. IGNORE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND THE VOICES IN YOUR HEAD! Buy the game, you'll thank me later.			"

												Oh man such a fantastic game. After putting about 800 hours or so into borderlands 2 on the 360, I had burnt myself on that game, and when I initially got this game I was still a little burnt and put it down about halfway through the story. Recently I got a new craving and started a new Athena character and oh I blazed through the game. Absolutely great side title to the series, the space mechanics are incredible fun, the laser and ice fit in perfectly and are great with my elemental build. The loot felt lacking as I won the game with guns 10 levels under as I was getting very poor loot throughout. Haven't tackled playthrough two or beyond, but I feel hungry for more of this game and the story felt very good, watching the perspective of handsome jack. Sure somethings felt a bit forced or played or too coincidental, but it was fun, it was exciting, new, and I had a blast. Highly recommended to any borderlands fan, and this just makes me so much more excited for borderlands 3.			"

												Although this game is a fun play it does not live up to the Borderlands legacy. The difficulty curve is really messed up, the maps are rather poorly designed and there are not enough fast travel stations to make the gameplay fluid. These things added together sometimes inspires unnecessary frustration and will probably kill the fun for some.That being said the humor we have come to expect is still there and most of the dialog is entertaining. Since much of the humor is clearly colored by the australian development team it might go over the head of some.In short: Borderlands the pre-sequel is not of the same quality as either of the previous games, neither in gameplay or humor, but it fills a hole in the storyline and lets you play with some entertaining new characters.I recomend getting it on sale as it is not worth the full price.

												the game tried to stop me from playing as Claptrap10/10all silliness aside, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is actually worth playing, but not for the $60 price tag. Get it when it's on sale, like I did because I got the entire game (base game, ""Jack"", Aurelia, The Holodome, and the Claptastic Voyage) for about $25. The game is really well-done and here is a list of why I recommend this:1) Great number of missions2) Bosses are fair3) All six new Action Skills and their accompanying Skill Trees are useful (my personal faves are Claptrap's ""VaultHunter.EXE"", which mimics the six skills from BL2 (then adds some like Pirate Ship Mode and Laser Inferno which includes a giant disco ball), and Aurelia's ""Cold as Ice"" (she sends out a shard of ice that homes in on enemies. Press the action key/button all you like until the duration runs out. It's f^&*ing awesome))4) The new Cryo element is fun to use and easy to learn and utilize (it also acts similarly to Slag from Borderlands 2)5) And the Glitched weapons (found in Claptastic Voyage) are neat and really useful			"

												It's a really fun game, especially for me because I am in love with the characters you get to play as. Nisha, Wilhelm, Claptrap, Aurelia, and Jack are all such solid classes. Athena is okay, but in my opinion she's the least interesting. Anyways, gameplay is a just what you would expect from a Borderlands game: shoot the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything and get tons of loot. Also, if you love the lore of Borderlands than this is a great game for youAs a die hard Borderlands fan, this game hyped me up to extremes. I bought two copies and I honestly was a LITTLE let down. Just a little bit. I'll make a scrambled up list for my own pros and cons for anybody who shares my thoughts. I've bought all of the dlcs so I can try and review them too.BASE GAME:pros- Solid story, it adds a lot to the world they've created.- Motha. Fuggin. BUTTSLAM? Fun as hell dudes.- The Oz kits and air system is a cool add, easy to control like it doesn't exist, but I can appreciate it anyways.-No gravity, you spend the whole time on the moon. When I go back to playing Borderlands 2, I immediately miss flying through the air.- The game is well-optimized. I remember it being pretty buggy here and there at launch but they resolved it quickly.- You get to learn more about Jack, since he's your boss. Same with Nisha, Wilhelm, Claptrap (especially in his dlc) and it introduces new characters like Timothy Lawrence (Jack's body double) And Aurelia Hammerlock, the sister of Alister Hammerlock. It also reintroduces old characters from previous games, such as Nakayama. Jack's #1 fanboy.- Funny and super amusing dialogue from the characters you play as! I'm so happy they have playable characters that can now talk, and NPCs all react differently for each character thanks to their personalities.- If you're a gun nut.... yeah. This game.- Jack's body double. Best. Character. EVER. (Same with Aurelia)Cons- The game raises more questions than answers. I'm guessing they are gonna do a lot in Borderlands 3 though, this definitely hypes for the third.- A lot of the bosses are forgettable. They all seem to have very weak qualities that sets them apart from another. Borderlands 2 had amazing unique qualities to their bosses. - I think this game tries a little too hard to be Borderlands 2, it tries to be wacky, and zany... but the execution left a lot to be desired. -There aren't many character depths, usually when you meet an NPC that's all you get. Borderlands 2 had a lot of awesome npcs and characters that everyone fell in love with, you just don't get that in this game as much. -The only memorable characters this game introduced would be Janey, Pickles, Felicity. That's about all I can remember off the top of my head.- I compare this game a lot to Borderlands 2, which probably isn't fair, but compared to the second game, this game's quests are lackluster. - Wilhelm's class is kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, if you're looking to play someone like Axton. His trees leave a lot to be desired. He was my main for a while and he is WEAK as hell. I quickly switched to Jack' though and don't regret it.CLAPTASTIC VOYAGE:[/b]pros- It breathes SO much life into the game.- It's fun, mesmerizing for a dlc based around CLAPTRAP.- Brightly colored digital world, you get to see a lot of cool stuff happening and it's just hilarious.- The whole DLC requires you to travel inside of Claptrap. It sounds 'wtf' at first but the moment you dive right in, you are guaranteed to have tons of fun. - It's comparable to Tiny Tina's dlc for the second game. It definitely isn't at that godly on a level, but this game needed a good dcl and Claptastic is just that.- That end cinematic though. It made me love Claptrap. This game will probably turn everybody to loving that stupid robot.- Great dialogue, awesome soundtrack.- YOU GET TO REVISIT ZONES FROM THE FIRST AND SECOND GAMES!- This DLC also answers a lot of questions instead of raising them. IT'S WORTH THE MONEY, TRUST ME.cons-Last boss fight is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and I know it's gonna be hard when I do it on UTHM. pray for meThe Holodome Onslaught:[/b]No.Don't buy it. It's awful. The only semi-decent things to come out of this stupid dlc are the skins I guess. Basically you just fight in a big dome, that's it. There is literally nothing to it. It's not the fun kinda fighting, either. The area is TOO big and you have to kill everybody to go to the next level. It's long, tedious, and the rewards aren't worth it. You get some audio logs from Axton and Gaige but that's all that it brings to the table. Awful DLC. Just look up all the audio logs and you'll be up to date on what's going on with them. "

												Would I recommend this game? Absolutely, to anyone who likes Borderlands in the first place. Would I say it was overpriced at $60? Absolutely. But then, I'd say most any game is overpriced at $60. But it is about as good a deal as you'll find in a mainstream 'triple-A' game, and way better than all those 12-hour blockbusters that everyone seems to go crazy for.People say that Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel (BTPS?) is just ""more Borderlands."" True. But that's not a bad thing. Innovation is all very well, but once the basic mechanics are in place, what I'm looking for is more content. BTPS uses the familiar Borderlands mechanics, and dishes up a great big helping of new content. I wish more successful games would do that. If already know I like the gameplay, then more levels, more missions, more game world is exactly what I want.It helps that the new content really is good. The characters are just as clever, and just as well-voiced as before. The maps and quests aren't wildly different, but they're well-designed and they take you to parts of the Pandora system that you definitely haven't seen before. As in previous Borderlands games, the plot is mainly an excuse to fight legions of AI enemies, while you level up your weapons and your skills. It's a perfect challenge-vs-reward formula, and BTPS doesn't mess it up. BTPS does add a few novelties: the need to watch your O2 levels in airless areas; the ability to jump way up in the air; the ability to stomp back down, dealing area damage. These add to the fun, and add a bit of freshness, but BTPS  would still be a good game without them.Is BTPS a good value? I'm up to almost 24 hours of game time, with no end in sight.

												This is a hugely biased review as I am a huge fan of the Borderlands series so I absolutlely love this game! I knew it wasn't Borderlands 3 when I bought it and I feel that Gearbox/2K was striking while the iron was hot in releasing this. There are few improvements compared to Borderlands 2 and overall I find it to be very engaging and funny. I feel like it's an extension of Borderlands 2 as the gameplay is the same and main/side missions reward completion are the same. There are farmable bosses and a variety of different things you can do to get legendaries. 10/10 would recommend.			"

												is this a lot like bl2?yesis that a bad thing?not reallyi found bl2 to be a pretty enjoyable game, and the presequel gave me the same impression. it's fun, and a lot like bl2 to the point i don't blame a lot of people for seeing this as more of an overpriced dlc. really the only reason i ended up getting it so soon after it released (at least soon when it comes to me who gets games at least a year after they come out) was because i got it for christmas. i opened the gift like 'oh♥♥♥♥♥♥i forgot this was on my amazon wishlist might as well play it'.so i did, along with a little bit of research on the way. while i was waiting for it to install, i told my friends i got it and they were like '2k didn't even wanna make this so don't think of 2k as a bad company because of it' even though i forgot 2k was even a company. another borderlands game wasn't supposed to come out until 2016, and hearing that i immediately assumed that the game was gonna feel pretty rushed. while it does, i didn't feel like it messed up the experience too much for me. i like to call this game a very safe release. they wanted to profit off of the ip they already had without screwing it up, so they just recycled the formula from bl2 if i had to guess. if that's not it, i guess it could be used to tide people over for bl3? whatever, either way what i'm trying to say is i feel like the reason why it's basically just like bl2 is because they wanted to make it just like bl2. there are differences, but these differences are pretty minor. these differences are all things everyone knows about: butt slams, cryo, and lazers. lazers would be more satisfying to use if they were more prone to having high fire rates, but unfortunately the vast majority of them seem to have fire rates between 1-3 with the exception of moxxi's vibrapulse. (which i'm really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about them nerfing. it might just be me but i really don't see the point in nerfing anything that makes the game easier to play if the only competitive option you really have is duelling over loot with your friends.)this is in vast contrast to butt slams and cryo damage which is pretty universally satisfying. (of course, cryo only goes for if you have a high chance of freezing people but that should be a given for any elemental damage.) i especially find it fun to butt slam someone and watch the rag doll physics kick in as they fly off into the void nothingness of space. it's also fun to freeze someone before slamming your♥♥♥♥♥on them so they break into pieces. what's hilarious is slamming into a huge group of enemies telling them to shut the ♥♥♥♥ up and they freeze to death. they're little additions that make the game a bit more fun in some parts, but still overall not much of a difference from bl2.there are a few more things aside from the slow fire rate on lasers that make the combat system a little less satisfying though i gotta say. flying enemies are annoying. rakks were annoying in the last game, and now you have to deal with the bootleg rakks and ♥♥♥♥ing bandits with jetpacks. 'who's shooting at me i can't find them oh it's because they're floating great'. while the immediate instinct is to kill them while they're in the air, again, it's pretty annoying because whatever loot they might drop you have no choice to miss out on because it falls into the many voids of this space place. there are a lot of drops you end up missing, actually. it's usually not weapons, but more likely money or ammo that just floats away after you open any box. but this is zero-gs so i guess that's how things behave in that atmosphere? hell if i knowloot also feels a lot less...invigorating? that word sounds weird to use, let's just say exciting. loot chests feel less exciting to open. odds are what they have is♥♥♥♥♥♥and you can just buy something better in a vending machine. it feels pretty insulting that i'm supposed to be kind of adventuring through the moon looking for these loot chests that have these awesome legendary weapons when i'm only a level 5 and whaddya know there's an orange weapon for sale right here. (adding insult to injury you obviously can't afford these things at these levels like what the ♥♥♥♥)okay last but not least i guess i'll talk about the plot(?). i'm not saying that fps games always have to have this extraordinary plot that'll break my heart, but what a disappointment. i'm not spoiling anything don't worry, kiddos. just saying that the ending was super abrupt. the game felt a lot shorter than bl2. i'm guessing it wasn't but it just felt like it was. it probably just does because in bl2 i was in a 3-player campaign while in pre-sequel i was by myself. i dunno. it was also pretty annoying to hear so many australian accents. i don't have a beef with australians, it just feels pretty stupid to be like 'remember us? we're 2k australia we're the ones that made this game this is our thing we did it with crayons and elmers glue aren't we cool?'.at the end of the day, i'm just gonna say what everyone else is gonna say.don't buy itnot nownot at full pricewait for it to go on sale for like 30 bucks then by all means but until then keep playing the dlc in bl2 unless you're super impatient and you feel like you absolutely have to buy it asap then fine waste your allowance don't say i didn't warn you			"

A Decent Expansion To Pandora's Colorful WorldBorderlands: The Pre-Sequel was a highly anticipated game, especially after the massive success of its gargantuan predecessor. Without DLC's, you play one of four in the band of misfits—most of whom show up as antagonists in Borderlands 2. Each person has their own motive for working as a group; some want to be heroes while others just live for the thrill of it. There's better mobility, new weapon types, money is actually useful to get loot, women who love women, Claptrap, and your excessive collection of guns can actually be used in a vending machine called ""The Grinder"" to rely on RNG to make a better gun. There are some intuitive changes and upgrades to the game. Skill trees have changed, giving you new abilities such as double jump and the skill to be like Kirby and do a butt slam in order to make a quick descent. Everything I loved about Borderlands 2 mechanics were built into the game—from higher tier modes with great loot drops to fun easter eggs.However, there was a lot wrong too. The writing suffered with the different team, opting for censoring profanity that broke immersion from the coarse world of Borderlands. Some jokes were more cringe-y than funny. The progression is significantly slower because it was padded with boring fetch quests. The new terrain was beautiful but seriously lacking in save points; someone else said it's like the game wanted us to die and restart from the beginning. They hit the nail on the head. Raid bosses were one of the highlights of Borderlands 2—and there was only 1 in TPS that was on a predictable respawn timer. As with any Borderlands game, I also strongly recommend playing this with friends. Otherwise, it will get boring really fast.So did it live up to the hype? Yes and no. It answered a lot of questions but it also left a lot of questions unanswered. If anything, the game is more worthy as an expansion to Borderlands 2 than a standalone game. I'm recommending it if you love Borderlands 2 lore and have a really strong desire for more Borderlands content. I also recommend playing this first if you want to appreciate Tales From the Borderlands more; many characters show up from this game and Borderlands 2.7/10			"

												If you've never played Borderlands 2 then you should buy this game, it has a great story, great characters and some pretty funny dialogue and quests. But if you're like me and spent waaaaay too long playing Borderlands 2 then the amount of recycled content makes the game boring and bland mostly because if you find any loot in a chest you can almost guarantee you've already used it in Borderlands 2. Apart from the new laser gun type which are a refreshing new adition to the formula but unfortunatly most of the unique lasers all feel the same and some are still OP after nerfs. You still get a fun co-op experience like you do with the first 2 games though with 6 unique classes that all feel different and have different story dialogue to help the MANY playthroughs feel fresh. Still no raid boss though, no respawnable bosses and very few new legendaries outside of laser guns. 7/10 - Buy it on sale			"

												I'm reading a lot of negative reviews for the game, and I can see the point all of them are making. Does the game have a few issues? Sure. Does it make it not worth playing? No. I feel like if you really enjoy the series it's really worth playing through. You get to play characters from BL2 that you otherwise would have no clue what their whole backstory was - Nisha and Wilhelm especially (not going to lie, Wilhelm made me have a feels moment when you realize there is nothing human left about him... even if he didn't care).All in all, if you've played the other games and enjoy them - give this a try. With it being on the summer sale right now you have no reason not to! Great deal if you get it with the season pass. I'm even envious that for only 5 bucks more you get the game and pass all in one go seeing as I have to pay 20 bucks for the pass myself.GO SHOOT SOME FACES.			"

												Borderlands is a great game.  Borderlands 2 is a great game.  Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, isn't a great game and that's the problem. Overall Borderlands The Pre-Sequel returns to the hole too many times.  I don't know if it's a lack of skill, a lack of design, or a lack of writing, but the Pre-sequel just isn't that memorable a game. I played through the entire game on PS3, and booted it up again on PC about 6 months later, and to be honest.  What I remember of the game isn't a good thing.  There's innovation here, but it's not good.  The idea of Oxygen is a novel concept but it seems to be thrown out just to change up the pace of the game, not because it's a good feature.  The New classes are weak, and there's really two types of players.  The guys who like Claptrap and play his class (which is interesting though gets annoying) and the people who don't which use the other three classes (plus DLC).  The thing is, the classes in Borderlands 2 were evolutions of the the classes in Borderlands, and that's a safe bet.  I'm sure it's been criticized for not innovating enough, but the thing is, I didn't like any of the classes in this game.  I wasn't drawn to them, except claptrap and even then his skill is a bit too random. The story though is what I feel like is the biggest problem, now Anthony Burch has been funny, but I've found that while I still enjoy the original Hey Ash Series, and Borderlands 2, I haven't really liked anything he's done after Borderlands 2.  I don't know what changed, and it'd be easy to say ""he ham fisted social commentary into the game.""  and yes he did that quite often.   However, social commentary can be done well, the problem is even when the social commentary isn't being pushed in your face (which does happen).   The script of The Pre-Sequel isn't that interesting.The game revolves around one of the best characters in the series, Handsome Jack.  It even has a doppleganger of Jack as a playable character DLC.  The problem is Jack is never the same as the previous games.  Everyone remembers Butt Stallion, that line sealed Jack's personality as awesomeness. Jack's never there, I don't remember a really good scene or line from Handsome Jack in the Pre-Sequel, and he's there to carry the ENTIRE game.  In the other games, you're going up against him, now you spend more time with him and he's less.  It's not an over abundance of great lines that ruins it, it's that there's not really a great line, that ever makes you like the character as much as you did in the previous games.Of course there's a number of other characters that have completely changed and that's a problem too, the social commentary is placed on a number of popular characters like Torque, and such, but this is a prequel, so the over the top characters, have a conscious in this game, but no explanation why they changed from the touchy feely version of the characters, to the insane characters later in the series. However this isn't a problem of ""the writing is bad"", because the game itself just.  It's a shadow of the previous two games, and never rises to the heights of the previous game.  Most of the quests are dull, the flow of the game is disjointed, and the final battle is... insanely hard, especially if you try to solo it.Now, if you absolutely loved Borderlands and Borderlands 2, then yes, you should grab the pre-sequel, but personally I would have prefered a second run through of Borderlands 2, rather than playing this.  However I did buy it on the PC, as part of a humble bundle, so I could get the DLC and finally play that.  Though as I do that, I'm reminded that the main game, just doesn't stand up to the other two entries in the series.			"

												First off, I'm not very good at making reviews and this is the second time I make a review of this game cause I've learned alot since last time, and Im sorry for any spelling errors I make, if there are any big ones and you are a crazy grammar nazi just point them out to me and I'll fix it.The way the game is played compared to Borderlands 2 is quite different but while still keeping that Borderlands feel to it, the new feature of Oz kits and cryo elements make it a bit unique. But gameplay wise, being on the moon and using those Oz kits make it so you can  fly further, jump higher and do butt slams on enemies, it is a big new feature and I like it's in there.Now I have completed the first playthrough with every character (except the newest one) and gotten the Lawbringer to 60 an wilhelm to 50, but I still don't get that kind feel like I did in Borderlands 2 each time I finished a playthrough, don't feel like I've really done anything productive and I don't really know what to do next. That brings me to the dialogue, honestly the dialogue can get quite repetitive and annoying cause you can't skip it and some are pretty long (1 to mention is the side mission where you help nurse Nina find a lover and each time you found 1 you had to wait through the dialogue then pick up the stupid flowers afterwards, many times I started making my way to the next point then realized I forgot the flowers.)Now the DLC, so far the DLC has honestly.... been quite crap, 2 playable characters and 1 level upgrade with a slaughter dome thing. and the season pass promised 4 DLC, 3 have already come out, and on the page is says ""all DLC will be released before October 2015, It's just February and they already released almost all of the ones they promised from their season pass. I really hope the last one is an actual playable DLC with a story (and I have heard it's going to involve something about Claptrap)The 4 new playable characters in the game, Wilhelm, Nisha, Claptrap and Athena all have these brand new kind of abilities that are all cool and unique in their own way and also how all the skill trees can effect all kinds of things, like with wilhems you can slowly make him into more of a robot the more you level up, with Nisha in the bottom of the middle tree you can dual wield any pistols you hold in your hands, with Athena there's not much there but you can make your shield do all sorts of cool stuff, and then Claptrap is kind of that main co op character, there is kind of an entire tree just for co op and at the bottom of 1 of them there is a skill where you can high five a player and get some extra stats for some time. Also with the DLC characters making them 6  now with Handsome Jack and Aurelia it makes it so you can play the story way more times and get all these cool new things. (but honestly I'm not a big fan of Aurelia's skill, I just find it kinda meh tbh)The story in this game is pretty interesting, it shows how Handsome jack got to power and how he became a crazy psychopath,  and I do think this game does actually have alot to do with Borderlands 3  That is the guardians of the vault, as you saw in the end scene of the game where the alien looking creature said they would need all the vault haunters they could get cause some mass force is coming, or something like that Though it may seem like I'm kinda just crapping on the game, I do actually really like the game and I'm a bit of a sucker for Borderlands and these kinds of farming games. I probably will keep playing this game, but probably not as much as I played Borderlands 2 cause I just reeeally loved Borderlands 2 and could play that for hours without getting tired of it.Overall, if you are a big fan of the Borderlands series, I would recommend it but be advised the dialogue in like the first 2-3 playthroughs are cool but after that gets kinda annoying. Also if you are looking for a good game to just chill with your friends I definitely recommend this game because this game seems to kinda involve a lot of cool co-op experience at to be honest kinda feels like this game was just made for co-op, though the story is educational for the hard core borderlands fans.

												Was the one thing you thought was missing from the Borderlands saga platforming?  If yes, then this is the game for you.  If no, then there is not enough here to warrant full game price imo.  The pre-sequel isn't terrible, but it isn't great.  The game was farmed out to a second rate studio and it shows.  Wait for the steam sale, more content, and more friends to play it with.   p.s.,  I especially 'enjoyed' the first major boss Deadlift.    p.p.s.  The quotes around enjoyed above are sarcasm.  ;-)			"

												SPOILERSI would recommend this game, but its one of those games you can play once and never play again. Its not as good as borderlands 2 which you can play repeatedly and not get bored of, mainly because this game lacks a exciting story. The story could be amazing but I feel how Jack becomes evil is sort of rushed and not well executed, for example, it would have been much better if Jack had done good deeds but then for the player to realise these were for bad intentions. The maps, I hate to say, are too big and arent filled with enough stuff to keep the game exciting.However, there are still some funny parts, especially how the 'story' is spoken to different vault hunters on each playthrough and some references are funny. Also it is a borderlands game so it still has the slightly maniac and psychotic playthrough with the addition of finally seeing the eridians!Its a good game, I would recommend it, but for most, this is one time play game so dont spend too much money on it!

												If you liked Borderlands and loved Borderlands 2, this one is like their ugly step-brother that you have to wipe his chin every few minutes because he drooled.The jokes are mostly not as good as in the original 2 games, the quests are somewhat boring and towards the end i found myself thinking ""when is this finally over"".It is an OK game, sure, but if you compare it to the other 2 games, which you have to do, because it's got the name in it, then it is really lacking everything. Get it only if you want to get all Borderlandsgames, but if you are on a budget and only want to play the good ones, just get part 1 and absolutely the second part of the series, ignore their australian drooling stepbrother.

It doesnt really feel like a new game, and they were very lazy in making this game, they reused many things from BL2.It's basically BL2 in space with new characters.			"

												I heard from a lot of people that Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel isn't as good as the first or second Borderlands games, but honestly I'm finding that's not true at all. This game is just as good as the previous two. The class are fun, the story is engaging, and the weapons are just as great. It works nearly identically to Borderlands 2 as far as gameplay goes, with the exception of the additional oxygen feature.I thought at first that the oxygen feature would be tedious, but it's honestly not that big of an issue. There's no micromanaging involved, and oxygen areas are easy to come by. The butt bounce it provides is tons of fun, especially with an elemental Oz kit, and the option of much-quicker resurrection of teammates using your oxygen supply is invaluable in a team setting.There were only a few things I found wrong with the game. The soundtrack isn't nearly as good as the previous titles' soundtracks. Though I haven't yet finished the game, there doesn't seem to be as wide as range of areas to explore, especially compared to Borderlands 2 and its DLCs, but the story is interesting enough to make up for that for me. It's interesting to see the character development that Jack goes through on his descent toward Handsome Jack. The addition of Cryo-- or ice elemental-- weapons is fantastic as well, especially when pared with the DLC Aurelia Hammerlock class, which has a whole skill trees devoted to Cryo damage.Overall, if you loved the previous Borderlands games, this one is a great addition to your collection. Don't pass it up, especially if you can snag it during a sale.			"

												A recommendation, but not the strongest one.The characters are much better designed and balanced, boss battles are more interesting, the new weapon type and element are fantastic, the memes are reduced, vending machines are worth looking at, the eridium analogue is easier to obtain, and UVHM is much better balanced. The writing is about on quality with BL2, for better or worse, and the new characters are divisive at best. Unique NPC dialog based on your character is also long overdue. The Claptrap DLC is also some of the best gameplay in the series. This game's ""pink"" weapons are more easily obtained than BL2's Seraph weapons, and much more interesting. For the players who refuse to Gib, the Grinder provides a fantastic option for turning their terrible legendary drops into something more interesting without farming.On the subject of DLC, the game is free from the cosmetic skin nickel and diming that BL2 suffered from, and the Season Pass is much less confusing in terms of what you get. The only DLC that it doesn't contain is the Shock Drop Slaughter Pit (for some reason), a location that provides standard slaughter arena fare. There's a lack of expansion compared to the four major DLCs of BL2, though the Claptastic Voyage is easily better than all but three, and a strong contender for best DLC of the series.The biggest strikes against the game is the level design and Fast Travel location. There are many places that are too large, or send you back and forth without any quick travel options. There are several locations in dire need of Fast Travel (Veins of Helios and Subsubconscious stand out). The oxygen system isn't bad, though it does lead to some floaty combat that can be annoying. For the completionists, several of the badass challenges are completely awful and give you only a single chance per playthrough to complete. On a nitpicky note, the game really needs to stop censoring its non-robotic swearing.TPS is a good game, one I've happily invested over 100 hours in. I wouldn't call the game better than BL2, though the two certainly belong in the same room. The game is very much worth picking up and playing, though the recommendation only becomes particularly strong when the game is on Steam sale. Just be sure to grab the Season Pass, for the aforementioned Claptastic DLC and two solid characters.			"

												While the core mechanics are the same as Borderlands 2, the main features that set it apart from the 2nd feel poorly implemented and become annoying. Combined with extremely poor level design and far too many glitches, whether they're fixed in later patches I do not know, I cannot say this is a better game, nor an improvement anywhere to be honest. I can't even say I want to do a second play through as the first is not very enjoyable beyond the story, which is a borderlands story. That's really all it has going for it.			"

												When I first saw this game, I wasn't sure if it would be good. It looked like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ copy of Borderlands 2, just with lazers and less gravity. And, luckily, I WAS WRONG.STORY (no spoilers)In this game you discover what happened before Borderlands 2, but after Borderlands 1. The reason I put the sentence that way is because it is way more connected to Borderlands 2. You discover how Handsome Jack turned from a low-level guy to a leader. You will see some familiar faces while you do it.GAMEPLAYJust like with previous games, this is a Role-Playing Shooter. So, you can choose which character you want, which skills your character will have, and which swella items will your character use.GRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCE]This game, just like BL2 and BL1 uses cel-shading. It's a specifc graphic style that makes everything look cartoon-ish. Not in a bad way, though. It performs really well, even on my old♥♥♥♥♥2007 PC (and my gtx 960 pc)CONCLUSIONAny Borderlands fan needs to get this game. If you haven't played Borderlands before, I recommend you play BL1 and BL2 first. If not, then just BL2.			"

												Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is a sort-of sequel, sort-of pre-sequel follow-up to Borderlands 2. It is made by a different studio, the Australian studio for the development team, and it definitely shows. A lot of people dislike this game, and I'll be honest, I did too at first. I wasn't 100% sure about the accents, but they grew on me and I enjoyed them a lot. The main issue I had was the movement in the overworld before getting the upgraded vehicle. It's a little tedious, and I found myself often falling off of things and having to re-do journeys, which I found slightly annoying. However, that is a problem only for a few hours, and once gotten past, the game was very enjoyable. The story was solid, the characters hilarious and diverse and brought some incredibly interesting backstory to a lot of the characters we knew from Borderlands and Borderlands 2. Plus, the Claptrap DLC is incredibly fun and well made, as is generally all of the story-driven Borderlands DLC.A definite recommendation from me. Nilesy			"

												Borderlands is BorderlandsIgnore the ones saying it is like a DLC bla bla bla, it still has the same good old humour and borderlands feel. The characters feel well made up and so does the story line, I mean who doesnt want to role with Handsome Jack one of the best characters. If you like Borderlands buy the game and have endless hours of fun with no gravity, laser guns and four new interesting and unique characters. You play through one character to get the feel and then you move onto the next and then the next. I would imagine the DLC will be just as good as the old ones aswell.A must buy for Borderlands fans.			"

												What a disappointment! The game was short, the levels dull, the missions boring, the fights easy,  the cinematics virtually nonexistent and the characters annoying as f*ck.  It's like a really bad long DLC.  Definitely not worth $60!How Gearbox allowed this to be released is beyond me. Oh wait, no it's not; cash grab!In their defense, I've only played through the game once.  It's possible I might find it slightly more enjoyable the second and third time around but I doubt it especially since the game appears to be severely unbalanced;  I reached chapter 12 without dying once, then the game become so difficult I was forced to do side missions or play online. I beat the game at level 27 I believe, meanwhile my main weapon of choice was a level 16 laser gun (the one Moxxie gives us) even though I had a level 22 legendary.. WTF?!All along, while playing, I kept thinking ""ah, things will pick up, the next mission will be more exciting"" and then I saw the end credits and my heart sank! I seriously thought it was a bug in the game, I could not believe it ended just like that.  THAT was the final boss fight?! LOL!If you're new to Borderlands I highly recommend starting with BL2.  Once you're done that, get ALL the DLC (they're all good, some are amazing) then BL1.  Stay away from this, only get it when you're bored with everything else and need a fix, but even then I would only pick this up if under $20.I'm sorry but the best part of this game was the intro video which can be seen on youtube at 1080p anyway.

												I'm a big fan of the Bordelands series so it was very interesting to get some more Jack-story. The world is smaller then earlier games, but I still enjoy this game. Cool playable characters, Claptrap must be my favorite! Try to hold an eye on your mission log when you're doing quest to avoid feeling like you go back to the same are over and over again. Second playthrough was better that first because of this. Third playthrough is the best :D			"

												If you enjoyed the other games in the series, I'd highly recommend this one. Even if you haven't played the others, it's a great RPG-type first person shooter.

												Borderlands TPS (The Pre Sequel) isn't a bad game, but it fails at making a compelling value proposition, being unable to justify it's expensive $60 price tag.In my review below, I spend most of my time complaining, and I've given this title a thumbs-down/Not Recommended. That being said, it's still a fun game, and I like the borderland series. It's just an issue of price. This isn't a $60 game, it's a $30 or $40 game. And, until the price comes down, I don't recommend my friends buying this title unless they have plenty of disposable income.TPS is based off of the BL2 code and asset base. The graphics and menu systems are just like BL2. I consider this a positive, as the BL2 engine and game was solid. Not broke, don't fix. Gearbox/2K should have been able to take all of the experience and improvements made to BL2 over that time and apply it directly to TPS. The result should have been an extremely solid game with good graphics and technical capabilities.Unfortunately, it was a different studio (2K AU) who produced this game, and thus much of that learned wisdom was lost.On launch day, BL2 was a solid game with very few issues. The QA process was great and the result was a solid launch day game.Unfortunately, TPS QA was noticably weaker. On day-1, TPS was crashing, corrupting player saves, and there were tons of game-breaking bugs.Even two months after launch, TPS is still crashing, corrupting saves, and some serious bugs have not been addressed. Players (including myself) are running into story progression bugs that break the game. Some issues have been fixed, but many remain, and the scope of problems is so significant that I don't think they will ever be fixed.I've had my own game crash more than I can count (at least 30), while BL2 may have crashed twice in the entire 1000 hours I put into it. Progression bugs, enimies get stuck behind wall/floors/ceilings, player arms get stuck in weird positions, walking near stingrays causes wildly violent clipping, and I fearfully back up my game saves after the number of threads I've read about people having their files corrupted.TPS should have been *better* than BL2 on launch day, not worse.When it comes to level design, there's some good and some bad. The entire Helios station levels are excellent, especially the launching area, which is gloriously loud with it's constant laser fire and cannon launches. Tycho's Ribs and beyond is truely our first real vault with an actual vault, and it is as strange and alien as it should be. On the other hand, the first 2/3rds of the game has a number of issues, including level 3 players being able to find a level 30 Iwajira, a rediculously difficult Deadlift as a level 5 boss and his homing shock orbs of death and desire to ride the same two jump pads back and forth repeatedly, the unjumpable chasms of death, and more.The moon itself is somewhat barren and open, leaving some players to critisize this fact, but I don't see how that's avoidable. These levels look visually stunning and the backgrounds are beatiful, but I agree that something does feel empty about them. I attribute this to the rather non-compelling storytelling and missions during this early period of the game. For those of us who pre-ordered and were supposed to have been blessed with that awesome Abandoned Training Facility, you might be wondering just where it is? Yea, they hid it in some place half way through the game where you probably won't find it except by accident, and it mostly sucks so don't bother. It's nowhere near as good as Fink's Slaughterhouse or the Ore Chasm was. Oh, and there are no other arena areas like Fink's Slaughterhouse or the Ore Chasm in TPS at all.The most significant level design problem, however, is the lack of it. TPS is much shorter than either BL or BL2, and this is ultimately what turned me to give this title a thumbs down. We, the TPS players, paid a lot of money for a lot less game. There are fewer areas, and those areas are generally smaller or more barren. It seems like there are fewer enemies, fewer types of enemies, and overall less content. Remember that most of what makes up TPS came from BL2; they had tons of content like items and props to start with, and yet they didn't add that much to it.By the time I got to what felt like was half way through the game, I was actually near the end.The lack of levels and areas in TPS also leads to another significant problem, which is that the difficulty ramp is too steep, and in several areas players are likely to run into a progress wall where they are suddently fighting enemies which are dramatically more difficult. In all three of the Borderlands games, the first playthrough goes from level 1 to 30, and then the second playthrough from level 30 to 50. This gives you 30 levels to play through on the first go-around, and then only 20 on the second. But since there is less content and areas in TPS, the ramp-up for new enemies in new areas is less gradual. The result is that after you finish the Lunar Launching Station in playthrough 2 with enemies around level 42-43 (and lots of cover), you go to Vorago Solitude and immediately have to deal with level 46-47 enemies (with very little cover). The result is that you die a whole lot, and it's very frustrating.The four new playable characters each offer new gameplay style opportunities which I enjoy. Each has a different set of skills and when combined with different equipment lends to different enjoyable play styles.Nisha, Wilhelm, Athena, and Claptrap are all fun to play and have some great skills which lead to interesting and fun play style. They did a pretty good job here of learning from the previous vault hunter skills and then giving us new skills.Speaking of the new playable characters, the dialogue Improvements made in TPS are awesome. No longer do you have nothing to say for the entire game. Each player has their own dialogue responces to different parts of the story, and to each of the other player characters playing with you. This makes a huge difference in the game, as playing each character actually tells a different story in regards to how they view the world around them. Now you don't just have to play each character for the enjoyment of learning their play/skill style, but because it tells a new story; their story.Laser weapons are awesome, ice weapons are awesome, the grinder is awesome, and low grav/slamming is awesome. Without these four features, TPS would just have been a really expensive BL2 DLC.A number of people have asked me if the lack of oxygen on the moon is a problem Fortunately, it's not. There are plenty of sources to get air, and you are probably never going to die due to lack of O2. I am very positive on how they implemented O2 usage in TPS.In summary: +They fixed the story +Dialogue Improvements +More legendaries in vending machines +The Grinder +Cryo/Ice elemental weapons +Laser weapons +O2 and butt slamming +It's basically BL2  -High price, not worth $60 -They f**ked up the story -Falcon Punch -Shorter game with less content -Huge difficulty ramp-ups -Fewer enemies -First half of game feels slow/boring -GAME SAVE FILE CORRUPTION -Lots of crashes -Lots of game-breaking critical bugs -Lots of other non- critical bugs -Unnecessary cameos of Tourge and Tiny Tina to prop up a boring plot -Gamergate references -More internet memes -Unable to farm bosses and special enemies -Removal of True Vault Hunter Mode and reduction in level cap from 72/61 to 50 -Removal of loot midgets -Deadlift's homing shock orbs are OP			"

												Borderlands: 2 with Low Gravity, Glitches, Recycled Material and Boredom.Re-writing now that I've played more. First off, I'm a big Borderlands fan. It took me a half hour to get used to the look in the first game, and I've loved it ever since. Pre-Sequel is a ripoff as a full-price game; it should have been an expansion. Not only because of how short it is, but because of the absolute laziness put into its design. The lack of polish is immediately obvious, and laziness quickly becomes evident when you realize a lot of objects are just retextured bits from B2. I've even heard recycled sounds, as well, not to mention reused dialogue for the vending machines and such.The next thing that quickly becomes obvious is that the OZ mechanic is a complete gimmick; generally all it serves to do is pull you away from whatever tedious quest you're working on so you can rush off an find a few canisters, then trek back and complete whatever you were doing. Sometimes it's cool to shoot an oxygen helmet off of a bad guy and watch it damage his health, but generally it's much faster to just shoot them again instead of waiting for them to die. Low gravity had excellent potential, but the implementation is lacking. There's very little that makes actual use of it; most of the time it just ends up being a way of skipping over parts of a map, except when there's a half-a$$ed platforming section thrown in for no reason. But the biggest problem with the low gravity is that when you kill an enemy carrying a mission-critical object, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHERE IT WILL GO. I had to restart just a few minutes into a mission because the stuff an enemy was carrying shot into the side of a mountain out of reach. That is dumb. Balance is definitely not as good as B2. Sometimes you'll find yourself painfully outgunned, to the point of frustration (especially in early stages). I don't know how much of my money was wasted on respawns that should not have happened; many of the enemies are far, FAR more powerful than they should be. On the other hand, sometimes you'll find a rifle that can kill a scav in one or two non-critical hits.Pickles makes me want to stab my ears out. And it's particularly jarring to hear a Cockney Brit amongst all the Australians... seriously, why is everyone on Elpis Australian? There are PLENTY of non-Aussie voice actors in Australia! DON'T BE LAZY!!!I'm not homophobic. I believe in freedom. I think homosexuals should be free to marry who they want. But are there ANY non-gay couples in this game??? Seems like every other person has a same-sex partner. Maybe it's something in the OZ...Level design is alright but not very imaginative, and most areas feel tight and constricted, which makes the overpowered enemies even tougher. More problematic is that some of the levels are PAINFULLY long and not very well designed for future side missions, I.E. you'll have to run for an hour killing low-level enemies to make to an objective. It's frustrating and boring.Hitbox glitches are probably the most annoying problem of the game so far. I've run into many instances where I'll fire a full mag at someone without hitting them, at point blank range... then move a couple of feet to the side and start hitting them. It sucks. Driving is awful, but that's to be expected (one of the weak points of all the games). The worst part is that a lot of jumps are not actually possible unless you hit absolutely PERFECTLY, which is frustrating when you're just trying to relax and enjoy yourself. WHY DO I NOT AUTOMATICALLY PICK UP ALL AMMO AND MONEY AND WHY DO I HAVE TO MANUALLY PICK UP MOONSTONES?? Also, be careful opening chests... you might do what I did, not pay attention and spend 40 moonstone to open a chest full of WORTHLESS ""loot"" when I could have spent it on storage upgrades.These are not all my complaints. But I'm bored of writing about it; that's how dull this game is. Final word: Don't both playing this padded, dragging, dull, boring, buggy excuse for Borderlands.			"

												Too short, too many hidden bottomless pits with poorly angled ramps, no funny bandit voice actors. Quickly becomes the soulless grind that Borderlands 2's wit and forgiving difficulty (outside ultimate vault hunter mode) expertly concealed.Unless you're just really curious to learn more about the origins of Handsome Jack, hold out for Borderlands 3, folks.

Note: Since this game is a sequel, and in many aspects very similar, to Borderlands 2, I will assume familiarity with this and only talk about differences.Many of the reviews, as well as most forum threads, complain about The Pre-Sequel (TPS from now on) being merely a huge DLC to BL2. While this is technically correct - the engine is the same, and the gameplay is not changed so much that it could not have been done in an expansion pack back in the day - I will explain why I still think TPS is an improvement over the (already amazing) BL2 and definitely worth getting.GameplayThe gameplay formula of BL2 remains the same - shoot, slaughter enemies in amazingly creative ways, loot. However, there is one notable new feature: Oz kits and low gravity allow you to jump huge distance, slam down on enemies and even float in the air for short durations - and of course, enemies can do the same. While this may not sound like much on paper, it is a huuge improvement for the game. It really mixes up the gameplay, and to me it feels as if this is really what Borderlands needed all along.Laser Guns dont have all that much of an impact, but it's still a nice addition. Slag is gone and replaced by the (even more powerful) cryo, that still amplifies damage but also freezes enemies.In short: If you enjoyed BL2's gameplay, you'll enjoy TPS as well only more so because buttslam.BalanceEveryone who played BL2 will remember its shortcomings: Exponential scaling that, at higher levels, made every weapon with even 1 level too less and every direct-damage skill useless. Thankfully, this is changed in TPS; although scaling is still exponential, and direct-damage skills still fall off somewhat towards high-level, the effect is much less noticeable and builds based on damage skills are totally viable even in the endgame. As a consequence, the game is much more enjoyable, although the masochists among you might find it too easy at times.Class balance is also vastly improved - all classes can be OP in some way, all classes have unique, interesting skills and multiple ways to play. I consider even the (imo) least interesting class in TPS more interesting than my favorite in BL2.StoryThe story is, as is expected from a Borderlands game, obviously no high literature. But it is well-written and interesting (imo more so than the story in BL2), and the new information gained about Handsome jack's rise to power brings interesting new points of view to the established lore.As usual, there are lots of jokes, which you might find funny or not, but does this surprise you? It's Borderlands.Some people complain about ""social agenda"" forced into the game. I do not feel that this is a valid complaint, but if you are worried, head to the forums and see for yourself.amount of contentMany complaints are about how this game is much much shorter than BL2. I do not think this is a valid complaint. Yes, the game is a little shorter (as was actually announced before release), but it's nowhere as bad as people make it out to be. Keep in mind that BL2 has 4 big story DLCs and the Headhunter packs - discounting those, the story is not that much bigger.SummaryIn short, TPS is basically more of the same, but better. If you didnt enjoy BL2, you most likely won't enjoy TPS either, the differences are not enough for that. But if you did, get this game. It's worth it. "

												BORDERLANDS: THE DISAPPOINTMENTI understand that the game isn't made by the same developers, but that's no excuse to charge sixty dollars for nothing more than an expansion of its predecessor. The game is worth 30 bucks, tops. It's brutally obvious how little time and money went into developing the Presequel. The side missions are uncreative and irrelevant, the writing is muddled and idiotic, and there are tons of bugs. Basically, the whole game is an unclever reskin of Borderlands 2, recycling the same jokes and characters. I've tried to be lenient with my judgement, but there's such a clear lack of effort that I can't excuse a company as powerful as 2K for.Buy the game if you REALLY want to, but don't do it until it goes on sale.

Unlike Borderlands 2 this had little to no replayability and no emotions. There was very little difference in this and Borderlands 2, it might aswell have been a big DLC.			"

CONS: Not much to do at level cap, MANY returning legendaries (devs got a little lazy) , lots of non-responable bosses which really sucks. I hope they fix this. Only one raid boss. All in all the game is good and i am confident and hopeful the DLC will make it better.			"

												This is the biggest disappointment in my gaming experience. BL and BL2 are among of my all time favourite games, so I was expecting a lot from the third game. But it's really just a boring compilation of random fetch quests with poor storyline, mediocre humour, annoying combats and weak weapons.Sure jump pads and zero gravity is cool for the first 10 minutes, but it gets tedious soon. The maze maps with vast distances of nothingness and low quality textures, almost instant enemy respawns and circling back and forth between different way points in order to press a button or deliver a thing... it's not my picture of Borderlands fun.Even without comparing TPS to other two parts, this is a very boring game. I'd rather play Tetris than this crap.Definitely not worth the full prize, not even with 90% discount.My overall rating: 4.5/10			"

												i saw the reviews where VERY positive, i say this is either caused by deleted reviews by 2k australia or people got paid money to write something positive. if this review disappears you know 2k australia did it, the commercials stated it was THE NEW BORDERLANDS GAME YOU HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR. it aint that, it fails to deliver on every front there is, bugs that havent been fixed since the start of BL2, removal of the endgame entirely, they made bosses nonfarmable (kill once and never respawns), nerfing weapons into the ground and not including fan favorites of the previous game while still using the same engine as BL2. this games pricetag is 50$ but i wouldnt even consider buying it for 10$ if i knew the gameplay was this bad, hell i can be compared to hydlide. having played both borderlands 1 and 2 for quite alot of time, i can say this game isnt a borderlands game but rather a game that profits off the huge demands for a sequel, take my advice and do not buy this game. it aint worth it, dont make the same mistakes as i did. ""Additional notes: i have just tried the new DLC, it sucks too, its just a regular slaughterdome with no aditional content. im hoping the next game (if theres gonna be a next game) will be something that delivers its content as good as borderlands 2, if not, the game series is dead to me, and with dead i mean never play it again and not spending ANY money to 2k aus games			"

												So... my review for this game, at the time of writing this i've played for a total of 19 hours and plan on playing much, MUCH more.This new borderlands. for starters. is NOT a DLC of any kind... I questioned it myself for how much of a new game this would be.. how it would play.. and simular questions as quite a lot of others had as well.. but after playing it for myself I can quite happily say, this game is comedy gold.I'm a massive fan of the borderlands series, played though the first and second game many times in almost every way, I completely loved the game, and TPS is no different, it's a perfect mix of the Borderlands gameplay style, with better scaling, more fun weapons, new Oz kits systems that allow so much more in the game.Oz kits is something people feared... it's not a resourse you need to manage... borderlands is a game that is made around having fun, laughing and doing some crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥ they wouldn't add in a new system you have to worry about or die.. no.. you can go for about 2-4 minutes before your oxygen depletes EASY.. and even then, you can barely run 30 seconds without a sourse of oxygen to refill at.. not to mention of you do run out.. you lose about %0.5 of your health pre second.. so theres no need to worry at all... Oz kits just add to the fun of the game.Characters, All the characters are amazing... now some people complained there was no siren and such.. though I like it.. it's a breath of fresh air, new characters, new playstyles, everything about them in different execpt in it's basic aspects, in which they keep though the series...Aussie lingo, now this is something I can say might annoy anyone who isn't Australian.. though I am myself.. and it's the most funny mix between modern and 80 years ago, just listen to the dialog in this game had me and my friends laughing for minutes at a time, not to mentiton the new talking gun.Verticality... now this has to be one of the best new features of the game, in BL1 and partly BL2, the game was flat, it wasn't layed or have platforming all to much, the areas were often closed in, but with this game, it takes the use of the new Oz kits and places verticality EVERYWHERE, any palce in the game you go, there will be enemies all over and at different hights, it's not a simple look to the spawn location of a door and wait, it's try guess where they are going to be, keeps the game more fresh.though for a summary, I'd give this game a 9/10, for me this is almost a perfect game aside from a few bugs in it, though it's still launch week, and they need some time to fix a few things out, but overall I am loving this game, I love the fact they made the game harder, more of a challange this time around.So if you're a borderlands fan, I would recommend this game, I don't really care if people try downvote this due to the massive ♥♥♥♥♥torm that is around Borderlands, without any good reason, people can read this and decide for themself.

												The first week of playing this game I had 90 hours played total so I enjoyed it for what it was but it's not a properly worthy sequel to Borderlands 2. I know that Gearbox wanted to make this as a filler game to fill in gaps and questions fans had about the events that lead up to Handsome Jack's takeover of Hyperion, especially for people who've played both Borderlands 1 and 2, and it shows. This is just here to hold you over until Borderlands 3 comes out.Some people complain that this is just Borderlands 2 in space and they're essentially right. However, I don't see that as a negative thing since I loved Borderlands 2 (I have approx. 400 hours into that game). I expected it to be nothing else actually. It's a Borderlands game. It should look like a Borderlands game and it should play like a Borderlands game, and it pulls that off perfectly. When you go back to BL2 after playing this game you actually realize how much you miss the butt slams and the Oz kit boost ability.Now, the main problem I had with this game is that it felt way too short in comparison to BL2, especially for a game priced as a triple-A full length title. The main quest line felt too lackluster. Again, it's good for what it is but it wasn't worth €50. If it had been priced at €35-40 I could see it being a more resonable price for this game.Another thing I didn't like about this game was that there was WAY too much dialogue where it didn't need any. I'm gonna quote TotalBicuit here and say that ""it's the game that likes to hear itself talk"". It can become a bit annoying here and there and the plot points they're trying to get across to the player could either be left out completely or just be explained in a much simpler manner that didn't need 2 minutes of NPC dialogue.All in all it's a good game with minor flaws and I recommend you buy this when it's on sale.

												I can't believe I'm recommending this game.  But I am.After enduring the lackluster, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ writing of Borderlands 2, I was skeptical about the pre-sequel.  I was ESPECIALLY skeptical about the sixty-dollar price tag.  But I'm glad it all turned out well (sort of), in the end.As it happens, the pre-sequel is a more balanced gameplay experience, and much more challenging - but in a good way - than its predecessors.  Gone are the obliterating alpha strikes of badass enemies in BL2.  There are far fewer WTF gear gates and gimmicky asshats who one-shot you regardless of spec.  Now the ride is smooth, for the most part - the difficulty really spikes once you get into True Vault Hunter Mode, and the game will massacre you if you're ill-prepared.  But on the whole, things are way more fun, and ten times more mobile.The writing blows Borderlands 2 out of the water.  I hated the writing in Borderlands 2 for reasons irrelevant to this review.  The Pre-Sequel actually reduces the amount of inane nattering in your ears from characters trying far too hard to be clever (or worse, clumsily TELLING you to care about some problem or issue or person or whatever when no one has SHOWN you why you should).  In BLTPS, instead, it presents you with surprisingly dark storytelling, a nuanced world, and incredible pacing.  This game is intense, and highly economical.  Not a moment is wasted.  It's still got some very funny moments, and I find the Scavs to be far more entertaining than the Bandits of BL2.  Some of these Australians sound so authentic, it's like they're gargling a wallaby for some of these lines.  Just deep, throaty stuff.  Delightful.One of the darkest corners of the plot regards the rarely-trod avenue of artifical intelligences and the ethical treatment thereof.  I won't spoil anything, but it's chilling.The cast of characters is amazing.  Claptrap is hilarious, yet surprisingly poignant and tragic, in his own sideways fashion.  Wilhelm is a refreshing breath of stoic masculinity in a medium plagued by try-hards and wanna-be ubermenschen alpha-nerd projections.  Nisha is at first hateable and seemingly two-dimensional, but unlocking more of her backstory reveals not just a cute 'for funsies' sadist, but an actual born-again psychopath who suffered the kinds of traumas that make modern serial killers.And then there is my absolute favorite, Athena.  In a world starved for powerful, matronly female role models, Athena takes the cake - she is both sexy and professional, modest, yet bold.  She doesn't mince words, and she makes her presence known through minimal effort.  In addition to the characters being stronger, there's also a great deal more individuality on the part of the PCs - your character responds to dialogue, to other characters, and there are plenty of in-combat call-outs geared toward specific partnerships (when one player activates their special ability, the other characters call out and notice).  Little touches like these are what seperate good games from great games.On top of all that, the environments are gorgeous and colorful, and the music is a FANTASTIC retro-future ensemble - think EVE Online meets Bladerunner meets When Mars Attacks!I could go on and on.  The game is amazing.  Why it has a low metacritic score, I can't imagine.  I hated it at first for the difficulty, but once I acclimated, and changed some of my bad habits from Borderlands 2, I loved it.Give it a try.  The price tag is steep, I know.  Maybe wait until it goes on sale.  But if you can afford it?  Go for it - especially if you have friends to play with.			"

												MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.  Its the most expensive DLC on steam.  This is not a complete release.  To get the entire game, you going to have to not only pay for the base game, but also the year long subscription.  The austrailian content is amazingly boring and very poorly written.  I had some pretty big expectations for this game and was totally and completely disappointed.The game was rushed out the door, premiumly priced and totally unbalanced from level 45-50.  Its a beta.Just check out youtube, the major publishers of Borderlands videos have actually gone back the BL2 now, thats how little content their is in this game.  Classic bait and switch, I think ~$90 US is a completely ludicrous and exploitive price.			"

												A pre-review: reduced gravity doesn't mean reduced fun....or does it???  To describe it, it's a lot like tying a helium balloon around the waist of a small dog or cat and ringing the dinner bell. Or maybe more like being with your kids on a trampoline and one of them is trying to throw a water balloon at you. Or perhaps like you're skateboarding down a hill and then you realize that it was uphill instead yet you are still moving for some odd reason.  Or FEDEX delivers your package one day before you order (it can happen with Amazon Prime). Yeah, that's exactly what pre-sequel is like.  One gamer called it cool, then I realized he was simply refering to the temperature on the moon and I was misinterpreting. Sorry, that was bad - I know.  Still if you liked Borderlands 2, this adds an additional fighting dimension on a new verticle axis. If you didn't get Borderlands 2, try that first, it's epic, felt like the devs put more energy into it.  This one is more like an giant DLC in my opinion.			"

												If you're in it for the story, you may be a bit disappointed as the comedy relief in TPS falls on deaf ears. Even though Burch is credited, this game doesn't even hold a torch to the writing of BL2. It's like this game was supposed to be BL2 but they just dumped it and 2K AU decided to pick up the corpse and run with it. Perhaps Burch got fired and they decided to pin the blame on him instead. It's something I""d like to believe at least.Agonizingly, if you missed the original Borderlands and wanted to rehash everything which most players didn't like about it, then this is the ticket. Now with additional level design slop of the BL2 Season Pass where you walk on mysteriously sloped ledges which you shouldn't. Areas you should be able to traverse but suddenly implode upon entering. And my all time favorite - Enemies with jetpacks flying through walls and ceilings that can't be shot but can still shoot you. What's QA you ask? Pretty sure that the devs asked that same question and nobody knows the answer to. Oh wait, those jokes are all probably in there but not activated because they hit too close to home.While much of this game does look pretty, it's sadly frustrating and lots of the things that make this game bad will probably never get fixed like the last game. Things like the writing, but that's set in adamantium so they can't change or punch it up. Sorry.			"

												After completing the second play through in TVHM, I now feel confident that I can adequately post a review about this game.  So, without further ado, lets begin by immediately discussing the pro’s list of this game: Very good storyline that does a great job tying BL1 with BL2, Oz kits are awesome as are the double jumps, new character classes, new weapon types, new ammo types, the Grinder, and the additional commentary by all of the playable characters is hilarious! (""Remember, its not Malware, it’s a feature!"") Now, the con’s list: Borderlands TPS main storyline is  very  short in comparison to its predecessors, many of the side missions are very tedious, but most importantly the game has a very… unfinished feel to it. (This can be seen in graphics, countless glitches (characters getting stuck, suspended in mid-air, not to mention the countless times when there are multiple people playing we have noticed that walls and other objects seem to ‘tear’ and you can just pass right through them, in my case (count is at 3 now) in group play I have gotten “stuck” in a locker when searching for loot).Final thoughts: Borderlands TPS has the makings of being another great game, especially with such an imaginative storyline.  However, the short story line, accompanied by a plethora of bugs, fails to truly take advantage of what, at its core, could have been a great game. The take-away from this is to recognize that Borderlands TPS is the result of 2K, and 2K Australia,   not  Gearbox as the primary developer.I would def. recommend this game, but if you have not already purchased it, with “Tales from the Borderlands” coming out in Nov. also, I would recommend waiting until the ‘Steam’ holiday sales.Additional comments:  Many of the new NPCs all have Aussie accents and as a result much of the humor is ‘Aussie-based cultural references/humor,’  not a complaint , just takes some getting used to.

												BL2 with low gravity and more character self mutterings :D They decreased the drops in BL2, with the rares going waaaay down. Now the drops in BLtPS they are almost nonexistant. 3247billion guns in the game doesn't matter if you see the same 10-20 over and over again in 2-3 different levels with 2-3 different variations. With these ""more guns"" you don't get more inventory space either, defeating the purpose. Also, no good farming places? Concordia sure doesn't have them, atleast BL1 and 2 did. So no good farming spots as of yet. The one I did find was ""above my strength level"" lets say. Awesome, but disappointing. 7/10I keep adding because things keep♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. There's alot of ""death ledges"" and open spaces. Which sucks since all your loot seems to fall off there.I have changed from Not Recommended to Recommend ON SALE. More glitches were patched its now not based on glitches but gameplay.Full review here: http://fg-2.com/2014/10/28/review-borderlands-the-pre-sequel-prepatch-review/ "

												 Ok, firstly.. whoever thought that adding low gravity into a game based on ""killing stuff to gather loot so you can kill stuff faster"" is a nice idea - should be fired from gaming industry.. or at least have his/her thoughts sorted into something more reliable.. there's nothing better to see some shiny orange piece flying away from you into open space.. GJ on that.. Secondly, could probably adjust the models animations that's staying the same from, like, the 1st game already? (not even mentioning it looking silly and glitchy at times) Apart of that it's just ""the same BL game"". Said gravity and some new types of weapons added a little, but not as much for this game to stand out in the series in my opinion. Is it good? Is it worth it? It is, if you're looking for another shooter game to just go and pew-pew without much brains put into the process (which I prefer after a hard working day for instance). Or just to chill with your friends maybe. Can't call this a ""must-have"" but worth a try or two.			"

I yo haven't played borderlands this is a Decent start point, the classes all play fairly unique to the other games classes. Notably no siren class. The witty humor and tons of pop culture references make this game great, pair that with decent voice acting and well written story, 2K Australia has hit it out of the park for its first game.			"

It also has alot of eastereggs, and secret bosses to find. I recomend this game to whoever has played both borderlands, and likes the series. Also, I suggest getting the Claptrap DLC.....

												After playing the game for a bit, here's what I think:Pros:+ Good graphics+ Game adjusts the settings depending on your computer+ Smoother gameplay/port than Borderlands 2+ FINALLY FIXED HEALTH/SHEILD SYSTEM (FOR CRYING OUT LOUD)+ Claptrap has a ton of skills+ ZERO GRAVITY (ITS THE FINAL COUNTDOWN!!)+ Trading cards (Who doesnt want them??)+ THIS SH*T IS ARGYLE AND SH*T+ Great and balanced guns+ Borderlands humor never gets old+ MR TORGUE IS BACK+ LASERS!!!!+ Cool Loot as alwaysCons:- Not much content in Season Pass this time- The Main menu, loading screen, and display module format is the same- According to everyone, basically a large expansion pack, therefore, the game is a bit overpriced- Once you buy the game, You will likely get more hijacker friend requests. I've gotten 5 the day after I bought the Season Pass bundle- For nearly all the loading screens, the game advertises to you to buy and download their DLC - Repetitive Side Quests- WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GORE???? - Repetitive gameplay and meh story- Feels so bland for a Borderlands game. I see a lack of humor compared to the other games.Overall 7.8/10: Get this game when its more than 50% off. Even if the game was bought for $29.99 or if it was bought with the season pass for $40.50, still too overpriced.			"

												The title of the name is both humorous and well fitted for this game. A series that place between the first and second Borderlands game to get more of the story on how things really happen during the rise of Handsome Jack and whole lot more. I'm intruiged just about everything about about this game and one can't ask for anything more!The upgrade of crafting your own weapons is pretty simple and not so very complex especially when you're getting legendaries so there isn't much to say about that. Laser guns = <3. But EXPLOSIONS!!!!!!!!!!!! still = <3.The story is still funny, awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome, and still very funny! It seem less longer than Borderlands 2.The Claptastic Voyage was the icing on the cake and....not gonna ruin this, get the game!Okay, I rather keep this review short, the game is just fantastic and really worth getting.

												To those who gave this game a bad review I ask, ""Did you play the game at all?""One of the first FPS games to offer a 50/50 split on your choice to play a lady or a dude, the music is reminiscent of the first Mass Effect mixed with a little of the Tron 2.0 music track tossed in. The game play is solid and fun as one would expect from a Borderlands title, and of course this game expands on the Borderlands story (always a good thing). So in short if you like Borderlands buy this game and go nuts, because it is after all Borderlands. (Springs is awesome by the way!) Sorry fan-girl moment there.

												This game is very fun and is in competition of the previous borderlands. The story does feel rushed, so, you'd need to wait on those dlcs, but if you played this game with friends, then you will not be dissapointed. It is a good way to pass the time, and the capabilitoes of each character make them all reliable, fun to play, and actually useful when trying to grind, boss hunt, or do the raid boss. The previous game had horrendous drop rates, but this one has drop rates are far more superioir, and the possibility of getting any rare item is hightened, making it more fun. The community of this game is very generous and helpful, and you could honestly (from personal experience) gol onto any game, ask for boosting, and most players would be perfectly fine with it, after thay are done with their current objective. The possibility of actually finding a game is lower than before though, simply because not enough people have this game. A suggestion of summer sale would be good, because then many would possibly get this game, leaving room for more cooperation with many other players. Personal review, 9/10.			"

												TL;DR - worse Borderlands 2 that gets terribly frustrating and exhausting by the end missions. 4/10.And now the long one. Let's just start with stating that this is still a Borderlands game, so if you enjoyed the previous ones you will most likely enjoy this one too, especially when playing with friends. For the most of it. Then you'll get frustrated and will want to just quit this god damn game.Lets start with the missions. There are some nice ones, some quite unique and fun ones. But that's like 5 out of 40. The rest are all repetitive fetch quests that get unnaturally prolonged, because if not the game wouldn't be the half of what it is now. The worst part is that this applies not only to side missions, which are obviously always lower priority for production, but for main quests as well. Without spoiling, there was a mission that could be literally summarised to:-Go to A-A doesn't work,  you need to go to B then-B doesn't work, ok C will for sure-Well, C ALMOST works, you only need D to make it work-Ok you have D? Now go back to C-Ok C works now? ok go to B and then you'll proceed to the final part of the missionWhere story wise, it could very well and at B and be much more fun. Even worse, by the very end the WHOLE GAME feels like it is being unneccessarily prolonged, without an actual, reasonable explenation why. That leads us to writing.The humor is worse. It's got to a level of stupidity that is actually cringe worthy and embarasing. The one part that they did well - Jack's change - is kind of destroyed by the fact that I can't state my point about it. Obviously, it's always like that in games like this, you have no dialogue choices etc, but the problem is, in other games your character doesn't make a change on it's own as well. SPOILER STARTS HERE: I've started the game as a more or less good guy. I wanted to save the moon with Jack's help or as his help. Regardless, even though I might not be 100% rightous, I was still good. And that's the character I liked and I wanted to play as. Later, when Jack kills 4 scientist because he suspected that one of them was a traitor my character suddenly screams AWESOME. What the ♥♥♥♥? I mean, it was awesome in terms of building Jack's character, showing how voilence is changing him, but I never wanted my character to change with him, nor was I ever teased that it might happen. SPOILER OVER.Next topic. Loot and character progression are both done terribly. Let's just say I've finished the game with weapons not higher than level 22, as a 26 level character, fighting level 28 boss. That's not how you balance loot. I've switched my sniper rifle 3 times during over 20h of gameplay. Also I have not seen a SINGLE legendary weapon, not to mention one I would actually like and want to use. Something that also didn't help with my gear progression is that I lost a TON of items by them dropping into abyss. You'd imagine they could write a piece of code that ensures loot lands on reachable place in a game that's heavily loot dependend.Character progression can be summed up as: start with active ability, put 25 boring stat boosters after and then put an actually cool ability at level 26. Boring as hell. One thing that also needs to be mentioned here - main story balancing, combined with unrewarding loot system, pretty much makes side quests obligatory.My last big issue with the game is it's optimization - on a GTX 780 i had very frequent drops to 30-40 even without maxing all of the settings and with turning off the PhysX. Another wierd thing with it is that even when it was running at stable 60 according to Steam FPS counter, there was TERRBILE screen tearing. G-Sync helped there, but not everyone can afford it. Then, when I switched to GTX 980Ti in the middle, it was still not achieving stable 60. What the hell. Witcher 3 runs at stable 60 in 2K, while also looking much, much better.The other issues are not as big, but perhaps worth mentioning. Gearbox introduced a couple of new gameplay mechanics, for example oxygen in vaccum, lower gravity with booster jump and laser guns. Not a single one of those is actually fun. Oxygen is annoying, because for most of the game you don't care about it, only sometimes you are searching for O2 source nearby in panick. Lower gravity (which means higher jumps) would be fun if not the fact that level design doesn't seem to adjust to that correctly and multiple collisions are just a tiny bit too high to jump on them, even with perfectly timed booster. Laser guns are mostly useless (I found one that I was using for a bit, because it actually shot where I poitned it to, rest shoots wherever it wants).There was also a lot of small bugs, like lacks of collisions or incorrectly placed ones, NPCs falling torso deep into terrain (mostly lunatics after their jump attack), problems with AI - NPCs walking past me peacefully while I'm in combat with their friends or launching a jump attack at a helicopter that's over lava in one of the missions, resulting in killing themselves, graphical glitches like some wierd, glowing mesh being left hanging in the air after killing one of the opponents.To be honest it's hard to say anything good about the game aside from the fact that shooting is fun. But then the last two missions start, you have♥♥♥♥♥♥gear because of unrewarding loot system and you just want this to end, but it doesn't. It goes on and on and on for no logical reason other that boosting the number of hours neccessary to finish the game. I do not recommend this one.			"

												I really, really, really like this game. After reading reviews about it I thought 'this game is going to suck' but suprisingly it's the best borderlands i've ever played! I just completed the story once with Claptrap and I must say it has a decent storyline. The game has many many references to Borderlands 2 and also 1. It also has alot of eastereggs, and secret bosses to find. I recomend this game to whoever has played both borderlands, and likes the series. Also, I suggest getting the Claptrap DLC..... Best DLC in Borderlands history! I would give this game a 11/10!			"

												After playing the game for a bit, here's what I think:Pros:+ Good graphics+ Game adjusts the settings depending on your computer+ Smoother gameplay/port than Borderlands 2+ FINALLY FIXED HEALTH/SHEILD SYSTEM (FOR CRYING OUT LOUD)+ Claptrap has a ton of skills+ ZERO GRAVITY (ITS THE FINAL COUNTDOWN!!)+ Trading cards (Who doesnt want them??)+ THIS SH*T IS ARGYLE AND SH*T+ Great and balanced guns+ Borderlands humor never gets old+ MR TORGUE IS BACK+ LASERS!!!!+ Cool Loot as alwaysCons:- Not much content in Season Pass this time- The Main menu, loading screen, and display module format is the same- According to everyone, basically a large expansion pack, therefore, the game is a bit overpriced- Once you buy the game, You will likely get more hijacker friend requests. I've gotten 5 the day after I bought the Season Pass bundle- For nearly all the loading screens, the game advertises to you to buy and download their DLC - Repetitive Side Quests- WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GORE???? - Repetitive gameplay and meh story- Feels so bland for a Borderlands game. I see a lack of humor compared to the other games.Overall 7.8/10: Get this game when its more than 50% off. Even if the game was bought for $29.99 or if it was bought with the season pass for $40.50, still too overpriced.			"

												This game is very fun and is in competition of the previous borderlands. The story does feel rushed, so, you'd need to wait on those dlcs, but if you played this game with friends, then you will not be dissapointed. It is a good way to pass the time, and the capabilitoes of each character make them all reliable, fun to play, and actually useful when trying to grind, boss hunt, or do the raid boss. The previous game had horrendous drop rates, but this one has drop rates are far more superioir, and the possibility of getting any rare item is hightened, making it more fun. The community of this game is very generous and helpful, and you could honestly (from personal experience) gol onto any game, ask for boosting, and most players would be perfectly fine with it, after thay are done with their current objective. The possibility of actually finding a game is lower than before though, simply because not enough people have this game. A suggestion of summer sale would be good, because then many would possibly get this game, leaving room for more cooperation with many other players. Personal review, 9/10.			"

The new characters are super cool and there new abillitys are awsome! There is tons of loot and almost infinate guns. All in all the game is a little over priced but when its on sale its worth it not to mention it has some replay value! Borderlands: The Pre-Sequal an amazing game and  is a blast! (Literaly)			"

If you thought that Borderlands 2 was good, just think about that except you're on the moon, you can BUTT SLAM, actually talk back to NPC's, and um let's see FRIGGIN LAZARS EVERYWHERE. LAZER SHOTGUNS, LAZER CRYO WEAPONS, LAZER PISTOLS, EVEN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LAZERS THAT FIRE A CONTINUOUS BURST OF LAZER. Probably not too safe and could give you turbo-cancer, but still pretty sweet.

												This game is just like Borderlands 2 on the moon that you see in the games before.Its enjoyable and fun, you can easily get used to the jumping because of the low gravity, and thats one of the thing i really liked about this game, that you can get up to places where you wasn't able to get up before.The new powers, vault hunters are good and unique.The new vehicles are really strange, i don't know because of the new physics of the moon or just because they are new mechanics but they more really oddly and just simply really bad to controll.The game is short but you'll probably play it through more times to get a feel for the other characters, i can't really talk about the DLCs bacause they not intrest me, the only one that i would say that you should buy is the Handsome Jack double, that seems fun.The looting is the same as in borderlands 2, the graphics are mostly the same but theres a few better looking settings and scenes, the new mechanics, such as the cyro elemental is really fun and good, it makes the game way more enjoyable. If you liked Borderlands 2 and you want some more of that game and their characters than this game is for you, if you can pick it up on a sale its a good choice for a good value, but not for a full price copy.

												I have played through both borderlands 1 and 2 multiple times with all the characters. And while I still enjoyed this game, it wasn't nearly as good as borderlands 2. It gives you more backstory and helps deveop the characters we know and love; however, it falls short of the greatest of borderlands 2. It has the same mechanics as BL2 but with a smaller world. It is basically a huge DLC for BL2. There is no humorous villian, or exciting boss battles with various abilities. Granted, handsome Jack is in the game and the first few and last boss battles are interesting, and the low gravitiy makes everything pretty awesome but the game is somewhat dull. Most missions consist of: go there, fetch that, fix this, come back, oh it doesn't work so find another way to fix it. Anyway, I am a huge borderlands fan so despite everything I still loved the game and the crazy aussie accents. But if you're new, PLAY BORDERLANDS 2 FIRST. IT IS SO MUCH BETTER IN EVERY ASPECT AND ALL AROUND MORE ENJOYABLE. This game is rather fun, yet boring. It is best to play with friends. Furthermore, it is definitely not worth the $60 or even the $50 right now. I grabbed it while it was $30 and I believe anything $45 or below is worth it for this game. Overall, 8/10.			"

The raid boss that was supposed to take the place of terramorphous(borderlands 2) and crawmerax(borderlands) was named Iwajira or something like that was easier than ♥♥♥♥ing boom and bewm in borderlands 2 and nine toes in borderlands.  This game was way to ♥♥♥♥ing easy, you finish the game at level 25????  WTF were they thinking??  The characters are extremely unbalanced except claptrap whos ♥♥♥♥ing stupidly under powered.

												TL;DR - worse Borderlands 2 that gets terribly frustrating and exhausting by the end missions. 4/10.And now the long one. Let's just start with stating that this is still a Borderlands game, so if you enjoyed the previous ones you will most likely enjoy this one too, especially when playing with friends. For the most of it. Then you'll get frustrated and will want to just quit this god damn game.Lets start with the missions. There are some nice ones, some quite unique and fun ones. But that's like 5 out of 40. The rest are all repetitive fetch quests that get unnaturally prolonged, because if not the game wouldn't be the half of what it is now. The worst part is that this applies not only to side missions, which are obviously always lower priority for production, but for main quests as well.

Making buttslams near to impossible to do...- I didn't like most of the Austrailians (Not being racist or anything), I just felt that their writing was poor and they weren't funny at all (I think Gladstone was the only funny one, just by a wee' bit)Borderlands The Pre-Sequel is a must get game, however I'd reccomend playing through Borderlands 2 first as it certainly helps you understand what is going on. If you loved Borderlands 2, then you will certainly love this new entry into the series			"

												As a massive fan of borderlands series I played whole series and dlc's etc. I recommend this game unless you are new to the series. First of all its too expensive for a game that needs lots of improvements. if you wanna buy BL: TPS I think u should wait. Tbh I got bored after I finished whole game 1 or 2 times. If you familiar to borderlands games the gameplay of TPS is quite different and its easier to play. also there are less legendaries than other borderlands games and a lot of bosses arent farmable its really really annoying. If you are totally new to the series go and buy borderlands 2 and I'm pretty sure you'll love it and you will buy everything about borderlands :)			"

												I loved Borderlands 1 and 2 so much that I just had to buy this game. There is only 1 problem that I cannot figure out. I bought a cheap keyboard off of amazon from a company called ""Red Dragon"" Turns out these people are cheap and don't put all of the keys on the keyboard!!! When I start Borderlands The Pre-Sequel, it says ""Press any key"" I've been looking for well over an hour and I still can't find the any key! I am buying a new keyboard from razer for $150 and hopefully they will have the any key, unlike this piece of junk keyboard that I have now. I'll update you guys when the new keyboard comes in.EDIT: Someone on yahoo answers told me that I needed to download more RAM. (Whatever that is)I went to DownloadmoreRAM.com and it gave me a virus!!! Can you believe that???? I am completely done with PC gaming. I thought I could trust people on the internet!

												The people at gearbox had a lot to live up to after borderlands 2. They KINDA delivered.pros-Same awesome artstyle-great soundtrack-same design and gameflow-badass rank and other features are the same-same menu style and mechanics-grinder-moxxi, lilith, and roland please note that MOST of the pros are related to being the same as borderlands 2 cons-not compelling to finish story-bland and unvarying terrain-bland and unvarying enemies-bland and unvarying side missions-less control over movement-oxygen-less intriguing characters / action skills-normal mode more difficult (bad for newer players)-UNFARMABLE BOSSES-returning legendaries that cannot be farmed (have to get them from grinder/vendor)This game did so many things right in the fact of staying the same as borderlands, but got a lot of key things wrong. The whole spirit of borderlands is being on a deserted wasteland shooting psychos, skags, and rakks. The space setting was the wrong move in the continuation of the series.Overall i give this game a 8 out of 10 "

												An interesting addition to the series. It still follows the cookie cutter design of previous Borderlands titles with the exception of having low gravity environments and laser weapons in the mix. Handsome Jack, Nisha and Wilhem's a**hat origins are explored in this game while Claptrap and Athena get fleshed out more. The diversity of characters is great compared to previous titles, especially considering most of the Elphis' (the moon) inhabitants are all Australian and reflect elements of Australian culture; Janey Springs comes to mind and she is a bad♥♥♥♥♥lesbian mechanic who adores Athena.Overall I loved this game but it's boring to play solo and should definetly be enjoyed with a friend or two.

												Well, the newest Borderlands game squares up fairly well to the games of its kind but does it really all add up to make a good game? I'll list a simple pro/con list to this game.Pros:-Fairly unique and new worlds. Nothing too copy/paste.-New characters, all unique as well.-Enough to explore on Elpis.-New laser guns are a great addition.-Probably the most fun gameplay in the series. -Interesting backstory and questionable moments.-Leaves you thinking.+/- Austrailian accents? +/- Laser guns. (Some people actually hate the feature)-Not as funny as BL2 or BL. Didn't. Laugh. Once.-Nothing has really changed in customization/badass ranks.-Short if you're not a completionist-Story just....drags.....on....-In this game, it seems like the characters are not treated equal. There are some starting characters better than others.In 2 sentences:Borderlands The Pre-Sequel seems second rate to Borderlands 2, however, it is extremely worth it at a lower price than 60 USD. If you're a die-hard Borderlands fan, pick up at a lower price then have fun!			"

												This is essentially a shorter, space-themed version of Borderlands 2. Taking place and tying-in the gap between the first and second game. A lot of people and things you'll recognize if you played the first two games. It plays nearly identically to BL:2.... except now you can: Grind sh*tty weapons into (hopefully) better ones, ride around in the 'Stingray' (cool little new vehicle), Butt-slam people as you hop around in Zero-G (pretty fun) and shoot laser weapons (also pretty fun). Not any revolutionary changes really, but it's more than just Borderlands 2 with a moon-themed skin slapped on like a lot of people imply. Just about everyone is Australian too... Yay?All in all, If you enjoy the Borderlands universe I'd say this is worth looking into. It's a lot shorter than the first two games, so I'd wait for a sale if you do buy it. Unless you're a huge Borderlands fan... or you are feeling overburdened with money ;)			"

												It's a really fun, compact Borderlands experience. Low grav is fun, laser weapons are fun, and the new classes are fun too. Probably not worth $60 like Borderlands 2 was, but definitely good enough to pick up on a sale.Edit: Oh, I've played the DLC now, and wow, I appreciated this approach way more than Borderlands 2. Borderlands 2 had like 4 campaigns included with the season pass, and with the exception of the Tiny Tina dlc, they were forgettable and not that fun. There was only one campaign released for presequel, but it was actually a sizeable and memorable addition with an interesting story and setting couple with a fully featured boss fight. It's easible better than the four in the Borderlands 2 season pass combined. Now is this campaign included with the two dlc characters and an arena mode worth $30? I woudln't say so, it's much easier to swallow while it's on sale, but if you're not interested in either of the other content, the Claptastic Voyage is definitely worth $10.			"

												Played about a good 50+ hours so far, finished the main game and the Claptastic Voyage, currently busy with TVHM.Honestly, i really don't get much of the negativity surrounding TPS, it's a fantastic game. The game has a number of flaws (in comparison to B2) but also has a lot of features that redeem it. I'll just list up the pros and cons.Pros:- Excellent storyline. Whereas i couldn't be arsed about B2's storyline, TPS does so a lot better. Everybody has a knack for Jack (pun intended) and TPS is focused around his side of the story that lead up to the events of B2. Don't wanna spoil it so i'll keep it short. The story will give you a lot more perspective on Jack, and why he's such a psycho hell-bent on reducing Pandora to rubble, and what morality he bears to it. You'll get to see his reasons for it.- Plenty of new additions. For example, slag has been removed and replaced with cryo damage. It's essentialy still the same thing, as it boosts damage, but enemies will be slowed or paralyzed for a few seconds, making it a far more effective elemental weapon. A new weapon is also introduced: Lasers, which is pretty much as awesome as it sounds.- Money is essentialy worthless in B2, with the exception of grinding slot machines. (which rarely give anything good anyway, so its mostly exchanging it for Eridium) Not the case anymore, vendors reguraly have excellent items on stock, even the occassional legendary item. And they dont come cheap. Money is an essential part, and paying a respawn fee is now something you want to avoid. Along with that, there's the 'Grinder', a machine that can turn items and weapons you don't need into something new, with a good chance of them increasing in rarity level. (for example, 3 green items can be turned into a blue one) - Level scaling is a lot better, with the 'Triton Flats' (an area which you will reguraly be returning to) set to your current lvl as the story progresses. Backtracking, grinding and looting is thus also a lot more viable if you wish to do so.- I've encountered a lot of bugs in B2, including a pretty gamebreaking one. It's annoying. TPS has a lot less 'rough edges', in the 50+ hours i've spent i have passed by barely any bugs at all. - A whole new cast of characters with entirely different playstyles. Whereas B2 regurgitated some of the characters from B1 into B2 (Commando being Roland, Gunzerker being Brick, etc.) every character in the game has its very own special skillsets and are extremely enjoyable as well.-There's lots of new enemies everywhere, which is awesome. Unfortunately though, some of them are mostly 'repackaged' enemies from B2. (Kragoons being Skags, Scavs being bandits, etc.)Cons:- It's shorter than B2. Fewer sidequests and a slightly shorter (though more enjoyable) storyline. - Little new weaponry. There's the lasers they added, which are awesome, but they've mostly ported the arsenal from B2 to TPS. I would've enjoyed seeing some new weapons around. Though, thankfully, there are a good number of new legendaries (quite a lot, actually) to find, and i've encountered a few high-lvl weapons (blues/purples, though i could be wrong and these have been ported from B2 as well) that i haven't seen before. It's still a shame though. For a game that focuses so much on loot and progression, some new flavors would've definetly been appreciated. Claptastic Voyage includes a new rarity level (Glitch) and new weapons which are awesome, but you won't find them in the vanilla game so i don't really think they count.- They've really tried to bring back that feel of humor from it's predecessors and implemented it into TPS. Yeah, i've laughed heartily a few times, but they've tried to give you the occasional chuckle every now and then. Or at least, that's the aim. Thankfully, none of it feels forced, but it's just not funny most of the time.- The whole low gravity thing is awesome, but the fact that you have to maintain your oxygen is just annoying. Occasionaly you'll have to run off to a location containing oxygen when you're on your way. Instead of keeping the pace, you're just gonna have to stop every now and then. For absolutely no reason whatsoever. It's not a feature Gearbox, it's just annoying.- It may not be something for everyone, but the DLC is - aside from the Claptastic Voyage (which is amazing by the way) - pretty little. B2 has huge amounts of excellent DLC (DLC done right), TPS has far less. Of course, this shouldn't affect the rating of the game, it's an add-on after all.In conclusion, i recommend B:TPS. Though i urge every person new to the series to start out with B2 (you dont need B1 if you dont wanna), if you want some more of it, totally get TPS. It might not be brimmed with content like B2 was, nor is it a huge step up what B2 did for B1, it's still a great addition to the Borderlands franchise.			"

However, the final boss kicks♥♥♥♥♥ Fragtrap's action skill is beautiful, and I've found at least 2 legendaries in a shop.If you enjoyed the other BL games, get this one on sale.

												With the Claptrap's Voyage DLC, it became much better than it was. If you want to buy the TPS, buy the story DLC too. Before it, TPS was suffering seriously. You'll finish the story in TVHM around level 50, but there wasn't any motivation to continue - even with UVHM and if you had the Holodome DLC and level cap increase (in fact, that was waste of money). The majority of the bosses and unique enemies, who had assigned loot only spawned once per playthrough - you killed it for the quest, if you got their loot, then you had luck, if not...well, you had to get known to the ""alt+f4 farming"". Thankfully they patched it with the story DLC's release, so it's not an issue anymore. Before it, the endgame looked like: you went to Iwajira, killed him a few times until you got 2 Thingies to grind legendary weapons. Or alternatevely you could farm the vending machines. Which is not an end-game in my book.However, there are still problems: there are lot's of legendaries which don't have any dedicated loot source and you have to farm the grinder and/or the vending machines for them. Like the Maggie, or VIral Marketer. Or Sledge' Shotty. Or.... I could continue this list for a while. On the other side, some loot's drop chance is glitched. The IVF (it's essentially the Baby Maker from BL2) should drop from Tony Slows. However, it doesn't drop from him, so the only way to get this weapon is again, the Grinder or Vending Machines. Then there are lots of unique enemies who don't have any loot drops, like the 3 darksiders who drop the prisms for a mission. Otherwise, the game itself is good. Not as good as Borderlands 2, but the story is interesting, the characters and the style of telling the story is awesome as well. The new things in gameplay are good too, butt slamming and air boosting adds a nice flow to the combat dynamics, and the Cryo element has some characteristics, that makes it better and more interesting than the slag was in BL2. I would rate TPS a solid 7.5/10 (for comparison, BL1 would be around 8-8.5, and BL2 would be 8.5 or 9)			"

												I don't understand why everybody thinks this game sucks! I enjoy it more than i enjoyed Borderlands 2. It has better guns, better characters, the DLC characters are better than the ones in BL 2 except Caige, it has a interaction with the character you chose. Of course that's my personal opinion. It could have been better if players could the skin packs like in the previous game. The laser guns are the best!  That's probably my favourite game!Borderlands The Pre-Sequel- 9/10			"

I think it's a pretty logical idea to take a game everyone loves, create a story which connects the first two games, add new weapons, vehicles and elements, subtract gravity and some other stuff and spice it up with old but new characters and skills. As with previous there is also brilliant humour, clever easter eggs, challenging bosses and everything I so love about the Borderlands franchise.The only negative part is too stereotypical maps and their names - even after few dozens of hours I only remember few of them.9/10			"

												I really had a good time playing the first run-through. It is such a strong similarity to Borderlands 2, probably why I enjoyed it that much more. A few pros vs consPros:Good weapon balancing - The choice of having higher end guns available at all times really helps out in the long runMoney's worth - Money is really important in this game for once. I held on to 7mill in BL2 because it was useless, but in this game I'm lucky to have 100k. Money is used to buy out top-gear items like purple or legendary items that can occasionally come up in the vendors.Interesting Dialogue - As always, Borderlands makes the dialogue either have some deeper meaning or is flat out hilarious. Introduction to new items - The added types of weapons, the O2 kits, and new abilites are amazingNew characters - Yo, Claptrap? For real??? lol, love the new charactersCons:Storyline is somewhat bland - Parts of the story are repetitive, but it does come with a rather big surprise at the endDoesn't seem like a ""new"" game - Although I was stoked it was so similar to Borderlands 2, it didn't feel like a new game, just a DLC of Borderlands 2All in all, 8.5/10, def recommend it, super fun and only gets better on harder modes + friends.

												This is Not a review.  It's simply my thoughts so far on the game.I like it so far, i mean Borderlands 1 and 2 are better but this one is still good it's just not THAT good.As a person who works with UDK i notice a lot of shortcuts made in the making of this game.The most noticeable is, the terrain seems to be mostley just ""Copy"" ""Pasted"" Prefabs. one for example is the ""Lava Water Fall"", and i say ""the"" because i only see 1 thats Copy Pasted over and over.The second most anoying thing is all the Clipping walls they have used. there are FAR too many, you just can't seem to go anywhere you want to go because as you try your character just wont jump or even move. The third is the Collision they have used on there static meshes, i don't really know what is wrong with it, it's just wrong. You get stuck all the time. In Borderlands i noticed A LOT of BSP Texture errors (Textures that were missing and showed the UDK's White/Blue Square's), So far i have not seen any in Borderlands TPS, so thats good at least.I still recomend this game as it is a good game, you might just want to wait for a sale though.Or a GOTY and then not have to pay so much for the DLC.

												While not quite up to the standards of BL2, this seems at first glance to be quite a good game.  Unfortunately, the game turns out to be ridiculously short and end-game is virtually nonexistant--a nasty combo.  Unlike BL2, the DLC introduces virtually no new content; only the last one really changes your gameplay experience and gives you something to do.I...honestly can't recommend this game unless you've completely exhausted BL2 and all its DLC and are desperate for more gameplay.  Combat isn't terribly balanced and endlessly farming the same end-game boss for gear with which you fight that same boss again and again, well...  It's a mess.			"

												While this is the third game in the series, it is chronologically the prequel to the excellent Borderlands 2.  Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel starts before the events in Borderlands 2, telling the of Handsome Jack.  Especially fun to play with a friend for some dialogue/interaction between the characters but levelling seems to always be slightly behind the storyline so repeating in vaulthunter mode or DLCs might require a little grind/levelling, where Borderlands 2 suffered very little from this unless you wanted to aim for the higher/max levels, but still damned good fun!If you are a fan of the franchise, you almost certainly won't be left disappointed.

I was so excited for this borderlands, that i preordered it. The preorder bonus is a joke, plain and simple. The DLC is sub-par, at best. To save everyone a lot of opinions and reading, this game isn't the Borderlands we loved. While the old games had enough story and difficulty to last for a pretty long time, this one does not. My current playtime is beating the storymode and true vault hunter.Its just an expansion pack.			"

Sadly, Borderlands has never been anything more than a mediocre gameplay experience with decent, varying greatly with personal taste, humor. Hilarious and entertaining for some, a complete and utter waste of time for others. Everthing unique about this game (mainly the randomly generated guns) has had no update significant enough to make it stand out from its predecessors. The new mechanics not present in previous installments are more of an annoyance than an improvement. On a final note, if you found Claptrap annoying in previous games, do not even bother playing this because there are Claptraps in every area of the game and Claptrap is a playable character. Repetative, irritating dialog from Claptrap will be enough to make someone who enjoyed the previous games but hated Claptrap want to stay away from this entirely.			"

												The time i've spent so far in the game, really haven't impressed me.Most of you have probably already heard about the mixed reception for this game, and i can certainly say that i lean to the side of people who dislike this game.The largest issue can be described with 1 wordTediousEverything about it is just sort of annoying, the map layouts, the enemies, the floaty locations and the need to search for oxygen all the time. One of the first enemies you'll encounter in this game are the Kragons, a sort of stone dragon which duplicates itself when it dies, so you'll get tired of fighting those REALLY fast.And due to the maps being all floaty and the gravity being close to non-existant enemies (especially larger ones) will knock you off a ledge or into a pit and insta kill you VERY often.I also dislike too that this game more or less bases it's story on telling how jack became the way he is in Borderlands 2, but that is done very badly, as it's awefully forced lines that hint towards him liking to do things, which i can't explain without spoiling parts of the story. I might flesh this out more when i feel like it, but after booting it up for a frustratingly annoying playthrough of it, i just gotta leave a bad review to even the opinions for this game.			"

Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is pretty good (in my stand). The whole story is pretty interesting to know and it's cool to see that at the end of the game we know how Handsome Jack became Handsome Jack and took over Pandora or like you know in Borderlands 2 .Playing Co-op in this game is very rare, since not many people like this game because the lack of DLC's it has. I mean we can get to level 70 which is nice but like... where is the fun without dlcs and new stories? Borderlands 2 had everything and that game is very popular from 2K. My only question is why did the people who made the Pre-Sequel not add any new DLC's that would add like a new story or new location and enviroments? I mean the Claptastic Voyage was the best dlc story I have played and with so many new npc's, weapons, locations and many others!Time to list some things I love about this game- Are you sure you want to pick Claptrap? Are you serious about this choice? Are you 100% percent sure about this? ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥ING SERIOUSLY GOING TO PLAY AS CLAPTRAP?!?!?, I warned you buddy.- Oh my god please nerf Nisha. She's just too powerful with her skill trees- Athena as a Gladator? Oh my god we got a new melee character in this game. Thank you.- Oh my god, we got Wilhelm back in the Pre-Sequel with Wolf and Saint!?!? Oh my god this is so fun!- Two words for you Moxxi. ♥♥♥♥ing Hot.- Handsome Jack doesn't have his Handsome mask on?!?!? Oh my god we actually get to see his real face before the end of the game.- The Destoryer's Eye is the Moonshot?!?! Oh my god that is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Also the Tiny Destoryer is adorable o3o- Space? SPACE? SPACEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!! and OZ KITS!!!!!! - Low Gravity? YES LOW GRAVITY IS ALWAYS FUN!- This game has so many intresting locations to explore. Sub Level 13? Ghostbusters Reference? AMAZING!  "

												An amazing game. In general, people say it's just a re-hashed Borderlands 2. But, you know what? It isn't.It has, in my opinion, a great story-line, revamped sounds and quality of the game, and, overall, has a brand-new feel to it. It's as if you got a new car after driving around a used one for a while.The story-line is great. It takes a new look on the Borderlands story -- one from the view of the antagonists. It's still great nonetheless!The action of the game kicks off, right from the get-go. There's no waiting around for stuff to happen!If you have a spare $70-$90 lying around, and want some good times, then, I highly recommend Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel.			"

												I am just going to go out and say it instantly.I don't like this game nearly as much as borderlands one or twoIts not as replayable, much shorter and costs 4 times as muchHowever, this game is worth buying (if its 50% off or something).This game really gives you freedom with your loadouts and weapon choices.If you want to go sniping you can just pick up a good sniper and go hunting, You can't do that on any of the other borderlands games. In borderlands 1 your sniper proficency would be so low that you couldn't even land a hit and in borderlands 2 any sniper will be garbage if you are not Zero with the sniping skill tree and sniper class mods (Atleast in the late game).So pick this game up if you are a borderlands fan but don't bother with the DLCs. Only Claptastic Voyage and Handsome Jack is worthwhile but you can also pick the holodome to increase your max level if you really want to get everything you can out of this game.			"

												Even if I disregarded the games that came before this one - which is admittedly difficult, given how much I enjoyed 2 - I can't say that I would recommend this game on its own. It's nothing special, in my eyes. If others enjoy it, I'm glad for them! In my case, however, I wish I had saved my money (and I bought this on sale).Here are a few things to consider, if you're looking to purchase this game and combing through reviews for some outsider input. I'll start with the objectively nice things:-It handles just like Borderlands 2, which is to say very nicely. It also looks great, keeping with the signature style of titles before it.-The new cast of characters are diverse and provide some neat expansion of the previously explored areas of the Borderlands universe. There is a feeling of many more possibilities moving beyond the given playable experience.  -While it sticks largely with the Borderlands 2 system, there is enough 'newness' in here that it provides a very different experience. The unique location, the Grinder, the new gun type, and the new element are enjoyable.-The new vehicles were pretty cool.-It was interesting to have to manuever in the new environments in the given way (even if it was slower). The need to interact with the oxygen vents on the surface could go either way for me. It made travel somewhat more difficult, which made the otherwise slow hops across the surface more exciting. -The new playable characters and abilities are pretty fun.Unfortunately, for me, that just about ends the good things that I can think of to say about this game. I was trying to be generous, honest.I seem to be in the lower bracket of opinions on this, and for the life of me I can't figure out what I'm missing out on. I really wish this was something I could enjoy. It just doesn't cut it for me, though. I see people redeeming this because in some way you could try to think of it as a DLC and not what's supposed to be its own game, but I can't even accept that. It just.... wasn't fun. Here's why I thought it wasn't fun: -From right off the bat, there were some ridiculous bugs causing the models to pop in and out of reality, especially in Sanctuary 2.0. Kind of breaking the diversity there.-The characters were so, so, so unfortunately samey. There were attempts to diversify them, and it helped that this team had characters to build off of from games before, but overall it was just.... bland. They were not at all belonging in what has been established in the fun and quirky Borderlands universe. They were often not more than ushering you down the questline with little other individuality or redeeming qualities to their name. ♥♥♥♥ing Pickle. -The main quest was so boring I refused to do side quests to avoid doing but the bare minimum. Consequently, I found myself severely underlevelled. I joke with my buddy that the script for each and every quest went this way: ""Give player objective across map, player attempts to proceed by completing objective, something breaks, give player new objective all the way backwards through the map to fix whatever went wrong with last objective, repeat"". There was SO much backtracking and loss of progression. It's NOT fun. -The characters being queer were cool. The characters having no other qualities I could tell you about other than them being queer are uncool. It felt just like the team wanted to include their sexual orientation just so they could say they did. That's the end of their work. Everyone pack it up.-REALLY forced attempts at resurfacing character qualities from previous games. Example, quite early on Torgue makes some comment about friendzoning and then something something about ladies and whatever. I think it was an attempt to relive what was actually kind of a cool moment for his character in his DLC, but it was just.... harsh. -Speaking of harsh, just about every dialogue bit in this game is harsh. It feels like the team played the previous games and only got ""insert joke into EVERY LINE POSSIBLE"" from them. They're not good. They're not subtle or clever, definitely nowhere near the beloved Borderlands standards. They're so forced, and it's painful to witness potentially neat characters being funneled into (now it is time to make a JOKE!). It's bad.-Also on the dialogue line, a lot of the dialogue was way too much, very cluttery and overwhelming. There were a couple times the ol' Borderlands dialogue came through, and it was a breath of fresh air, but it wasn't often enough.-This would only be an issue if you disliked this game the same way I do, but the replay value on this is seriously 0 for me right now. I replayed BL2 close to 10 times at this point, so I was really hoping for something else I'd be able to waste my life on, but I'm afraid it's not here.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this even as a DLC. Especially if you've played the games before this, I just don't find it up to par. If you consider yourself someone who especially enjoys characters and quests, then I'd be especially cautious. If you're just in it for the gameplay, then go for it!			"

Only this time with more guns, new characters, zones and vehicles. If your looking for more Borderlands content, this is where you should go. Get ready for more co-op, shooter, action!

												Welcome to Elpis, Pandora's moon. The third installment in the Borderlands franchise brings back pretty much everything you loved from Borderlands 2 and added new gravity mechanics and weapons. For those who believe this was just a large DLC I will say because of the same engine yes it feels much like BL2 but I feel they added enough to make a full game. However being a diehard Borderlands fan I can't help but feel slightly disappointed in 2k Aus's take on the franchise. The content and gameplay of the game seems to grow stale after awhile, something that didn't happen for me in either of the previous games. As for the endgame content well compared to 2 there's really none to be found past maybe 3hrs of beefing up your character. I will say it pales in comparison to it's former titles but it was still a very enjoyable playthrough and in my opinion completely worth buying but I hope for great DLC additions like we saw in BL2, but until then I wait for gearbox to take the reigns back for the gameplay aspect because everything else is still just as good as it has been. 9/10			"

												Pre-Sequel is a highly focused expansion on the new gameplay introduced in Borderlands 2, yet it cuts down on the content enough to make almost every mission feel meaningful. There are no seemingly abandoned areas filled with pointless side missions, you always feel pointed in the right direction. There is also about 99% less Tiny Tina, which could be a positive or a negative depending on if you like shrill, meme-ridden husks of characters. I like Borderlands for the gameplay, and this is probably the best game in the main series yet.			"

												I am writing this a really big Borderlands fan and because i feel a lot of these reviews forget a thing or two about TPS (What i will be referring The Pre-Sequel as)Lets get started with the storyThe story is amazing if you played Borderlands 1 and 2 the story will really make sense and you will enjoy it. Its awesome to watch Handsome Jack's character development through the story. The player you decide to play even gets unique dialogue to say in this game at certain parts some characters are smart asses some are funny its a welcome addition as now your character isn't completely like a killing machine. In short the story is pretty fantastic if you played Borderlands 2 if not go play Borderlands 2 you'll see why in a minute.The characters and skill treesAs i said above the character's dialogue is perfect and a welcome addition but the choice of characters is pretty cool as well. You will get to select out of 4 familiar vault hunters or 6 with the DLC as much i would love to sit here tell you the most OP builds for them all i'm just going to say this: They are all good it is not like Borderlands 2 where there is a character or 2 are terrible at the end game *Cough* Axton *Cough* they are all good and can pretty much succeed at anypart of the game some are still better than others but its not like Borderlands 2 in the fact there are harder characters to play than others. The skill trees which is the most important of the characters are the best yet in Borderlands. It makes you wish they would maybe do some kind merge with TPS and Borderlands 2 and let you play as TPS characters and vice versa. Anyway back on topic the skills actually synergize well with other skills even if different trees and characters. Picking a character and leveling him up and working on builds is really fun in TPS.Loot and raritesThis is where my review starts to get a negative and you might be thinking how could this be bad after that well i said at the start that i am writing this a really big Borderlands fan as i am, i have played every Borderlands for countless hours on console and PC. Which leads to the huge problem of TPS: Legendaries are mostly returning or reskins with slight different mechanies. Although some of you might be happy that there is no Norfleet therefore shamfleeting or Unkempt harold. This is still a problem but this issue has been somewhat resolved with the new DLC claptastic voyage which adds new legendaries and a new rarity called glitch weapons but if you're not buying the DLC then don't bother about this sentence.Endgame Scaling and FarmingLets start with another positive scaling is heaps better in TPS and doesn't go into terriblely unfun levels like Borderlands 2. Scaling is better in TPS enough said but farming took a hit when the game released with no respawnable bosses. Although this has been resolved with a patch it was a problem and took a bit too long to fix which is why most Borderlands fans are playing Borderlands 2.DLCThe DLC packs for TPS are pretty good besides Holodome which is terrible and should only be bought if you are level 60 and want to be level 70. The other packs like the Doppelganger pack and Baroness pack are good but not %100 necessary at all. The only DLC you really need if you are playing casually or want more endgame is Claptastic Voyage which is one of the best DLC's i have ever played its packed with new content and a raid boss although people say not technically i think the last boss was an intended raid boss as it is pretty difficult. Glitch weapons are pretty cool as they get random buffs when you reload after emptying a clip some as simple as faster fire rate to your weapon shooting shotgun bullets thats right you ever wanted an assault rifle that could randomly start shooting shotgun shells? Well thats now possible with glitch weapons.In Conclusion TPS is a welcome game in the Borderlands franchise but i must say if you're new to Borderlands and reading this to see if you should buy this to start with Borderlands, buy the Borderlands 2 GOTY edition on sale its worth it as its cheap, fun and much better than TPS. But if you're like me, played all the Borderlands games, done your fair share of shouting at that bandit moving behind cover when you need a second wind then i might say buy this with Claptastic voyage if there isn't anything else to spend your money on and you need something to play or do. TPS might satisfy you			"

												Pre-Sequel definitely follows the Borderlands Franchise in a good and meaningful way. The story telling is slower pace, yet it retains all of it's comedic aspects. The combat is still fluid and the loot system has gotten even better. I think the only downfall of this game, is that the atmosphere seems slightly repetitive, other than that I believe that this game almost lives up to how great borderlands 2 was.			"

												Borderlands 2.5New stuff: characters/skills, story, vehicle, enemy types, gear grinder & oxygen/slam.  It looks the same as BL2, plays the same, its basically a very long DLC of BL2.  I was pretty disappointed that they even have the same achievements: explore areas, complete all level 1 challenges, and story progression (though to be fair, every game has that).The good news is its very fun, they added a few new stuff & its just as much fun with friends as before.  Even though the legendaries are the same (with different names), it's still a fun game.  It's definitely not worth full price since it's SO similar to BL2.7/10 Worth playing but shouldn't have been priced more than $30 on release date.			"

												Borderlands, the pinnacle of shoot & loot games. Procedurally generated weapons, loot chests, boss fights. It has everything that makes a grind addictive. Borderlands The Pre-Sequel, however, is a little more stale than the other games that have come from the franchise. Borderlands one was amazingly fun, I have countless hours into that game on my Xbox 360 and the only issue with it was the insanely drab pallete. Lots of browns, really. Borderlands 2 ramped up the color pallete, gave us even MORE procedurally generated weapons, more enemies, more story, areas, and fun. Overall, Borderlands 2 was a better game than Borderlands the original.But this game... The Pre-Sequel...Let me start off by saying, I adore Borderlands as a whole. The entire universe, lore, all of it. It's amazing. Borderlands has always walked that fine line of being cheesey, but still funny while being dramatically graphic. Shooting people's heads off while your character makes snarky comments has always been something they've done right with the series. You get a lot of good laughs in the games. Borderlands 2 ramped that up a bit. And The Pre-Sequel made it almost non-stop. While I do love the dialogue and all of its hilarity, sometimes it IS a bit much. The characters actually talking to eachother is an amazing addition, but it seems to be over-used in Co-Op where your characters are talking almost constantly to eachother or somebody on your Echo.Another thing Borderlands is famous for is its weapon generation. BL1 had a load of guns, always finding something new. BL2, even more so. But The Pre-Sequel adds maybe a handful of weapons, IF THAT. The new laser weapons are fun and unique, but they really dropped the ball on other weapons. I'd venture to guess that 99% of the weapons (barring legendary weapons) are re-used from Borderlands 2. And even then, most legendary weapons are re-used as well. They most certainly could have done better in this respect.As I said before, dialogue is huge part of this game. Character dialogue is great, voice acting is great, voice actors are great. It makes you feel more immersed in the Borderlands universe, your character speaking directly to your friendly quest-giver on the Echo.I don't think it needs to be said, but low-gravity is fun. The ground slams you can do are also fun, but a bit underwhelming. I used the exact same O2 Kit from the second mission of the game, all throughout the campaign. Not because I forgot to, or wanted to, but because it was genuinely the best one I could find. It had the highest oxygen capacity by quite a bit, but I suffered with the low slam damage. It wasn't until I got into Playthrough 2 that I started finding worth while O2 Kits. The slams for me mostly worked as a means to jump cancel. The low gravity was sometimes irritating and you constantly whack your head everywhere, or go too far because you have little to no control where you go. The slams bring you down immediately, which is nice.Bosses in this game are a little underwhelming. The final boss was a lot of fun, but I felt like it dragged on a bit too much. Like they had run out of ideas.In fact, I think this entire game was built on a pre-laid foundation and they WERE out of ideas. They just wanted to push some new things like the dialogue and lasers. It doesn't seem like a full game to me, unfortunately. It feels more like a large expansion for Bl2 than a full game. Regardless of the lack of new content and some of the minor annoyances in the game, it is still VERY fun. It's still Borderlands at heart, even if it isn't really all that brand new. Being a lover of the series, I do recommend the game. But if you're looking for some brand-new mechanics, new weapons, and an all around COMPLETELY NEW game. You are going to be disappointed.This game serves it's purpose in the lore. Showing us what happened between Borderlands 1 and 2. It tells a story, and it's very good at it. That's what kept me playing, the story. If you haven't played Borderlands 1 and 2, then I wouldn't recommend playing this game until you do. You really need to know what's going on to understand most of the game. I would recommend playing the games in order, Borderlands 1, Pre-Sequel, then Borderlands 2 so you get the full story.So far, unfortunately, this game is my least favorite of the series. That isn't saying a whole lot, though. I still love it. It's still Borderlands like I said. It's just not new and shiny. It's kind of just...Here... I'm looking forward to the DLC to see if it sparks my interest in the game a little more.Final verdict, in my opinion; Wait for a really good sale if you're a Borderlands lover/veteran. If not, go ahead and jump in if you've played Borderlands 1.			"

												Don't get me wrong, I love the Borderlands series. This game, in my opinion, was vastly inferior to Borderlands 2. I have over four times the amount of hours on Borderlands 2 than I do Borderlands: The Pre-Sequal.   Cons Reasons   Story Story didn't feel as in-depth as Borderlands 2. It felt like a backstory, that didn't need to be a full game, maybe a DLC at most.   Humor The vast amount of humor that you found in BL2, one of the main reasons for that game being so great, is just not found in this game in the quantities previously mentioned.    Bosses/Enemies Some of the enemies are non-respawnable, and other bosses, be it mini-boss or not, just don't seem as rushed additions with no real purpose (I'm looking at you RK5)    Pros Reasons   Gameplay (Guns) The new features, cryo weapons & laser weapons, may not completely change the way combat feels, but it brings new options to the table.   Gameplay (Environment) The zero-gravity environment also changes the way people will play, doing ""butt slams"" and such, with core gameplay still there.   Cosmetics While in the vast range of moon and space, I genuinely felt in awe of the art style I fell in love with, yet again seeing the new areas.  Overall Verdict This game shouldn't have been a full $60 game. Maybe $40-50 at most. I think the main reason it wasn't up to par was that, plainly put, it wasn't a needed story. As I previously mentioned, it felt like this game was just a backstory that should've been a DLC. My score for this game?  5/10  "

Like come on guys, quit whining if something isn't broke don't fix it. I don't think a game has to be on a brand new engine to be new. This is a new game, it has* A new well written story* New classes with new skill trees* New environment* New charactersSo basically don't listen to the negative hype, this is an amazing game, you should definetly get it, it is gonna give me hundreds of hours of entertainment, and I can't wait for borderlands 3.

												Urgh, take Borderlands 2, make it way more tedious, make every joke seem tired and just poorly written, add zero gunplay or gameplay improvements really, and you have the pre-sequel. Even the cast is pretty lame this time around. Unless you REALLY liked borderlands 2, and I mean to the point where you're desperate for more of the same, then skip this. I was a pretty big fan of the first two games but god damn, it feels like a huge chore to play the pre-sequel.			"

												I'm sorry, but I cannot recommend this game. It all feels like one giant DLC to the much superior game of Borderlands 2. Hell, I'm not even sure if this game is worth 20$, let alone 40$. The characters feel flat out boring to play (or annoying), and the ones that are interesting to play stop being once you realize that most of their optimal gear can't drop! At all! Most weapons are actually imbedded in the code, but have no suitable loot source (or that loot source is bugged, like the Lady Fist) Understandibly, these unobtainable weapons are very powerful even without a proper build to back them up, but in BL2 with Shamfleeting, Pimperahabing, and Beehawking, there really isn't much of a reason to leave this game so...unfinished. The replayability is trash, the story just drones on and never EVER has the character's just saying a line and having you on your way. A great example of this is when Jack is telling you about the vending machines in the beggining. It would be great, if not for the fact that he takes forever to complete the objective that you could do in under 10 seconds! You don't even have to be near the machines, he'll just explain them anyway. A great option would've been to disable tutorials and tutorial-like dialouge, but no. You have to listen to these god damn explinations over, and over until finally you just go and download a lvl50 (or 70) save and have fun with that. Except that the endgame isn't even fun! The ""mobbing"" areas are either have way too much cover or way too open. And the worst part? They had a chance to redeem the game. The Claptastic Voyage was hyped and hyped and nothing came of it. Another story with awful slow speed and extremely cringe-worthy jokes. The glitch weapons were way too unreliable and weren't really much better than purples. Hell, if it hadn't been for BL2, I probably wouldn't have even touched this game. The co-op wasn't even that decent. The only ""support"" was Athena and if she went down you're whole team was screwed. Please 2K, I hope you take this is a regretable mistake and build off of it. We don't want another TPS for BL3.

												I don't think this game is better than Borderlands 2, unfortunately. I had over 6 playthroughs on Borderlands 2 but this game, I started then stopped mid game. I finally came back, started over, and then finally finished it. I only recommend it to people who do not care about the story or are just looking for a fps. If you want a good story, play BL1 and BL2 or just BL2 really. If you want something cheaper, pick up BL2.Pros:-Many characters to choose from. (2 are DLC)-Funny.-Pretty to look at.-Plays like a Borderlands game.-Added gravity fun.-Added the ""Grinder"". Throw in old guns you don't want or need and then you may get a better one.Cons:-The characters and their abilities aren't very good. I only like Wilhelm and the Baronness. -While playing Handsome Jack's doppleganger, if I walked two feet away from one, it'd despawn then respawn wasting time for me. -They made ClapTrap a character. I'd prefer to see him around Concordia or perhaps assisting in a couple quests (Like BL2). Also, he's funny at the start but as the game progresses, you start to regret picking him. Also, he's only good with multiplayer. -This is a bit of a personal preference.They made the main characters (the characters you play) talk. In the previous game, your chracters would be silent. The characters talking back ruins a bit of the game for me. In the previous game, I could imagine what my character would say. Instead, I get cringy responses from the heroes. Wilhelm, Nisha, and the Baroness are nearly impossible to listen to. -In BL1 and BL2, you had the pleasure of reoccuring characters like Scooter and Zed. In this game, they're replaced with Janey Springs and Nurse Nina. I don't mind Nurse Nina at all but Janey Springs is a nightmare. Annoying! Almost as bad as Tiny Tina. -Story is okay...The enemy in BL2 (Handsome Jack) really made a huge impact in the game. Zarpaddon was okay but very boring. The aliens were also kinda boring.-LASER WEAPONS ARE STUPID AND TERRIBLE. I agree with Torge on this. They just aren't satisfying to use. -Moxxi has this alternative side added to her (actually a redneck mechanic) that was annoying. -The new vehicle, Stingray, isn't fun. Prefer the car but some quests make you use the Stringray.			"

												Unfortunatly, I can't recommend this game. Up to a certain point it's all fine and dandy but there comes a point where you realise you are playing a running simulater, rather than what you'd expect from a Borderlands game. The missions become a real chore. ''Pick up this on this side of the map'', ''Now run across the map and get this thing'', ''Now, go put this in that... but not here... there'' ''Now, almost done, you see that thing on the other side of the map? We're gonna need that, go pick it up''. Which I would have much less of a problem if most of the maps didn't look the same. I was really hyped to play Borderlands in space, only to be let down by the poor map design.It feels like 2k Australia tried to stretch the missions out as far as possible. Also, I didn't give zero sh**s about the characters. I just wanted them to shut up so I could go on about my day. I thought the grinder would be a welcome addition but it kinda ruins co op gameplay in my opinion because everybody wants weapons they can grind. Because hey ''3 blues equal a purple''. It's not like in BL2 where if a blue dropped and nobody needed it, it wouldn't matter who gets it.I guess there are pros to the game too but they are overshadow the cons by a long shot, but to keep it simple: The game feels like a chore and isn't as good as BL2 (where I don't mind doing missions multiple times, seriously, the replay value on that game...)

												This plays exactly the same as the previous games, so the gameplay is quite monotonous, especially if you play in single player.While the writing in the previous games was passable (and even good in Assault on Dragon Keep), the writing here is atrocious, however. It's full of memes that are already now old, full of preaching about homophobia, sexism and other beloved topics of a certain political group in the English speaking countries and written as if teenage friends were talking on Twitter.If you loved the previous games, eh, why not, but if you are lukewarm about them, this is the same old, wrapped in bad, preachy writing.

Hovewer it lacks in diffrent aspects. It's combat flow is not great and often you will find yourself waiting for dialogue to finish when going from combat to combat. A lot of locations look the same as most of them is just the surface of the moon. The game overall is not as addictive as BO2 was. It lacks end-game content. If you want a shooter that can provide you many hours of fun TPS is for you. Also buy claptastic it's really good. "

This is Borderlands, to the core, and a great credit to the franchise. Low gravity combat, lasers, cryo effects, both new and re-imagined enemies, and a metric crap ton of that classic Borderlands humor we have come to love so much. Love the new characters, and ... you can play as Claptrap. I enjoy seeing the story leading up to BL2, and some of the side mission stories are cool as well. Seeing Jack be ... nice. The birth of the robot army. But, I will stop there, no spoliers.  As I write this, I see a small flood of spam in the reviews here on Steam, people hating on the game for various reasons. Everyone is most definitely entitled to their opinions, but a lot of what I am reading makes no sense. This is NOT a DLC or expansion, it's a full on game in it's own right. People complaining about the $60 price tag, and while I am have been a long time critic of overpriced games, there is most defiantly $60 worth of game here. If you go for the full Borderlands experience, it's going to take you dozens of hours to complete, per character. Like all of the other BL games, we have coop as well. So I am not sure what people are complaining about. Rest assured, it's unwarranted. If you truly enjoy Borderlands, then you will enjoy The Pre-Sequel.			"

												I am a big fan of any co-op game, they are pretty much the only ones I play. I enjoy the graphics and the occassional appearance of Borderlands 2 characters, but this one just isn't quite up to that level. Compared to the other Borderlands, this one lacks a solid story line, likable side characters (providing details about their lives that in no way improve the story or experience), lacks challanging and enjoyable bosses, and has few leveling perks/customizing options available through the standard play-through. I would say its value in entertainment is half the cost of what was paid. Some games deserve a second or third playthrough, this isn't likely to be one of those.			"

												After 2 weeks, this is my assessment of Borderlands: The Pre-SequelHolding Borderlands 2 as the king of the series, i can say borderlands the pre-sequel is crap by comparison. Its nowhere near as funny, the pacing is ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and the music is awful.Here are my Pros:+ The low-gravity jumps and airboosts are fun, but bring little to the table.+ The new freeze ammo type is very useful and appropriately used+ The characters are unique enough to make play styles change+ The vehicles are cool+ Enemy AI seems improved over previous generations.Here are the numerous cons:- The low-gravity gets old, quickly- The writers must have quit because there is almost no comedic voice acting in this game, its all crap so far.- The environments are bland with little variation- That ♥♥♥♥ing music- Major glitch if you die while affected by the freeze element- Weapons have no effect if fired too close to an enemy- Its too easy to fall off the map, on foot and in vehicles- The story is ♥♥♥♥ed up from the beginning unless you play as athena, otherwise its assuming you are with her in multiplayer (half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥writing).- The grinder is an absolutely pointless addition to the game, it might as well not be there- the pacing is crap from the get go, and makes me not want to playin short, i want my money back and i am♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at the dev team.

												Look, this is a fun game, no doubt, but it's seriously infantilising. Borderlands, the original, I could blow limbs and heads into smithereens. Sure, you get some blood splatter here, but all body parts remain intact. And then, when someone says a 'swear' in dialogue, it's censored out. I simply can't recommend the game for anyone that appreciated the adult humour that made the original such an entertaining experience. Also, I don't have a problem with a gay character here and there, but I don't need them reminding me how gay they are every couple of minutes. Seriously, who does that? None of the straight characters are doing that.			"

												BL:TPS is basically Death by a thousand cuts. This game is a strictly worse version of BL2. We surely expected a similar game, or even more of an expansion pack. Instead they've hybridized the worst parts of BL 1 and 2 into one fairly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ package. This is coming from someone with 500+ hours in 2, and currently sitting at 70 in this. Pros first: The low gravity combat is great, boosting/buttslams fit very well and just feel good to do. Melee specs play a mech-like dodge air game.  Playable characters all feel very different and have interesting skill trees/actions skills. More legendary drops while levelling. Halloween event is neat and was rather unexpected. Cons: Low gravity isn't on in some areas, which makes you play a lot differently. Dots received a huge damage buff, and lategame enemies have tons of lasers (high proc chance and dot damage), so you frequently find yourself dying a few seconds after the last enemy. Area design is a lot worse. There are fewer areas and only one real hub (which is stacked deep with quests all throughout the game). Lots of backtracking through it, which isn't interesting or comparable to the progression in Bl2. Areas are more monochromatic and a lot less interesting to be in, much like in Bl1. Droprate was buffed in vending machines and there is a horadric cube type random crafting system. Presumably to compensate, a lot of legendaries drop from one time encounters. This means you're faced with: Saving all quests with a unique mob until after you beat playthrough 2, making backups of your saves to farm them repeately, using backups to farm the grinder till you get what you want, or worst of all playing Vending Machine Farming Simulator 2015. Non-respawning one time bosses: as mentioned above, more or less every unique mob encountered on a quest does not respawn, and they all seem to have unique head/skin drops or a legendary in their loot pool. This includes most sidequests as well as the first, and third to last story bosses.  This is a common complaint on both official forums, reddit, twitter, and in streams/from streamers or YT guys and has not been  acknowledged by 2k/2k Australia.Tied into the above, the low number of quests. There are fewer sidequests than either previous game, and in order to maintain level parity in TVHM you have to do basically all of them. This sucks because it means either you don't save quest drops/farmables for 50, you grind mobs for hours to keep up, or you have fun being severely underlevelled. Especially near endgame the story quests jump ~4-5 levels in requirement and mob level, so you go from being 41-42 fighting lv 43-44 mobs to the last story quest being 48, with lv 49 mobs and a boss at 50. Its unforgiven and grindy due to how ineffectual personal healing is outside of using Moxxi's Probe. Buggy launch: Based on Bl2s launch you had to expect some balance issues and bugs. TPS is a lot worse, and has some legitimately gamebreaking ones. People are having all equipment wiped from savefiles, any talented buffs are wiped by entering a vehicle, and random CTD is becoming a familiar friend. Less pending DLC support: This applies more to people who bought the season pass after the strong support from Gearbox for Bl1/2. 2k has indicated the intent to release *one* campaign, s opposed to the 3/4 eleased for previous games. This may prove to be ill-founded or they may scale it up, but as it stands I already regret buying the season pass. This last bit is subjective, but I feel the writing is a lot worse as well. It gets some cheap laughs by riding the jokes and NPCs from the previous games very directly, but offers almost nothing new or interesting. The decision to stick the story between the first two limited what they were able to do, and they did not excel within those constraints. At the end of the day its an okay game, if a pale shadow of the predecessor. It feels like a cashgrab from the publisher (Gearbox was a consultant in development, but the game was made by 2k Australia and outsourced parts to several other studios). It is definitely not worth the full AAA title asking price. I'd pick it up on sale, and wouldn't buy the season pass unil they've released enough DLC to make it worth 30.			"

												I was pretty excited for BP-S when I'd first heard about it. While it seemed to be kind of humorus to note that it'd been handed off to a foreign studio and ""let loose""... That's where its downfall started.The game is *relentlessly* Australian, and I mean that it has such difficult to understand language, poorly done dubbing, and worst of all the (hopefully unintended) racism rampant in it is ... disappointing. It's one thing to have a 'white trash feud' (as shown in Borderlands 2 with Moxxi's families) as something that the player can watch pan out. It's another entirely to have an NPC openly insult *the player's character*, in such a way that it is clearly projected from the developers opinions. For such an open minded bunch in B2's creative team, to have such narrowminded tripe in their sequel seems outright wrong.The music is uninspired, and worse, bland at its very best. I would have thought that if Elpis is ""the Australia of Pandora"" then the music would have followed suit. Apparently, they didn't get the the message out that thematic sounding music might have worked well. The dialog is under-recorded, and usually overwhelmed by any noisy sound fx going on - and the lack of the ability to re-listen to the Echoes, as you could originally in Borderlands 1, seems like a complete failure to understand what went wrong in B2. (Which was where you first couldn't listen to them again.) Having no ability to hear the dialog AND no ability to rehear it even though you've ""picked up an Echo""... really seems short sighted.I think I've rage-quit this game more in one place - Zarpedon's boss fight - than I have done in any other Borderlands game. It's at this point I'm giving up on the game entirely. The boss - sure, I could take her. After the learning curve of death and costly respawns, to the point where I have no cash left to restock my ammunition? Yeah, no. Where exactly did these ""ascended"" people come from? Why is that suddenly a thing? There's been exactly NO hint that this could be something to encounter, why did they suddenly appear as shields and overwhelmingly hard enemies? There is no story behind this, and that's what makes it even less palatable. If I had heard at some point, ""oh these people transmute into ultra-powerful new versions of guards that restock her shields, and then level up into new and resistant damage types"" ... I might have been able to arrange a few more trips to the Grinder. But as it is, they come out of NOWHERE, as enemy types go, and this tells me only that the developers did not have a clue what they were doing.I would be willing to let the game have a pass for these issues (along with the geometry issues, clipping, sticking in places, invisible walls making travel impossible, the bad 'ice slow' glitch that slows your movement even after it's supposed to go away, etc etc etc) IF the game was only a MOD. A team of inexperienced modders would make these mistakes. A team of badly organized and first-time game makers could be let off the hook for such very, very basic issues - many of which were QA problems and have been resoundingly reported - and never fixed. But this is a supposed team of *professional game makers*. Their issues with game design go very deep, and I'm afraid that they just should never have been put on this project at all. It's a smirch on the franchise that won't go away. This game deserves its low Metacritic score, for so very many reasons.For folks who suggest: you should team up for that fight! Well I don't pub-lobby, ever - because ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I don't have any friends who have finished the game, either, as far as I know. Even the friend who bought it for me hasn't gotten even half as far as I have, and we've tried to team up on other such things in the past, to little success. Plus, I play a game with a single-player mode *as a single player*, not as a ""maybe I'll drop in on someone"" type - because I'm trying to learn the STORY behind the game. Not just trying to blast everything in sight, which has caused me problems in the other Borderlands games, by losing my personal progress and not being able to properly understand what is going on after teaming. For folks who suggest: you're just not hard core. No, no I am *not* hard core. But what I expect from a game with a professional design team is a PROFESSIONAL PRODUCT. And this, I'm afraid, is NOT professional enough. The game play here is abominable. The boss fights up till Zarpedon were fluff - they shouldn't have been. I'm used to having ""tough"" boss fights in Borderlands. But to suddenly have what appears to be an *exponential* change in the level of difficulty within one boss? Nope. That's just 100% bad design. 2k, you could do better than this. Gearbox, you should be ashamed of the level of crap this game has shoveled out. I won't even grace '2k Australia' with a label of 'game studio'.			"

												OK. Same engine as Borderlands 2 so you can tweak the game to make it look even better. There are New guns and combat mechanics, which are a novelty at best; lasers, double jump, butt stomping. Looks great, sounds good, if not being buggy. The Pc and npc's are very good shame the game tanks so hard. The season pass is not worth it either. Best class was for Me CL4P-TP.That is where the good points end!Gravity jumping Weeee. only to be shot when 3 miles in the air. killed fall back down, then attempt to get a 2nd wind.Then we have flying loot due to anti gravity. When loot is this rare you do not want it flying off in to the Cosmos or Lava flows. Grinder was a way to deal with the weak loot system.This instalment of the franchise, even took the shine off Borderlands 2 for several weeks. Which gave me time for quiet reflection. After many hours of reflecting, realised this was a whole lot of Tosh. 2K Purely just cashed in on the good name that was Borderlands 2. This game is pitiful in the ways you'd not expect it to be.You'll die a lot more, mostly due to falling into space or lava or glitches in the level.Never has one been promised so much, only to not have it delivered. Shock horror. ""Sell the Sizzle not the Sausage"" business model was used here.To sum up; if you have never played any Borderlands games do yourself a ""Solid"" Buy Borderlands 2 it is better in every way. Afterall you are Worth it!Pre-ordering off 2K / Gearbox is now over for me.			"

												I am appalled by this game, which is so far disparate from its predecessors as to not have the right to the title of Borderlands. All of the characters are stronk womyn with colored hair and all the male characters are brutish dumbasses. I played through this. The first lady you encounter in the game is a lesbian and the first boss fights are, you guessed it, brutish dumbass guys trying to restrict her access to the surrounding area because they were rejected by Mrs. Lesbo. I played through this. And then Torgue pops in at random and asks her out. He is rejected. He cries ""Friendzoooooned!"" And then, from the perspective of the future, Torgue interrupts Athena to say that ""I was in a really dark time back then and I want you to know that I am aware that the concept of the 'Friendzone' is an unacceptable, mysoginistic view of women."" I had to stop right there, because my disgust for this game's obvious pandering to sjws had crossed the tolerable threshold.This is coming from the series that previously had Tiny Tina alluding to how dolls strapped to rockets had gratuitous sex and all that, this is coming from the series that seemed to give no ♥♥♥♥s about any convention (and that irreverence was epitomized by the psychos, who we don't see in the pre-sequel at all). To go from that to writing all the characters as lesbian snowflakes and making the game a platform for sjw ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t... I'm disgusted. I should have listened. Even though I only spent $10 on it during a sale... I should have listened.			"

												Well, it's not a bad game really. It's quite fun! (Just finished the campaign at the time writing this review.)Considering I paid less than $40 for it.Borderlands 2 does feel better, but I did enjoy this. But we're all still waiting for the REAL Borderlands 3, not this.Oz. kits are awesome, movement is so much more easier. In fact, it's going to be hard getting used to regular movement when I play BL2.Discounted, it's worth it. Else, you better consider how much of a Borderlands fan you are. I have'nt picked up the Season Pass yet, maybe I won't. Perhaps when it's discounted even further, or maybe a GOTY~ verson (I doubt The Pre-Sequel will get a GOTY title, but a complete pack is a probability indeed).There you have it, my review.TLDR: good game, best picked up at a discount price though. Enjoyable regardless. Consider your love to the Borderlands series when buying at full price.			"

												First of all, i'm very disappointed about this game, heres why(SPOILERS INCLUDED):-Really short playthrough-Alot of plot holes (random creature at the end- it didn't appear at all in BL2)-Glitchy (enemies running into the wall, repeating dialoge..etc)-Sometimes the network connection is really wonky (it broke my friend's game causing her to redownload the game again)-End game boss was underwhelming and somewhat easy to defeat-Too rushed storyline-Very anti-climatic-Less humor-Characters are more tense (except claptrap)-It's weird how claptrap is the only who doesn't need the O2, and in my opinion it's a little unfair to other people who are playing a different character-Very hard to navigate through the map-Less areasGood Things(yay):-New mechanics (buttslams, boosted jumps..etc)-New guns -New characters/NPCs-Moonstones are easier to obtain (based on our experience in BL2 with eridium)This game was kind of a rush, the storyline was too short and obvious and it had it's good moments but it was alot less compared to BL2. If you are planning to get this game, you should wait until it's at a more reasonable price because the price right now... I don't think it's really worth your money. I would give this game a 5/10.

												Buggy as hell, not really well thought-out, not that much content (just running there and back (which they want you to do, since there are few fasttravel stations and they're placed in rather silly places; it sorta feels like Borderlands 1 DLC which was running and running and... running) isn't content; even the raid boss is... oh well not gonna spoil it, but yeah whoever finished the game knows) and expensive as hell. Probably not even that many new legendaries, considering most I dropped for now (except ZX-1) were... yeees, taken straight from Borderlands 2. I liked the music, I liked the story (though rather short), I liked shooting stuff. Despite that - can't recommend it for now. Definitely NOT for that price.EDIT: even better. It appears that there won't be many story DLCs for that, which means that whoever bought the season pass is paying mostly for characters and perhaps UVHM or whatever they come up with. Not much new content really.EDIT2: Here's some good review I agree with: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053229257/recommended/261640/ - sorry I CBA to say that all myself. ;-)			"

												As much as I had hoped this wouldn't just feel like an overpriced DLC, that's exactly what it turned out to be. I'd estimate that around 60% of everything you see during the game are reused assets from BL2.  Which boils down to the fact that they did half the work and want a full $60 for the game for just the base game.  Ammo venders reuse all of Marcus' lines from the previous game, all Hypyrion New-U stations reuse the lines from the previous game, there are a miniscule amount of new designs for weapons, and most textures are ripped directly from BL2.  It's of a respectable length.  I clocked in at 25 hours for my first playthrough with all side quests completed. Story is rather lackluster.  Not particularly exciting.  The writing is below average.  While the humor was less handicapped than BL2 (The curse of Burch), it was mostly miss with only a few hits and laugh out loud moments.The glitches are extensive and catastrophic in the first two weeks since launch.  They include having your entire inventory wiped randomly, leaving only your badass rank and level intact.  Some people suffer constant crashing.  Some people have their entire system restart.  Low gravity and poor collision detection cause loot to fly off the map or through walls.  Being hit with cryo weapons can cause you to become permanently slowed until you restart the game.  It's been two weeks and there is no patch in sight, and the ""hotfixes"" have not fixed ANY of the aforementioned issues.While the gameplay felt reasonable solid playing as Nisha or Athena, Wilhelm's action skill is strictly ""release drones and let them fight for you"" and Claptrap is broken and only of any use playing co-op.Bottom line would have to be that I would have been content if it had released at $30, but at $60 it feels like a cash grab that wasn't as good as either of it's predecessors, and took half the work to make. It's worth playing but not at current cost.  Wait until a Game of the Year edition comes out.  In the meantime you're not missing enough to shell out full price.			"

												This game, unfortunately, is markedly inferior to Borderlands 1 and 2.  Despite using pretty much the same game engine and recycling much of the assets from Borderlands 2, the design of the enemies and levels just aren't at the same level of quality.  The combat rarely rewards careful tactics, instead often degenerating into disorderly brawls - not that this didn't exist in Borderlands 2, but in that game it was usually your choice how to engage the enemies.  Frequently, enemies don't spawn until you're in the middle of a room, then they spawn all around you, and the cover would be ineffective.  Maps are often confusing and lacking in distinctive landmarks.  Boss fights often take place in arenas that are awkward to maneouver or just entirely devoid of cover, again rapidly degenerating into clumsy brawls.  The story is irritating - you work for Handsome Jack, and he's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ - but that is more or less constrained by the story laid down in Borderland 1 and 2.  The humour is, well, Australian.  If you like it, you like it.  If you don't, it'll annoy you.  The one redeeming quality is the final boss fight, which is the only part of the game that, for me, felt like the quality I expect from a Borderlands game - the one part of the game that received the care and polish deserving of the Borderlands franchise.  Basically, what I'm trying to say is, go play Borderlands 2 instead.			"

This game Does reuse BL2, but that's because this is a part of BL2's timeline!It's about how things were before BL2 came out and how they became how they are now. It tells the story of athena (from General Knoxx) and Handsome jack among others. That being said, this game is overpriced. i Recommend this game to any borderlands fan, but DO NOT buy this game unless it's on 40% + or if you dont care about your money.			"

												Plot:I have to say I was a little worried when I first started playing this. I stumbled upon the Borderlands series accidently and started with Tales From the Borderlands. i actually been working backwards and have yet to play BL1, but am a huge fan of BL2. I saved up so I could play presequal, I was so excited for more background on some of the charectors I already loved.At the beginning things didn't feel the same. I knew they weren't supposed to, but I was missing the old charectors, scenery, and familarity I felt with BL2. But as the game went on I fell in love with the story line. Handsome Jack, who was already an all time favorite charector of mine, was well done, and dynamic. His charector is constantly chaning and you really get to know the man behind the mask and what makes him who he is. The final cut scenes had me on the edge of my seat. I flipped out, they were truly amazing! The only thing I wish was that we got to know Angel more, or even more about his back story as a programmer and after the amazing final cut scene there didn't feel like there was any closure. To me it felt like the needed to add one more something to really connect presequal to BL2. Game was beautiful though and as an Artist I so appreciated the coloring, style, and overall look and feel of the enviorment.Gameplay:Has all the feel of the orginials. The only difference being these new lazar guns, the jumping, and oxygen. Guns aren't bad, the game didn't really need them though. the oxygen was way more fun then i thought it was going to be and the double jump really helps you feel like you are in a new enviorment. The Moon curency is a little hard to see versus the stark purple Eridium. The final boss battle just wasn't like Warrior though, that was the only dissapointment. Depends on the person though, if you like the very alien side of Pandora, you'll love it, but if you like the less-explained more resonable (if you can even say that about an alien dragon) you might be a tiny bit dissapointed like me, it just won't have the same feel. Also Concordia is no Sanctuary and I didn't appreciate the passive agressive political views. Violent, probably would recommend for a more mature aduience because of language; but humor is on point and well done.Overall Presequal was amazing and I hope the next borderlands comes out soon, don't know if I can wait three more years!

												Perhaps you could call it burn out from playing more than 200 hours of Borderlands 2, but I wasn't as addicted to this one as Borderlands 2 (my first game in the series). That being said, the combat is probably more enjoyable here than in Borderlands 2 and the story is still pretty good, but it's easy to feel burnt out of the series if you have played a lot of Borderlands 1 or 2. Game play isn't drastically different, so it can feel like a lot of the same old even with all of the butt stomping. Still worth buying, especially on sale.			"

												Butt slam your way across the moon of Pandora, Elpis! Some of the franchises most beloved characters return as NPC's and a NPC from a DLC of the first game is now playable. And the most galvinizing (I made a funny!) NPC of all is now playable: Claptrap! Whether you love him or love to hate him he's the most recognizable character in the series. If you like the prior games you'll love Borderlands: TPS. It keeps most of the same formula but adds just enough new things to keep it interesting.This also is 2K and Gearbox's first game to see simultaneous cross platform release. The PS3, Xbox, Mac, Windows, and Linux versions all released at the same time. Pity I have but one thumbs up to give this game! "

												The third game in the Borderlands series and still going strong!  Only 1/2 the length of Borderlands 2, but a worthy game nonetheless.  Still maintaining its top notch voice acting dialog and gameplay.  Not much has changed graphically from Borderlands 2, but the game still looks fantastic.  The main difference in The Pre-Sequel is it takes place solely in space and you'll have to worry about oxygen as a life resource.  Having oxygen does hinder you somewhat.  Especially in long drawn out fights or just exploring.  You'll find your oxygen tanks low or just on the brink of empty a lot of the time, but there are quite a few oxygen hubs located throughout the entire game. Everything you loved about the previous Borderlands games is here including multiple characters to choose from, skill trees, transportation vehicles and of course the ever loving witty dialog!  Having only spawning 1 story driven DLC this time around the game doesn't offer as much as Borderlands 2, but if you're a fan of the series it's a must play.  New lazers, space ground stomps, ice grenades and so much more kept this game going strong until the end.  And ohhh boy.. the ending boss was great.  Good fun!  Recommended.			"

												I'm going to be disgustingly critical with this game, in only the best effort to sound and thorough.  Compared to BL2, this game is akin to that of another DLC. It's ridiculously short, story wise. and everything else wise. I can load up BL2 and find things that are totally new to me, while in this, nothing is new. After about 4-5 hours one can effectively complete every single quest in the game, and take out the ""hidden"" bosses with relative ease. Honestly, the only reason I actually load up this game anymore is because of the new ""Claptastic Voyage"" DLC, which I'll get into in a second.  The humour, has been utterly destroyed. Honestly, the only thing that remotely makes me laugh at this game anymore is when Racist Hot Dog appears. That's about it. The story itself is pretty meh. You arrive, and just as quickly, you leave. Sudden surprise enemy ""oh no gotta kill that ♥♥♥♥♥ with no backstory!!!!1111!"" is the quickest trope. (I mean, yes there are scattered Echo logs about Zarpedon, but they don't reveal who she is or her background, only that she works for Dahl, and that she used to operate the ship that the Bosun has now taken over.) You then find Janey Springs who is a homosexual. She helps the character throughout. She is also a homosexual. She resides in Concordia with her own shop. Did I mention she was a homosexual? This is honestly how her character feels to have been introduced. Flatly, she's a flat homosexual, who's only real character trait, is that she is a homosexual. You meet the Merrif, who spoiler alert, is a traitor!!!111!!11 ZOMGNOWAI?! What a curveball! Then, the defining moment in whether or not I believe this is a good story or not, you meet Felicity. Poor ♥♥♥♥in' Felicity, man. If I ever met a character that didn't deserve what happened to them, it is Felicity. Felicity, who in an actual decent curveball, turns out to be an AI unit, who runs the Drakensburg, and who also ran it when Zarpedon was in control. She has a very fond dislike for killing, and all she wants is to be copied. That's apparently too much to ask. Poor Felicity, my god did you not deserve that. No one does. That is why this story does not sit right with me. Borderlands is a roughly light-hearted game. That, and for lack of better words, is describable only as ""entirely ♥♥♥♥ed up."" It doesn't belong in a Borderlands-esque setting. I mean, ""yeah we're trying to prove that jack is ♥♥♥♥ed up here blah blah blah"" but Jesus christ that wasn't necessary. Killing Gladstone and his buddies were more than enough to prove that point, but honestly that may just be me. Though, they did manage to kill off the only character with any sort of depth whatsoever. Speaking of Gladstone, you're then tasked to help in the manufacturing of the first ""constructor"", or murdered Felicity. You're sent on a quest to do the single most annoying thing on the planet, and that, is to damage multiple enemies without them dying. Overleveled? ♥♥♥♥ you. Powerful weapons? ♥♥♥♥ you. That's honestly how this quest feels. In an effort to ditch this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ quest, I managed to break one of my saves. Gr8. The game ends with you storming Helios and taking it back and blah blah blah generic plot♥♥♥♥♥♥ Also, Moxxi tries to kill you. That twist is commendable, though virulently hinted at through the last couple segments. It's also hilariously obvious if you have any sort of technological knowledge at all. BUT!!!!!11111!!11 because there needs to be a raid boss, theres an open vault and you go and kill the big scary monster and Jack sees the vault thingy and gets his face burned and blah blah blah. THE END! Honestly, it's a 7/10 story. Better than what most major companies make nowadays. The graphics are the same, which sits pretty with me. Borderlands is a sobel shaded game, and it's pretty cool what they manage with it. The weapons are one of the highlights. Now, I can use my favorites from 2 again. You want new ones? Nah, ♥♥♥♥ that. LASERS!!!!!! Which, is a cool addition, just lazy if you're going to not add new weapons.  DLC!Why, oh why, did the Devs decide, ""YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE GREAT? MORE VAULT HUNTERS! YOU'RE SAYING THE GAME LACKS CONTENT? MORE CHARACTERS!"" I mean, yeah they're cool and all but they have no depth. Timothy has slight depth but other than that they're all as flat as a board. Aurelia is shunned by Hammerlock because she kills things. How sad. She's rich though. The skillsets for these characters are nice though, and I don't have much to bicker at. I have to say that Aurelia is a really well done sniper class, though I may be biased because she's what I main. Speaking of the vault hunters... they're all great. But, yet again, lack of development hinders them greatly. The continuity is nice, with them all being some part of BL2, but other than that, eh. Claptrap has character, only because he's been in all three games thus far. Claptastic Voyage. Something that FEELS like Borderlands. FINALLY. I honestly have nothing really to gripe about except for one thing: That last boss fight is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Fix that♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Let me start by saying this: If Steam had an ""on the fence"" option for reviewing games, then I'd pick it for Borderlands: The Pre-sequel. Unfortunately, it does not. I'll list what's good about it first:-I'd be willing to try out most the characters, since they have a good design and cool abilities (accept one, which even the game itself shuns time and time again.)-The new combat mechanics added for zero gravity handle well and are enjoyable to use-Laser weapons are effective and enjoyable to use-Shops have rares for sale on a regular basis through their timed deals-You can combine three weapons of the same rarity into a new weapon with the same rarity or higher, and you can choose to add in moonstones (the game's special currency) for a special buff and finish on it.-The new cryo element is awesome-The new vehicles are great and handle wellOk... *deep breath* now the bad stuff:-Most (if not all) of the dialogue could've been written by a typical teenager-Characters like to move as little muscle as possible during cutscenes, and have mastered the art of speaking without the movement of lips-I encountered a glitch where I was permantly slowed, and the only way to fix it was to restart the game. It doesn't sound too bad, but...-Points where you can respawn are stupidly scarce. There are checkpoints, but you can't teleport to them... If you need to quit for whatever reason, you've got a lot of walking to do. (Enormous waste of time)-Most enemies are re-skinned enemies from Borderlands 2 with the complete lack of funny quotes. -They pulled the menu system straight from BL2 without fixing the infamous ""scroll glitch""-The map is still lacking a Z-axis, making navigation to different altitudes long and frustrating-I've passed through multiple solid objects, and fallen through the map, killing me. (Which means more walking!)-Leveling up still takes forever-Quests=running a lot-It's basically overpriced DLC if it isn't on sale. So if you actually bothered to read this far, thanks. If you still want to get this game, buy it at 75% off and have some friends to play with.			"

												Chaotic, funny, with amazing scenarios. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is lovely to play.The main story as we all know is Jack's rise to power, which I'm sure all Borderlands 2 fans will love. In my opinion the main story is less interesting than in Borderlands 2, but now our character actually has conversations and I think that's a great addition because we can get to know our character better. Also, the sidequestes are as fun as ever, with a couple of easter eggs here and there.I totally recommend it.			"

												If you have played Civ BE then that is what I would equate this to. But you probably haven't because they have, like, nothing in common. So, here is the really the only problem. IT'S A GOD DAMN RE-SKIN OF BORDERLANDS 2! There I said it. If you like Borderlands 2 then buy this game, just not for $60 USD. It's worth $30 USD max. The story is pretty much the same, the characters are pretty much the same. Think about this, in Borderland 2 there was Axton wo could throw down 1 turret on the ground to be BFF's with. Now with Wilhelm you can get TWO flying turrets. For $60 USD. I recommend this game on the condition that the price goes down. Way down.			"

Low gravity is actually a really fun feature and the new weapons are great too.My only negative with this title is.. Money. The DLC's are way too overpriced for what you get, the Claptrap DLC is good but still too much. As for the DLC characters, may as well take out a mortgage.If you're a fan of the Borderlands series then you'll want to pick this up.If you're new to the series then I suggest starting with the first game or BL2, that would be more bang for your bucks.

												Yes it's good, it's more borderlands how could it now be? But it’s not the best in the series and definitely not the first one I would recommend. Before you get this play Borderlands 2 and if you like that and want more, then play the DLC. It's the best part of the game as far as I’m concerned. If you’ve done all that and you’re still hungry for more then go ahead and pick up the pre sequel, just know it’s not quite up to the standard that borderlands 2 set.			"

												Just when you think one of your favourite franchises can't get any better!Borderlands the Pre-Sequel takes everything that was great about its predacessors (excellent gun play, graphics, performance, voice acting, story and loot) and adds a whole new vertical element through the oxygen system that makes it feel like a completely new game. It will be amazing trying to play another borderlands game without it as it makes that much difference!This game (whilst being the shortest so far) may have the best story of any of the Borderlands games before it (a huge feat considering how much I adored Borderlands 2) and this is in part to the amazing voice acting provided for the game. Huge props to Dameon Clarke who voiced Handsome Jack as he really bought the character and this game to life.In conclusion, play this game. The sub classes are really new and fun (I played as Athena the Gladiator) and the whole package is just fantastic. 10/10P.s: Every game should have the Boganella shotgun.

												It is a decent game. The campaign has a few laughs and the laser guns are a nice addition to the gun types in the series. The oxygen kits are frankly not all that different from the relics though. Some give you weapon damage, others give resistance, some give chance of free grenades. So I wouldn't call it a new feature. The low gravity adds a nice dynamic to the combat, since you now can reach higher places that you wouldn't on Pandora and have to worry about enemies hovering over you which were on ground a moment ago. The characters themselves are good to play with with and their skills are interesting. None of them especially feels overly powerful save for a few combinations and none of them feels weak (cough Axton BL2, cough). The scaling is better than BL2, at least at level 50 (can't tell about it once a level cap increase is released). So, your legendary gear won't go obsolete in 4-5 levels. Good defensive builds are actually viable at level 50, which feels good. The game is overall balanced decently in combat. The player characters also talk more, which is nice if you like more banter (I do). The legendary gear drop rates from enemies are still pretty bad (same as BL2), but the chances of finding legendaries in vendor machines has been increased, so money actually matters in this game if you want good gear and want to buy it when you see it in a machine. The other addition that really makes getting legendaries easier is the grinder, since you don't need to farm for a specific legendary. Just take whatever you got and you canuse the grinder to get a legendary weapon of a desired type (it still leaves some probability since there are many legandaries of a type, say sniper rifles, smgs, pistol etc., but still much better than farming one boss over and over and over).The main complaint is that the campaign is really short. It feels shorter than BL2 campaign for sure, but it also feels shorter than BL1 campaign. You can complete main questline in 10 hours more or less on normal mode, WITHOUT speed running. Many of the side quests are poorly designed, which require to go to the same area over and over because you are not allowed to unlock all side quests at a place at once, for some reason (it was in BL2 as well, a bit, but here it is really bad). The maps are a bit unintuitive and most of them remind me of frostburn canyon from BL2, which was a bit tricky to memorize. The campaign also has a few plot holes and suffers from poor writing regarding how some of the character behaviors seem very forced.Overall, I will recommend this game but not at full price. A price of $35-$40 sounds reasonable for a game of this length. And this is a definite buy for Borderlands series fans. So go on kiddos, buy this game (on sale, not full price) and make Jack happy. Learn how Jack turned from a somewhat moron to a complete psychopath in this game and shoot some bandits (oops, scavs) on the way!			"

												I love this game but i feel like this is a inferior to Borderlands 2. Its a bit short and i have to admit the Oz Kits 'Butt Slams' is a Fun gimmick and attack. But the problem is the cost. In my country 74$. If u compare that to BL2 which is 20$ theres a big difference. Firstly, BL2'S game length is way longer then pre sequel and has more dlcs too. If the cost was lower, this game is going to be a hit. But for now, BL2 is the champ even though Pre-Sequel is really fun.			"

So my suggestion is if you didnt paly any borderlands before,you could have a try.But if you've palyed Borderlands2,you'd better stay away from the presequel cause it only gives you a whole lot worse gameplay experience.(ohh,forgot to mention    Claptrap may be the reason for you to buy it......which I did)			"

												I like Borderlands more as a franchise than this game in particular. The style and playstyle are fun and captivating. That being said, this is almost exactly the same game as borderlands 2. WHich if thats what you're looking for it is great, but if you are hoping for something different or changes to features you will be disappointed. The changes are minor yet clunky. The gravity thing is awkward and is not a part of the game when it would be most useful. Lasers replace slag weapons in a way, but still have unique elemental effects. I mainly got this because I lost borderlands 2 and didn't want to rebuy the same game so it works in that regard. I'm hoping the play style will flow better once my steam controller shows up and I can play it on my big ole TV			"

I would have missed out on a great extension of the series. It was fun to see the same characters and delve into some of the background - a must have for fans of the series.Controllers are as you expect, the machines actually give you great gear like the first did (and the 2nd had failed to do). Gameplay was seamless like I had just picked up from Borderlands 2. There was no reason to complain other than ... I didn't like almost ALMOST feeling bad for Handsome Jack! Oh, the one thing that was a pain in the rear was running out of Oxygen, unless you play the Robot. But you eventually do get used to it.

												I can honestly say, that the pre-sequel has the best gameplay out of all the Borderlands games. Some could argue that Borderlands 2 is the best game of the series and in a way they would be correct. Story and overall progression wise Borderlands 2 is better and the environment is more diverse. But Pre-sequel takes every aspect of Borderlands 2's gameplay and makes it better. For example the skill trees in Borderlands 2 are way more unoriginal and overall stale than in the Pre-sequel.The loot drop rate is also handeld better. In Borderlands 2 I felt lucky if I found a blue loot and extremely lucky if I found a purple loot, and don't even get me started on legendary items. This issue is well solved in the Pre-sequel by making rare loot more common and with the introduction of the grinder. With the grinder you can grind loot you don't desire and get something more desirable.Of course there are issues with Pre-sequel. First even though the pacing right at the begining of the game is better than any other, putting you in the middle of an invasion, the rest of the game is paced extremly poorly. There are times when I don't want to start new characters or start on a new game +, because the begining of the game is extremly tedious. Also Legendary farming is difficult with some loot due to the fact that they don't have a specific boss they drop from.Overall The Pre-sequel beats Borderlands 2 in the gameplay section but otherwise Borderlands 2 is the better game. If you expect an epic story from this game you will be sorely disapointed, but should you just pick up this game with a friend and play it for the experience you wouldn't be dispointed. the game get's a solid 8/10. (also probably should wait for the game to go on sale, overall the games worth with ALL the DLC is about 40-50€)			"

Posted: April 20, 2015
												Okay, I've been putting off this review long enough- but there's definitely quite a lot I want to say.I hear a lot of negativity about this game- saying it's the worst Borderlands game yet, that it should just be a DLC, and that it's not wroth any semblence of money- some people even claimed it was the worst Borderlands game of all time. Personally, I think the game is- in some ways- an improvement, and in others a step back. Let's start with the negatives.The worst part of the game is certainly level designs (this is in the main game). Every level seems to be 'moon with large metal building' or 'moon with blue sky' and my personal favorite 'moon with purple sky'. Levels seem repetive, and variation doesn't exist. The Claptrap DLC, on the other hand, is fantastic when it comes to environments, having some of my favorite level design in any Borderlands game. So, I'm blaming Austrailia for this point (Sorry, mates.)Second, the 'plot twists'. Though some of the plot twists were well handled, others seemed very AREN'T YOU SURPRIIIIISED! I know you're surprised, OH the plot twist. One of my personal favorite of these comes near the beginning (mild spoiler- go to the next paragraph if you don't want it) when you shut down the Jamming Signal on Elpis. You arrived, and go to talk to The Meriff. He avoids you, refusing to speak to you. He's very obviously part of the problem, as he stops you from leaving the town, and his speeches to the town are shifty at best. But then you learn (in Jack's worst performed line yet) that ""UGH! The Merriff's been working for Zarpedon the whole time? GAAAH!"" Real deductive, Jack. Reeeeally deductive. Overall, the story has some fantastic parts *cough* Zarpedon *cough* and some... less fantastic parts. Borderlands 2 wins on story by far (See profile picture of Angel for reference).My final complaint (don't worry, the review gets optimistic in a second), is the minus of killing off new characters. Two characters are introduced, and then subsequently killed in terrible ways. Though their deaths are fantastic, it gives the minus of them never giving us sidequests- the developers best way of showing us characters personalities and backstories. Pickle's ""Another Pickle"" quest, for example, or the infamous tea party in Borderlands 2. It doesn't make the quests as powerful as they could have been. But so it goes.Onto the optimism! Firstly, the characters. All six characters are fun to play, and none of them are unable to hold up at the max level. Characters work well together- Claptrap's boosts to reload speed work perfectly with helping Nisha and Timothy/ Jack to fire like there's no tomorrow, and there's definitely more exciting combos to come up with. There are very few pointless trees, and I actually prefer the selection to Borderlands 2.The biggest thing that made the characters come to life are the changing dialogue. Sure, each characters says the same basic idea, but just having the characters say things at all brought you into the experience. With those dialogue trees, we learned that Aurelia hates Roland's hat, watched Wilhelm become more and more of a monster, say Nisha and Jack's 'love' blossom, built up Timothy as one of my favorite Borderlands characters, got some serious feels with Claptrap, and then say the story from Athena's now protaginistic perspective. The game changed enough so that it rewarded a playthrough on every character- where I can't do another playthrough of Borderlands 2 alone.Control wise, the serious also improved. Double jumping is the best. The gameplay keeps energetic and alive the entire time, and gives movement a new importance that I can never seem to match in Borderlands 2. The Oz kit system is a bit annoying, and I wish the oxygen reserves gave a 25% warning rather than a 50%. But even if you do run out, the worst thing that happens is that you're unable to boost for a second, and then you stand on an air vent and you're fine in five seconds.Overall, I enjoyed this game quite a bit, and I'm likely going to continue levelling up characters and try and get these last two achievements (fricking Ghostbusting...). However, $60 dollars plus DLC price (American Style here) is quite a pretty penny- so I suggest waiting for a sale. It's a big name game on Steam, just wait long enough and you'll be fine. If you're rolling in dough up to you neck, though, no harm in dishing out all the cash. Or maybe handing some to me.Either way. The long short is, story is okay but nothing special, gameplay and characters are fantastic, and Jack's decent into Handsome Jack's awesome, Lilith's a prick and I hate her, Brick and Tina narrate True Vault Hunter mode and have a tickle battle, and it's not as bad a game as people make it out to be.Also there's a Space Jam sidequest. So we have that now.BASKETBAAAAAAAAAAAAAALL!			"

												It's Borderlands 2 with character dialog, lasers, and butt slams. All three are really awesome additions, but basically it's Boarderlands 2 with a few new thins and new (good) characters. So, if you want more Boarderlands 2 (like I did) then this is the game for you.			"

												Love the game. Although quite expensive and not as worth as Borderlands 2, its still great to play.Some pros and cons: Pros:- Great storyline, being able to play as Jack himself as well.- New gameplay mechanics eg. oxygen+buttslam+doube jump, cryo element, jump pads- Great characters with awesome skill trees to mess around with, and each has their own unique lines- Lots of replayability just like Borderlands 2 eg. Grinder, Moxxi Buffs- More uses for Moonstones, the equavalent of eridium in Borderlands 2- Grinder!!- Legendaries and purples are more common in vending machines- LASERS!!!Cons:- Still alot of glitches and bugs currently eg. car jumps have problems, bosses with glitched loot pools- Overall shorter storyline than Borderlands 2- Terrain and maps have alot of death traps, not enought save points and fast travel stations- Poor endgame- A lot of unique weapons were just transferred from Borderlands 2- Small variety of enemiesOverall I love the game and have enjoyed it so far, especially when playing multiplayer. Hope you enjoy it as well! "

												8/10If you're a die hard Borderlands fan like myself, I highly reccommend this game. It ties up a lot of loose ends that were left between Borderlands and Borderlands 2. Even though the game uses the same engine as BL2, I do feel like I'm playing a new game. Especially with new features such as the O2 and low gravity.For Fans: Buy the game! It's a lot of fun and I've thouroughly enjoyed it. Definitely beat the game and start TVHM, they've added some nice story features.For New Comers: Buy Borderlands 2. More bang for your buck, and it's just a great game. (BL:PS is full of Borderlands 2 spoilers anyways)Overall I enjoyed it. But I'm still trying to find buddies who haven't played BL2 with to play through again. I beat BL:TPS and I'm on TVHM but I just don't have the urge to play. I beat normal and TVHM with three different characters on BL2. I don't have that same drive with BL:TPS			"

												An honest and short review for Borderlands Fans...This game is enjoyable and fun, you got new features and items like:-Laser Weapons-Grinder-Oz Kits-Double Jump-Low GravityThat will make you feel good in a new Borderlands game, which is awesome!When you start to play the game you enjoy at some point, after you beat the game you will get stuck with only 1 raid boss! Which means this game has no endgame like Borderlands 2. It's lack out of content:- Small Maps.- No Rare Monsters- Like Chests monsters, Rank up Monsters etc...- No Loot Midgets.- Only 1 Raid Boss.- Few Side Quests.- No Side Maps- that's not for story line but for side quests.- Small Bosses aren't repeatable.- Specific Legendary Items drop only from specific ""not repeatable"" bosses.- Short Game.( I will not mention any bugs! though there's some annoying ones, every new game starts with bugs)In other words, currently the game is short and no content, this is not the Borderlands we used to love!If you want to compare The Pre-Sequel to Borderlands 2- New release to a new release= Borderlands 2 release was way better than Pre-Sequel, with alot more content and endgame.Final review is 7.0Still, i recommend The Pre-Sequel but not now of course! If you love Borderlands games just wait until there's more DLCs in this game. You better play the ""endless"" Borderlands 2 instead.			"

You should look at it more as a Expandalone Pack for Borderlands 2, not a game in its self.The Game shares alot (basically all) of Combat Mechanics minus Improved Manuverability and Variable Gravity.While the game DOES have infuriating moments, that's what happens if you rush the main story.In all; Borderlands 2 Expansion, essentially. New Guns, Better Movement. Lots of Issues.			"

												What makes a good man? That is what ‘Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel’ asks of you in the last 10 minutes, as the avalanche of betrayals, heartbreak, and madness culminates in the creation of one of the finer video-game villains in the last few years. But, is he really the villain? He certainly believes himself to be the hero of this yarn. I guess, in the end, it is left to the Vault Hunter him or herself to decide upon the matter in a way they them self see fit. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the prequel (and, of course, sequel) to one of the finest shooter games of last generation, and the origin of Handsome Jack.Getting in to the meat of this look-back on this game, we shall start with game play. If you played Borderlands 2 (or the first Borderlands, for that matter) you already know the gist of how this game works and plays. You shoot enemies, you collect loot, and you kill more enemies. Subsequently, you also get more loot (and so on, and so on…). The Diablo-esque loot system was already refined in BL2, and did not require much in ways of improvement in TPS. The addition of laser-type guns is a fun one, and is a great addition to the stock experience. The beauty of what makes this system work is of course what every player loves-to-hate, RNG. Do you get a purple VLADOF sniper rifle that shoots corrosive bullets, all the while playing Mozart’s ‘Requiem’ in a solemn remembrance for the hundreds you have (and will) kill? Or do you receive a six shooter, which in a true Joker fashion doesn’t even shoot bullets? RNG at its finest.The general game play, which is pretty much copy-and-paste from BL2, is enhanced by the addition of zero (almost) gravity. Jumping around has never been more delicious, and the fact that you can kill your enemies by butt-slamming on to them is just pure awesomeness. As fun as it is to just jump  up and down, all around, whilst breaking necks and taking names, the addition of platforming proves to be a two-edged sword. Whilst it does give a certain sense of exhilaration, going higher and higher, and exploring the countryside, when you get knocked back by an explosion or a ‘Lunatic’ (TPS’s Psycho) landing right next to you, or (as it happened many times to me) you just accidentally walk off of the edge, yer dead. And it’s back to the last save point for ya! This happened in such a rarity to me in early game that it didn’t prove to be more than an annoyance. But as the game progresses in to the late-game parts, especially in the purple-land-of-go-f***k-yourself, I could swear the developers were playing a practical joke on me.The moon of Pandora, on which this game unfolds, is called Elpis. And hot-damn! How beautiful it is. As much as I loved BL2, one thing that always annoyed me (which was kind of bad, it being the most important part of it) was the world of Pandora. There just were too many browns, and reds, and just purely dull colors. Elpis, on the other hand, is a lot of…white. White ground, white walls, black sky. But look just over the horizon…and you’ll see some damn awesome backgrounds. The beauty of the space, mixed with all kinds of stuff that comes out of the ground, just makes the view very pleasing to the eye.But, enough with that chatter. Let us enter the REAL meat of this review (and my favorite part of the whole game): the story, and characters. I personally hold these 4 Vault Hunters (Athena, Nisha, CL4P-TP, and Wilhelm) to be the best VH’s from the past 16. Maybe it’s the fact that we FINALLY get some interaction from them in regards to what happens in the story. Or maybe it’s how awesomely these 4 fit with the story of BL2. (*slight SPOILERS FOR BL2*) If you played BL2, you must remember Wilhelm, the slaughterer of New Haven, and someone, of whom even Angel was afraid of, and Nisha, the iron-fisted ruler and sheriff of Lynchwood, and Handsome Jacks’ girlfriend. They, of course, are one half of the VH quadruplet that saves Elpis. The second half is (oh god…) CL4P-TP (or Claptrap), and Athena. Claptrap you’ll know from the beginning, and entire game, of BL2, who heralds your ability to walk as being “…Handsome Jacks’ downfall!” And Athena actually comes from the first Borderlands, from the DLC ‘General Knoxx’s Secret Armoury’, as well as the EXCELLENT Tell-Tale’s ‘Tales from the Borderlands’ game (which actually happens after TPS).To complement these excellent VH’s, you have Mad Moxxi (of course), Lilith and Roland, a new character called Janey Spring’s (who actually also appears in ‘Tales...’), and of course, Jack. I do not want to spill anything, but this game made me despise Lilith EVEN MORE than I already did, and made me love and feel sad for Jack (EVEN MORE than I already did).  Let’s just say that Lilith is kind of a (huge) ♥♥♥♥♥, who may have single handedly caused things that happened in BL2 to be as bad as they were. I actually rooted for Jack (duh, he’s one main characters) the entire game, and it this had been a completely ‘choose-your-self’ game, I would not have blinked a single eyelash before joining forces with Jack, and sticking a hot skewer through Lilith’s eye. But, alas, it is a fixed story, and I, playing as Athena, walked away from Jack, saddened that the man who was a Hero, who saved hundreds of people, descended in to madness.Now, the final thing; the score. I personally loved the game, and I bet anyone who has had even a vested interest in BL2 will love, or like, this game as well. But for someone who is brand new to the franchise, Borderlands 2 is a much better starting point (even so than Borderlands 1). Though I loved the game, the last chapter of the game, which happens as you fight your way to a vault, was one of the most infuriating and skill-demanding levels in any game I have ever played. I, myself, play solo completely, and thus I had no help whatsoever as I faced a wave after wave of some of the most infuriating enemy types and mini-bosses. The level represents, in my honest opinion, a HUGE rise in difficulty. And it will be VERY infuriating. But, once you have finally gotten to the end, you can’t help but smile. ‘The Pre-Sequel’ is a great game, from a now defunct studio, and one that any self-deserving Borderlands fan should experience. 8.5/10 "

												Maybe I was expecting too much.  As a huge Borderlands 2 fan, it is unfortunate that the Pre-Sequel does not have the same magic as 2.  This game is fun but needs some serious rescuing from the DLC.  Giving all the characters Australian accents was not a good idea in my opinion.  I just have to assume that the people who live on the moon are from Australia and the people who live on Pandora are not.  The story is tedious and the upgrading feels more like grinding.  2K, you are losing an opportunity to build this franchise into one of the greatest ever by making a money grab with this latest installment.  I am only recommending this because there is no option other than yes or no.  It is a good game, but don't expect the Borderlands 2 experience here.			"

												this is a very well made game but like all great games there are flaws legendarys are either really rare of so easy to get you can find then off the bat.to that point if they are really rare you have to farm for them and some bosses that drop the best loot you can only fight once making it really hard to get good loot.i will have to say the gameplay is well made and greatly developed but unlike to other games were you could do the story and be coughbt up to in levels you NEED to do side missions in this one just to get past the story witch draws some people away.it may seem like this game is not good but im just telling you the things i think are wrong with it i cant even fit all the good things in this game in this reveiw box.I would say you could play these games in order and you would now everything about the series, so thats gets a yes in my book.

This game Does reuse BL2, but that's because this is a part of BL2's timeline!It's about how things were before BL2 came out and how they became how they are now. It tells the story of athena (from General Knoxx) and Handsome jack among others. That being said, this game is overpriced. i Recommend this game to any borderlands fan, but DO NOT buy this game unless it's on 40% + or if you dont care about your money.			"

												ONLY BUY IF YOU LOVED BL2 and BL AND NEED MORE. Honestly this games story could have been DLC and that would have been awesome as there were very few sidequests that lived up to the first two games.I found this game very lackluster. At first the anti-gravity jumping seems cool at first but i found it to take a lot of way from combat and gameplay.The Oz kit was fun( a lot of fun in areas without the anti gravity) but anti-gravity was everywhere. If it wasn't everywhere ( like 80% of the game ) it would have been fun to go out and moonwalk but after a few hours I was getting annoyed by it. My favorite part of the game was towards the end on Helios where you till had the Oz kit to do some flying but wasn't everything.... I atleast lost 4 legendary items to them flying off a cliff along with a few quest items and myself. Along with being annoying to get thrown all over place it really effected what guns i used. I found without atleast 90%+ accuracy i couldn't hit♥♥♥♥♥♥(I may be a bad shotting but in BL and BL2 i didn't worry about it) top with the fact things stay airborn way to long. My next big problem goes with the airborn problem as ALL the enemys seemed to fly or were at my feet on the ground. Get ready to aim at your feet to kill the 10000000 torks and other creatures that spawn or spray into the sky as every scav/bandit flys and sometimes for way to long.I bought on sale for $20 and i think that was a little too much but as i loved borderlands i can live with the purchase (id be really upset if i bought at full tho) sooooo I want to say MAYBE but ill hit yes just because my two biggest problems arent game breaking more just annoying aspects and i loved borderlands since me and my friend played it back in highschool.

												Plot:I have to say I was a little worried when I first started playing this. I stumbled upon the Borderlands series accidently and started with Tales From the Borderlands. i actually been working backwards and have yet to play BL1, but am a huge fan of BL2. I saved up so I could play presequal, I was so excited for more background on some of the charectors I already loved.At the beginning things didn't feel the same. I knew they weren't supposed to, but I was missing the old charectors, scenery, and familarity I felt with BL2. But as the game went on I fell in love with the story line. Handsome Jack, who was already an all time favorite charector of mine, was well done, and dynamic. His charector is constantly chaning and you really get to know the man behind the mask and what makes him who he is. The final cut scenes had me on the edge of my seat. I flipped out, they were truly amazing! The only thing I wish was that we got to know Angel more, or even more about his back story as a programmer and after the amazing final cut scene there didn't feel like there was any closure. To me it felt like the needed to add one more something to really connect presequal to BL2. Game was beautiful though and as an Artist I so appreciated the coloring, style, and overall look and feel of the enviorment.Gameplay:Has all the feel of the orginials. The only difference being these new lazar guns, the jumping, and oxygen. Guns aren't bad, the game didn't really need them though. the oxygen was way more fun then i thought it was going to be and the double jump really helps you feel like you are in a new enviorment. The Moon curency is a little hard to see versus the stark purple Eridium. The final boss battle just wasn't like Warrior though, that was the only dissapointment. Depends on the person though, if you like the very alien side of Pandora, you'll love it, but if you like the less-explained more resonable (if you can even say that about an alien dragon) you might be a tiny bit dissapointed like me, it just won't have the same feel. Also Concordia is no Sanctuary and I didn't appreciate the passive agressive political views. Violent, probably would recommend for a more mature aduience because of language; but humor is on point and well done.Overall Presequal was amazing and I hope the next borderlands comes out soon, don't know if I can wait three more years!

Only thing im very dissapointed are the DLC's, BL2 had awesome dlcs with ton of content, curently there are 4 dlcs, yet they have brought you, the player, nothing. -Shock drop slaughter pit is nicely made arena where, again, u will shoot stuff in few waves.....-Holodome is boring arena where npcs get stuck, so u have to literally search for them, so the next wave can start-And the last 2 dlcs are the biggest dissapointment for me, sure nice they have added new characters, cool, i loved mechomancer in BL2, but they have added nothing else, so 10e for only a character is joke. First i thought nice new character, maybe there will be some sort of side storyline separate from the former 4 characters, but nope. U have new character, but u will do the same boring♥♥♥♥♥♥all over again, on all difficulties, with no changes, except difficulty and npcs names.So it's great game, but DO NOT BUY the dlcs or SEASON PASS ffs "

												I've heard this game receive a lot of hate for its major similarities to Borderlands 2, but it's not all bad. In my opinion the difficulty vamped up, yes maybe to extend it's duration, but still I found it compelling to play for the sake of the feeling of triumph. Especially over the Boss near the end of the game (It's very similar to the BNK-R from Borderlands 2, but harder somehow). I played through the game twice, and am now on my third playthrough. For its flaws (which it has many of, don't get me wrong, for instance maybe the story was a bit short or maybe it's that the difficulty is too hard?) it is still a game I'd recommend to any Borderlands fan. 8.5/10			"

												Perhaps you could call it burn out from playing more than 200 hours of Borderlands 2, but I wasn't as addicted to this one as Borderlands 2 (my first game in the series). That being said, the combat is probably more enjoyable here than in Borderlands 2 and the story is still pretty good, but it's easy to feel burnt out of the series if you have played a lot of Borderlands 1 or 2. Game play isn't drastically different, so it can feel like a lot of the same old even with all of the butt stomping. Still worth buying, especially on sale.			"

												Is it as good as Borderlands 2? -> It's hard to follow a great successor...  Is it better than hundreds of ""said to be great"" games out there? Yes!There is absolutely nothing wrong with this game it took me about 40 hours to finish first run with all sidequests (except raid boss)  - so its a great game with plenty to doIn my opinion, if you enjoyed Borderlands 2 get this one too.

												i just got the pc copy but ive been playing it on ps3. ive read some of the negative reviews and they all seem to gravitate to the same problems: ported weapons, non respawnable bosses, not the best story, and not alot of things to look at besides space. for the ported weapons, in my opinion, that isnt a bad thing, i know it wasnt very creative, but for a game that is mainly just story filler and we all knew it was gonna be shorter, i like not having to take the time to learn alot of new weapons and what they do. having most of the legendaries recycled made it easy to know which guns would go good with each charecter without having to do alot of reaserch into it. kok non respawnable bosses does suck, cant really argue that.the story was short, but it did what at least i expected. to learn about jacks past and how he became the way he was. although i know there are echos in bl2 that explain alot, it was still nice to go a little more into what i believe is one of the best villians of any video game. and the scenery was boring, but its a game on the moon. you are gonna see the moon. when youre on helios it looks nice.i still have a lot to play, ive only beaten it with 2 of the vault hunters, but i think the game delivers what it was meant to deliver. also, i got it for the half off deal that was just going on, i suggest waiting for another because although i will defend this game to the end, i dont think its worth the 60 bucks.

												Borderlands: The Pre Sequel is definitely a fun experience. Overall, the game is well made and I really can't stress how entertaining it is. But, is it worth the price tag? The blunt answer is no. Luckily I did not pay full price and got it bundled with the season pass for $20. $20-30 is the most this game should've asked for. While it has quality content there isn't much. The story itself takes maybe 15 hours at most. The world is much smaller, the story is shorter, less sidemissions and fewer interesting personalties than in Borderlands 2. The vertical leveling was also quite annoying and made finding your way around or find missions or mission objectives a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥The story is pretty solid, with some entertaining bit sprinkled in and a few returning faces. The huge problem I had with the story was I didn't have any sense of urgency. In BL2 you feel this urge to defeat that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Handsome Jack who is threatening Pandora. In BLPS you can't really get that connection to any of the ""villains"". Zarpedon is the closest you get to that and she really isn't an intrecate part of the story. You might hear her shout something to her soldiers like ""Blow this up!"" or ""Stop him!"" but that's where it ends. Some of the plot is really confusing too. Why are we following Athena's point of view when you're not playing Athena? Even in multiplayer it will show Athena in cutscenes and not the entire group.The characters were okay. Janey Springs was well done, so was The Meriff, of course Crazy Earl and that little kid I can't really remember. I've heard a lot of people complain about Janey and they're usually sad sap loonies. There weren't an awful lot of characters and none of them really have anything terribly intresting about them unlike the ones from BL2 we all loved. The player characters were excently done though, and interact with Jack and other NPCs differently and actually talk. I thought the different abilities were pretty nice, escpecially the DLC ones. Enemies on the other hand weren't done so well. The scavs and lunitics really aren't as good as their raider and pyscho counterparts. They never really say anything intresting or have much variation other than charcter models. Other than that, the UI is basically the same, there's moonstones (which is basically eridium), laser weapons which are pretty cool, Australian accents everywhere, butt slamming, cyro weapons and Mad Moxxi.Don't buy on full price, wait for a sale and you won't regret it.

												I'm going to be disgustingly critical with this game, in only the best effort to sound and thorough.  Compared to BL2, this game is akin to that of another DLC. It's ridiculously short, story wise. and everything else wise. I can load up BL2 and find things that are totally new to me, while in this, nothing is new. After about 4-5 hours one can effectively complete every single quest in the game, and take out the ""hidden"" bosses with relative ease. Honestly, the only reason I actually load up this game anymore is because of the new ""Claptastic Voyage"" DLC, which I'll get into in a second.  The humour, has been utterly destroyed. Honestly, the only thing that remotely makes me laugh at this game anymore is when Racist Hot Dog appears. That's about it. The story itself is pretty meh. You arrive, and just as quickly, you leave. Sudden surprise enemy ""oh no gotta kill that ♥♥♥♥♥ with no backstory!!!!1111!"" is the quickest trope. (I mean, yes there are scattered Echo logs about Zarpedon, but they don't reveal who she is or her background, only that she works for Dahl, and that she used to operate the ship that the Bosun has now taken over.) You then find Janey Springs who is a homosexual. She helps the character throughout. She is also a homosexual. She resides in Concordia with her own shop. Did I mention she was a homosexual? This is honestly how her character feels to have been introduced. Flatly, she's a flat homosexual, who's only real character trait, is that she is a homosexual. You meet the Merrif, who spoiler alert, is a traitor!!!111!!11 ZOMGNOWAI?! What a curveball! Then, the defining moment in whether or not I believe this is a good story or not, you meet Felicity. Poor ♥♥♥♥in' Felicity, man. If I ever met a character that didn't deserve what happened to them, it is Felicity. Felicity, who in an actual decent curveball, turns out to be an AI unit, who runs the Drakensburg, and who also ran it when Zarpedon was in control. She has a very fond dislike for killing, and all she wants is to be copied. That's apparently too much to ask. Poor Felicity, my god did you not deserve that. No one does. That is why this story does not sit right with me. Borderlands is a roughly light-hearted game. That, and for lack of better words, is describable only as ""entirely ♥♥♥♥ed up."" It doesn't belong in a Borderlands-esque setting. I mean, ""yeah we're trying to prove that jack is ♥♥♥♥ed up here blah blah blah"" but Jesus christ that wasn't necessary. Killing Gladstone and his buddies were more than enough to prove that point, but honestly that may just be me. Though, they did manage to kill off the only character with any sort of depth whatsoever. Speaking of Gladstone, you're then tasked to help in the manufacturing of the first ""constructor"", or murdered Felicity. You're sent on a quest to do the single most annoying thing on the planet, and that, is to damage multiple enemies without them dying. Overleveled? ♥♥♥♥ you. Powerful weapons? ♥♥♥♥ you. That's honestly how this quest feels. In an effort to ditch this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ quest, I managed to break one of my saves. Gr8. The game ends with you storming Helios and taking it back and blah blah blah generic plot♥♥♥♥♥♥ Also, Moxxi tries to kill you. That twist is commendable, though virulently hinted at through the last couple segments. It's also hilariously obvious if you have any sort of technological knowledge at all. BUT!!!!!11111!!11 because there needs to be a raid boss, theres an open vault and you go and kill the big scary monster and Jack sees the vault thingy and gets his face burned and blah blah blah. THE END! Honestly, it's a 7/10 story. Better than what most major companies make nowadays. The graphics are the same, which sits pretty with me. Borderlands is a sobel shaded game, and it's pretty cool what they manage with it. The weapons are one of the highlights. Now, I can use my favorites from 2 again. You want new ones? Nah, ♥♥♥♥ that. LASERS!!!!!! Which, is a cool addition, just lazy if you're going to not add new weapons.  DLC!Why, oh why, did the Devs decide, ""YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE GREAT? MORE VAULT HUNTERS! YOU'RE SAYING THE GAME LACKS CONTENT? MORE CHARACTERS!"" I mean, yeah they're cool and all but they have no depth. Timothy has slight depth but other than that they're all as flat as a board. Aurelia is shunned by Hammerlock because she kills things. How sad. She's rich though. The skillsets for these characters are nice though, and I don't have much to bicker at. I have to say that Aurelia is a really well done sniper class, though I may be biased because she's what I main. Speaking of the vault hunters... they're all great. But, yet again, lack of development hinders them greatly. The continuity is nice, with them all being some part of BL2, but other than that, eh. Claptrap has character, only because he's been in all three games thus far. Claptastic Voyage. Something that FEELS like Borderlands. FINALLY. I honestly have nothing really to gripe about except for one thing: That last boss fight is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Fix that♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

Nice classic borderlands feel2. runs well if you can get past the launcher crashes3. okay story4.CO-OP works fineNow for the Cons:CONS1.crashes ALOT2.Game gets very dry towards the end3.Game repeats itself alot4.Fails to keep intrest5.has bad patches6.forces humor on to claptrap(which isnt that funny anyway)7.loads of things in the game are broken8.bosses dont work properly(AT DATE OF TIME WRITTEN)OverallIn short do not get this game. wait for it to be fixed and has proven itself to even be in the same steam library as borderlands 2/1. If you are desperate for new borderlands then you're better off watching a lets play of it in fullscreen pretending to play it with a controller plugged in.			"

												Butt slam your way across the moon of Pandora, Elpis! Some of the franchises most beloved characters return as NPC's and a NPC from a DLC of the first game is now playable. And the most galvinizing (I made a funny!) NPC of all is now playable: Claptrap! Whether you love him or love to hate him he's the most recognizable character in the series. If you like the prior games you'll love Borderlands: TPS. It keeps most of the same formula but adds just enough new things to keep it interesting.This also is 2K and Gearbox's first game to see simultaneous cross platform release. The PS3, Xbox, Mac, Windows, and Linux versions all released at the same time. Pity I have but one thumbs up to give this game! "

												If you have played Civ BE then that is what I would equate this to. But you probably haven't because they have, like, nothing in common. So, here is the really the only problem. IT'S A GOD DAMN RE-SKIN OF BORDERLANDS 2! There I said it. If you like Borderlands 2 then buy this game, just not for $60 USD. It's worth $30 USD max. The story is pretty much the same, the characters are pretty much the same. Think about this, in Borderland 2 there was Axton wo could throw down 1 turret on the ground to be BFF's with. Now with Wilhelm you can get TWO flying turrets. For $60 USD. I recommend this game on the condition that the price goes down. Way down.			"

												Let me start by saying this: If Steam had an ""on the fence"" option for reviewing games, then I'd pick it for Borderlands: The Pre-sequel. Unfortunately, it does not. I'll list what's good about it first:-I'd be willing to try out most the characters, since they have a good design and cool abilities (accept one, which even the game itself shuns time and time again.)-The new combat mechanics added for zero gravity handle well and are enjoyable to use-Laser weapons are effective and enjoyable to use-Shops have rares for sale on a regular basis through their timed deals-You can combine three weapons of the same rarity into a new weapon with the same rarity or higher, and you can choose to add in moonstones (the game's special currency) for a special buff and finish on it.-The new cryo element is awesome-The new vehicles are great and handle wellOk... *deep breath* now the bad stuff:-Most (if not all) of the dialogue could've been written by a typical teenager-Characters like to move as little muscle as possible during cutscenes, and have mastered the art of speaking without the movement of lips-I encountered a glitch where I was permantly slowed, and the only way to fix it was to restart the game. It doesn't sound too bad, but...-Points where you can respawn are stupidly scarce. There are checkpoints, but you can't teleport to them... If you need to quit for whatever reason, you've got a lot of walking to do. (Enormous waste of time)-Most enemies are re-skinned enemies from Borderlands 2 with the complete lack of funny quotes. -They pulled the menu system straight from BL2 without fixing the infamous ""scroll glitch""-The map is still lacking a Z-axis, making navigation to different altitudes long and frustrating-I've passed through multiple solid objects, and fallen through the map, killing me. (Which means more walking!)-Leveling up still takes forever-Quests=running a lot-It's basically overpriced DLC if it isn't on sale. So if you actually bothered to read this far, thanks. If you still want to get this game, buy it at 75% off and have some friends to play with.			"

												Maybe I was expecting too much.  As a huge Borderlands 2 fan, it is unfortunate that the Pre-Sequel does not have the same magic as 2.  This game is fun but needs some serious rescuing from the DLC.  Giving all the characters Australian accents was not a good idea in my opinion.  I just have to assume that the people who live on the moon are from Australia and the people who live on Pandora are not.  The story is tedious and the upgrading feels more like grinding.  2K, you are losing an opportunity to build this franchise into one of the greatest ever by making a money grab with this latest installment.  I am only recommending this because there is no option other than yes or no.  It is a good game, but don't expect the Borderlands 2 experience here.			"

												The third game in the Borderlands series and still going strong!  Only 1/2 the length of Borderlands 2, but a worthy game nonetheless.  Still maintaining its top notch voice acting dialog and gameplay.  Not much has changed graphically from Borderlands 2, but the game still looks fantastic.  The main difference in The Pre-Sequel is it takes place solely in space and you'll have to worry about oxygen as a life resource.  Having oxygen does hinder you somewhat.  Especially in long drawn out fights or just exploring.  You'll find your oxygen tanks low or just on the brink of empty a lot of the time, but there are quite a few oxygen hubs located throughout the entire game. Everything you loved about the previous Borderlands games is here including multiple characters to choose from, skill trees, transportation vehicles and of course the ever loving witty dialog!  Having only spawning 1 story driven DLC this time around the game doesn't offer as much as Borderlands 2, but if you're a fan of the series it's a must play.  New lazers, space ground stomps, ice grenades and so much more kept this game going strong until the end.  And ohhh boy.. the ending boss was great.  Good fun!  Recommended.			"

The DLC's are way too overpriced for what you get, the Claptrap DLC is good but still too much. As for the DLC characters, may as well take out a mortgage.If you're a fan of the Borderlands series then you'll want to pick this up.If you're new to the series then I suggest starting with the first game or BL2, that would be more bang for your bucks.

In my opinion the main story is less interesting than in Borderlands 2, but now our character actually has conversations and I think that's a great addition because we can get to know our character better.

After playing BL2 I came to expect many more varieties so I got tired of killing the same enimies over and over again.  Claptrap was pretty fun to play as.

												I can honestly say, that the pre-sequel has the best gameplay out of all the Borderlands games. Some could argue that Borderlands 2 is the best game of the series and in a way they would be correct. Story and overall progression wise Borderlands 2 is better and the environment is more diverse. But Pre-sequel takes every aspect of Borderlands 2's gameplay and makes it better. For example the skill trees in Borderlands 2 are way more unoriginal and overall stale than in the Pre-sequel.The loot drop rate is also handeld better. In Borderlands 2 I felt lucky if I found a blue loot and extremely lucky if I found a purple loot, and don't even get me started on legendary items. This issue is well solved in the Pre-sequel by making rare loot more common and with the introduction of the grinder. With the grinder you can grind loot you don't desire and get something more desirable.Of course there are issues with Pre-sequel. First even though the pacing right at the begining of the game is better than any other, putting you in the middle of an invasion, the rest of the game is paced extremly poorly. There are times when I don't want to start new characters or start on a new game +, because the begining of the game is extremly tedious. Also Legendary farming is difficult with some loot due to the fact that they don't have a specific boss they drop from.Overall The Pre-sequel beats Borderlands 2 in the gameplay section but otherwise Borderlands 2 is the better game. If you expect an epic story from this game you will be sorely disapointed, but should you just pick up this game with a friend and play it for the experience you wouldn't be dispointed. the game get's a solid 8/10. (also probably should wait for the game to go on sale, overall the games worth with ALL the DLC is about 40-50€)			"

												Okay, I've been putting off this review long enough- but there's definitely quite a lot I want to say.I hear a lot of negativity about this game- saying it's the worst Borderlands game yet, that it should just be a DLC, and that it's not wroth any semblence of money- some people even claimed it was the worst Borderlands game of all time. Personally, I think the game is- in some ways- an improvement, and in others a step back. Let's start with the negatives.The worst part of the game is certainly level designs (this is in the main game). Every level seems to be 'moon with large metal building' or 'moon with blue sky' and my personal favorite 'moon with purple sky'. Levels seem repetive, and variation doesn't exist. The Claptrap DLC, on the other hand, is fantastic when it comes to environments, having some of my favorite level design in any Borderlands game. So, I'm blaming Austrailia for this point (Sorry, mates.)Second, the 'plot twists'. Though some of the plot twists were well handled, others seemed very AREN'T YOU SURPRIIIIISED! I know you're surprised, OH the plot twist. One of my personal favorite of these comes near the beginning (mild spoiler- go to the next paragraph if you don't want it) when you shut down the Jamming Signal on Elpis. You arrived, and go to talk to The Meriff. He avoids you, refusing to speak to you. He's very obviously part of the problem, as he stops you from leaving the town, and his speeches to the town are shifty at best. But then you learn (in Jack's worst performed line yet) that ""UGH! The Merriff's been working for Zarpedon the whole time? GAAAH!"" Real deductive, Jack. Reeeeally deductive. Overall, the story has some fantastic parts *cough* Zarpedon *cough* and some... less fantastic parts. Borderlands 2 wins on story by far (See profile picture of Angel for reference).My final complaint (don't worry, the review gets optimistic in a second), is the minus of killing off new characters. Two characters are introduced, and then subsequently killed in terrible ways. Though their deaths are fantastic, it gives the minus of them never giving us sidequests- the developers best way of showing us characters personalities and backstories. Pickle's ""Another Pickle"" quest, for example, or the infamous tea party in Borderlands 2. It doesn't make the quests as powerful as they could have been. But so it goes.Onto the optimism! Firstly, the characters. All six characters are fun to play, and none of them are unable to hold up at the max level. Characters work well together- Claptrap's boosts to reload speed work perfectly with helping Nisha and Timothy/ Jack to fire like there's no tomorrow, and there's definitely more exciting combos to come up with. There are very few pointless trees, and I actually prefer the selection to Borderlands 2.The biggest thing that made the characters come to life are the changing dialogue. Sure, each characters says the same basic idea, but just having the characters say things at all brought you into the experience. With those dialogue trees, we learned that Aurelia hates Roland's hat, watched Wilhelm become more and more of a monster, say Nisha and Jack's 'love' blossom, built up Timothy as one of my favorite Borderlands characters, got some serious feels with Claptrap, and then say the story from Athena's now protaginistic perspective. The game changed enough so that it rewarded a playthrough on every character- where I can't do another playthrough of Borderlands 2 alone.Control wise, the serious also improved. Double jumping is the best. The gameplay keeps energetic and alive the entire time, and gives movement a new importance that I can never seem to match in Borderlands 2. The Oz kit system is a bit annoying, and I wish the oxygen reserves gave a 25% warning rather than a 50%. But even if you do run out, the worst thing that happens is that you're unable to boost for a second, and then you stand on an air vent and you're fine in five seconds.Overall, I enjoyed this game quite a bit, and I'm likely going to continue levelling up characters and try and get these last two achievements (fricking Ghostbusting...). However, $60 dollars plus DLC price (American Style here) is quite a pretty penny- so I suggest waiting for a sale. It's a big name game on Steam, just wait long enough and you'll be fine. If you're rolling in dough up to you neck, though, no harm in dishing out all the cash. Or maybe handing some to me.Either way. The long short is, story is okay but nothing special, gameplay and characters are fantastic, and Jack's decent into Handsome Jack's awesome, Lilith's a prick and I hate her, Brick and Tina narrate True Vault Hunter mode and have a tickle battle, and it's not as bad a game as people make it out to be.Also there's a Space Jam sidequest. So we have that now.BASKETBAAAAAAAAAAAAAALL!			"

												It was cool to learn more about Jack's background story, as well learning about familar past vault hunters'. I enjoyed the game overall, although it felt short, yet I had plenty of laughs along the way. Although I played the game single player, it would have been awesome to expierenced it with friends. =] I hoping there will more DLC announced in the future, like Borderlands 2!			"

												Love the game. Although quite expensive and not as worth as Borderlands 2, its still great to play.Some pros and cons: Pros:- Great storyline, being able to play as Jack himself as well.- New gameplay mechanics eg. oxygen+buttslam+doube jump, cryo element, jump pads- Great characters with awesome skill trees to mess around with, and each has their own unique lines- Lots of replayability just like Borderlands 2 eg. Grinder, Moxxi Buffs- More uses for Moonstones, the equavalent of eridium in Borderlands 2- Grinder!!- Legendaries and purples are more common in vending machines- LASERS!!!Cons:- Still alot of glitches and bugs currently eg. car jumps have problems, bosses with glitched loot pools- Overall shorter storyline than Borderlands 2- Terrain and maps have alot of death traps, not enought save points and fast travel stations- Poor endgame- A lot of unique weapons were just transferred from Borderlands 2- Small variety of enemiesOverall I love the game and have enjoyed it so far, especially when playing multiplayer. Hope you enjoy it as well! "

												I've read a lot of detailed reviews that get many things right on the good side, but I have to disagree to some extent on the negativity.  The levels do seem boring at first and they are more boring than BL2 overall.  However, my biggest complaint was getting around early on.  The game takes awhile to offer you fast travel and vehicles to speed things up.  Well, BL2 did also, BUT the levels weren't so repetitive looking to start.  They do get better over time, but the first several levels of the Pre-Sequel are pretty boring.  Yes, the game is a hand-me-down and so one would expect more time on levels since there was less time needed to develop the game instead.  This is clearly a money/greed kind of issue (overpriced at $60, but probably worth it when on sale at $25-30) combined with a rush to get a sequel out faster.  However, at least the game is based on the totally awesome BL2 and less so on the original which I've started playing, but find it hard to get into due to point-of-view issues that can be hacked, but never truly fixed along with any kind of mini-map making it a PITA to navigate, horrible guns early on that are hard to easily compare, etc.  It's just painful to play, yet reading reviews on here that paint it as the second coming while the pre-sequel is total crap for not giving you farming farming farming farming BOREDOM action for the first 161 days, well... I can only conclude that some people see VERY different things in this series than I do.Generally speaking, I don't really farm the first two levels of BL2 or the Pre-Sequel.  it's totally 100% unnecessary.  You can get by quite handily with purple and even blue weapons with a reasonable skill tree.  In fact, the skill trees are vastly more fun, at least with Athena compared to Zero.  I love the Tron-like ""disc"" she has and how you can build it up to do all kinds of interesting things and serve as a secondary shield, making her character able to survive solo in situations some characters would have trouble with.  I thin Zero was vastly more fun for the first two difficulties for actual melee as he could rush enemies with a skill tree option while stealthed and then take out multiple more enemies.  This worked great in True Vault Hunger Mode, but he couldn't generally do enough damage in Ultimate mode whereas Athena's skills with some stack skills added seems to scale much better in that regard.  That brings us to Legendaries.  They were pretty much a MUST in Ultimate on BL2 if you wanted to play alone for any length of time as trying to spray enemies with slag and then kill them is a pain.  It works better in team mode, but there isn't always someone available to play when you need one.  The problem is BL2 was super stingy with them.  I did see them in the occasional vending machine and almost all the time in the DLC 'token' machines (unlike some that have played longer than I have) and I probably got around six playing alone through the first two skill levels (normal and true vault), all without all that boring farming (with the exception of farming for the Bee to try it out and that didn't take long at all with Hunter Hellquest).  You had two choices as your level went up.  You could spend ages farming for a higher level version, trade/clone or use an editor to level up your weapons to match your current level.  I played around with all three over time, but ultimately found it easier to just level my weapons so they wouldn't be useless and I wouldn't have to farm forever.  The game should have a leveling quest or option, IMO.  The Pre-Sequel, however, adds the grinding machine.  This pretty much offers an alternative to straight farming.  You can pick up lots of white, green and blue weapons and combine them to get each level in turn.  I got like four legendaries in a row this way, believe it or not.  In fact, the game was INCREDIBLY STINGY for almost the entire first difficulty level and then suddenly around level 24, I got like 6 in one session.   I've since found another half dozen in TVHM.  But once again, leveling becomes an issue.  The grinder will make new items from leveled lower items, but there is no way I know of to level your existing weapons (shame once again).  I typically play straight for the first two difficulties and then save frustration by simply using an editor to level the ones I like every five levels or so.  This saves me hundreds of hours of mind-numbing farming and grinding.  I want to have fun, not go insane.   You could find legendaries regularly against The Warrior in BL2 and it's an EASY boss even on Ultimate (I could take him down single handedly with the right weapon in less than 15 seconds in TVHM and about 1 minute in Ultimate without overpowered weapons).  That's fast, but not much fun.  I'd rather be playing Tiny Tina DLC or something amusing.  That brings me to the #1 complaint I have about The Pre-Sequel.  The lack of raid bosses and DLC content in general.  With all the DLC for BL2, you had a nice choice of places to go with friends and take down a really hard one.  Here you have ONE and it's pretty much the same regular end-boss, only a bit harder and I do mean a BIT (i.e. not that hard, but it does take longer than the Warrior which is a pushover and SOOO disappointing after the game making him out to be a bad dude, but then the Warrior is an end-boss, not a raid boss despite people treating him like it.   Claptastic Voyagae came out not too long ago and its end boss is almost downright infuriating in solo play, but it's doable.  THEN there's all these weird ""kind of sorta"" boss matches you can set up with some controls.  Some of those are pretty intense, but I've found it hard to find people at this time to play it with since many people gave up on this game and never bought that DLC (I gather the first DLC sucked and I've never bothered with it from the reviews).  Even so, Claptastic Voyage is highly amusing but it's nowhere near as funny as Tina Tina, but then I used to play a lot of D&D so it was extra funny for me.  Overall, the biggest problems with this game are not the levels or the re-used legendaries.  Yes, it would be nice to have more variance, but ultimately, people tend to settle on their favorite gun and strategy after awhile, anyway.  The biggest problem is that BL2 was enormous with all the DLCs added (and with regular sales, you could get it ALL for under $15 for over a year now).  Here, it seems that Claptastic Voyage is likely the last DLC and so the biggest problem is less replayability as you run out of quests faster (and I don't mean those boring side quests that aren't as good in BL2 as some make them out to be).   Even so I find myself missing Athena in BL2 for her skills and the high gravity jumps and thrusts and butt slamming.  So clearly the game does have its more fun points, even so.  I think for a lower price, it's a nice addition and if there were some more DLCs like Claptastic Voyage, it could be awesome.This game was made in Australia and I find that it's hard to laugh when you don't get the reference.  I need sub-titles on there just to see what they're saying half the time.  I love doing an Australian accent to team mates during the game, but I say things that are funny to non-Australians and emphasize things differently (e.g. when the Kraks attack, I'll say something from an old movie I saw like, ""Oh no, not another ruddy dingo!"" and people I've played with have told me that single line was funnier than anything the encountered in the entire game.  In other words, they play straight Aussie humor and you have to be Aussie to really enjoy it.  I caricature the funnier things (to me) I've heard from any given film, etc. and non-Aussies ""get"" that better since they've likely seen/heard those references in films, etc.  Thus, I think this is why many don't find the humor as funny outside of Australia.  They don't have the background for it and have never heard those ""jokes"".			"

												Having completed Borderlands 1&2 including DLC- investing both wallet and time into the universe of Pandora i was ready and waiting for the next BIG thing in the series. Hearing of the Pre-sequel i hastily preordered awaiting release hoping to be the first in a new era of borderlands, Boy does this game fall short. Filled with Aussie accents, poor character development and the added playable clap trap gimmick. This game adds nothing fresh to the already vibrant and rich experience of BL2. This story takes place on the moon acting as a back story to why Jack became 'Evil' as you play as one of the members of his task force helping him to.... i actually forgot ! Heck the plotline is forgetable, all i can say is the ending teases the idea that BL3 will bring back aliens and that will be the premise for the team to fight on a much bigger scale. This game is nothing more than a high priced standalone DLC. Hopefully this is the last we seen of 2K Australia. On a random note, any die-hard Borderlands fan should not acknowledge this as a triumph-its an actual travesty although if you love the series your probably gonna buy it anyway, the added laser rifles are redeemable and the oz suits can add a certain flow to the gameplay, giving the player the aspect that they are feeding off the environment. 2K Australia has still managed to capture the beauty in the series but has failed to create dynamic and memorable range of characters. I hope the predecessor will bring forth an original experience to both this and the last, as its safe to say palette has run dry.			"

												This game was surprisingly great. Was it on the level of Borderlands 2? no, but it was actually a really great great game. I would highly recommend it if you are a fan of the series. I would have missed out on a great extension of the series. It was fun to see the same characters and delve into some of the background - a must have for fans of the series.Controllers are as you expect, the machines actually give you great gear like the first did (and the 2nd had failed to do). Gameplay was seamless like I had just picked up from Borderlands 2. There was no reason to complain other than ... I didn't like almost ALMOST feeling bad for Handsome Jack! Oh, the one thing that was a pain in the rear was running out of Oxygen, unless you play the Robot. But you eventually do get used to it. The jumping and fighting in low-gravity almost made up for the pain in the♥♥♥♥♥of running out of air. Grab the Baroness if you were a fan of the Sirens, you won't be dissapointed. I miss my midget!

I mean who doesnt want to play as a freaken copy of handsome jack. The thing about bl:ps is its a bit random if u ask me. The bosses appearing when dats the last thing u expect so it seems as if the game was a bit rushed. The moral is Borderlands the pre sequel is a good game overall but not worth $60. And i forgot to mention, corrosive weapons are near to useless in the pre sequel since there are not many armored enemies so i think there should be a dlc containing mostly armored enemies. that will make corrosive abit less usless			"

												Maybe I was expecting too much.  As a huge Borderlands 2 fan, it is unfortunate that the Pre-Sequel does not have the same magic as 2.  This game is fun but needs some serious rescuing from the DLC.  Giving all the characters Australian accents was not a good idea in my opinion.  I just have to assume that the people who live on the moon are from Australia and the people who live on Pandora are not.  The story is tedious and the upgrading feels more like grinding.  2K, you are losing an opportunity to build this franchise into one of the greatest ever by making a money grab with this latest installment.  I am only recommending this because there is no option other than yes or no.  It is a good game, but don't expect the Borderlands 2 experience here.			"

The DLC's are way too overpriced for what you get, the Claptrap DLC is good but still too much. As for the DLC characters, may as well take out a mortgage.If you're a fan of the Borderlands series then you'll want to pick this up.If you're new to the series then I suggest starting with the first game or BL2, that would be more bang for your bucks.

IT'S A GOD DAMN RE-SKIN OF BORDERLANDS 2! There I said it. If you like Borderlands 2 then buy this game, just not for $60 USD. It's worth $30 USD max. The story is pretty much the same, the characters are pretty much the same. Think about this, in Borderland 2 there was Axton wo could throw down 1 turret on the ground to be BFF's with. Now with Wilhelm you can get TWO flying turrets. For $60 USD. I recommend this game on the condition that the price goes down. Way down.			"

After playing BL2 I came to expect many more varieties so I got tired of killing the same enimies over and over again.  Claptrap was pretty fun to play as.

												I don't see what's the big deal about this feeling like a big DLC,because the Legend of Zelda: Majoras Mask felt like DLC to Ocarina of Time,and no one gives 2♥♥♥♥♥♥s about that.It's still a good game. Just not as good as it's predacessor, but some people think it is.Just like this game.			"

												Overall a great game. It has a feel of Borderlands 2 with a mod aspect that is very hyper-realistic. Haven't invested many hours into yet, but so far I can see it being well worth the purchase.By the looks of things, I should be spending <$0.20 an hour after all is said and done.Great game.Detailed*""The game has you run back and forth constantly on missions, by the time you play it a couple times it becomes monotonous."" I spend most evening playing this when I decide to check out DLC for it, but lack further interest afterwards. Worth a play through if you find it on sale, doesn't encompass the extent of BL2's nicely constructed world/story/AI.			"

												8/10If you're a die hard Borderlands fan like myself, I highly reccommend this game. It ties up a lot of loose ends that were left between Borderlands and Borderlands 2. Even though the game uses the same engine as BL2, I do feel like I'm playing a new game. Especially with new features such as the O2 and low gravity.For Fans: Buy the game! It's a lot of fun and I've thouroughly enjoyed it. Definitely beat the game and start TVHM, they've added some nice story features.For New Comers: Buy Borderlands 2. More bang for your buck, and it's just a great game. (BL:PS is full of Borderlands 2 spoilers anyways)Overall I enjoyed it. But I'm still trying to find buddies who haven't played BL2 with to play through again. I beat BL:TPS and I'm on TVHM but I just don't have the urge to play. I beat normal and TVHM with three different characters on BL2. I don't have that same drive with BL:TPS			"

												Only buy if you are a diehard fan of the series and have friends to play it with. For me playing this game has been a drag. Gameplay and mechanics are the same as BL2 and that doesn't bother me - BL2 gameplay was solid enough that it carries well into this game. But the pace, game length, loot system, and in general what was promised to us just didn't deliver. The Pre-Sequel has moved far and away from the space-western that was the first game and just feels smaller than the previous two games. BL2 was 25~ chapters compared to the Pre-Sequel of 17~. The majority of sidemissions are some variety of fetch quests. The new moon cast is largely fogetable, and there is the 'apperance' of Marcus (what, you couldn't come up with an alternate moon arms dealer?). The attempt to spice up the combat in the Pre-Sequel was done lazily - adding more bandits and monsters to fight doesn't change that the AI is terrible and predictable (the flow of combat came to the point where I could predict which cover the enemy would lock into and which side they would pop out of). Character dialogue is increased but its not streets ahead of BL2. An unimaginative end game raid boss. The list goes on. But my main gripe now comes with the latest DLC, Lady Hammerlock. Bear in mind its not her as a character I object to, its the fact that the 3rd DLC is another character class. Track time, the first 3 DLC for each game: BL1: Docter Ned's Zombie Island (expansion), Secret Armory of General Knoxx (expansion) Miss Moxxi's Arena (arena)BL2: Mechromancer (character) Captain Scarlett and the pirates booty (expansion) Mr. Torgues Campaign of Carnage (expansion)BL TPS: Handsome Jack (character) holodome Onsalught (arena) Lady Hammerlock (character)Three DLC's in and the game hasn't gotten bigger, just the cast of characters. The only thing I can guess that the Pre-Sequel did right is make the loot system not force you to keep swapping new guns every single level, allowing you to enjoy a gun for a handful of levels at least. It just feels as if the Pre-Sequel was handed off to a less capable team - sure they tried their best but their best wasn't good enough.  "

												I gave it a shot and wasn't all that impressed with it. If there were better DLC's and a more of a storyline other than watching the downward spiral of a character who was from the start, a jerk (I'm being kind here) I would have enjoyed it more.  I was excited for this game at first. After two full playthroughs and testing some of the other new characters out, I had this feeling inside that wanted something bigger for all the hype I had read about. Pros:I did like the new laser weapons and the butt-slam ability, it was different. I often found myself trying to butt-slam in BL1 and BL2 and facepalming later. The playable characters were a bit of a surprise. Most of my playtime was with Athena however. Cons: Austrailian humor? Yeah sorry folks, a lot of the stereo-typed voice acting/jokes were a total turn off.Didn't really need a backstory to a character that I didn't particulary care for to begin with in BL2.So it's totally okay for one character to just completely forget about part of their past in one game..then in this one they are demonized terribly and everyone seems to hate them now? Huge failure on the writing team. Good job making your storyline sound like it came from a bad fanfiction site. Bottom line: I wanted to enjoy this game, I really did, I've recently un-installed and tried to forget about it. If there is going to be a BL3..I'm going to be wary of it after this fustercluck. I've seen too many other reviewers saying they are jumping ship on the BL fandom. They need to bring back the writing styles of the BL1 team and get rid of that Burch guy! He's a t-w-a-t. If you're still wanting to pick up this game, wait until there is better content and when it's on sale for like $25 or so, as it stands right now, it really is not a 60 dollar game, way too short, poor content and it left an ache in my already dark husk of a heart.

												I am making a positive review for the game but keep in mind the price does not represent the game in this review, as you should try to pick it up on sales. The Pre-Sequel runs the same as Borderlands 2 but with different characters, some new weapons, and well... you're in space. I love this game but I agree with most reviews that there are quite a bit of problems with the game such as the lack of the iconic boss grinding for legendary loot that we all love in Borderlands as a franchise. It does have its own plusses though as it stays true to the series in its humor and its gameplay. If you were looking at buying this game as your first Borderlands though or have not gotten Borderlands 2- turn around and buy BL2. It is better than the Pre-Sequel and has a lot more worthwhile side quests to do.			"

I mean who doesnt want to play as a freaken copy of handsome jack. The thing about bl:ps is its a bit random if u ask me. The bosses appearing when dats the last thing u expect so it seems as if the game was a bit rushed. The moral is Borderlands the pre sequel is a good game overall but not worth $60. And i forgot to mention, corrosive weapons are near to useless in the pre sequel since there are not many armored enemies so i think there should be a dlc containing mostly armored enemies. that will make corrosive abit less usless			"

												Not sure what to say. Borderlands games are always great way to pass time, but this one seems kind of black sheep. The game itself is really short compared to others. Music seem to repeat itself and fade away in certain places, while the adventuring gets kind of dull in time to time. Of course, its going to be whole other game when played in co-op. Cool new features include lasers, jumping around in vacuum and suffocating. And of course you have the feeling of living down under. But for some reason it requires a lot more from your hardware, while looking ""same"" as the previous game. Needless to say im an Ati user... All in all, its a pretty great game, although im not quite sure is it really worth the money? Not to mention the dlc about to come.			"

The game is too easy, don't even bother using the cheats.   If you do then a five year old could play the game.    Final answer, thumbs up just because I love Borderlands.

												So, after playing absolutely tons of Borderlands 2, I was hopeful this was going to equal or exceed it - unfortunately, it did neither, falling far short of both. The humour seemed a little off and I never laughed out loud once. The missions also seemed to keep taking me back to the same area time and time again - at one point you go through a level, to get to another level, to complete an optional mission and then come all the way back again, only to get given another mission for the same place. Poor design? Maybe. Overall though, my biggest gripe with the game is what it has done to a couple of the well established goodly characters who at one point stand by and watch four peeps get murdered with barely a moan. A little consideration of canon and those same characters could have simply left the room first. But hey, it's Borderlands and does some stuff right. Lasers are cool, but roll on Borderlands 3. This one just feels like a wonky wheel. It gets you there but it isn't as fun a ride.			"

I finished the game on true vaulthunter on 3 characters so far and havent lost interest yet but I have noticed what seems to be a lack of easter eggs and pearlescent weapons which is a bummer because those were my personal favorite parts of the game. After I maxed out my characters I felt like I had nothing much to grind for but that could just be my playstyle.Pros:-Same old borderlands we love, new story that fills a lot of gaps from BL->BL2, new and old guns, great boss battlesCons:-Lack of end game content(?), pricey but destined to go on sale, Not as many baddies as in older games, feels more like a grind with what seems to be so few baddies, some characters in the story seem forced in and have no real role of importance but thats nbd.Overall If you love borderlands you'll love this game.

This game Does reuse BL2, but that's because this is a part of BL2's timeline!It's about how things were before BL2 came out and how they became how they are now. It tells the story of athena (from General Knoxx) and Handsome jack among others. That being said, this game is overpriced. i Recommend this game to any borderlands fan, but DO NOT buy this game unless it's on 40% + or if you dont care about your money.			"

												This might be hard to believe, but this man is the leader of a group of lizards from the hyper elite. I know this first hand. I took care of this being as the mentor, as I am a hyper elite of the syntax-sector of the Illuminati. I have experimented with teleportation, Obama, and lizards shape-shifting into Secret-service agents. When the syntax-sector of the hyper elite barracks in the north pole, most experiments broke loose. This prototype, however, was smarter than most. With little to no signs of lizard-like structures when shape-shifted, he was the perfect man for our job. I once used my transformation powers, but was quickly spotted, and the extra-molecular shape-shifting superdinosaur came and saved me, with the hyperbeam harvested from Dialga in the Pokemon dimension. Yes, that show is real, made by the Ancient Gods from Sector-B//AnimationDimension//X-3, we transported the creatures into the ""intelligent"" planet called Earth, in my opinion, the weakest sector of the whole Illuminati. If you want more information about these creatures first hand, contact me via Google+ or teleportating to the hyperdimension in Class-A.			"

												Is it as good as Borderlands 2? Perhaps not, but is it over the top bat #&@ crazy and fun as riding a druged up deathclaw with 20 jet packs up it's bum? You bet you're sweet Claptraps it is! Gameplay- Much like Borderlands 2, EXCEPT ZERO G! Also boost pads can launch you miles accros the battlefield and lazers are very fun! One gameplay mechanic I feel is worth mentioning is Claptrap's ability, he can use any power used by a previous Vault Hunter, so he can use ANY ABILITY EVER MADE! And it's not random, it scans the situation and pick an ability that will be helpfull. So you never get screwed over. Story- Pretty good story if I do say so myself, tons of interesing side quests and bosses. Characters- All of the characters are very lovable, espicially good ol Handsome Jack!I reccomend getting this game on sale. It's fun but slightly shorter than Borderlands 2.			"

												I will give this game a thumbs up for the Borderlands humor we have all come to love, the co-op, Jack's story, and new characters.   But I give it a thumbs down because the game was just too short compared to the past Borderlands games, there are hundreds of glitches that still have yet to be fixed, and when you play in co-op mode, prepare to get your♥♥♥♥♥♥kicked by your partner because half the characters are OP and the other half are so-so.    The game is too easy, don't even bother using the cheats.   If you do then a five year old could play the game.    Final answer, thumbs up just because I love Borderlands.   But if you are not a die hard fan, don't waste your money.			"

												After 2 playthroughs as Athena and now playing as Nisha, with 50+ hours in the game I'm finally ready to give the Pre-Sequel a positive review. I'm a huge Borderlands fan; BL 1 - Finished the GOTY edition multiple times on PC, PS3 & XBox, BL2 - 300+ hours spent mainly as Maya having purchased every conceivable peice of DLC available (yes even the headhunter packs). Therefore I had high expectations of the third entry in the franchise.Upon first viewing it really does present as a re-skin of BL2, or as many have suggested, simply a substantial add on pack. The difference between BL2 and Pre-Sequel were nothing compared to the leap we saw in from first game to it's arguably superior sequel. As you progress through the campaign however, the apparent minor changes actually serve to present quite a different style of game. The low gravity combat and slower player movement is a huge change that drastically alters the pace of the gameplay, at least it feels like it does to players familiar with BL2 speed. Combine this with the unecessary O2 game mechanic and the initial impression is that 2K Australia took a wrong turn. However, after persisting with this change I found it simply meant that I had to approach the game from a different angle and as soon as I stopped trying to play in the style of BL2 or even BL 1, I began to have a lot more fun. This is quite a different beast and the comments that it's too similar to the previous game are actually incorrect. It's vastly different in gameplay. The space setting on Elpis is a big change from the deserts of Pandora. The Australian accents play a big part in making this feel like a completely seperate environment. The new weapon and elemental types are a welcome addition that most people cited as a positive. The story, while not quite as engaging as BL2 is still interesting especially for people who've been invested in the universe from the beginning. The playable characters and their respective skills are arguably the most interesting and varied we've seen in the series and for the first time I feel a desire to try them all out. Overall, this is different than expected though utlimatley another satisfying entry to the franchise.			"

												Although I used to adore this series, I've recently become somewhat disenchanted with it. I'm finding all of the combat a bit ""samey"" and the level design all too predictable. The humour is still great, don't get me wrong. I've spent more than my fair share of time roaming Pandora in Borderlands 2, and the commentary given still earns a chuckle out of me from time to time.I think the biggest issue I have with the series is the first game. Not because it was bad, but because it was good. It was original. It was new, fun, exciting. I dare say there was nothing quite like it on the market when it came out. Borderlands 2 fixed some of the very infrequent issues with the first title, such as melee being obsolete past a certain level threshold. Borderlands 2 was still a great game, and I'll always look back fondly.When the Pre-Sequel was announced, a friend and I went nuts fangirling over it. We screamed about moon physics and CL4-TP being a playable character for hours on end. I, of course, pre-ordered it. I was so excited for its release, just around the two month bend.And when it came out, and I started playing it, it felt familiar. Too familiar. It felt identical to Borderlands 2. I tried to push that thought away and enjoy myself but there was the constant nag in the back of my head. The very same nag of Saint's Row IV. Whilst I played at least a hundred hours of the first Borderlands, and an ungodly amount more of the second, this installment left me feeling like I was at a Skag-steak dinner, and I'd over eaten with my numerous servings of Borderlands, and I didn't want anymore, but it would be impolite to my host if I didn't finish what sat on my oversized plate.I feel like I'm betraying myself, but here I am, not recommending this game.

												Unlike the previous Borderlands titles, this game's side quests suck. It's still a fun game, but don't do sidequests unless they are given by characters that are part of the main questlines, since those are the only ones that seem to have effort put into them.All and all this game is amazing, I highly recomend doing some ini tweaks if your PC can handle it and the game looks absolutely amazing when you turn off the cell shading.

												Not sure what to say. Borderlands games are always great way to pass time, but this one seems kind of black sheep. The game itself is really short compared to others. Music seem to repeat itself and fade away in certain places, while the adventuring gets kind of dull in time to time. Of course, its going to be whole other game when played in co-op. Cool new features include lasers, jumping around in vacuum and suffocating. And of course you have the feeling of living down under. But for some reason it requires a lot more from your hardware, while looking ""same"" as the previous game. Needless to say im an Ati user... All in all, its a pretty great game, although im not quite sure is it really worth the money? Not to mention the dlc about to come.			"

												Overall: 6.6/10In its current state, I'd reccomend you buy Borderlands 2 instead. The game is nearly identical to the previous (Same guns, same mechanics with a few minor new ones added on (O2 for example)), but it just doesn't have the amount of content to justify its price tag. The game is a fair bit shorter than BL2, and the DLC is nowhere near the quality of the previous game. There will supposedly be a 5+ GB story DLC being added fairly soon, but I am not sure that will convince me to reccomend this. In the first 30 minutes of Borderlands 2, I was hooked on the game, but for The Presequel, it just wasn't the same.Also, if you don't like or understand Austrailian humor, a lot of things in the game will go over your head. 2K Austrailia poured a lot of it into this game, and a lot of the voice actors have Austrailian accents. I had no problem with this (even though a few jokes went over my head), but if you have an irrational hate for Austrailians, you might want to pass on this.			"

												This game, without DLC's, has about 100 hours worth of gameplay before you seriously feel like you are repeating the game over and over (which is indeed what you do). I would say: Worth it for the 100 hours of fun. Just be aware that some challenges are one-time only, and some bosses only spawn 1 time, so if you wanna farm their legendaries, Alt+F4 and Google are your friends.			"

												I gave it a shot and wasn't all that impressed with it. If there were better DLC's and a more of a storyline other than watching the downward spiral of a character who was from the start, a jerk (I'm being kind here) I would have enjoyed it more.  I was excited for this game at first. After two full playthroughs and testing some of the other new characters out, I had this feeling inside that wanted something bigger for all the hype I had read about. Pros:I did like the new laser weapons and the butt-slam ability, it was different. I often found myself trying to butt-slam in BL1 and BL2 and facepalming later. The playable characters were a bit of a surprise. Most of my playtime was with Athena however. Cons: Austrailian humor? Yeah sorry folks, a lot of the stereo-typed voice acting/jokes were a total turn off.Didn't really need a backstory to a character that I didn't particulary care for to begin with in BL2.So it's totally okay for one character to just completely forget about part of their past in one game..then in this one they are demonized terribly and everyone seems to hate them now? Huge failure on the writing team. Good job making your storyline sound like it came from a bad fanfiction site. Bottom line: I wanted to enjoy this game, I really did, I've recently un-installed and tried to forget about it. If there is going to be a BL3..I'm going to be wary of it after this fustercluck. I've seen too many other reviewers saying they are jumping ship on the BL fandom. They need to bring back the writing styles of the BL1 team and get rid of that Burch guy! He's a t-w-a-t. If you're still wanting to pick up this game, wait until there is better content and when it's on sale for like $25 or so, as it stands right now, it really is not a 60 dollar game, way too short, poor content and it left an ache in my already dark husk of a heart.

												It was very fun to play, and the new characters and weapon are amazing. It just felt relly short though. I've been playing it for about 18 hours, and I've done the main story and all the side quests I can find. Also, alot of the weapons are rehashes of weapons from borderlands 2. I think theres possibly about 3 new weapons in the game (other than the new eapon class of Lasers).I think it would have been better if it was DLC for Borderlands 2. It just didnt feel like it had alot of substance for it to be counted as a game in its own right.			"

The gravity would be cool in certain situations and perhaps a mechanic in certain fights or arena type things. But the game just doesn't have the Story or depth of BL or BL2. I wasn't expecting a BL3 but this falls short of everything I think of as a BL game. I still enjoyed it but I wouldn't buy it full price. I got it in the humble bundle thankfully for cheap.			"

												Honestly, Borderlands 2 was probably in my top 5 fav games of all time, I've put more hours into it then any other Steam game, it was probably the best fps I ever played, and Borderlands The Pre-Sequel wasn't that much of a disappointment. Most people really liked the game, and some others thought it wasn't that great. Imp, Pre-Sequel is NOTHING compared to Borderlands 2. But if you really enjoyed the 2nd game, definitely give Pre-Sequel a try cause it is a really good game, I just kinda wish they brought back more of the characters, but I can kinda understand why.

Where to start...I'll go through my pro's: Fart blasting people Cryo weapons were amazing The game is more fun with a pack of friends than solo Grenades, Torgue, the usual Playing Claptrap was actually hilariousI love the Borderlands series... wholeheartedly adore it. Mordecai was my favourite hero in the existence of RPGs. Then came Borderlands 2, where I fell in love with the Mechromancer and Axton. Now, I pre-ordered this game with the same kind of childhood glee you'd have seen back when Pokemon first came to Gameboy. I started off as Wilhelm, I enjoyed it, I also played around with some Claptrap . I found the stereotypical Bogan voices quite grating, but that's probably because I'm Australian and deal with enough Derro people day-day. I made it through the whole playthrough, and tried to rerun it, but found I couldn't physically bring myself to completing another playthrough. It may have been the quests, it may have been the zones, it may have been the bosses, or it may have simply been the terrible scripting (some of the jokes were great, but nothing like the hilariousness that came from BL1/2).I found it pretty evident that the game itself wasn't really made for the community that so enjoyed the first two titles, but more for a bone thrown to the Australian devs in 2k. I'll finish by stating this the game is great for a time, but it's hard to get the motivation to play through each of the heroes you may be interested in without having your ears bleed. "

												What's more to say that has not already been said?I guess I'll talk about the Season Pass, which feels like a waste. You play the game, you beat the game, you get items, and....I don't know, I feel that BL2 had more reasons to keep you coming back for more. This game? Not so much. DLC for this game comes far and few in-between...I have a feeling BL3 will be out before they add anything interesting to this game.For what feels like DLC, the game is not bad, but in my honest opinion, it's not worth $60. I'll also add that this game has put a sour taste in my mouth when it comes to season passes. For most games, season passes are not worth it; they're a complete ripoff.UPDATE 27JULY2016Wow...I still can't believe the price tag for the game + DLC (ahahahaha) is still $60+ after 2+ years...last addition of DLC content was 2014? Yeah, congrats on wasting your money if you bought the season pass...			"

												I personally found this game more enjoyable then Borderlands 2, and I put several hundred hours into that verison. While I feel that the replay value on this is a lot less, it's still too early to tell with the DLC coming if it will be more enjoyable. But in my opinion I feel as if the new features add a to the series and leave me with great hope IF a Borderlands 3 shows up! I thought the ice element was a great touch, and adds new level of combat with freezing and using explosive weapons to shatter. I personally am glad that the Eridian weapons are gone, because they were always the best and without then it adds the balance of weapons back from Borderlands 1. The Oxygen feature can be troublesome at first, but later on in the game you will find it doesn't play that much of a factor, and you can get some nice stat boost from the O2 kits themselves. Overall, if you are on the fence about getting the game I feel that I got my moneys worth, but I will add back to this with further assessments from the DLC to see how it changes things.			"

												This game is a 10/10. It has all the important things that a game needs, CooP, Story, side missions. You go around with friends or alone shooting killing and laughing. This is a game for everyone, Its funny and still has the action games need. Mayby your thinking nah it cartoonish i dont like this but thats what makes the game special. So much to try, so many weapons to use, so many laughs everytime you play it. Jumping around with low-gravity and exploring the beatiful landscapes of this game. Choose from 4-different characters. You can play as Athena (My favorite), Nisha,WIllhelm and the beloved Clap-Trap. Each character comes wtih i special abillity so its not just about the looks its about the style you play. Aggressive, defensive or however you want. Fighting bosses for example, going aggresive and and running and gunning or taking it slow behind a bow with a sniper rifle, its your choice. Hope this rewiew helped and :3			"

												I will give this game a thumbs up for the Borderlands humor we have all come to love, the co-op, Jack's story, and new characters.   But I give it a thumbs down because the game was just too short compared to the past Borderlands games, there are hundreds of glitches that still have yet to be fixed, and when you play in co-op mode, prepare to get your♥♥♥♥♥♥kicked by your partner because half the characters are OP and the other half are so-so.    The game is too easy, don't even bother using the cheats.   If you do then a five year old could play the game.    Final answer, thumbs up just because I love Borderlands.   But if you are not a die hard fan, don't waste your money.			"

												When it first came out it was nearly $70. I got it during the steam summer sales, when it was $19.99. As much as I love the game, I honestly don't think it is worth as much as they put it out the first time. It's now down to $39.99, which is good, but that's still too much I think. It's just not enough game time for it to be that much. Honestly it didn't even take me 24hrs of gameplay to beat the game (including side quests.)  But if you're looking for a BL game to keep you busy until BL3 finally comes out, I for sure recommend this one! Though I would wait until it's on sale again for sups cheap. Also if you're a person who likes co-op's then this is perfect, but if you hate co-oping, I wouldn't recommend this, because this game pretty much makes you co-op.Overall: 7/10			"

												I have to say that compared to Borderlands2 ,this game sucks.It barely have anything of its own.Its like playing Borderlands2 all over again in space but with less things to do.The whole game is so pale.Mostly you just go to one place,kill bunch of people(or animals),and then all over again.The only thing rememberable is Felicity.Her life is so tragic that she could be a character in a Shakespeare play.And the humor is not so good as the first two. So my suggestion is if you didnt paly any borderlands before,you could have a try.But if you've palyed Borderlands2,you'd better stay away from the presequel cause it only gives you a whole lot worse gameplay experience.(ohh,forgot to mention    Claptrap may be the reason for you to buy it......which I did)			"

												Really addictive game.Having played the first two games on console, I can't say this is the game I enjoyed most. But it is still tons of fun.Pros-collecting 10000000000+ different weapons (slightly exaggerated)-fun multiplayer mode-fun dialogues-it is a sand box that isn't empty-a lot of side missions to do-personally I think all the achievements are achievable and relatively easy(??)-jump pack. Yeah! everyone's favouritebut when you think about it...cons(as in the previous games)-weapons aren't 'unique' which means you constantly have to get rid of your old weapons for new ones because the dmg that a weapon causes depends on the level of your character when you pick it up, so any guns you collected before lvl70 will need to be thrown away somehow-grinder, yes grinder, where you combine three guns or shield or whatever together to forge a new thing. Totally depending on luck.-multiplayer seems to be a race of who's gonna grap the better guns first-did I mention a thing called the shift code? You can find a lot of it online- basically it allows you to open a chest and grap a better item, so what's the point of collecting weapons from enemies? (given that you haven't reached the highest level)In conclusion, it is definitely worth trying if you have plenty of time to spare.			"

												It's fun, but it's not Borderlands 2. Don't expect this to be as good as Borderlands 2...It's a good game, just not a great game. I guess one of its main flaws is that its predecessor was a masterpiece.The story is pretty bad for almost the entire game, but the ending makes up for it tho.The level design is bad... like pretty bad... you might get pretty mad sometimes.Vehicles are still buggy. Terrible and unimportant bosses in the game, with the exclusion of the last boss fight(s). Loot is pretty bad, but they made a new system: you get a GRINDER in which you combine 3 weapons (of the same quality) to get a better weapon.The classes are very fun, it really feels like they invested a lot of time in developing their action skills and talents.I'm afraid the characters don't have as much personality as the main characters did in the previous games.I played the first Borderlands game for about 150 hours (PS3+PC), Borderlands 2 for about 260 hours (PC), I like this game series a lot, but I was as bit disappointed by BL:TPS.7.0 - Play it if you enjoy the Borderlands universe and story. It could've been better, feels like they rushed the production...			"

												If you like Borderlands 2, This game is for you.It has some improvement since Borderlands 2, that is, there is no slag.In previous game, Slag was a elemental effect.When enemy is under the effect of slag, the damage to that slagged enemy is increased.It was powerful, that was the problem. Under the presence of powerful slag, game was balanced for that.The result, enemy's HP is so high which makes using slag almost mandatory.Slag was powerful, but using the slag wasn't that fun.You equip a weak damage but slag weapon just for slagging enemies,then switch to high damage weapons to finish it off.Borderlands has only 4 weapon shortcut slot, and switching weapons takes some times makes using slag stressful. Since there is no slag in TPS, enemy's health is lower than B2.The only things I don't like in TPS are just 4 weapon slots and switching weapons takes times. "

I really enjoyed the story and the gameplay is fluent and fun.

												This game, unfortunately, is markedly inferior to Borderlands 1 and 2.  Despite using pretty much the same game engine and recycling much of the assets from Borderlands 2, the design of the enemies and levels just aren't at the same level of quality.  The combat rarely rewards careful tactics, instead often degenerating into disorderly brawls - not that this didn't exist in Borderlands 2, but in that game it was usually your choice how to engage the enemies.  Frequently, enemies don't spawn until you're in the middle of a room, then they spawn all around you, and the cover would be ineffective.  Maps are often confusing and lacking in distinctive landmarks.  Boss fights often take place in arenas that are awkward to maneouver or just entirely devoid of cover, again rapidly degenerating into clumsy brawls.  The story is irritating - you work for Handsome Jack, and he's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ - but that is more or less constrained by the story laid down in Borderland 1 and 2.  The humour is, well, Australian.  If you like it, you like it.  If you don't, it'll annoy you.  The one redeeming quality is the final boss fight, which is the only part of the game that, for me, felt like the quality I expect from a Borderlands game - the one part of the game that received the care and polish deserving of the Borderlands franchise.  Basically, what I'm trying to say is, go play Borderlands 2 instead.			"

												Overall a really great game, especially since it was meant as filler to satisfy fans until Borderlands 3.The new mechanics in this game are done very smoothly, low gravity in general is just super fun. Cryo weapons have become a favourite of mine as well, and just feels satisfying. It really feels like the developers just had a lot of fun making that, which transfers so well into how fun the game itself is. The playable characters actually have dialogue with the NPC's now, which made the experience a whooooole lot better.Unfortunately though, this game is EXTREMELY buggy. Some of the bugs are hilarious, but many are just frustrating. For example, when you get slowed due to an enemy cryo weapon or something in the environment, there is a chance you will stay slowed until you quit to the main menu. I've also experienced several issues with the Fight For Your Life system, which makes playing on your own a serious pain.I still reccommend this game, even with all the bugs theres just so much fun to be had.

												Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, on a first time completion, is near brilliant in my terms.The comedy may be lacking compared to the other games, and it may be too heavily pushing the Australian accent thing.But in all honesty, I thoroughly enjoyed the game.The one thing that makes this game brilliant, is that it's a connector. A game in which many questions are answered, a game in which makes you think and look at the other games and go ""Wait, is that guy from this game? Did this lead to that? Oh, that's why that happened."" And so forth.And the lasers, oh my sweet jesus. I freaking love lasers.My overall opinion would give it an 8/10 for it's storyline and how it incorporates itself into the series.			"

I really love Borderlands and it would be a shame on my side if I haven't bought this, also just love the character designs and actually I think it's even better that in Borderlands 2. Oh and my favourite thing is that characters that you play as actually comment on the actually gameplay and that's really the thing I really love and think the future games could also has becasue in Borderlands 2 there was next to none of that and it was a huge lack for me.

Loot is pretty bad, but they made a new system: you get a GRINDER in which you combine 3 weapons (of the same quality) to get a better weapon.The classes are very fun, it really feels like they invested a lot of time in developing their action skills and talents.I'm afraid the characters don't have as much personality as the main characters did in the previous games.I played the first Borderlands game for about 150 hours (PS3+PC), Borderlands 2 for about 260 hours (PC), I like this game series a lot, but I was as bit disappointed by BL:TPS.7.0 - Play it if you enjoy the Borderlands universe and story. It could've been better, feels like they rushed the production...			"

												The Pre Sequel is the game between borderlands one and two. It changes what the definition of a borderlands game can be. This game was over-priced in my opinion, but it was still a lot of fun. I loved the Claptastic Voyage, but the holodome played like it was just slopped together in a short amount of time. In the past, a borderlands DLC has had more success when not outsourced and made in-house. I really like the moon background and art design. The characters have a lot more mobility options than previous games. Sadly, to this day, lots of main bosses are not farmable. I do not find this very smart because in the past the games have thrived on the mechanic that you can farm for loot out of bosses. Between the characters and the feel of the game, I certainly recommend this game.			"

												Of course the game does not live up to Borderlands 2, but once you create such a game like that it is impossible to live up to the hype created by the predecessor. Admittably, the homey borderlands nostalgia does not strike as much as the second addition, the world feels a bit lacking, and a first playthrough left me feeling slightly offput. However after coming back to the game, i found myself quite happily playing through all over again.  To anyone who has played Borderlands 1 or 2, i strongly reccomend this game to you. Although it is a bit lacking in charisma, the gameplay is fabulous, and the enviroment is one of a kind.Pros:                                      Cons:-Gameplay is superb             -lacking in humor, and nostalgia-Wonderful enviornment      -Not enough content-Valuable storyline               -Bland NPC dialogue-Unique expirience               -Not much good DLC produced-polished features from bl2Regardless of whether it seems like a let down, it is an enjoyable playthrough.

												As a huge fan of Borderlands franchise, I can only say that if you're like me and you're really into borderlands that much just get this game becasue I don't specifically hate a single aspect in this game... maybe that's just my opinion but still! I really love Borderlands and it would be a shame on my side if I haven't bought this, also just love the character designs and actually I think it's even better that in Borderlands 2. Oh and my favourite thing is that characters that you play as actually comment on the actually gameplay and that's really the thing I really love and think the future games could also has becasue in Borderlands 2 there was next to none of that and it was a huge lack for me.

												Honestly, Borderlands 2 was probably in my top 5 fav games of all time, I've put more hours into it then any other Steam game, it was probably the best fps I ever played, and Borderlands The Pre-Sequel wasn't that much of a disappointment. Most people really liked the game, and some others thought it wasn't that great. Imp, Pre-Sequel is NOTHING compared to Borderlands 2. But if you really enjoyed the 2nd game, definitely give Pre-Sequel a try cause it is a really good game, I just kinda wish they brought back more of the characters, but I can kinda understand why. Rating: 8.5/10 (Note: I Haven't beat the game yet, so I may or may not update this review in the future lol.)			"

												I love this game but i feel like this is a inferior to Borderlands 2. Its a bit short and i have to admit the Oz Kits 'Butt Slams' is a Fun gimmick and attack. But the problem is the cost. In my country 74$. If u compare that to BL2 which is 20$ theres a big difference. Firstly, BL2'S game length is way longer then pre sequel and has more dlcs too. If the cost was lower, this game is going to be a hit. But for now, BL2 is the champ even though Pre-Sequel is really fun.			"

												This game, unfortunately, is markedly inferior to Borderlands 1 and 2.  Despite using pretty much the same game engine and recycling much of the assets from Borderlands 2, the design of the enemies and levels just aren't at the same level of quality.  The combat rarely rewards careful tactics, instead often degenerating into disorderly brawls - not that this didn't exist in Borderlands 2, but in that game it was usually your choice how to engage the enemies.  Frequently, enemies don't spawn until you're in the middle of a room, then they spawn all around you, and the cover would be ineffective.  Maps are often confusing and lacking in distinctive landmarks.  Boss fights often take place in arenas that are awkward to maneouver or just entirely devoid of cover, again rapidly degenerating into clumsy brawls.  The story is irritating - you work for Handsome Jack, and he's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ - but that is more or less constrained by the story laid down in Borderland 1 and 2.  The humour is, well, Australian.  If you like it, you like it.  If you don't, it'll annoy you.  The one redeeming quality is the final boss fight, which is the only part of the game that, for me, felt like the quality I expect from a Borderlands game - the one part of the game that received the care and polish deserving of the Borderlands franchise.  Basically, what I'm trying to say is, go play Borderlands 2 instead.			"

												I like Borderlands more as a franchise than this game in particular. The style and playstyle are fun and captivating. That being said, this is almost exactly the same game as borderlands 2. WHich if thats what you're looking for it is great, but if you are hoping for something different or changes to features you will be disappointed. The changes are minor yet clunky. The gravity thing is awkward and is not a part of the game when it would be most useful. Lasers replace slag weapons in a way, but still have unique elemental effects. I mainly got this because I lost borderlands 2 and didn't want to rebuy the same game so it works in that regard. I'm hoping the play style will flow better once my steam controller shows up and I can play it on my big ole TV			"

												When Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel first came out it has scored quite a number of negative reviews along with 7/10 on metacritic. Whereas BL2 is almost 9/10. I have picked it up a few month after the initial release at 55% discount for TPS + Season Pass edition... and after playing a few hours simply abandoned it for almost half a year. Why? I was bored out of my brains by the first two-three chapters. To be honest, this game should have been named 'Borderlands 2: The Pre Sequel', because yes it's a ♥♥♥♥ing DLC. A pretty good one though, but dlc nonetheless and playing it right after spending almost 200 hours in Borderlands 2 was too much.Yet now, six month later, I'm on my second playthrough. It's also worth mentioning that the pre-sequel feels slightly more difficult to play solo than the sequel. After all I'm pretty happy with it and highly recommend it to everyone who enjoyed other Borderlands games, but I'd suggest picking it up during a sale.			"

												I can reccomend this game with a lot of asterisks on the end and only to specific people. Also let me start out this review by saying that this game isn't worth 60$ +30$ for DLC, even if you really liked BL2 this game is not worth the full asking price and this reccomendation is based solely on the prospect that you buy this game on sale for 30$ or less.Lets start with the negatives here because for some people(roughly half of the people who saw my BL2 review) this is what they'll care about.The first is that Vehicle handling is TERRIBLE and in the game you'll be on them a lot. Jumps just plain don't work half the time and as best I can tell its random wether they sent you where you want to go or into an instant death pit. I cannot stress how terrible the vehicles are.This game is VERY CLEARLY an expansion pack thats been stretched out into a full game and it shows, my god does it show. The writing is there but so is the padding, fetch quests abound. If you're looking of a repeat of BL2's story, just no. NO.Some people may say Handsome Jack has been... comprimized and let down from his fantastic role in BL2.Most of the legendary guns in the game are brought over from BL2, again expansion pack stretched into a full game.Talent trees are more restricted than they were in BL2, more similar to the Mechromancer Anarchy skill tree in that there are more things that you HAVE to spec into to progress.Clap Trap is a playable character in the game, if you have a friend that doesn't like you rest assured they'll play him.Now let me get into the things I liked about this game:Somebody thought to balance the guns here, so reload times are better overall and assault rifles with minigun barrel attachments will actually get up to a decent firing rate before you have to reload them. In addition it feels like more guns are viable than they were in BL2 and if you ran around using whatever you pick up off the ground you won't find yourself getting your face mashed into the dirt.Vending machines scale to your level and can actually have decent loot in them once again. So money actually has a point in the game and if nothing interesting drops you can still pop in at a vending machine and pick up an interesting gun or two.The loot is better than in BL2 and I felt like I was picking up enough useful new guns to keep me looking for more, however the economy seems to revolve more around selling guns than picking up money so I would reccomend picking up backpack upgrades early.The lasers are cool and have a good amount of vareity to them: Beam, Railgun, Shotgun, Automatic and I think they add a lot of variety to the game and add more elemental weapons outside of just Maliwan and Torgue.The oxygen Mechanic feels well thought out and effects not only you but your enemies as well, combined with the low gravity jumps and butt stomping the movement in BLP is very satisfying and flows. You can also get an OZ kit that lets you jump around and fire more accurately while jumping around.I think Cryo damage adds to the game a lot more than Slag did to BL2. Slag just felt like a numerical bonus that you were punished for not using and Cryo just feels like its own thing. In addition if you freeze an enemy mid air with cryo they can drop to the ground and shatter.The special abilities in BLP feel... weak? however you can use them a lot more often than in BL2 and I feel like I'm getting more use out of them since they recharge so quickly.So overall I feel like BLP is an overpriced expansion pack for BL2 that improves on gameplay in a number of significant ways but may try your patience if you're here for more story by sending you around for too many fetch quests. So if you're in it for the loot Diablo style I'd wait for at least a 50% off sale and pick it up, if you're in it for the story I'd wait for at least 75%.			"

												Now, I have to make something clear. You really get the most out of this game if you have played Borderlands 1, General Knoxx DLC, Robot Uprising DLC and Borderlands 2 GOTY. In a way, this is a fan service game. It's filled with jokes and characters that you can really only understand if you are a fan of the series.I played this for  the story, and frankly, it's great. Even though the game takes place before Borderlands 2, it's told in a way that it still kinda extends the story forward. There are, of course a lot of fan favourite characters, as well as few new ones. The new ""replacement"" for Scooter, Janey Springs is probably the one you interact with the most and I have to say, she is one of the best written characters in the series. Overall, the writing is fantastic, funny and fits the universe perfectly.The gameplay, however, has a few problems. The zero g combat is fun, lasers are fun, oz-kits are fun. Actually, all the new additions are simply great. Even though the game is still basically an extension of Borderlands 2, it's fun and works very smoothly. There is this sort of flow, which makes the game feel weirdly serene. The problem is not really in the new additions, it's in the pacing.There is a lot of running around. Some of the side quests are quite boring and require you to use hours and hours just travelling back into places you've already been numerous times. Now, this is a problem only if you are a completionist like me, and you want to do every single quest in the right order. If you just care about the story and the gameplay, it's gonna be no problem, but I felt really frustrated in the final few hours, when the game spammed long♥♥♥♥♥side quests, when the story started to get intense.But that aside, I found Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel an enjoyable RPG Shooter that really expands the Borderlands IP well. The game gives a background and answers for a lot of questions from the first two games. A must have for a fan of the series. If you are new? You should play the previous games first.			"

												I think this is the best borderlands yet. the Oz kits are awsome, the actoin skills are better in this game than Bl2, (in my opinon,) the laser wepons are one of the best new things in the franchise. the only two problems are that there isn't really a endgame, where borderlands 2 had a great endgame with alot of raid bosses to farm. The last problem is that some unique enemies have legendary weapons in there loot pool only spawn once, for ex. the fatale is a legendary hyperion SMG, that can only be gotten once. But that really is not a problem with casual players who play one run of this game. Another new thing they added was a element named,""Cryo"". in this game, it replace's borderlands 2's,""Slag"" element. In my opinon, this a alot better than slag because cryo will freeze enemies in place, making them take more critical hit damage. That all the info I got. I give this a 10/10. the problems are few and far between. It would be nice they would add more Raid bosses thou.			"

												Overall a really great game, especially since it was meant as filler to satisfy fans until Borderlands 3.The new mechanics in this game are done very smoothly, low gravity in general is just super fun. Cryo weapons have become a favourite of mine as well, and just feels satisfying. It really feels like the developers just had a lot of fun making that, which transfers so well into how fun the game itself is. The playable characters actually have dialogue with the NPC's now, which made the experience a whooooole lot better.Unfortunately though, this game is EXTREMELY buggy. Some of the bugs are hilarious, but many are just frustrating. For example, when you get slowed due to an enemy cryo weapon or something in the environment, there is a chance you will stay slowed until you quit to the main menu. I've also experienced several issues with the Fight For Your Life system, which makes playing on your own a serious pain.I still reccommend this game, even with all the bugs theres just so much fun to be had.

												Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, on a first time completion, is near brilliant in my terms.The comedy may be lacking compared to the other games, and it may be too heavily pushing the Australian accent thing.But in all honesty, I thoroughly enjoyed the game.The one thing that makes this game brilliant, is that it's a connector. A game in which many questions are answered, a game in which makes you think and look at the other games and go ""Wait, is that guy from this game? Did this lead to that? Oh, that's why that happened."" And so forth.And the lasers, oh my sweet jesus. I freaking love lasers.My overall opinion would give it an 8/10 for it's storyline and how it incorporates itself into the series.			"

												Great Game, a bit short but DLC should cover that,I you have played BL2 or any other shoot n loot game and enjoyed it then you will enjoy this game !!!Also if you are a pc gamer annoyed over the fact that destiny will only be released on pc only in 2015, this game is a great game to play while waiting for 2015 :)			"

What i think:I think that this game can ONLY be fun with friends on your first playthrough. after that it is .Once you have completed everything then theres not much left and you cannot play it without feeling like you are treading through sludge.PROS & CONSPROS1. Nice classic borderlands feel2. runs well if you can get past the launcher crashes3. okay story4.CO-OP works fineNow for the Cons:CONS1.crashes ALOT2.Game gets very dry towards the end3.Game repeats itself alot4.Fails to keep intrest5.has bad patches6.forces humor on to claptrap(which isnt that funny anyway)7.loads of things in the game are broken8.bosses dont work properly(AT DATE OF TIME WRITTEN)OverallIn short do not get this game. wait for it to be fixed and has proven itself to even be in the same steam library as borderlands 2/1. If you are desperate for new borderlands then you're better off watching a lets play of it in fullscreen pretending to play it with a controller plugged in.			"

												Butt slam your way across the moon of Pandora, Elpis! Some of the franchises most beloved characters return as NPC's and a NPC from a DLC of the first game is now playable. And the most galvinizing (I made a funny!) NPC of all is now playable: Claptrap! Whether you love him or love to hate him he's the most recognizable character in the series. If you like the prior games you'll love Borderlands: TPS. It keeps most of the same formula but adds just enough new things to keep it interesting.This also is 2K and Gearbox's first game to see simultaneous cross platform release. The PS3, Xbox, Mac, Windows, and Linux versions all released at the same time. Pity I have but one thumbs up to give this game! "

												The third game in the Borderlands series and still going strong!  Only 1/2 the length of Borderlands 2, but a worthy game nonetheless.  Still maintaining its top notch voice acting dialog and gameplay.  Not much has changed graphically from Borderlands 2, but the game still looks fantastic.  The main difference in The Pre-Sequel is it takes place solely in space and you'll have to worry about oxygen as a life resource.  Having oxygen does hinder you somewhat.  Especially in long drawn out fights or just exploring.  You'll find your oxygen tanks low or just on the brink of empty a lot of the time, but there are quite a few oxygen hubs located throughout the entire game. Everything you loved about the previous Borderlands games is here including multiple characters to choose from, skill trees, transportation vehicles and of course the ever loving witty dialog!  Having only spawning 1 story driven DLC this time around the game doesn't offer as much as Borderlands 2, but if you're a fan of the series it's a must play.  New lazers, space ground stomps, ice grenades and so much more kept this game going strong until the end.  And ohhh boy.. the ending boss was great.  Good fun!  Recommended.			"

												Borderlands: The Pre Sequel is definitely a fun experience. Overall, the game is well made and I really can't stress how entertaining it is. But, is it worth the price tag? The blunt answer is no. Luckily I did not pay full price and got it bundled with the season pass for $20. $20-30 is the most this game should've asked for. While it has quality content there isn't much. The story itself takes maybe 15 hours at most. The world is much smaller, the story is shorter, less sidemissions and fewer interesting personalties than in Borderlands 2. The vertical leveling was also quite annoying and made finding your way around or find missions or mission objectives a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥The story is pretty solid, with some entertaining bit sprinkled in and a few returning faces. The huge problem I had with the story was I didn't have any sense of urgency. In BL2 you feel this urge to defeat that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Handsome Jack who is threatening Pandora. In BLPS you can't really get that connection to any of the ""villains"". Zarpedon is the closest you get to that and she really isn't an intrecate part of the story. You might hear her shout something to her soldiers like ""Blow this up!"" or ""Stop him!"" but that's where it ends. Some of the plot is really confusing too. Why are we following Athena's point of view when you're not playing Athena? Even in multiplayer it will show Athena in cutscenes and not the entire group.The characters were okay. Janey Springs was well done, so was The Meriff, of course Crazy Earl and that little kid I can't really remember. I've heard a lot of people complain about Janey and they're usually sad sap loonies. There weren't an awful lot of characters and none of them really have anything terribly intresting about them unlike the ones from BL2 we all loved. The player characters were excently done though, and interact with Jack and other NPCs differently and actually talk. I thought the different abilities were pretty nice, escpecially the DLC ones. Enemies on the other hand weren't done so well. The scavs and lunitics really aren't as good as their raider and pyscho counterparts. They never really say anything intresting or have much variation other than charcter models. Other than that, the UI is basically the same, there's moonstones (which is basically eridium), laser weapons which are pretty cool, Australian accents everywhere, butt slamming, cyro weapons and Mad Moxxi.Don't buy on full price, wait for a sale and you won't regret it.

												I'm going to be disgustingly critical with this game, in only the best effort to sound and thorough.  Compared to BL2, this game is akin to that of another DLC. It's ridiculously short, story wise. and everything else wise. I can load up BL2 and find things that are totally new to me, while in this, nothing is new. After about 4-5 hours one can effectively complete every single quest in the game, and take out the ""hidden"" bosses with relative ease. Honestly, the only reason I actually load up this game anymore is because of the new ""Claptastic Voyage"" DLC, which I'll get into in a second.  The humour, has been utterly destroyed. Honestly, the only thing that remotely makes me laugh at this game anymore is when Racist Hot Dog appears. That's about it. The story itself is pretty meh. You arrive, and just as quickly, you leave. Sudden surprise enemy ""oh no gotta kill that ♥♥♥♥♥ with no backstory!!!!1111!"" is the quickest trope. (I mean, yes there are scattered Echo logs about Zarpedon, but they don't reveal who she is or her background, only that she works for Dahl, and that she used to operate the ship that the Bosun has now taken over.) You then find Janey Springs who is a homosexual. She helps the character throughout. She is also a homosexual. She resides in Concordia with her own shop. Did I mention she was a homosexual? This is honestly how her character feels to have been introduced. Flatly, she's a flat homosexual, who's only real character trait, is that she is a homosexual. You meet the Merrif, who spoiler alert, is a traitor!!!111!!11 ZOMGNOWAI?! What a curveball! Then, the defining moment in whether or not I believe this is a good story or not, you meet Felicity. Poor ♥♥♥♥in' Felicity, man. If I ever met a character that didn't deserve what happened to them, it is Felicity. Felicity, who in an actual decent curveball, turns out to be an AI unit, who runs the Drakensburg, and who also ran it when Zarpedon was in control. She has a very fond dislike for killing, and all she wants is to be copied. That's apparently too much to ask. Poor Felicity, my god did you not deserve that. No one does. That is why this story does not sit right with me. Borderlands is a roughly light-hearted game. That, and for lack of better words, is describable only as ""entirely ♥♥♥♥ed up."" It doesn't belong in a Borderlands-esque setting. I mean, ""yeah we're trying to prove that jack is ♥♥♥♥ed up here blah blah blah"" but Jesus christ that wasn't necessary. Killing Gladstone and his buddies were more than enough to prove that point, but honestly that may just be me. Though, they did manage to kill off the only character with any sort of depth whatsoever. Speaking of Gladstone, you're then tasked to help in the manufacturing of the first ""constructor"", or murdered Felicity. You're sent on a quest to do the single most annoying thing on the planet, and that, is to damage multiple enemies without them dying. Overleveled? ♥♥♥♥ you. Powerful weapons? ♥♥♥♥ you. That's honestly how this quest feels. In an effort to ditch this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ quest, I managed to break one of my saves. Gr8. The game ends with you storming Helios and taking it back and blah blah blah generic plot♥♥♥♥♥♥ Also, Moxxi tries to kill you. That twist is commendable, though virulently hinted at through the last couple segments. It's also hilariously obvious if you have any sort of technological knowledge at all. BUT!!!!!11111!!11 because there needs to be a raid boss, theres an open vault and you go and kill the big scary monster and Jack sees the vault thingy and gets his face burned and blah blah blah. THE END! Honestly, it's a 7/10 story. Better than what most major companies make nowadays. The graphics are the same, which sits pretty with me. Borderlands is a sobel shaded game, and it's pretty cool what they manage with it. The weapons are one of the highlights. Now, I can use my favorites from 2 again. You want new ones? Nah, ♥♥♥♥ that. LASERS!!!!!! Which, is a cool addition, just lazy if you're going to not add new weapons.  DLC!Why, oh why, did the Devs decide, ""YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE GREAT? MORE VAULT HUNTERS! YOU'RE SAYING THE GAME LACKS CONTENT? MORE CHARACTERS!"" I mean, yeah they're cool and all but they have no depth. Timothy has slight depth but other than that they're all as flat as a board. Aurelia is shunned by Hammerlock because she kills things. How sad. She's rich though. The skillsets for these characters are nice though, and I don't have much to bicker at. I have to say that Aurelia is a really well done sniper class, though I may be biased because she's what I main. Speaking of the vault hunters... they're all great. But, yet again, lack of development hinders them greatly. The continuity is nice, with them all being some part of BL2, but other than that, eh. Claptrap has character, only because he's been in all three games thus far. Claptastic Voyage. Something that FEELS like Borderlands. FINALLY. I honestly have nothing really to gripe about except for one thing: That last boss fight is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Fix that♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Let me start by saying this: If Steam had an ""on the fence"" option for reviewing games, then I'd pick it for Borderlands: The Pre-sequel. Unfortunately, it does not. I'll list what's good about it first:-I'd be willing to try out most the characters, since they have a good design and cool abilities (accept one, which even the game itself shuns time and time again.)-The new combat mechanics added for zero gravity handle well and are enjoyable to use-Laser weapons are effective and enjoyable to use-Shops have rares for sale on a regular basis through their timed deals-You can combine three weapons of the same rarity into a new weapon with the same rarity or higher, and you can choose to add in moonstones (the game's special currency) for a special buff and finish on it.-The new cryo element is awesome-The new vehicles are great and handle wellOk... *deep breath* now the bad stuff:-Most (if not all) of the dialogue could've been written by a typical teenager-Characters like to move as little muscle as possible during cutscenes, and have mastered the art of speaking without the movement of lips-I encountered a glitch where I was permantly slowed, and the only way to fix it was to restart the game. It doesn't sound too bad, but...-Points where you can respawn are stupidly scarce. There are checkpoints, but you can't teleport to them... If you need to quit for whatever reason, you've got a lot of walking to do. (Enormous waste of time)-Most enemies are re-skinned enemies from Borderlands 2 with the complete lack of funny quotes. -They pulled the menu system straight from BL2 without fixing the infamous ""scroll glitch""-The map is still lacking a Z-axis, making navigation to different altitudes long and frustrating-I've passed through multiple solid objects, and fallen through the map, killing me. (Which means more walking!)-Leveling up still takes forever-Quests=running a lot-It's basically overpriced DLC if it isn't on sale. So if you actually bothered to read this far, thanks. If you still want to get this game, buy it at 75% off and have some friends to play with.			"

												Great in many ways, just like BL2, i love the lasers and CLAPTRAP is a must play. Only thing im very dissapointed are the DLC's, BL2 had awesome dlcs with ton of content, curently there are 4 dlcs, yet they have brought you, the player, nothing. -Shock drop slaughter pit is nicely made arena where, again, u will shoot stuff in few waves.....-Holodome is boring arena where npcs get stuck, so u have to literally search for them, so the next wave can start-And the last 2 dlcs are the biggest dissapointment for me, sure nice they have added new characters, cool, i loved mechomancer in BL2, but they have added nothing else, so 10e for only a character is joke. First i thought nice new character, maybe there will be some sort of side storyline separate from the former 4 characters, but nope. U have new character, but u will do the same boring♥♥♥♥♥♥all over again, on all difficulties, with no changes, except difficulty and npcs names.So it's great game, but DO NOT BUY the dlcs or SEASON PASS ffs "

												ONLY BUY IF YOU LOVED BL2 and BL AND NEED MORE. Honestly this games story could have been DLC and that would have been awesome as there were very few sidequests that lived up to the first two games.I found this game very lackluster. At first the anti-gravity jumping seems cool at first but i found it to take a lot of way from combat and gameplay.The Oz kit was fun( a lot of fun in areas without the anti gravity) but anti-gravity was everywhere. If it wasn't everywhere ( like 80% of the game ) it would have been fun to go out and moonwalk but after a few hours I was getting annoyed by it. My favorite part of the game was towards the end on Helios where you till had the Oz kit to do some flying but wasn't everything.... I atleast lost 4 legendary items to them flying off a cliff along with a few quest items and myself. Along with being annoying to get thrown all over place it really effected what guns i used. I found without atleast 90%+ accuracy i couldn't hit♥♥♥♥♥♥(I may be a bad shotting but in BL and BL2 i didn't worry about it) top with the fact things stay airborn way to long. My next big problem goes with the airborn problem as ALL the enemys seemed to fly or were at my feet on the ground. Get ready to aim at your feet to kill the 10000000 torks and other creatures that spawn or spray into the sky as every scav/bandit flys and sometimes for way to long.I bought on sale for $20 and i think that was a little too much but as i loved borderlands i can live with the purchase (id be really upset if i bought at full tho) sooooo I want to say MAYBE but ill hit yes just because my two biggest problems arent game breaking more just annoying aspects and i loved borderlands since me and my friend played it back in highschool.

												I have never. EVER. Been more dissappointed in a sequel. This is the laziest, cashgrabbing, mess of a game I have in my library. I think I can safely say I'm never buying a game from 2k australia again. If this wasn't made in part by gearbox I would call them thieves as well as lazy. Borderlands 2 was a wonderful sequal. It had new everything. UI, weapon designs, weapon sound effects (a big thing for me), hud, brand names, level designs and best of all nearly every enemy character is voiced by an entirely new cast, who just so happen to be the same voice actors that did DBZ. I lost my♥♥♥♥♥♥when I heard Mr Satans voice for the first time (mr torgue). Lost it even harder when he announced he was holding a tournament. This game has none of that. The moon environments are all white and bland, the hyperion city is Opportunity stuck in permanant dusk, the extremely hyped laser weapons are almost always worse than conventional bullets and to top it all off the most prominantly advertized feature: the ""huge"" amount of your characters ingame dialog is almost nonexistant. If your lucky you might get a voice clip once per mission and that gets rarer and rarer as the game goes on. Remember how the quotes your character makes whenever they get a crit kill would get annoying after a while? Well 2k aus seemed to look at this problem and say ""I know what would make this better: if the character said something stupid every single time they get a crit, that won't make headshots annoying at all!""Please dont get this game. The dlc is considered to be the worst in the series and is shamelessly promoted ingame. The season pass gets you access to something that was given away for free to the GOTY edition of BL2, there are only 7 different enemy types and 2 of them are just copied from BL2. Please, PLEASE, just save your money and buy borderlands 2, its so much better and has so much more to offer. Dont encourage this kind of lazy, bland, greedy game design.EDIT:  ""The game that killed its makers"" 2k aus is dead and everyone that bought the season pass has lost out on about 70% of the content they were promised. 2k australia is dead: no relocation to another city/ country, no giving its employees jobs in other departments, no refunds for the people who trusted in them to un♥♥♥♥ this horrid, lazy mess of a game. Its just stone cold dead. And now with the dissapointment that is Battleborn gearbox is looking kinda ♥♥♥♥ed. This might just go down as the beginning of the end for one of the most amazing game series I have ever played. 1 was good, 2 was amazing and now... now the dream has died. Borderlands 3 will either be an amazing comeback and start of a bright future for gearbox and shooters in general or the last gasp of a hillarious fish dying in a brown pond filled with dust and gravely voiced meatheads in hallways behind cover.

												I will update this review as time goes by and as I progress through more characters and DLC launches etc.Right, I have finished the game 4 times now, on 4 different characters, so I'll give out my final review:THE PROS:-Lasers. Borderlands does guns well, so it was no surprise that Lasers would be fun and easy to use. Athena can take full advantage of them, seeing as she rocks Elemental damage more.-Character Classes. A big step-up from BL2, is how competitive each and every character can be. Nina was a solid choice for Beginners, whilst Claptrap allowed for some fun but still powerful builds. IMO Wilhelm has a lot going for him, and might be THE top dog.-Vehicles. The new vehicles are a nice refreshment from the older ones in BL and BL2.-Plot. The plot is thoroughly enjoyable. The ending was a really nice way to tie in the BL2 game chronologically, whilst still showing Athena's narrative of the events on the moon. Borderlands 3 anyone?THE CONS:-Voice Acting. You think giving everyone Australian accents is a good idea. It was. For 5 minutes. And then Pickle comes along and singlehandedly out-trumps Jar Jar Binks in annoyance levels. Even then, I wanted some really outlandish and crazy Ozzie to be used, but sadly, the enemies are duller than BL2.-Orange Weapons+: As many have stated before, Orange Weapons are farmed by either Vending Machines, or by Grinding in a Grinder Machine. The chances of actually finding one from a dead boss is SLIM.-Long Intervals of Play: Because you spend so much time in the air, in buildings, or just running to Oxegyn, you'll find yourself passing 5/6 minutes alone in getting to destinations. Coupled by how long it is before you get the first vehicle, the grind seems longer and longer. Not only that, missions usually set their completion areas a fair distance from them, prolonging the actual length of the game.-Length. This game was originally planned as a big DLC for €30, and with the short story and limited interesting quests, you can see why. The only long bit of BLTPS is navigation. Fighting is fast paced and iconic of the older iterations.So can I reccommend this? Not at €55. At that price point, I expect a solid 20+ hours of story and even more in optional side quests. Also, with the amount of DLC available for the game, BLTPS suddenly hits the €85+ mark. But, if in a sale, like €30, then this game is well worth it, and longtime fans will feel their purchase was justified.			"

												This seemed an awful lot like a watered down, soulless version of BL2, I don't think the new characters where that interesting, the dialogue is only good if you're claptrap. The enemies seem bland in comparison and this thing plays like an extended DLC for BL2 honestly.The lazers were pretty cool and buttslams were a great addition, though they take it off you for the last bit anyway.

												The pre-sequel is noticeable but not necessarily an improvement upon Borderlands 2. I personally like the Character Classes better and I love the new double jump/ground slam combat mechanics. The game keeps most of the good features and builds upon them.Cons-Death Pits everywhere (Lava pits, holes in the ground etc. These obstacles leave little room for error and take away from the little amount of gold the game allows you to salvage)-Not enough save points leading to long travel times if you die (death Pits)-Micro objectives within objectives just to make the game longer. This is one of the most frustrating parts of the game. Side missions and Main missions alike will tell you this is a point A to B then return back to a kind of mission; however along the way they always create two or three other unneeded problems that waste a lot of time. Most missions will have you running across several maps, slogging through hordes of guys you have already killed several times, to obtain the item and then you have to go all the way back. Outcome-Gameplay is fun Classes are better-Transportation/travel time sucks and there are lots of death pits -Money is scarce and Rare’s from vending machines are overpriced and not as good as they should be-Lots of repetitive filler in missions that takes away from the otherwise enjoyable gameplayLove the game but sometimes it tries my patience!

												I have enjoyed all the games in the Borderlands series. This game is basically the same as Borderlands 2, but with Lasers (and probably a couple other things different). The lasers are a pretty fun addition. Since I loved Borderlands 2 so much, I thought I would try this one out too, and it didn't disappoint. I liked the story line that added so much background into Handsome Jack. The most important thing I liked was that it kept me appeased for a while until Borderlands 3 is created, someday. Overall, I recommend this game.			"

												Instead of creating Borderlands 3, the developers decided to narrate a little more about what happened before Borderlands 2, just to re-use the beloved villain Handsome Jack. The story however is actually good. Some people say the game is boring and it is true there are weird Australian jokes that I don't understand as a foreigner... But it is still enjoyable with typical Borderland style comedy scenes, and the character in which you play actually interacts with the NPCs. That's not bad? The low-gravity system is very fun and addicting that has brought the combat system to the next level.The best part is you can play as CL4P-TP. What could be better than this? Now you are officially an outcast. Literally no one is going to like you; the NPCs and your friends as well. If you want to get punched in the face and kicked in the balls by your fellow neighbors, this is the perfect choice for you!

Read before you make a decision.Short version: An action-FPS-RPG game with the same humor and loot that has made the Borderlands series famous.  For $60 though, it's not worth the buy unless you're a big fan of the Borderlands series.  Wait until it's on sale (at least $30 or less). Since there's almost nothing new from BL2, 5/10.Long version: (Update: Dec 3, 2014) From what I've heard about recent hotfixes, The Pre-Sequel's end-game is basically dead (very improbable loot farming) because Gearbox/2K Aus is not listening to their fanbase.  I've also heard legendaries are almost exclusively found in the Grinder (seriously, wtf? no drop source?).  Here's Admiral Bahroo's video/rant on the issue:

(Original review)This game is obviously marketed towards long-standing fans of the Borderlands series.  If you like Borderlands you'll enjoy The Pre-Sequel.  Unfortunately, if you don't enjoy farming for loot or the style of humor in this series then this game is NOT for you.  Most of this review is a comparison of The Pre-Sequel (which from here on I'll refer to as ""TPS"") and Borderlands 2 (which I may refer to as BL2).TPS is, canonically, the prequel to Borderlands 2.  It focuses on the story of the Vault Hunters hired by Jack (yes, THAT Jack, from BL2) as the anti-heroes save Elpis - Pandora's moon - and the Helios Space Station - a large Hyperion-based space complex located within orbit of Elpis.  (Note: this is before Jack becomes the main antagonist for the series.  This game helps players understand how he came to be the crazy nut-bag that he is in BL2.)  The dialogue and writing for this game is clearly the work of 2K Australia, but the humor just didn't seem to tickle my fancy this time around.  (In fact, some of the dialogue made me cringe a bit)While the game is almost exactly a carbon-copy of Borderlands 2 - complete with (nearly) identical HUDs and reskinned enemies - TPS brings a few new things to the table, including the Cryo element (which replaces Slag, even though Jack seems to know about Slag in this game), kraggons (the new resident creature of Elpis), low-gravity environments (read: moon jumping), ground pounding (read: butt slamming), and O2 kits (read: Oz kits - these things replace Eridian artifacts from BL2)In essence, TPS seems like a re-skin of Borderlands 2  (Or, if anything, a ""standalone"" expansion pack).  It's not going to attract any newcomers to the scene, but those that like Borderlands 1 and 2 will definitely enjoy The Pre-Sequel.  I personally think this game is alright, but at the full $60 I can't recommend this game at all (I got mine for $40 when it was on sale on Amazon).  If it goes on sale - say, 50-75% off - then I would think it's an decent buy.Oh yeah, and don't forget all the DLC that Gearbox always releases with these games.  Season Pass is recommended IF you want all the DLCs.  The base game is okay and it has a decent amount of content with it.  Also, Steam says I've logged 5.5 hours at time of writing but that doesn't count the time I've played offline (so, including that, my game time is closer to 15 hours)			"

												You've explored enough of Pandora in Borderlands and Borderlands 2, so now, welcome to Elpis, Pandora's moon. Borderlands the Pre-Sequel is the third game in the series, and like its predecessors before it, is equally random and filled with craziness. The plot revolves Handsome Jack and his fall from hero to villain, along with new Vault Hunters that play minor roles in Borderlands 2 (considering the events of the pre-sequel happens before that). The story is engaging enough, and the Vault Hunters have a lot more lines of dialogue during quests, which is a nice addition and breathes more life into your characters. It is also quite amusing that all citizens on Elpis pretty much have an Australian accent, because the Pre-Sequel was developed by 2K Australia. Gameplay is enhanced with the introduction of the Oxygen system in the pre-sequel, considering you are on the moon, and you can now leap into the air and crash down on your foes in a low-gravity atmosphere. This is affectionately called ""butt-slamming"" by the citizens of Elpis. This new Oxygen system also enables you to reach places that you otherwise wouldn't be able to, by leaping tall structures in a single bound. While all these are great additions to this game, Borderlands the Pre-Sequel does have some flaws. The side quests in this iteration of the series do not flow very well, usually requiring you to return to the same areas dozens of times, to the extent of a fair bit of annoyance. The sheer amount of side quests that suddenly pop up also bring you away from the main plot of the story, which does reduce the engagement and impact of the plot. In some ways, it does not feel as polished as Borderlands 2. To some, this makes Borderlands the Pre-Sequel seem more like an expansion to Borderlands 2 than a standalone game, but the Pre-Sequel has enough new additions to stand out on its own, yet stay true to the Borderlands series. Here's looking forward to more DLCs!			"

												Yeah, it's a Pre-Sequel and yeah, it explains what they forgot to tell you in terms of lore. Though, i never figured the moon would be populated by brits and aussies.Should you buy this before BL:2? No. You'll get spoiled if you watch the intro. Which, btw, i would scold Gearbox/2k about. They really should have ran the story like a new Borderlands title, rather than a ""expansion""Also, it seems they decided to stop being so rude with the humor as well, sadly. ""Midgets"" are ""'Lil"" and they don't say funny things like ""So cold! So cold!"" or ""Here lies midge midge!"", though, they and the Psycho's/Scavengers do still have quips.So in summary, get this game if you want to know what happened up there on the moon and what Jack was up to from BL1 to BL2 and prepare to treat this game like a BL:2 expansion.

												I've purchased the original Borderlands 4 times... on various platforms. BL2... I bought twice.. PS3 and PC. I've probably played both games around a total of 800hrs. This game... 35hrs... and then I said ""done"". Not recommended for the 59$ I paid for it... Totally worth 30$. Felt more like a DLC than a full game. The series has always been super funny... and the story missions in this game were funny too, but all the side quests lacked in humor; mostly because I hated almost all the NPCs you did missions for... especially Pickle... F that guy. and for the others.... felt like knock-offs of the beloved characters on Pandora. Moving on... If you can pick it up on sale... do it...and if you run only through the story it will last you about 19hrs or so. I'm hoping that the DLC that comes out takes place back on Pandora... fingers crossed. 2K, please please please get back with your old teams and develop... These new guys ain't cuttin it.			"

												Borderlands pre-sequel was designed to fill in the details between BL and BL2.  Based on Elpis, the moon of Pandora, and Helios space station you meet Jack and discover how and why he changed into Handsome Jack. I thought the story was pretty good but depressing in some parts. Loved the Aussie accents and their little quirks and sayings which might explain why many people hate those parts of the mission. Loads of references to Aussie culture, like the snicket game, the swearing, the foul mouth gun Bognalla, janey Springs and her three words of wisdom, the swagman , Oz kits, the Dahl respawn station quotes, Red Belly and many more.The gameplay is a lot easier than BL2 where tens of millions of damage were needed to defeat enemies. Cryo guns, and butt slams are so much better than slag but corrosive and fire less so understandably as there is little oxygen on the moon. Was possible to progress in the game with guns five levels below the mission level and a lot more legendaries from vendors.However, some of the badass map achievements are mission related so fail to get it means you can not return unless you reset. Others only allow one person to complete the rank per day. At the moment only some of the DLC has been released and thats only been arenas which I am not fond of. And Jacks body double which I loved playing cause he did and said stuff I so wasnt expecting. Some of the boss fights are annoying too like DeadLift and his impossible Dead Weight badass achievement.Can I recommend this? Definitely, but wait for a special and try and get BL 2 as well because then the pre sequel will make a lot more sense. Already spent over 350 hours here and will spend a few more as more stuff gets released.			"

												Love Borderlands, but this game seems like a massive DLC for borderlands 2 as it lacks any major changes to the previous game (Borderlands 2). To me it was the same game different setting and different characters with arguably the same moves just spread out in different orders among different vault hunters. It is full of humor and the characters actually talk to NPCs which gives them a voice which was uncommon in the previous borderlands. Nevertheless being a ""dlc"" it still inherits its amazing gameplay style from its predecessors and an intersting story.			"

It focuses on the story of the Vault Hunters hired by Jack (yes, THAT Jack, from BL2) as the anti-heroes save Elpis - Pandora's moon - and the Helios Space Station - a large Hyperion-based space complex located within orbit of Elpis.  (Note: this is before Jack becomes the main antagonist for the series.  This game helps players understand how he came to be the crazy nut-bag that he is in BL2.)  The dialogue and writing for this game is clearly the work of 2K Australia, but the humor just didn't seem to tickle my fancy this time around.  (In fact, some of the dialogue made me cringe a bit)While the game is almost exactly a carbon-copy of Borderlands 2 - complete with (nearly) identical HUDs and reskinned enemies - TPS brings a few new things to the table, including the Cryo element (which replaces Slag, even though Jack seems to know about Slag in this game), kraggons (the new resident creature of Elpis), low-gravity environments (read: moon jumping), ground pounding (read: butt slamming), and O2 kits (read: Oz kits - these things replace Eridian artifacts from BL2)In essence, TPS seems like a re-skin of Borderlands 2  (Or, if anything, a ""standalone"" expansion pack).  It's not going to attract any newcomers to the scene, but those that like Borderlands 1 and 2 will definitely enjoy The Pre-Sequel.  I personally think this game is alright, but at the full $60 I can't recommend this game at all (I got mine for $40 when it was on sale on Amazon).  If it goes on sale - say, 50-75% off - then I would think it's an decent buy.Oh yeah, and don't forget all the DLC that Gearbox always releases with these games.  Season Pass is recommended IF you want all the DLCs.  The base game is okay and it has a decent amount of content with it.  Also, Steam says I've logged 5.5 hours at time of writing but that doesn't count the time I've played offline (so, including that, my game time is closer to 15 hours)			"

												Havent finished my first playthrough as Athena yet, but this game is great! It serves filling the gap between 1 and 2 with an interesting story and also somewhat sets up for future installments with a few characters from this game. Overall would recommend for fans of the Borderlands games.			"

												Advance notice: there will be spoilers herein.  I'll hold off until I'm safely into ""read more"" territory.I've played through normal mode twice now, as Claptrap and Doppelganger Jack.  Having 500+ hours logged on Borderlands 2, I watched TPS for a while to grab it soon as the price dropped.  I grabbed it for about what you'd expect to spend on a decent expansion pack, expecting that it'd play pretty much like a decent expansion pack for Borderlands 2.  And if you want the short version of this review, it pretty much did.  If you liked Borderlands 2 you'll probably like Borderlands the Pre-Sequel because in just about every way that matters it's the same game.  The best comparison I can make for it is to the Captain Scarlett expansion for Borderlands 2, both in good terms and not so good.Yes, there are some differences.  Aside from ice replacing slag in the elemental table, which is a bit of a tactical shift, they're minor.  Having a whole new class of guns in the Borderlands universe which is already swimming in them really is a lot less noticeable than you would think.  It does seem that lasers are on the overpowered side in Normal mode, and I wouldn't be surprised if that's intentional, but other than that they're not much different than Maliwan sub guns from BL2.  Since Borderlands relies heavily on having a decent gun or couple of guns to make the game hum along, it is kind of nice to expand the field of possibilities a bit.  Oz kits just replace relics and while the gravity slam is nice to have as an option, its usefulness doesn't go far beyond being surrounded by kraggons or torks.  Air supply is not a huge issue (especially if you play Claptrap) and really the main practical use of double jumping is to try to execute some of the annoying jumping puzzles that crept their way into this game.  Really, Gearbox?  Jumping puzzles?If you're familiar with Borderlands 2, this game leaves you feeling a bit like something's missing that you can't quite put your finger on.  And no, it's not threshers (who only make a cameo here, thankfully).  I thought for a while it was just burnout on the Borderlands universe but after playing some BL2 again the other day the magic is still there.  The translation of the Psychos, Marauders, Nomads, and Goliaths of Pandora to the Scavs and Lunatics of Elpis may have been little more than a skin and voice change, but it lost something in the process that's apparently more important to the ambience than you might think.  Also, the Aussie accents don't make up for the comparatively sparse and not-really-funny things the NPCs say.  Just sayin'.Mechanically, I have a few minor grumbles.  The vehicles suck.  Seriously.  I never liked the skiff you were given to drive around Oasis with and while the reskin for the Stingray looks pretty badass it's still almost the exact same lemon underneath.  Also, TPS is much too quick with the respawns.  You can run headlong into repops on your way out of moderately small areas after just doing your quest business, not even poking around or exploring over much.  This was an annoyance in the first Borderlands that seemed corrected in BL2 so I hate to see it go backwards.  On a more positive note, side quests tend to appear earlier than they did in BL2.  Instead of finishing the story mission and getting the option to go back to the area you just finished for a milk run, you can see most quest givers on the map as soon as you arrive and can detour to them before you go on with your primary objective, saving yourself a fair bit of backtracking.  I'm neutral on the jump pads.  They walked right up to the line of overusing them in my opinion but didn't quite cross it.  Speaking of crossing lines, possible SPOILERS past this point.If there's anywhere TPS outright falls down it's in the supporting characters.  BL2 gave us a brilliant cast of background personalities topped off with one of the very best archvillains since Megatron.  In BLTPS, it's hard to pick out any character unique to this game that isn't just...really annoying.  It's possible, but hard.  Our archvillain Colonel Zarpedon is as colorless as she is relentless, far from the constant foil Handsome Jack was in BL2.  And don't get me started on Pickle.  Tiny Tina was genius in BL2, Pickle was an obvious attempt to recreate her that shoulda been strapped to a badonkadonk.Which leads us to the story in general.  Are we far enough in from the spoiler warning yet?  Ok.  If you liked the story of Borderlands 2 and don't want to see it messed with, then do not play this game.  Of course if you liked BL2 then you're probably way more interested in hanging out some more with Jack than you are in preserving the story, but you've been warned.  The way most of the game plays out, you can start to understand what would drive Jack to go from the hero on Elpis to the way he was on Pandora, then a thing or two happen that almost seem like the writers suddenly remembered they needed Jack to do something bad and/or crazy to get his descent into barking madness back on track.  It really doesn't work, and only results in the game feeling badly written in those spots.  The out-there ""here's an evil thing for Jack to do"" moments seem like last-minute afterthoughts bolted into the plotline and sticking out awkwardly, and don't keep you from reaching the ultimate conclusion that Jack was right all along, and Lilith is the real bad guy in the Borderlands universe.  Told you not to play if you didn't want the story turned on its head.So to summarize, as a game, it doesn't measure up to BL2.  In fairness, that's a tough act to follow.  It's still a good game in its own right and viewed as an expansion to BL2 rather than a standalone game it's fantastic.  I know I've been kind of negative here but if you're already familiar with BL2, then telling you it's like an addon for BL2 should cover all the positives.  And if you're not...start with BL2.			"

												This is one of the most enjoyable experiences I have had playing a game. It adds to the story of both Borderlands and Borderlands 2 and has a few mind blowing moments. I am also really enjoying the amount of small details they have added into the game referencing other items. The easter eggs are brill and the character voices are awesome. I am truely enjoying the new characters that we get to run into and interact with, and the dialog between each playable character and the environment is amazing. I can't wait to see what they come out with in the DLC.Best experienced playing with friends!			"

												I have played Borderlands enough that I have become intimately familiar wih its various strengths and weaknesses as as series, and Pre-Sequel as a lot of both. An interquel that reuses the engine and assets of Borderlands 2, Pre-Sequel nonetheless manages to reinvent the series tried-and-true, shoot, loot, rinse and repeat gameplay primarily by the introduction of low gravity- moving around on Elpis and the Helios spacestation is infinately easier then being stuck in Pandoran gravity. It brings to mind the low-gravity mutator of Unreal Tournament. Combat additions of cryo-element weapons and lasers are also welcome. I had a lot of fun as Athena the Gladiator, whose elemental tree gives her a hefty punch and whose Aspis denies a huge percentage of incoming damage, giving her incredible survivablity that the entirety of the Borderlands 2 cast lacked- most egregiously Salvador, who in the course of playing I spent an inordinate amount of time as with my face in the dirt waiting to be revived. I had a chance to sample the other characters, including Doppleganger Jack and Aurelia but most notably Wilhelm the Enforcer, whose autonomous drones are a big help in combat. The game is well-written for what it is, though if you are bothered by an excess of memes and references then it will rub you in much the same uncomfortable way that BL2 did. The combat in pre-sequel, I would say, the most refined in the series, and actually feels reasonably balanced, but the level design leaves much to be desired- the mazelike decks of Helios station in particular left me dazed and vexed, and had I not had my friends to guide me I would surely have needed to look at a guide to find my way around. The moon also has its share of navigational difficulties, with twisting, identical-looking crags and instant-death lava pits. For the geographically challenged player like myself, Pre-Sequel can be very annoying, but once you can actually find the battle, you'll have a lot of fun. The DLCs, few as they are, are solid- the holodome providing some of the most dynamic arena battles of the franchise, and Claptastic Voyage offering excellent music and asthetics, as well as a very epic final boss and game changing ""glitched"" guns. Pre-Sequel is a solid continuation for the series and also I think, a good entrypoint to the franchise for newcomers. I'm expecting more improvements in future entries.			"

I have played the other Borderlands games before this one and really like them so I have hopes that this one will pick up momentum as I continue to higher level areas.			"

												If there's anything good I can say about this game, it's that it is borderlands, and most of what you liked about borderlands is still present here. MOST. The story is far less engaging this time around, quests are boring and so is the setting, but at least the gun looting, combat and general gameplay formula are kept the same. A for effort 2K Austrailia, but this is the weakest entry in the series quite easily. Reccomended only as a fan of the series.			"

												This last summer I got into the Borderlands series thanks to the sale as did many of my friends and we had an absolute blast with it, so when the pre-sequel came around I was looking forward to playing it. First and foremost I will get this out of the way: for the most part the gameplay is just like the predecessor, but considering that it was awesome I dont really find that to be detrimental, plus it is freshened due to the enviroment you are in with the lack of oxygen and the lower gravity, and butt slams. It manages to have more personality than the previous one as the vault hunters actually say stuff now, they have actual character, speaking of character development the guy everyone loves to hate, Handsome Jack, gets a ton of it. I'll avoid major spoilers and just say that it becomes a lot easier to say why he is the way is is in Borderlands 2. Another thing is it makes Claptrap, at least the playable one quite likable and fun to play as.Overall when it comes down to it, it' more Borderlands and if you had fun with the previous ones, you'll have fun here			"

If you are a fan of BL2 and want to play even more, but now with a few new additions (low grav,♥♥♥♥♥slamming, cyro, no slag bs, grinder, and a whole new world/campaign), try to get it for $30. If you aren't a fan of Borderlands this won't sway your mind. If you never played Borderlands, pick up 1 + 2 before this. Also, the AI is still♥♥♥♥♥♥and the difficulty settings in the game just involve making the enemies bigger bullet sponges.

												9/10When compared to the other Borderlands games, Borderlands the Pre-Sequel might actually come up on top. Despite it's expensive price tag, the Pre-Sequel is special in its own way.Having more story rich elements than the other Borderlands games, the Pre-Sequel also has this great Sci-Fi feel to it. The ""space-y"" atmosphere and great graphics really make this game worth the time and money.The only reason this doesn't deserve a 10/10: The game was a bit lacking in content. It takes just under 24 hours to complete without side-quests, and even then, the Pre-Sequel world feels sparse and lacking in certain elements that make the game feel more like a Borderlands title.Despite this, I highly recommend this game when its on SALE. Not worth the $39.00, but well worth the money when under 30 dollars.			"

												Whether or not you should buy this game depends on a few things. I have to say upfront, that I enjoyed playing this game with my friends, but that probably has to do with the fact that I wasn’t expecting anything. A few of my friends that preordered and were really hyped absolutely hate this game with a fiery passion and will never touch it again. First, if you are big on story and characters, do NOT buy this game. The story and characters pale in comparison to BL2. To my memory, the game was advertised based on story and the game doesn’t really live up to that. When playing with my friends, the story seemed to be over way too quickly. If you are buying this game for gameplay, then there are both good and bad things. If you are buying NOW, the game finally has respawnable bosses fixing some of the end game stuff that the game lacked at first. It doesn’t totally fix it though and lots of end game stuff is still missing. I am no expert when it comes to that so go to a different review. What it adds for gameplay fits really well. Why haven’t we had double jumps, grinders, and lasers before? The gameplay is very close to borderlands 2. The enemies are not diverse in the slightest. In all, as a casual fan of the borderlands series who cares mostly about playing with friends, I enjoyed it. Know what you are getting into and buy it at a discount as there is not nearly enough gameplay as BL2 which was also $60. If you are looking for more borderlands 2 or to spice things up, look up Admiral Bahroo’s randomizer video on YouTube and try that first.			"

												This is one of the most enjoyable experiences I have had playing a game. It adds to the story of both Borderlands and Borderlands 2 and has a few mind blowing moments. I am also really enjoying the amount of small details they have added into the game referencing other items. The easter eggs are brill and the character voices are awesome. I am truely enjoying the new characters that we get to run into and interact with, and the dialog between each playable character and the environment is amazing. I can't wait to see what they come out with in the DLC.Best experienced playing with friends!			"

												I have played Borderlands enough that I have become intimately familiar wih its various strengths and weaknesses as as series, and Pre-Sequel as a lot of both. An interquel that reuses the engine and assets of Borderlands 2, Pre-Sequel nonetheless manages to reinvent the series tried-and-true, shoot, loot, rinse and repeat gameplay primarily by the introduction of low gravity- moving around on Elpis and the Helios spacestation is infinately easier then being stuck in Pandoran gravity. It brings to mind the low-gravity mutator of Unreal Tournament. Combat additions of cryo-element weapons and lasers are also welcome. I had a lot of fun as Athena the Gladiator, whose elemental tree gives her a hefty punch and whose Aspis denies a huge percentage of incoming damage, giving her incredible survivablity that the entirety of the Borderlands 2 cast lacked- most egregiously Salvador, who in the course of playing I spent an inordinate amount of time as with my face in the dirt waiting to be revived. I had a chance to sample the other characters, including Doppleganger Jack and Aurelia but most notably Wilhelm the Enforcer, whose autonomous drones are a big help in combat. The game is well-written for what it is, though if you are bothered by an excess of memes and references then it will rub you in much the same uncomfortable way that BL2 did. The combat in pre-sequel, I would say, the most refined in the series, and actually feels reasonably balanced, but the level design leaves much to be desired- the mazelike decks of Helios station in particular left me dazed and vexed, and had I not had my friends to guide me I would surely have needed to look at a guide to find my way around. The moon also has its share of navigational difficulties, with twisting, identical-looking crags and instant-death lava pits. For the geographically challenged player like myself, Pre-Sequel can be very annoying, but once you can actually find the battle, you'll have a lot of fun. The DLCs, few as they are, are solid- the holodome providing some of the most dynamic arena battles of the franchise, and Claptastic Voyage offering excellent music and asthetics, as well as a very epic final boss and game changing ""glitched"" guns. Pre-Sequel is a solid continuation for the series and also I think, a good entrypoint to the franchise for newcomers. I'm expecting more improvements in future entries.			"

												Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel seems to improve on everything that was wrong with the first two games in the franchise in the gameplay department, but sacrifices the charm and comedic elements as well. Let's start out with gameplay. It is the same old Borderlands gameplay that you know and love, but with a new twist. On Pandora's moon, Elpis, there is low-gravity, which allows for new gameplay mechanics, that make the experience fresh and new. There are also new vehicles, which add for more diverse travels between different players. The game also runs fantastic, and look gorgeous. Some locations had beautiful settings with pitch perfect lighting, scenery, and even had lots of action going on with enemies, and still ran smoothly on my laptop. On the flip side, the game has several downsides. For one thing, the story falls short of my exoectations. If you have ever played a Borderlands game, you will laugh or chuckle at leasto nce every few minutes. In this installment, I only laughed 3 or 4 times, which was really a dissapointment. The story would have been acceptable if there were interesting characters, but there are very few. All in all, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is a great game for lovers of RPG's, Shoot Em Ups, or loot and farming games like Diablo.                                                                      FINAL VERDICT   8.75/10 "

												If you liked any of the previous Borderland games then hold onto your seats becaue this one could possibly be worse than the others.  In saying that I do love the game as I am a massive Borderlands fan and have enjoyed every game in the series. However, Gearbox Australia has put their own twist on the humor in the game and needless to say it falls quite flat. There are references to classic Austalian icons but for some reason us Aussies (i.e. me) did not find in nearly as funny as the other games. A laugh was had here and there throughout the game but coparing this to Borderlands 2 this falls short of being funny. That is about the only bad thing I can say about the game. The combat is as hectic as ever and the new classes introduced are incredibly fun! The variety of weapons is AWESOME and it just feels like a solid Borderlands game all round. In the end I would give this game a 8/10 and reccommend it to anyone who likes the series and especially those who just love to shoot, kill and loot just about everything you see.			"

												PRE SEQUEL! if you guys love Borderlands 1 and 2, there is no doubt you will like this game. It is very much like the previous ones, with only weapons, maps, sceneries, enemies, characters and story difference. Everything else such as gameplay is the same as the old Borderlands. Best game to play a co-op story mode, I cannot think of other FPS co-op game that is as good as this. If you are looking for a game to play with your friends, and you are not into the heavy multiplayer or competitive games, then this is the game for you. Co-op, help each other.			"

												-Australian Space Simulator 2014Not as good as Borderlands 2, but enjoyable as a shorter side game. New gameplay mechanics and character classes to keep things interesting, but all in all I would recommend Borderlands 2 over this.The over the top Australian-ness does get old, very fast though. I mean there's a gun called 'Boganella' which yells slurs in an Australian accent upon firing, such as:- Get that f**king up ya!- Yeah that's not a gun-- I'M A GUN!- Later, ya c**t!Need i say more?

												I will be editing this review as I play with my thoughts over time. I'm doing this mainly because at the time of writing, I can't wait to review this game.3.1 HOURS: This is already starting out better than the other games did, and I loved both of them immensely. A good part of that quick start is the Action Skill available at level 3, rather than the usual level 5, meaning you get into the real heart of the game a lot more quickly. I chose Athena, with my friends being Nisha and Claptrap. Athena's action skill, Kinetic Aspis, makes for a very interesting weapon. It is a shield that blocks and absorbs attacks, then is thrown at enemies to deal damage. It deals more damage based on how much it absorbs. My friends like their own action skills as well. vaulthunter.exe is perfect for someone who wants something different every time, and Showdown is a good skill to have if you don't want to be precise all the time. But I think all of our favorite parts about the action skills is their quick reset time. Athena's and Nisha's abilities have a base cooldown of only 16 seconds (!!!). Compare that to the 42-second cooldown that Axton (my main in BL2) starts with, which can only be lowered to 21 with the best possible class mods and investment in a specific skill. As a result, the game feels a lot more fast-paced and fun. (Wilhelm is the exception with his own 42-second cooldown, but none of us have played him, and his action skill could be fun to make up for it.)  One of the other fun features is lowered gravity (note: the lower gravity does not apply to vehicles, as myself and one friend figured out). It's a lot of fun to be able to enjoy ""parkour"" again. In the first game, exploration was heavily encouraged by free loot at the top of the tallest buildings and most inconspicuous locations. The second game had very little benefit to exploring beyond easter eggs. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed finding the Minecraft section and experiencing the double rainbow with Claptrap, but loot lasts longer than laughs (there's no reason we can't have both, right?). The dialogue is more interactive than ever before. The characters respond and interact differently based on who's present. At the very start of the game, Claptrap begs the players to get moving. At the drop pod, Jack flirts with Nisha. Once you hit the moon Janey flirts with Athena. The characters never interacted like this before, and it makes it seem much more like you're playing people rather than robots (except Claptrap, who IS a robot. Let's ignore that for now). Currently, this game seems to be well worth the money.8.9 HOURS:Started a game as Wilhelm. I think I prefer him to Axton already. Wolf isn't exactly the most helpful, automatically killing the small enemies I need to revive myself during boss battles, but it's better than a stationary turret that can't follow the boss if he goes around a corner. Saint is proving to be useful. He recovers my health and draws enemy fire, so no ill effects there. Other than that, so far there isn't much else to say. Until I get the perk that lets me fire while running, I don't rally have much else to add.11.7 HOURS:Started another single-player game with Claptrap this time. I'm not certain how I feel about him yet. I'm level 9, which is normally the time rolls of the dice start to become more minor (until TVHM). The skilltree I went down (the least useless for single-player) makes RNG more important than ever. Random ""subroutines"" make specific weapon types more powerful and the rest less powerful, or increase shields/health and make ALL weapons less poweful. The subroutine chosen is random, and changes every 100 ticks. It's a great fit for Claptrap, since his Action Skill is also chosen by RNG (as well as certain criteria). My favorite part so far has been beating Deadlift in less than 5 seconds when I had The Funzerker skill active, the Vault Hunter Loyalty shotgun, and the Shotgun subroutine. He stood no chance that attempt. My last 2 attempts were not so lucky, with Blightbot senselessly flying through walls, doing next to no damage, followed by Miniontrap being accidentally thrown to the most useless and secluded corner (Thanks, jump pad). But that third time, he didn't stand a chance! Jokes aside, that is a perfect example of how you can expect the whole game to go as Claptrap. Random numbers can make you go from useless to overpowered in the span of 10 seconds. Ridiculously dependent on numbers. That said, it was a ton of fun and I want to do more.			"

												I have played quite a few games again which I initially did not like, and either still disliked them, or found a way to dislike them even more. However, it's incredibly rare that I revisit a game and find myself really enjoying it upon trying it again. I did about 1.5 playthroughs of the Pre-Sequel (which is kinda funny, since the game is ""1.5"" in the series, so there's that), and simply did not enjoy the game. I thought it felt like Borderlands 2 in a crappy setting, and never wanted to play it again. Someone insisted he wanted to play it again, and, wanting to have something to gripe about, I offered to play through it with him so I could complain about the game some more. However, I ended up doing three whole playthroughs of the game, and would like to do more.What changed? The only thing I can think of that's any different is my expectations...and I didn't play as Claptrap. Although a lot of people find him annoying as a character, period, I actually really like him. However, as a vault hunter, I didn't like his skill tree all that much. Of course, my half-playthrough was as Nisha, and I think most people enjoy playing as her, so I don't know. As for my expectations, though, Borderlands 2 had an amazing plot compared to Borderlands 1, and the maps had a lot of environmental variation. In The Pre-Sequel, however, the moon is rocky...all over. There's not a lot of map variation, so that is still a negative, and the plot, though decent, wasn't as good as Borderlands 2.Gameplay-wise, though, I played through the normal difficulty and True Vault Hunter mode with Athena, and the normal difficulty with the Baroness (DLC character who makes cryo element wonderful), and loved my time as them. Their skill trees and skills were a ton of fun, and the guns in this game are great, because...well, because they pretty much did copy-paste everything from Borderlands 2 about the guns, then added a laser gun type and called it a day. The low-gravity jumping and quasi-double-jumps were fantastic, and I would actually love to see something like that in the next Borderlands game. Although a lot of stuff felt lazy in his game because it's identical to Borderlands 2, getting new vault hunters, a cryo element that's way better than the slag element it replaces, and various nice gameplay features make this a really enjoyable game.It's rare that I change my mind from severe disappointment to high appreciation, but it happened here. Thank you for existing, The Pre-Sequel, and I'm sorry I hated on you before. <3			"

												Borderlands TPS is alright. Its mainly for previous fans of the Borderlands games. It provides interesting insight into Handsome Jack's character, further propelling my love for his character. A big thing to consider is that if you're going into this thinking that this will be Borderlands 3, then you will end up dissappointing yourself a lot. Treat this as a big big BIG DLC for Borderlands 2. Infact, this is probably what it should have been.			"

												First I got to say:Accents - 10/10This game has the best accents ever heard in video game history. It is a monument to the beauty of the English language. You've got your americans, your brits and of course 20 different flavours of Australian (since the game's setting basically is space Australia), all delivered perfectly by top-notch voice actors and equalized to perfection. So, for all this game's flaws, the accents make it worthwhile to pick up anyway.Otherwise, the maps are under-utilised and empty, the story is simply ""go to next place, push trigger, repeat"" - while somehow helping Handsome Jack rise in power - and the enemies dull and uninteresting (Shugguraths are cool tho).The guns are the same as in Borderlands 2 with the addition of laser weapons because, you know, space, so if you liked the guns in that game you'll like 'em here. Gameplay is the same (shoot things 'til they die), but some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥has opened the console and lowered the gravity. The writing is contrived and mostly focuses on trying to create memes and failing. For example; you know how Mr. Torgue being a feminist was kinda fun? Well, they run that into the ground until it's not fun anymore.But still; them accents tho. 10/10 would eargasm from the Skipper's voice again.			"

												This game is... meh. It's good, but not BL2 good. Out of the 4 ""DLC"", only one was actually missions and content. 2 of them were character packs (there isnt really any point in replaying this if you have BL2 which can be replayed many times) and the other dlc is just an arena. Kind of lame. The story is ""okay"" at best, as is the humor as well. You don't see any orange weapons until the last 30% of the game, and then they're so abundent that they're not that special anymore. The bosses aren't difficult at all really, i only went down once or twice with even the final bosses (keep in mind i had 0 orange weapons). And to add on to that, 80% of the orange weapons are exact copies from BL2, name/design and all! Kind of lame if you ask me. I would never pay full price for this game. But even with all these downsides, it is still a borderlands game, and it is still fun.TLDR: The game isn't worth full price. Wait till it goes on sale for 20$. It is nowhere close to the godliness of BL2, but it is kind of fun. Also the low gravity feature makes the game worth 20$ (if you get bored, just ♥♥♥♥ around with double jumping xD)			"

												To put this review into one sentence: This game is great, but it really should have been a DLC for Borderlands 2.Although, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is generously shorter than Boarderlands 2, it truely does capture the same atmosphere as the rest of the saga. However, when I say it's like Borderlands 2, I mean it's practically a duplicate. The story is great, but the game-play hasn't changed at all, for better OR worse! I wish they would've added more features to the final product. Overall, however, I'd say I would reccomend this game, but not for the retail price. This REALLY should have been an DLC, not a full game. Therefore, I'd like to suggest waiting for the game to go on-sale.(I've completed 2 play-throughs of Borderlands 2 on the Xbox360, so just incase you were thinking that I haven't done my research, I really have.)

												Oh hey, Borderlands 2 got an expansion. Wait, it's a full priced game? With it's own Season pass to boot!? Oh Gerabox you silly...Now, based on that you ight think that I hate this game, but I don't. It's more Borderlands and I like Borderlands. All the stuff that worked before still work here. But the game adds nearly nothing into the Borderlands formula, except for zero-g jumping and (nearly pointless) oxygen tanks. The jumping is a great addition and I hope that they keep that in the future games, but besides that, I don't think this game does anything better than Borderlands 2.I didn't find it to be quite as funny, except for a few missions. There are no stakes in the story because it's a prequel so you know what will happen.Most of the time they are merely filling in some blanks, or retconing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of things. Also, Claptrap is able to go up stairs, which is simply wrong. The game is also far shorter than BL2. They did have a pretty nice variety of different locations, but even that pales in comparison to BL2.This game is NOT worth a full price release. It should have been a 30€ at best. Gearbox is simply getting too greedy at this point. Still, even with all of it's faults, I did have a pretty good time playing through this game in co-op. If you like the Borderlands games, you will most likely enjoy this one too. If you don't, this game will do nothing to change your mind. I can't comment on the quality of the dlc's(those have been really good in the past) because I have not played them, and I'm not exactly eager to buy a season pass to something that propably should have been a standalone dlc in the first place!

												If you liked any of the previous Borderland games then hold onto your seats becaue this one could possibly be worse than the others.  In saying that I do love the game as I am a massive Borderlands fan and have enjoyed every game in the series. However, Gearbox Australia has put their own twist on the humor in the game and needless to say it falls quite flat. There are references to classic Austalian icons but for some reason us Aussies (i.e. me) did not find in nearly as funny as the other games. A laugh was had here and there throughout the game but coparing this to Borderlands 2 this falls short of being funny. That is about the only bad thing I can say about the game. The combat is as hectic as ever and the new classes introduced are incredibly fun! The variety of weapons is AWESOME and it just feels like a solid Borderlands game all round. In the end I would give this game a 8/10 and reccommend it to anyone who likes the series and especially those who just love to shoot, kill and loot just about everything you see.			"

												Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel seems to improve on everything that was wrong with the first two games in the franchise in the gameplay department, but sacrifices the charm and comedic elements as well. Let's start out with gameplay. It is the same old Borderlands gameplay that you know and love, but with a new twist. On Pandora's moon, Elpis, there is low-gravity, which allows for new gameplay mechanics, that make the experience fresh and new. There are also new vehicles, which add for more diverse travels between different players. The game also runs fantastic, and look gorgeous. Some locations had beautiful settings with pitch perfect lighting, scenery, and even had lots of action going on with enemies, and still ran smoothly on my laptop. On the flip side, the game has several downsides. For one thing, the story falls short of my exoectations. If you have ever played a Borderlands game, you will laugh or chuckle at leasto nce every few minutes. In this installment, I only laughed 3 or 4 times, which was really a dissapointment. The story would have been acceptable if there were interesting characters, but there are very few. All in all, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is a great game for lovers of RPG's, Shoot Em Ups, or loot and farming games like Diablo.                                                                      FINAL VERDICT   8.75/10 "

												PRE SEQUEL! if you guys love Borderlands 1 and 2, there is no doubt you will like this game. It is very much like the previous ones, with only weapons, maps, sceneries, enemies, characters and story difference. Everything else such as gameplay is the same as the old Borderlands. Best game to play a co-op story mode, I cannot think of other FPS co-op game that is as good as this. If you are looking for a game to play with your friends, and you are not into the heavy multiplayer or competitive games, then this is the game for you. Co-op, help each other.			"

												Technically, and design-wise, this game is better than Borderlands 2. Better jumping. Better guns. Better balancing. Better characters and abilities. Where it fails... Is that there is less of it. Smaller maps, smaller levels, shorter missions, a story that is padded to hell... It's a great story, but the padding is very obvious. See, Borderlands 2 had so much content that you could spend hours in it. Especially in bonus after game content. The Pre-Sequel has none of that. Only one real expansion pack is out, and it's good. But it's only one expansion pack. The rest are characters and an arena mode. You'll find a good game here, but after 2 playthroughs, I garuntee you'll have done everything the game has.			"

												Borderlands 2 set a high bar for the series; it combined raunchy humor, infinite variable and fun weapons, multiple unique classes with three seperate specializations each, a lovable villain, fun and interesting characters, and a straightforward but complex story. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, unfortunately, did not live up to its predecessor. Much of the raunchy humor that made 2 and the 1's DLC so memorable is missing, the playable characters are bland (though still fun to play as), a forgettable villain, boring NPCs, and less of a story than slightly guided wandering.However, much of the gameplay that makes the series so memorable is still there, and the game provides a backstory to the main villain and one of the side villains of Borderlands 2. It's still fun, the oxygen mechanic is interesting and useful, and the new laser weapon type can mimic every other weapon type, with its biggest advantages being the obscenely large amount of ammo and the extra damage when in oxygen. The Cryo element is also a welcome addition, as it is the first elemental type dedicated to something other than doing more damage.Final Score: 7/10. Feel free to try it, but don't expect it to be as good as the last one.			"

												To put this review into one sentence: This game is great, but it really should have been a DLC for Borderlands 2.Although, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is generously shorter than Boarderlands 2, it truely does capture the same atmosphere as the rest of the saga. However, when I say it's like Borderlands 2, I mean it's practically a duplicate. The story is great, but the game-play hasn't changed at all, for better OR worse! I wish they would've added more features to the final product. Overall, however, I'd say I would reccomend this game, but not for the retail price. This REALLY should have been an DLC, not a full game. Therefore, I'd like to suggest waiting for the game to go on-sale.(I've completed 2 play-throughs of Borderlands 2 on the Xbox360, so just incase you were thinking that I haven't done my research, I really have.)

												The gameplay is a step up from Borderlands 2.The story is... not as great. The side missions had good subplots, the usual referential humor was good, the main plot was not as gripping.  A lot of questionable plot holes and character interactions that probably shouldn't have happened between 1 and 2. That said, if you are worried about what you might miss for future installments, catch the beginning and ending cutscenes on youtube. If you want more Borderlands gameplay with some new mechanics, this is the place.Also, Claptrap is more fun to play than he is to watch.			"

												Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is the third official installment in the series, and definetly more interesting(not necessarily better) than the other two games for multiple reasons.Before we begin, if there is one thing you should know about BPS right off the bat, it is that this game is a very ""samey"" sequel. If you thought that Borderlands 2 didn't bring enough new things to the table when it came out in 2012, then you will most likely not enjoy this game.On that note, I also didn't find the BPS as enjoyable as B1 or B2. BPS doesn't bring the same charm or luster as the other entries in the series. Once I beat the campaign, I didn't feel the need to come back to this game.Yet, this game still does bring some cool new things to the table. The oxygen system was an good concept, and I often found myself missing the Butt Slam ability upon revisiting B2. Not to mention Laser Weaponry is possibly the best addition the series has had so far.In the end, BPS is still a fun game; but for right now, I can only recommend this game if you are a fan of Borderlands. It is more worth your money to get either of the first two games if you want to try out the series. If you are just dying to know how the story continues, feel free to give this game a shot. If not, consider it again when this game goes on sale.			"

												This game is... meh. It's good, but not BL2 good. Out of the 4 ""DLC"", only one was actually missions and content. 2 of them were character packs (there isnt really any point in replaying this if you have BL2 which can be replayed many times) and the other dlc is just an arena. Kind of lame. The story is ""okay"" at best, as is the humor as well. You don't see any orange weapons until the last 30% of the game, and then they're so abundent that they're not that special anymore. The bosses aren't difficult at all really, i only went down once or twice with even the final bosses (keep in mind i had 0 orange weapons). And to add on to that, 80% of the orange weapons are exact copies from BL2, name/design and all! Kind of lame if you ask me. I would never pay full price for this game. But even with all these downsides, it is still a borderlands game, and it is still fun.TLDR: The game isn't worth full price. Wait till it goes on sale for 20$. It is nowhere close to the godliness of BL2, but it is kind of fun. Also the low gravity feature makes the game worth 20$ (if you get bored, just ♥♥♥♥ around with double jumping xD)			"

												First I got to say:Accents - 10/10This game has the best accents ever heard in video game history. It is a monument to the beauty of the English language. You've got your americans, your brits and of course 20 different flavours of Australian (since the game's setting basically is space Australia), all delivered perfectly by top-notch voice actors and equalized to perfection. So, for all this game's flaws, the accents make it worthwhile to pick up anyway.Otherwise, the maps are under-utilised and empty, the story is simply ""go to next place, push trigger, repeat"" - while somehow helping Handsome Jack rise in power - and the enemies dull and uninteresting (Shugguraths are cool tho).The guns are the same as in Borderlands 2 with the addition of laser weapons because, you know, space, so if you liked the guns in that game you'll like 'em here. Gameplay is the same (shoot things 'til they die), but some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥has opened the console and lowered the gravity. The writing is contrived and mostly focuses on trying to create memes and failing. For example; you know how Mr. Torgue being a feminist was kinda fun? Well, they run that into the ground until it's not fun anymore.But still; them accents tho. 10/10 would eargasm from the Skipper's voice again.			"

												Oh hey, Borderlands 2 got an expansion. Wait, it's a full priced game? With it's own Season pass to boot!? Oh Gerabox you silly...Now, based on that you ight think that I hate this game, but I don't. It's more Borderlands and I like Borderlands. All the stuff that worked before still work here. But the game adds nearly nothing into the Borderlands formula, except for zero-g jumping and (nearly pointless) oxygen tanks. The jumping is a great addition and I hope that they keep that in the future games, but besides that, I don't think this game does anything better than Borderlands 2.I didn't find it to be quite as funny, except for a few missions. There are no stakes in the story because it's a prequel so you know what will happen.Most of the time they are merely filling in some blanks, or retconing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of things. Also, Claptrap is able to go up stairs, which is simply wrong. The game is also far shorter than BL2.

												For everyone who liked Borderlands and Borderland 2 this Game will be fun. The Classes are well disign and Claptrap's abilities is very funny and usefull.there are nice new weapons and effects like ice, the whole disign with air and no air, combined with the oz-kits (o² supply) is well executed.the storyline is nice and gives good background information.There is just one thing, for the price of it, it is a rather short game and does feel alot like an expensiv DLC that is just a bit bigger then normal.So if you havend played Boderland 2, or 1, get one of those and try it out. if you like it you can think about getting this one.If you havent played at least boderlands 2 (and liked/loved it) you shouldn't buy it, you will miss a lot of the jokes and the charme of the game, while this game isnt much of an upgreat over boderland 2.

												This was a great game.Although the development stopped and cut this game short, I feel it is still a great game. Some may think they reused legendaries because they were lazy, they may be right, but I feel like if development was still happening this game would have been just as good as 2.			"

												Instead of creating Borderlands 3, the developers decided to narrate a little more about what happened before Borderlands 2, just to re-use the beloved villain Handsome Jack. The story however is actually good. Some people say the game is boring and it is true there are weird Australian jokes that I don't understand as a foreigner... But it is still enjoyable with typical Borderland style comedy scenes, and the character in which you play actually interacts with the NPCs. That's not bad? The low-gravity system is very fun and addicting that has brought the combat system to the next level.The best part is you can play as CL4P-TP. What could be better than this? Now you are officially an outcast. Literally no one is going to like you; the NPCs and your friends as well. If you want to get punched in the face and kicked in the balls by your fellow neighbors, this is the perfect choice for you! Feel the endless solitude in your hearts as no one accepts your high-five request!			"

												This will be a simple review for people who already know the franchise but are on the fence about this game. Kidding, it is a little lenghty, but there is a TL\DR on the bottom as well as a part you can choose to skip literally right under this sentence, so read up! ^_^So, a little backstory. (You can skip to the next paragraph indicated by a space if you don't care to know where this opinion is coming from).First off, most of my playtime was on console, sorry.I bought Borderlands 1 about a month after release and thought it was heaven-sent. I couldn't have loved a video game more and I replayed the heck out of it.When the Doomsday trailer released for Borderlands 2, I am sure my happiness caused an earthquake on the other side of the world. I watched and rewatched and rewatched that trailer over and over and over again and I am sure I lost some friends simply by being annoying with wanting them to watch it with me while gushing over the IP. The game released and I disliked the first part in the snow, but once we went to find Roland, it was absolutely amazing after that. The story and characters blew away any and all expectations. I was again in love. That is until the end game where I realised everyone pretty much had the same gear, which I felt was a stark contrast to the first game (where blues and purples were always still viable), especially with the broken and unbalanced UVHM. I soon went back to the first borderlands. I say soon, but it was still several hundred hours later.When the Borderlands game released on mobile and that it was a strategy game too, I once again jumed for joy, and some country on the other side of the world was cursing me for cusing yet another earthquake. I quickly realised it was trash though, and disposed of it.Then Borderlands PreSequel was announced. The trailer made me feel it was trying to copy the hype Doomsday set but the premise seemed interesting enough. I got it day one with cautious optimism. Here'show I feel/felt...Borderlands the PreSequel does some interesting things, such as having alternate dialog for your New Game+ playthroughs, introducing the Cryo element (which I felt was soooooo much more fun and useful than the Slag element), double jumping and boot gliding and butt stomps, shattering frozen enemies, beautiful skyboxes, verticality, playable Cl4p-Tp (Claptrap) and just some overall freshness. However, the story is absolute garbage. Devs went on to say things like how you learn why Handsome Jack hates Claptrap units amongst other fun tidbits, but that's not there. Literally a claptrap dies and Jack is already like ""Sweet."" There's a couple other moments like that but none of it really builds up, he just hates Claptrap units from the get-go and we don't really see all that much of a transformation from jack. It is like all the dialog is simply the bare minimum there, as far as story stuff goes, that it needs to tick a checkbox. The end leaves some decent ideas though so it wasn't all bad, and the military AI part was actually okay too.The humor also isn't as good either. Maybe it is Australian humor (no offense) but I just didn't dig most of it. I like dry humor, I like sarcasm, sucky jokes, dirty jokes, and many other types, but I felt a large part of the humor was laid out in a way that wasn not funny. Take for example the Deadpool commercial where D says something like ""that guy has the right idea, he's wearing the brown pants."" If it was in the PreSequel, it would be ""Hey that guy is wearing brown pants, which is fitting because he might just poop himself"" *que pause to hear laughter, only to hear awkward silence*A lot of guns were copy-pasted from Borderlands 2, there was an even worse post-game (unless you enjoyed cryo as much as I did) and it overall just felt like a cash grab. A decent cash grab, but one that left that taste in my mouth regardless, slightly better than the cash grab a lot of people were thinking it would be especially since it was originally going to be DLC, but then was expanded into a full game.TL/DRAll of that said, even though I have some hate towards this game for how it was handled, I still find this game to be quite fun if you are a fan of the Borderlands series. I would maybe wait to get it for $15 or so and yes, the DLC characters are worth it. (I love Aurellia or however it is spelled).			"

												2k's Borderlands is such an amazing serise spawning many great titles such as Bioshock, Evolve and so on, but one day they decided to create Borderlands. With their Borderlands 2 was making them millions they decided to create Borderlands the Pre Sequel, a game after Borderlands but before Borderlands 2.The Pre Sequel features the ""Evil"" boss in Borderlands, none other than Handsome Jack. Which he hires four vault hunters that would save man-kind from Helios, since it has been taken over by DALH's Henchmen who want to destory Elpis and Pandora! It is The Valut Hunters, Jack, and friends to stop the DALH destorying the home planet of many lives, Elpis and Pandora.Borderlands is a huge Shoot-em-up game serise, don't like shoot-em-up, don't buy this game, but like good story telling, funny quoets and lines, you'll have a ball with this game for sure.Since this game is fairly new there are no Map DLC's, so I can't judge on them, but their are character DLC's and they are amazing. For the first time ever you can play as Handsome Jack, well his clones that is and the one and only Hammerlock's Sister. They are great ideas to this game, but they are the only characters that are coming out that we know of.Anywho The Pre Sequel is a bit shorty than Borderlands 2 (Inculding side mission) But who knows maybe their DLC's may live up to it...

												So I have played every single borderlands game and every single borderlands DLC. I have been with the franchise since the beginning actually. Below are my opinions on this game including the DLC.Pros:~ Money and vending machines are vital (you WILL find oranges and purples in there A LOT)~ All characters have appeared in previous games (or future in time)~Not as much emphasison ""OPness"" (in inthe Pre-Sequal at level 35 you havent really broken 1000 damage for the most part (excluding rocket launchers, sniper rifles, and grenades)~ Enemies scale with you. As opposed to going back to the start for some easy kills, most enemies get harder as you level up.~ New vehicles (I still personally want a few more options for what to drive in)~ More detailed skins (look up the ""Eridian Enhanced"" skin for the Enforcer)~ LASERS ( <3 beam guns <3 )~ More unique classes. Instead of a sniper, melee, tank characters the classes are much more unique and can build in many directions. Sorry...no super OP Krieg builds for this game :(~ Bits of story, parts of the story really helped to build the background and fill in some holes. After the claptrap DLC most things are explained, most of them...~ CLAPTRAP IS PLAYABLE~ GRINDER. It is an awesome way to recycle cheap white guns and possibly get something more.Cons:~ Story. Having played EVERYTHING gearbox has put out for borderlands I was overall unimpressed. I beat the game and most of the side quests in under 100 hours. I felt extremely short. The claptrap dlc REALLY helped improve the game and add more content and background story~ NPC. After 1 and 2 it was cool to see new NPCs come into the game. But not much was done to help build a relationship with them like with the original DLCs.~ Needs more skins. This game has been out for a while and I still have yet to see any purchaseable skins come out.~ Needs more content. For a $60 game ($90 with season pass) I honestly don't believe that there was not enough content. Granted there might be more on the way but at the moment it is not worth the $90 with small amount of dlc. For the basic game it is not worth the $60 for just the basic stuff.~ Filler game. As you play it is VERY clear that this game is just to fill in the gaps and take up time until we get BL3~ Grinder recipes. You ""discover"" grinder recipes but there is no way to view those recipes (we are excluding the wiki). I know some people are hardcore about it with writing things down but I definitely don't plan on writing things down. I am happy with the 8 orange guns I carry around everywhere...I probably have more to say but it is almost finals week and I'm a college senior so I need to prepare for life :PI will update this as I come up with more things to say. I'm open to playing with others so if anyone is interested post your username in the comments below			"

												As of writing this I have played the game once as Wilhelm and I am about 50% in a claptrap playtrough.  (Normal mode.)Overall this game is not as good as Borderlands 2. It is basically the same game with a few additions and a new story. It has its moments, but some issues holds it back. I would have given it a neutral rating if possible. I would only recommend it to someone that have played and enjoyed Borderlands 2, and wants more.Pros:- Fun and surprisingly good classes. Nice that they speak this time around.- The new lasers are fun.- Cryo is a much better element than slag ever was.- Lots of Dahl stuff to see.- Neat bits of lore here and there.Cons:- Pandoras moon Elpis is not all that interesting compared to Pandora.- This game have very poor map design in some places. Many maps are mazelike and cumbersome, filled with instadeath pitfalls.- The new O2 mechanic. Whats the point in giving you a death timer like this? It adds nothing to the game at all, it just makes it stressfull. Why not just give players a jumpboost mechanic instead?- Bosses are boring. From their bad and stiff intro to their boring fights. 50% of all bosses in the game is a big or small man in spacesuit with a buckethelmet. - Everybody but you have jetpacks. They are hard to see and I want one too. And Kraggons. They never stop...- The story in this game is understandably a bit darker than Borderlands 2, but sadly a bit of the charm was lost as well. Its not a masterpiece and sometimes dull.- Many sidequests are extremly tiring. What seems like 2 objectives usually turn into 6 objectives. Some quests will have the player collecting very hard to get items, or do some sort of awkward hard maneuver to move on. Elemental weapons are often required and the game only assumes that you have that specific elemental weapon on you. They even put the exact same quest in there 2 times in different maps for some reason.- The game is filled with australian references that non australians will not get. A few sidequests are just complete gibberish - like a billabong in a tuckerbag - ??- To little innovation. The game is to similar to Borderlands 2, more should have been added. New loot, more guns, new enemies++.- At the time of this rewiev, jan 2015, no decent dlc too speak off.			"

												If you enjoyed the other Borderlands games, you should, absolutely, get this addition to the series. If you like FPS games with off color humor, an excelent plot and guns that loot like an RPG, you should get this game (I would recomend starting with Borderlands 1 because of the excelent ongoing plot). With that said, this isn't just an ""episode"", there are two new mechanics that really add to the game and make it feel ""fresh"" while it also fits nicely within the ongoing story(s). My top 3 Favorite things about Borderlands:TPS:1) You're in low grav with all the fun that comes with that. Combined with an ""Oz pack"", you can take longer jumps, or slam down upon some skavs when you're floating over them. I can't even describe how fun it is to Jump up and snipe an exploding barrel next to a gang of skacs, and then to slam down and AOE shock the psychos that ran up to melee you. The more you play and get a feel for the control of it, the more fun it becomes. The combination of how it feels and the very precise controls even make simply getting around more fun too.2) Grinding. Not the MMO kind, the ""I got 3 guns I don't want, and I can put them in this Grinder to get a new one, possibly better"" kind. Once I unlocked the grinder, I stopped selling loot and now grind it all. I have definitely gotten all my Luneshine weapons from the grinder. It's a bit addictive, and I find myself getting a bit OCD about saving the best things to grind and going back to do so mid-mission sometimes, but it's fun. (ADVICE: It should go without saying but; NEVER, ever ever ever, grind one of your main weapons. You may end up with something that technically makes it more valuable, but acutally makes it less useful to you)3) PLOT!!!! if you liked the other Borderlands, you will like this one. As a matter of fact, the story in this one adds to the story of the others. I will probably replay them all again just to enjoy the story all together.			"

												Me and a friend both got this game in the recent mid week madness, the season pass of course! We have already beaten it once, starting playthrough 2 tonight. Anyway, if you liked Borderlands 2, you'll probably like this game as well, same kind of in your face combat. Guns...OMG GUNS. The loot is not as pleasing to find in BL:TPS as it was in BL:2 but after getting loot that's complete♥♥♥♥♥for one playthrough, on the next, I can imagine it will be pleasing to find hopefully some better loot. EVEN THE KEY BOX WAS GIVING CRAP. There are some minor bugs we ran into, like my buddy played Wilhelm for a little alone while I downloaded the game. When he reached a certain mission at I believe lvl 8 (I have forgotten which mission) it would not let him progress, apparently its a pretty common glitch when playing Wilhelm... Another bug I came accross was the inventory and equiping new stuff, when I would click on a gun to equip it it would try to allow it and then stop, now that I think about it almost as if I was dragging the weapon and let go because I was just clicking...besides those couple bugs I havent found anything else so far. I have faith that eventually they will be fixed, hopefully soon coz I was looking forward to playing Wilhelm and I really don't wanna have to keep re loading because of that glitch I mentioned...Short: If you liked BL:2, get this game, but be aware of some minor glitches! 9/10 will play 9 more times. Happy gaming!			"

Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is not as bad as what you think it is. As a hardcore Borderlands fan, you'll be disappointed for sure but as a regular FPSRPG game, you will not be disappointed. Some good points that the game has and does better than Borderlands 1 & 2 is that the characters are more fun to play as and combat is more interesting as you have the ability to do double jumps and butt slams. For each character, you can come up with many different builds and that really helps up the replayability. Another good touch that the game has is that the character you play as actually responds to what the NPCs have to say.However, as much as I like this game, there are still some glaring issues with the game that I would like to point out. One of the issues is that some of the missions just drag out for too long. This makes it very tedious for the player to go through and also makes it very repetitive. Speaking of repetitiveness, this game can get boring at times in my opinion. While I do believe that there is a good amount of replayability withtin the game, this game does not have as much replayability as Borderlands 2 as it suffers from the lack of end game content. In Borderlands 2, after you finish the campaign, you are able to farm these raid bosses for loot. In Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, however, there is only one raid boss to farm and that raid boss is the same as the final boss but just a more beefed-up version.Overall, I do recommend this game as it is a lot of fun and you are sure to sink in tens and probably even hundreds of hours into the game.FINAL RATING: 7/10 "

												I wish I had someone to play with.. can't get last achievement :/ Not as good as previous game which will always stay close to my heart <3 + Great story where you get to know your main antagonist from a different view + Fun mechanics  + Cool and complex characters to play with different build to try out  - Felt monotous after some time, like go there, kill this guy, come back. - Basicly no late game, no dlc = nothing to do at max lvl except farming final boss over and over again. - I've never been so disappointed to spend that much (in my wallets perspective) on season pass expecting lots and lots of stuff throughout the time having in mind Borderlands 2 and then finding out you get one campaign, arena and 2 characters.. woah. Just personal experience though.Love the series, so far my favourite one and I don't expect it to change in the future, but I would give the last place within the Borderlands games, ever after the Telltale one.(But) Heeey! (overall) that's pretty good!If you have someone to play with you, both buy this game and you will enjoy it! :)			"

												Great game that I got for about 3.50$. It is not as good as borderlands 2 though, and the Nisha is too game breakingly OP. It is definately worth buying during a sale but not for full price. For those who have played Borderlands 2. This game is quicker and less open world, however the humor is just as good and the story may change you views on some things. Quite a great game and definately key if you plan on following the story of Borderlands.WARNING: Do not play the game if you haven't played Borderlands 2.			"

												I have enjoyed all the games in the Borderlands series. This game is basically the same as Borderlands 2, but with Lasers (and probably a couple other things different). The lasers are a pretty fun addition. Since I loved Borderlands 2 so much, I thought I would try this one out too, and it didn't disappoint. I liked the story line that added so much background into Handsome Jack. The most important thing I liked was that it kept me appeased for a while until Borderlands 3 is created, someday. Overall, I recommend this game.			"

												I loved it, but i wouldnt say that it was as good as borderlands two, and i also wished that they wouldve brought back slag weaponry with cryo weapons, and or have weapons that dealth multiple elemental damage, like a fire/shock combo.			"

												This will be a simple review for people who already know the franchise but are on the fence about this game. Kidding, it is a little lenghty, but there is a TL\DR on the bottom as well as a part you can choose to skip literally right under this sentence, so read up! ^_^So, a little backstory. (You can skip to the next paragraph indicated by a space if you don't care to know where this opinion is coming from).First off, most of my playtime was on console, sorry.I bought Borderlands 1 about a month after release and thought it was heaven-sent. I couldn't have loved a video game more and I replayed the heck out of it.When the Doomsday trailer released for Borderlands 2, I am sure my happiness caused an earthquake on the other side of the world. I watched and rewatched and rewatched that trailer over and over and over again and I am sure I lost some friends simply by being annoying with wanting them to watch it with me while gushing over the IP. The game released and I disliked the first part in the snow, but once we went to find Roland, it was absolutely amazing after that. The story and characters blew away any and all expectations. I was again in love. That is until the end game where I realised everyone pretty much had the same gear, which I felt was a stark contrast to the first game (where blues and purples were always still viable), especially with the broken and unbalanced UVHM. I soon went back to the first borderlands. I say soon, but it was still several hundred hours later.When the Borderlands game released on mobile and that it was a strategy game too, I once again jumed for joy, and some country on the other side of the world was cursing me for cusing yet another earthquake. I quickly realised it was trash though, and disposed of it.Then Borderlands PreSequel was announced. The trailer made me feel it was trying to copy the hype Doomsday set but the premise seemed interesting enough. I got it day one with cautious optimism. Here'show I feel/felt...Borderlands the PreSequel does some interesting things, such as having alternate dialog for your New Game+ playthroughs, introducing the Cryo element (which I felt was soooooo much more fun and useful than the Slag element), double jumping and boot gliding and butt stomps, shattering frozen enemies, beautiful skyboxes, verticality, playable Cl4p-Tp (Claptrap) and just some overall freshness. However, the story is absolute garbage. Devs went on to say things like how you learn why Handsome Jack hates Claptrap units amongst other fun tidbits, but that's not there. Literally a claptrap dies and Jack is already like ""Sweet."" There's a couple other moments like that but none of it really builds up, he just hates Claptrap units from the get-go and we don't really see all that much of a transformation from jack. It is like all the dialog is simply the bare minimum there, as far as story stuff goes, that it needs to tick a checkbox. The end leaves some decent ideas though so it wasn't all bad, and the military AI part was actually okay too.The humor also isn't as good either. Maybe it is Australian humor (no offense) but I just didn't dig most of it. I like dry humor, I like sarcasm, sucky jokes, dirty jokes, and many other types, but I felt a large part of the humor was laid out in a way that wasn not funny. Take for example the Deadpool commercial where D says something like ""that guy has the right idea, he's wearing the brown pants."" If it was in the PreSequel, it would be ""Hey that guy is wearing brown pants, which is fitting because he might just poop himself"" *que pause to hear laughter, only to hear awkward silence*A lot of guns were copy-pasted from Borderlands 2, there was an even worse post-game (unless you enjoyed cryo as much as I did) and it overall just felt like a cash grab. A decent cash grab, but one that left that taste in my mouth regardless, slightly better than the cash grab a lot of people were thinking it would be especially since it was originally going to be DLC, but then was expanded into a full game.TL/DRAll of that said, even though I have some hate towards this game for how it was handled, I still find this game to be quite fun if you are a fan of the Borderlands series. I would maybe wait to get it for $15 or so and yes, the DLC characters are worth it. (I love Aurellia or however it is spelled).			"

												This game is... meh. It's good, but not BL2 good. Out of the 4 ""DLC"", only one was actually missions and content. 2 of them were character packs (there isnt really any point in replaying this if you have BL2 which can be replayed many times) and the other dlc is just an arena. Kind of lame. The story is ""okay"" at best, as is the humor as well. You don't see any orange weapons until the last 30% of the game, and then they're so abundent that they're not that special anymore. The bosses aren't difficult at all really, i only went down once or twice with even the final bosses (keep in mind i had 0 orange weapons). And to add on to that, 80% of the orange weapons are exact copies from BL2, name/design and all! Kind of lame if you ask me. I would never pay full price for this game. But even with all these downsides, it is still a borderlands game, and it is still fun.TLDR: The game isn't worth full price. Wait till it goes on sale for 20$. It is nowhere close to the godliness of BL2, but it is kind of fun. Also the low gravity feature makes the game worth 20$ (if you get bored, just ♥♥♥♥ around with double jumping xD)			"

												To put this review into one sentence: This game is great, but it really should have been a DLC for Borderlands 2.Although, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is generously shorter than Boarderlands 2, it truely does capture the same atmosphere as the rest of the saga. However, when I say it's like Borderlands 2, I mean it's practically a duplicate. The story is great, but the game-play hasn't changed at all, for better OR worse! I wish they would've added more features to the final product. Overall, however, I'd say I would reccomend this game, but not for the retail price. This REALLY should have been an DLC, not a full game. Therefore, I'd like to suggest waiting for the game to go on-sale.(I've completed 2 play-throughs of Borderlands 2 on the Xbox360, so just incase you were thinking that I haven't done my research, I really have.)

												Oh hey, Borderlands 2 got an expansion. Wait, it's a full priced game? With it's own Season pass to boot!? Oh Gerabox you silly...Now, based on that you ight think that I hate this game, but I don't. It's more Borderlands and I like Borderlands. All the stuff that worked before still work here. But the game adds nearly nothing into the Borderlands formula, except for zero-g jumping and (nearly pointless) oxygen tanks. The jumping is a great addition and I hope that they keep that in the future games, but besides that, I don't think this game does anything better than Borderlands 2.I didn't find it to be quite as funny, except for a few missions. There are no stakes in the story because it's a prequel so you know what will happen.Most of the time they are merely filling in some blanks, or retconing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of things. Also, Claptrap is able to go up stairs, which is simply wrong. The game is also far shorter than BL2. They did have a pretty nice variety of different locations, but even that pales in comparison to BL2.This game is NOT worth a full price release. It should have been a 30€ at best. Gearbox is simply getting too greedy at this point. Still, even with all of it's faults, I did have a pretty good time playing through this game in co-op. If you like the Borderlands games, you will most likely enjoy this one too. If you don't, this game will do nothing to change your mind. I can't comment on the quality of the dlc's(those have been really good in the past) because I have not played them, and I'm not exactly eager to buy a season pass to something that propably should have been a standalone dlc in the first place!

												Borderlands is probably my favorite game franchise of all time. I have played every one of them, including the Telltale Game. After completely leveling up two characters (Nisha and CL4P-TP) in TPS, here are my thoughts about this game in singleplayer mode.Pros:+Low gravity and buttslams are welcome additions to gameplay mechanics+Space Australia-theme+Best skilltrees in the franchise+Laser weapons and cryo-element+Claptastic Voyage dlc (probably the best BL dlc there is...)+Stingray (the best BL vehicle there is)+Option to replay playthroughs at will+Increased amount of skill points allows to use all three end tier skills at the same timeNeutral:+/- Plot+/- Humour+/- Voice acting+/- Graphics+/- Grinder and Luneshine effectsNegatives:-Significantly reduced legendary loot selection compared to previous installments-Less pop culture references-Only two story dlc's, from which only one is good-Increased amount of levels, but not a whole lot of additional stuff to play... means that you'll grind the main story quuuuuite a lot.-No pearlescent rarity loot-No OP-levels-Fully leveled up character is too powerful. Nothing provides a challenge, except the Holodome dlc.-Many locations are without a fast travel station-Some items can only be acquired once per character (playthrough reset doesn't help)-Too many legendaries that belong to general loot poolLooking at the neutrals only, you can already guess that this game waters down the awesomeness of BL2 quite a bit. Still though, it made up some of it by giving better gameplay mechanics (although in smaller scale). The main plot is mediocre and execution is cumbersome. Humour is good at times, but it should be excellent. This is a BL game after all!I recommend you grab this game on sale. In the end it is a good deal of fun! Just don't go expecting it to be as good as BL2.			"

												So many reviews and so many positive. I honestly doubt this will even be read. I would rather have a 1-5 rating system than a black and white yes/no. As of this writing the approval rate is 80% and in my opinion, the game doesn't deserve that. So I'm going to say no. Here's why. Voice Acting: BadStory Development: Very BadUI and Engine Basics: Same old same oldVoice ActingExcept for the playable characters the voice acting was notably inferior to BL1 and BL2. It lacked motivation, inspiration, emotion and believability. I felt as if the voice actor asked the producer ""what is my motivation?"", and there was either no producer or the producer didn't know or didn't care. I'm sure the actors are skilled but a clueless actor results in mediocre acting. Making a dialog comment about not being able to understand the Aussie accent and dumbing it down ya'll, was clearly targeting the American market and annoying. It wasn't funny. I understand the dialog just fine. It is however, difficult to follow any dialog of speed-talkers, which occurred once. Story DevelopmentI did appreciate the how the BL1 vault hunters inserted dialog into the story as it developed. That being said...2K Australia's design for this game focused on high spawn rates and repetitive mobs over story development. The story became progressively confusing and disjointed, senseless. It is incredibly disappointing and lacking. If you want to witness what happened to Jack that made him the psychopath that he was in BL2 then you will be disappointed as well. Evidently all you have to do is lie to him, end of story. Jack is surprisingly capable of taking care of himself. He never acted like a code-monkey. He was rarely timid. There was no story development as to what he was doing on the station or why Hyperion was even building it. The few details regarding this in BL2 were not elaborated upon in the Pre-Sequel. So Angel has already helped her father Jack to mislead the original vault hunters. But to what extent is he abusing/manipulating her now, if at all, is not covered. She plays only an investigative role for the vault hunter character back-story as in BL2. I was shocked to see Roland and Lilith in the Hyperion space station. This might have worked if Jack's character was better developed. There was no real motivation (no story) for these two to turn on Jack in this story. There is one late-game instance where Moxxi apologizes for sabotaging the Eye of Helios saying she knows Jack is a psychopath. Was Jack sleep-talking while they were dating (no longer in this story)? How does she know this and how was she apparently able to convince Roland and Lilith? Not that they did anything. Prior to this the only psychotic thing Jack did was space a small group of scientists. And there was no reason for Jack doing this, as his character development hadn't even been properly progressed to the point where he would. Unless again, the entire premise for his breakdown is because people lie to him... So Moxxi sabotaged Jack's precious laser. Roland and Lilith did nothing but assist Jack. Except in the final scene where Lilith... smashes a Vault Interface symbol into Jacks face, scarring and partially blinding Jack. So if Jack is mad at anyone it should be Moxxi... at least according to the 2K Australia story. UI and EngineThere is no way to replay dialogThe devs trigger enemies and dialog at the same time. Often making it difficult or impossible to hear the dialog. The spawn rate is annoying. Annoying doss not equate to fun. Still get stuck trying to walk or drive over rocks/pebbles or steps that wouldn't stop an infant. ConclusionThe game is fun but not worth paying the full price. I enjoyed the insight into the new vault hunters, as these are characters that the BL2 vault hunters will encounter. I didn't care for Nisha and Wilhelm (didn't play Claptrap). And while I could relate to Athena, I do not feel any desire to replay the Pre-Sequel for any character, even in True Vault Hunter mode. Don't buy this game for the story. Don't expect any fan recommended engine improvements to be addressed.  "

												First of all, I can't help but feel slightly dissapointed. Borderlands 2 set the bar SO high that TPS didn't really deliver too well. The character roster was pretty freaking good though. Claptrap, Wilhelm, Athena, and Nisha could all be extremely good first time playthroughs. Personally, I went with Athena mostly because of the gerneral Knoxx DLC and I wanted to know more about her backstory.  (Just FYI, I did do a little bit of cheating to see fully what the game had to offer, so forgive me.) (Some of the achievements were a real pain is the♥♥♥♥♥if you're an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ like me.)Athena: Oh man, playing with Athena was an absolute blast. That melee dash was absolutely broken if you were a high enough level. Alpis is also very handy, especially with the multi hit upgrade. (Also making her date Janey Springs in the Claptrap DLC was too ♥♥♥♥ing much.)The Story: Not gonna lie, It was pretty rough. It made sense and all, it was just meh. The whole thing with Zarpedon was pretty anit-climactic. The Final boss (Main story): 15/10The Oz Kits: *sigh* The space idea is really cool, but I can't help but feel like the Oz kits just placed a time limit on me. It was extremely frusterating sometimes, especially when I'm doing some platforming and UH OH ran out fof oxygen, now there isn't any double jump (for example in that one ridiculous section of Helios with the jump pads.)DLC: Shock Drop Slaughter Pit: Pretty sure they made this just to fill a quota. Basically a carbon copy (but much easier) of the DAHL combat missions from the first game.Doppelganger Pack: The dialouge was great, but Jack just wasn't that great of a pickThe Holodome Onslaught:  For some reason, before I started this DLC, I though it was going to be a lot like Moxxi's Underdome *Cue PTSD flashbacks of the first game*, but It's more of a creature slaughter dome type thing. I thought it was actually pretty fun. (Athena's Alpis multi hit thing and melee dash made be unkillable js.)Baroness Pack: Who? Not great to be honest. Claptastic Voyage: The only decently long DLC for TPS (unfortunatly.) If you really like Claptrap, this DLC is for you! Just about every non-enemy character is a claptrap (in one shape or another.) The final boss was honestly probably one of the best bosses in the series. Hte fact that you fight Helios is absolutly amazing. Pretty challengeing as well. Conclusion: TPS was a good game. It just wasn't as good as BL2 (imo.) Now just to wait for Borderlands 3 to come out ;^).So far the series goes Borderlands < Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel < Borderlands 2 "

												Borderlands TPS brings a wide range of fun, adventure and inginuity to the table with their new additition to the already successful borderlands franchise. It immediately opens with an action packed starter mission and the controls are smooth and ready to be learnt easily, as well as the ongoing trend in all borderlands games is the feature of almost infinite weapons. All with 1 out of (Don't quote me on this) 8 brand names and different adjectival properties which enhances certain devices within the weapon, I have read over 17,500,000 weapons are availible (There may be more) so your bloodthirst for killing aliens with a fancy weapon is granted in thousands upon thousands of opportunities. The vanity profile is something close to me aswell, I have always loved being able to individualize your own character to prevent running into someone in multiplayer looking exactly like you. Everyone wants to stand out and give a motive of power and an impression of skill but many people have figured that earlier players focus on their cosmetics that their skill declines and the facade of skill lifts. The campaign has many missions filled with skill testing limits (I definitely recommend playing with a friend, but singleplayer is still god in itself) and if you're stuck on a level then there are even larger side quest missions to play in reward for a new gun, some money or moonstones or a vanity item. It provides an unboundable amount of fun regardless of difficulty sometimes or frustration, I still play it now and again as it never fails to provide to my seeking eye when it comes to ""action, adventure, weapons, space"" the variety of the needs people want in a game is scarce with agreement aswell as many people don't understand the cartoon-style graphics, it may put some hardcore battlefield fans off this game. But there is something for everyone here, the price of £8.99 (winter sale 2016-2017) is so generous and worth it entirely. I myself got it for free while purchasing my gaming pc, I was adamant to start the game as I was only playing minecraft. Now this game and many others changed my perspective of video gaming as a whole, I wonder what it will do to you? Amazing game 8.7/10			"

												I'm a huge fan of this franchise. I'm even considering buying the Tales of the Borderlands (I don't like the gameplay style). Long story short, I'm loving the Pre-Sequel as I loved Borderlands 1 and 2, and I'm loving all the new systems.The story: 10/10The grinder: 10/10The New Rides: 10/10The laser weapons: 10/10The cryo damage type: 10/10The new classes and DLCs: 10/10The Oz Kits and the breathable/vaccum environments: 10/10EDIT: Bought and finished Tales from the Borderlands. For my surprise, I loved it too!			"

												Gearbox's to-do list for BL3 (because the ending proves that BL3 will be a thing)-Keep the boss mechanics. The bosses in this game are really well done, and they actively reward you for paying attention and avoiding attacks, instead of going full on rambo.-Keep Lasers. Lasers are fun to use.-Come up with new legendaries. Old legendaries with different names and effects are still re-used legendaries. Get creative! Try and come up with some interesting stuff for legendaries!-Keep the scaling. The game actually feels more balanced than BL2.-Nerf the damage DoT does to players. You will get killed faster being on fire than by being shot with a shotgun by a Badass enemy. Why is this a thing?-Let us farm some freaking bosses. Why do we have to farm vending machines and the Grinder to get the loot we want? Make us earn it!-Keep the Grinder. There is actually a reason to pick up useless guns now.-Improve the Grinder. The elements, the parts, and the company brand of the gun should be factored into the grinding process. If I put 3 Maliwan beam weapons into the grinder, I should NOT end up with a Dahl railgun.-Keep your promises. We were promised that Tiny Tina would actively change the story in TVHM. Did that happen? Besides her little tidbits during the story, nothing changed. At all. We got the same stuff that TVHM in BL2 had: Tougher enemies, new enemies, enemies with 1 hit kill rocket launchers (why is this a thing) and every single enemy has a new name. And thats it.-Keep coming up with cool ideas for Vault Hunter skills. Wilhelm is a great example of this due to his cybernetic upgrades tying into his character, along with how awesome they are.-Give us reasons to do certain things. I played the game for the first time as Wilhelm and I never threw a grenade with the intent on killing something. I threw 1 legendary grenade to see what it did, and I threw the Snowball a couple of times because it was fun, but other grenades were never used. Give us reasons to do certain things without shoving them down our throat (''You need a fire weapon for that'')! Is that too much to ask?Rant overThe game is good, but it could have been way more than it is. BL2 set the bar for the series, and instead of jumping over it, Borderlands the presequel hit the bar with its forehead, and then fell face first into the dirt.

												So I've put 100+ hours into this game now and I've gotta say, it's the worst in the Borderlands series. I've had a number of game-breaking bugs occur, spent days where I literally couldn't play the game online (and received no support from the Devs when I mesaged them about this) and have found a ton of glitches. I am under the impression that a number of those bugs have been fixed, though.Still, the actual story for the game fills in a lot of gaps with some unsuspected surprises but I found it nowhere near as satisfying as BL 1 or 2. The NPC's are easily forgettable (Maybe with the exception of Pickle). It got quite  boring after a while. When I started my second character it felt more of a chore to rank him up, rather than being a  fun experience. There is very little content to keep you occupied when farming, unlike the 80 squillion billion guns that BL2 boasts. I have found only one weapon that I actually like, they did recycle a few (Some of the worse weapons of BL 2) and added a load of pretty uninteresting weapons IMO. The only weapon I do like is the Guerilla, and that's from BL 2.  The new laser weapons are cool but I found the novelty quickly wore off after I realized how inaccurate they were.The ""invincible"" boss is quite easy to beat and not very entertaining after the first time you beat it. If you have a team of 4, you're pretty much guaranteed to beat it, even with 3 people being noobs and only one guy shooting.What I liked about the previous games is they seemed to have just taken elements from the best games in their genre and smashed them alltogether to create Borderlands (The loot/farming system that made Diablo, the fast paced Halo co-op FPS action etc.)The matchmaking for BL has always been a little weird for me, I see 10k+ people playing but can only find 1 online match?Now, after saying all that, I'd still recommend the game if you like BL but don't expect it to be as good as 1 or 2. Buy it in a sale, you'll be less annoyed if you don't enjoy it as much as the others. If you've never played Borderlands and are thinking of getting this one, get the second or first one because they are much much better.7/10			"

												All these reviews I read with negative content are funny to me.I played it,I didn't feel at all like its just a dlc? You have whole story told,of what happened before,a whole new world new vehicle,new element,new monsters,characters with even a possibility to play handsome jack himself (well doppleganger) and the fact its in space gives it another plus.My point is,how can you even say it feels like dlc?? Did you play the borderlands 2 and 1? they are both pretty much the same I don't see why aren't you arguing over these? All of the borderlands games are just as much fun as this one ! I completed it once and now Im in the middle of completing it another time.An hell yes,I will play borderlands again after that because in my opinion these are ones of the best co-op story games I ever played. Please continue what you are doing, I love this pre-sequel and the story behind it. This is the game I can play for days without getting bored,because I love to make new characters and discover their abilities.I recommend playing as claptrap,he is really fun in my opinion.The only sad thing is that its short but still a lot of fun!

With the patch, the game works like a charm. I have to disable FXAA, but that was expected, the card is old after all.			"

												Short but sweet game, and also in this horrid review.Pros-- Visually beautiful.- A few more choices for weapon types and vehicles.- The history about Jack and the 'Vault Hunters' was put in a new light how certain characters came to be. (The Hyperion Announcement voice isn't a Computer but a woman trapped in a room made to say things Jack writes, who knew?)Cons- - The outdoor exploration on Elpis was a bit tedious. Constant outlook for airpockets if you want to explore (Which is what Borderlands is well known for)- The main characters seemed to lack actual character the other two games Vault hunters had. It didn't let you immerse like the previous games and chosen character.- Most of the storyline takes place on Elpis which the areas seem all the same, just a different coloured background of space.And...- The amount of 2K Australia Aussie-like-isms is kinda shocking. Although I am a Kiwi (from New Zealand) I wasn't against it since I could understand it fine and have similarities, but I was surprised non-Aussie-Kiwi-British mates had to ask me what this and that was. Such as Billabong for Lake, Jumbuck for sheep etc.But overall, I still love the game, the price should be lower and the DLC's are alriiight. But still, if you want chocka-block of loot, a good punt with your mates on the bosses or grinder? Give this Multiplayer beaut a go.			"

												Provides decent backstory and content, but the price is far too steep for what you're getting. The Holodome DLC is funny, but far from worth the $10 for essentially what is an arena sidequest with a free Legendary at the end. Both Vault Hunters are unique and fun to play, don't really have any complaints about them. Claptrap's Mind is on par with Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep quality wise, in my opinion, but it suffers from the same problem that the base game does: it's far too short.I loved Borderlands 2 because even if the base game wasn't that long, the DLC (as mediocre as it was at times) was available to fill the gap in replayability. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel! does not have much in the way of actual content and the level cap increase does little to help this when you're forced through the base game 5 or 6 times to reach it. ince you're there, it has very little boss wise, with only 2 endgame bosses compared to the second game's 11.The first is a pushover and the second is an excercise in patience unless you've got a method of cheesing it. (In a way though, that's a bit nostalgic of BL2's Raid Bosses, which leads me to believe Gearbox can only make fights that swing on either end of the difficulty spectrum.)Overall, I'd advise not picking this up unless it's on sale. I recommend it if you love the series, but certainly not for more than $30.			"

												I don't see where all of the hate on this game comes from. From the start, they said it was gonna be based off of Borderlands 2, so what were you expecting? Some just dislike the gravity, jumping, jump pads, and the atmosphere as well. Some dislike the fact that weapons are just imported from BL2 (but like I said this is based off BL2). It may be a shorter story as well, with slightly fewer side quests, but overall, the game itself is not a bad game. There are plenty of new features, enemies, characters, raid bosses, elements (cryo), loot, and more to explore. In my opinion, this is a great borderlands game, and I'm sure there are more to come. I reccommend buying it whenever it goes on a sale, and don't forget to grab that season pass bundle too, it's worth it.			"

												A game that initially had me skeptical at first that eventually had me hooked due to some enjoyable gameplay changes such as low gravity and a few more weapon changes such as laser weapons and an ice element. From someone who is a fan of the Borderlands series and plans on picking it up, be noted; this game is much better at a sale price. While it can be enjoyed by anyone who liked Borderlands 1 or 2, there is very little in this game that really changes the formula, so come into the game with the right expectations.			"

												This game did exactly what the developers intended to do with it:- It explained all the events prior to Borderlands 2- It sets up the plot for Borderlands 3 (since Borderlands 2 left them with all and no direction to go off of)- It kept the same brand of humor/style as the other Borderlands games- It showed off some unique mechanics like the OZ Kit and Cryo Freezing- It got the Vault Hunters to be more involved dialogue-wise making them dynamic- Include more space-themed easter eggs than you know what to do withThere are others I'm sure, but these are some of the biggest, and mostly overlooked, reasons that this game does not get enough credit. Honestly, I like this game and what it had to offer. With its interesting story, awesome DLC, and immense replay value, this game is honestly like Borderlands 2, but with a nice twist so the gameplay doesn't have to be so stale.This game is not perfect though because:- Driving mechanics suck. The littlest change in direction at full speed make the vehicle unstable.- Explosive shotguns fire bullets about 2 seconds after the shot has been fired.- If you get hit by a cryo blast and exit your vehicle while being damaged by it, you are perma-slowed and need to reload game to return to normal speed.**SPOILER**- Raid boss is not only unoriginal, it's the exact same difficulty as the final boss, but with higher shields and health.But overall, the game is fantastic and I will keep replaying it for everything it's worth until I'm sick of it.

												So, I realize most of the critique given to this game by other seem to be centered around the hubbub it caused at launch. There's no denying that this game was a bit on the rickety side when it first came out. Bugs, non-farmable stuff, the feeling that it was more of the same, etc... Well, now that it's settled down a bit, I can write a proper review on this.I would've made the review on how the game holds up on its own merits. But the problem is that this was meant to be played after you wrung Borderlands 1 & 2 like a wet sponge and pretty much knew what was going on on both stories, so the game does assume you've played those two first. So here's my first criticism on it, it's pretty much impossible to review this without making comparisons to the other games because it assumes you've played them first. Fortunately, I have, so I can at least start spluttering on it.On its very first glance, it may look like Borderlands 2 with a spacey background. Well, in essence it pretty much is, but there are a lot of new things added which makes it stand out from its predecessors enough.This does let me mention my first pointer: the aesthetics. Until now, you were pretty much grounded on Pandora. A whole lotta brown on the first game, while the second game varied up the scenery though it was still relatively grounded. The Presequel, on the other hand, takes place on Elpis, that really big moon that takes up a good chunk of the sky, alongside maybe a space station environment here and there. While it replaces too much brown to maybe too much grey, it's something different, and in my opinion quite fitting as it reminds you that you were playing a sci-fi game.Like any self-respecting moon, Elpis sports a lower gravity compared to Pandora. This pretty much means that you would be able to jump to places not normally possible on Pandora. Though admittedly the low gravity also means that you were able to platform to places you shouldn't be, if you were skilled enough.Now that the aesthetics are out of the way, let me talk about the new content.First of all, Oz Kits. Replacing Eridian Artifacts, these things serve an entirely different purpose. Obviously being in space, you would need to be able to breathe, which is where these things come in. You get a new bar alongside health and shields, and that is Oxygen. While in an environment with no air, your Oxygen constantly drains, and when you run out your health ticks down instead (unless you are a robot, in which case your oxygen doesn't even drop. A nice attention to detail).  One important thing the Oz kit can do, however, is that by expending a short burst of oxygen, you are able to launch yourself at a specific direction, basically a double jump. Another addition is that you can crouch down in the air to rapidly speed downward, and at a high enough height you emit a shockwave that can lay down the hurt on enemies. With these additions, the game style effectively differs entirely from Borderlands 1 & 2, swapping out the duck and shoot playstyle for something with a much faster if riskier flow. There isn't as much cover you can utilize compared to its's predecessors, but to make up for it your maneuverability is kicked up a notch.There is a new element added to this game: the Cryo element. A replacement to the Slag element, instead of coating the enemy in purple stuff and causing them to take extra damage, this element has a chance of stopping enemies dead in their tracks, and causing them to take extra explosive and melee damage. This element has to be my favorite, as the ability to stop even a rampaging Badass in their tracks and one-shotting them in their crit-spot with a point-blank shotgun is one of the most cathartic things you can possibly do in this game. Obviously this doesn't work on everything, but given this game is more run & gun with its approach the ability to freeze will assist you aplenty.My personal favorite addition: The Grinder. This piece of machinery is basically a pseudo crafting machine, by slotting in equipment that you don't need, it will spit out new equipment that has a chance to be of a higher rarity. In my opinion, this is a fine addition to the game. While the option to revisit a miniboss or boss and killing it over and over until a chunk of orange drops is still there, this alternate means of grinding (no pun intended) allows you to create useful weaponry with the junk you'd normally skim over. Hey, anything that gives me a reason to loot the green stuff is a plus in my books!There are two vehicles exclusive to this game: The Moon Buggy and the Stingray. The Moon Buggy is basically the Elpis equivalent to the Runner, and sad to say I found it really unwieldy to control, even more so that the Runner if you can believe that. The moon surface is pockmarked with cracks and pitfalls, and suffice to say it's almost inevitable you'd accidentally careen into one at least once while driving the Moon Buggy. Which is why I always switched out to the Stingray whenever i got the chance. A hovering vehicle, it operates on a similar philosophy to the Oz kit in that the boost sends it straight up instead of forward, and it helps a lot that the vehicle falls slower than other vehicles, which allows you to platform over uneven surfaces easily. That being said however, I counted three times that I jumped too high into a building ceiling and glitched myself into it, which was vaguely embarassing.Now I had a lot of fun with this game despite what other people say about it, but how does it compare to the other games before it? Something they bought back from Borderlands 1 was the more generous weapons system where even a  rather mundane blue weapon can last for a long time. For the longest time I've used a Torgue Ravager which was able to stand up to even Legendaries during my run as Claptrap. Another thing they bought back was the frequency that rare weapons occurred in the vending machines, sometimes even Legendaries. It's well worth checking every vendor you run across! As for how it compares to Borderlands 2, there is a rather heavy emphasis on story much like that game, so if you enjoy that sort of stuff, you'd like it. In fact, as this time you're pretty much playing on the side of the villains, it has many instances where things get rather morally ambiguous, which I'm a sucker for.It is worth noting though, that this game is nowhere near as large as Borderlands 1 and 2. The main games are about the same size, but there is only 2 DLCs, one being an arena and the other being a DLC campaign. If price matters to you, wait for a sale.My overall opinion, I think it stands up pretty well to its predecessors. Give it a go!			"

Tactics are different, the story is more complex, the characters are fantastic...If you haven't played Borderlands 2 however, this is not where to pick up the story. Play BL2 first (you can skip BL1 and it's DLC if you want).			"

												Short but sweet game, and also in this horrid review.Pros-- Visually beautiful.- A few more choices for weapon types and vehicles.- The history about Jack and the 'Vault Hunters' was put in a new light how certain characters came to be. (The Hyperion Announcement voice isn't a Computer but a woman trapped in a room made to say things Jack writes, who knew?)Cons- - The outdoor exploration on Elpis was a bit tedious. Constant outlook for airpockets if you want to explore (Which is what Borderlands is well known for)- The main characters seemed to lack actual character the other two games Vault hunters had. It didn't let you immerse like the previous games and chosen character.- Most of the storyline takes place on Elpis which the areas seem all the same, just a different coloured background of space.And...- The amount of 2K Australia Aussie-like-isms is kinda shocking. Although I am a Kiwi (from New Zealand) I wasn't against it since I could understand it fine and have similarities, but I was surprised non-Aussie-Kiwi-British mates had to ask me what this and that was. Such as Billabong for Lake, Jumbuck for sheep etc.But overall, I still love the game, the price should be lower and the DLC's are alriiight. But still, if you want chocka-block of loot, a good punt with your mates on the bosses or grinder? Give this Multiplayer beaut a go.			"

												All these reviews I read with negative content are funny to me.I played it,I didn't feel at all like its just a dlc? You have whole story told,of what happened before,a whole new world new vehicle,new element,new monsters,characters with even a possibility to play handsome jack himself (well doppleganger) and the fact its in space gives it another plus.My point is,how can you even say it feels like dlc?? Did you play the borderlands 2 and 1? they are both pretty much the same I don't see why aren't you arguing over these? All of the borderlands games are just as much fun as this one ! I completed it once and now Im in the middle of completing it another time.An hell yes,I will play borderlands again after that because in my opinion these are ones of the best co-op story games I ever played. Please continue what you are doing, I love this pre-sequel and the story behind it. This is the game I can play for days without getting bored,because I love to make new characters and discover their abilities.I recommend playing as claptrap,he is really fun in my opinion.The only sad thing is that its short but still a lot of fun!

With the patch, the game works like a charm. I have to disable FXAA, but that was expected, the card is old after all.			"

												I loved Borderlands 1 and 2, so this was quite a shock. Do NOT buy this game.The combat is slow and boring, the characters are boring, the soundtrack is horribly boring, the story is boring, somehow they made the humor even worse, the guns are not satisfying to shoot, PhysX still runs like complete doo doo, missions are filled with TONS of wasted time and running around collecting seemingly useless crap.Why does this game feel so different? At its core it should be the same kind of game right? I'm baffled as to how somebody could take such a solid game series and make a sequel as awful as this. It's as if a skyscraper had its steel structure built professionally, but then the rest of the building was made by a drunk child with hot glue and popcicle sticks.It's the little things that kept me interested in the previous games. Let's be honest, Borderlands 1 and 2 made you walk around a lot and do a ton of seemingly meaningless stuff as well, but there was enough good banter over the NPC communications and enough reason to each objective to keep me pushing forward. After dying maybe 10 times from janky low gravity mechanics and then being forced to walk back across the ENTIRE map just to get where I was before I just lost all motivation to go further. The checkpoints need some serious revamping.I hate to say it, but I think everything that could have gone wrong with this game went wrong. I got the game for free with my second GTX 780 so it's not a huge loss, but it's still a massive disappointment.			"

												This game was more annoying than fun. They were trying way too hard to stereotype australians as the inhabitants of the moon. None of the new NPC characters were even remotely funny and most of the time just made me go ""God I wish you would just SHUT UP"". The new playable characters while still cool didn't bring much new to the table (also I know Claptrap is supposed to be annoying and gimmicky but they are trying way too hard with the playable claptrap). The only real highlights of the game was when old characters made an appearance (Jack, Torgue, Tina and others) and those were far and wide to come by in the game.The story doesn't add anything interesting either. Jack's road to corruption is as bland as bland comes. The new laser weapons are also terrible. The trailers made such a big deal out of these laser weapons and they function like trash.Just play Borderlands 2. Skip out on this one			"

Jumping simulatorIf you're a fan of bl2 or you're expecting it to be nearly as good as bl2,you can forget about getting this game.(Tps=the pre-sequel,bl2 =borderlands 2)Weapons:•THE PRE-SEQUEL HAS LESS GUNS THAN BL2(If Im not mistaken,there are only 4 legendarys for the shotgun),for a game that cost almost 3times the price of bl2(the game of the year edition of bl 2 cost HK68 and tps with the season pass cost HK162),this must be a joke.•The game replaced the Seraph weapons with Glitch weapons,and removed the pearlscent and E-tech weapons.Yep,they just removed it and didn't even bother to replace them.Tps did add a new type of weapon,laser which uses its own kind of ammo like shotgun and sniper,but even with the added gun type,the no. weapons in tps is still nowhere near the ones in bl2.•And the worst of all, even though they removed most of the legendarys,you still get to see the ones in bl2,just not the favorites such as infinity,norfleet,the bee...I could go on but I won't .But I could.Characters:•I will be honest,most of the newly added characters aren't nearly as lovable as the ones in bl2,some of them are even downright annoying(Far more annoying than CL4P-TP).•And the increased character dialogue really isn't helping,the character you choose basically talks too much(at least for Lady Hammerlock,I am ♥♥♥♥ing sick of hearing her brag how rich she is)•The Humor in tps is..... different from the humor in bl2(at least for me it is ),I would prefer they stick to the humor in bl2. Skills:•The character's skills are far different from bl2.In Tps you won't get to play as the siren or the gunzerker,and the character that have skills to mains sniper is locked in a dlc expansion,yep the type of character you get to play for free in bl and bl2 (Mordecai in bl and Zer0 in bl2 ) needs you to pay to play as.•Personally,I think the game encourages co-op to much,some characters have a whole page(each character has three pages of skill tree )dedicated to co-op,just look at CL4P-TP's skill tree.This wouldn't be an issue,if the game didn't cost three times as bl2,then maybe there would be more players.Campaign:•The story mission really isn't as interesting as the one in bl2 and there's only one DLC that has a story campaign(CL4P-TP's),there were 4 DLC story campaigns in bl2.Here are the reasons why I would recommend this game1.One of the key features In the tps,the low gravity level design.I have to admit,even though the levels can sometimes be frustrating,I had so much fun playing in the low gravity areas.2.You get to crush ppl with your♥♥♥♥♥BUTT SLAM )3.With the increased character dialogue,each character has his/her own unique dialogue when interacting with others.4.The Grinder-A crafting station that lets you trade up your equipment to get better equipment (for example,grinding three purple may give you a legendary ),since gearbox decreased the no.of guns,grinding for specific legendarys are easier.5.You get to play as Jack........the doppelganger.(DLC required)6.You get to play as CL4P-TPHere are the reasons why I wouldn't recommend this game1.They biggest difference of tps from bl2 is the low gravity jumping2.It cost way much when compared to bl2 which is a turn down to most bl2 fans			"

												this is by far the worst part of the borderlands trioligy. having played part 1 about 300 hours and part 2 about 400 hours, i dont feel like playing this part again after having played 4 characters to lv 15, and 1 character completing the normal mode. sure it was nice to hear about the histories of main characters in part 2; but could have seen that on youtube as well.  If this game is on your wishlist, but you havent played borderlands 1 or borderlands 2, i would suggest spending your cash on them instead.			"

It is still a ton of fun and the space element ""buttslam!"" and laser weapons (laserweapons!!) bring a nice refresh to it.  Same old familiar and loved faces and the skewed humour is still spot on.

												8.5/10 More Bordlerlands. For those of us that like that, its great news. The game is very colorful, has a good enough sense of humor, plenty of guns and interesting new characters to try out.  Especially the claptrap and jack. I haven't tried them all, but the story dialogue seems to change for difference characters.Its marketed as a pre-sequel, but the amount of content included pretty much makes this Borderlands 3. Its a full game and not a quick cash grab.  The moon setting makes it different and fun imho.  When I heard about the air-less environment I thought it would be a gimmick, but i think it works and adds to the experience. **just keep your first oz device, for the 50% reduction in O2 jump cost** I like the jump mechanic as it makes avoiding combat on foot a breeze, when you're just trying to get from point A to B without fighting every skag on the way.The last Borderlands I played was launch vanilla part 2, without ALL the dlc that came out later. So for me Pre-sequel is an awesome step up from the previous game. Maybe if you've been religiously buying all the dlc its nothing new. But for me it was.Long story short, I am loving it. Its a game you want to come back to and play til 1am. I will keep playing for a while. In addition, I got a great deal and bought the game plus the season pass for less than the full priced game alone, during the last steam sale. Wait for another one or jump right in any time. I recommend this game with a big F for FUN! "

												When i started the game with my friend, i was only a human and my friend was a robot, i was super jealous of him, throughout the whole adventure of Handsome Jack, Claptrap and I, i wanted to be a robot, levels upon levels upon levels, he was still a robot and so far i had only 1 robo arm and 1 robo leg and a laser turret on my shoulder, this was just not enough for my wisdom, why does an annoying little creature get to be a robot when i'm much cooler than him, i want to be a robot not a cyborg, once we beaten the game and did true vault hunter mode, i thought i could get more skill points and become more robot, i was getting closer to becoming a robot, i had this ability to go all shocked up when i was about to die, this was the only extra upgrade i got. im still waiting to be a robot, my claptrap friend is only getting more roboty as we venture along. alas a new dlc come out, ignoring the Jack DLC, the holodome, with UVHM, this could be the chance to become robot with my extra 10 points, my dream might finally come true, but unfortunately the only upgrade I got was to cry more tears because claptrap could be a robo-pirate, a Bomb robot and a disco robot. whilst Im still just a cyborg.Gearbox im still waiting for the be more robot DLC, i dont want no destruction of New Haven or that baroness chick, i want to be more robot and Gearbox is the only way, I need to replace my bones with metal and wire. replace my heart with motherboard.

												I've got more than 100 hours on Borderlands 2 and have played more than 5 hours on the Presequel now, and I've got to say that I enjoy playing the Presequel.  I admit that there are some aspects of the presequel that's annoying as hell, such as low gravity jumping, but the main annoying part was that I kept on landing off the map and instantly dying.  It was annoying, but it could have been prevented had I simply jumped shorter distances (aka the safer approach).   Lazers are actually not as powerful as people hype or exagerate them to be, however the Cyro element is.  Spoiler Alert: There are some bosses resistant to cyro, so it's not as game breaking and a sweep through as you think it is.Overall, I love the game and its concept regardless of that minor annoyance (because it's entirely my fault, not the game's fault).   Definite recommend, and I suggest buying only the base game when on sale.  $60 is extremely pricey, I got this for $30 knowing that there will eventually be a GOTY edition later on (it's what always happens), but hey, I wanted to play the game.  It is definitely worth $30, hell probably even $40.  We were spoiled with Borderlands 2 and it being pretty cheap.  Looking at the Presequel without comparing it to BL2, it is a very good game that has fluid controls (a little more fluid than BL2 infact), a pretty good story, a large variety of weapons to choose from, as well as very interesting gameplay.  NOTE: I have not bought or tried any of the DLC's, I was turned off by the reviews and I can understand them saying that the DLC's are fun, BUT overpriced.  I will hold off from them and I suggest that you do too until/unless there is a sale of 50% off or more on them.			"

												borderlands 1 was fantastic back in the day on the PS3, spent hundreds of hours farming crawmerax and the farmory trying to find legendarys with the best parts. The algorithm to spawn guns made almost any gun that dropped different from ones you already had, so you were constantly trying new weapons.Blands 2 was great. Different approach with boss dropping specific weapons, but still fun.This game is a grind beyond belief. The drop rates are so low that the only people who have legendarys online seem to have gibbed them. I have played however many hours to have only found 2 legendarys, one from nel and one from flameknuckle. Thats it. Nothing in the grinder, they say you can find them in the vending machines too, I say that they are fan boy liars. Borderlands 2 and 1 are fun grindy games, this is not.F U 2K			"

Product received for free
												Borderlands TPS brings a wide range of fun, adventure and inginuity to the table with their new additition to the already successful borderlands franchise. It immediately opens with an action packed starter mission and the controls are smooth and ready to be learnt easily, as well as the ongoing trend in all borderlands games is the feature of almost infinite weapons. All with 1 out of (Don't quote me on this) 8 brand names and different adjectival properties which enhances certain devices within the weapon, I have read over 17,500,000 weapons are availible (There may be more) so your bloodthirst for killing aliens with a fancy weapon is granted in thousands upon thousands of opportunities. The vanity profile is something close to me aswell, I have always loved being able to individualize your own character to prevent running into someone in multiplayer looking exactly like you. Everyone wants to stand out and give a motive of power and an impression of skill but many people have figured that earlier players focus on their cosmetics that their skill declines and the facade of skill lifts. The campaign has many missions filled with skill testing limits (I definitely recommend playing with a friend, but singleplayer is still god in itself) and if you're stuck on a level then there are even larger side quest missions to play in reward for a new gun, some money or moonstones or a vanity item. It provides an unboundable amount of fun regardless of difficulty sometimes or frustration, I still play it now and again as it never fails to provide to my seeking eye when it comes to ""action, adventure, weapons, space"" the variety of the needs people want in a game is scarce with agreement aswell as many people don't understand the cartoon-style graphics, it may put some hardcore battlefield fans off this game. But there is something for everyone here, the price of £8.99 (winter sale 2016-2017) is so generous and worth it entirely. I myself got it for free while purchasing my gaming pc, I was adamant to start the game as I was only playing minecraft. Now this game and many others changed my perspective of video gaming as a whole, I wonder what it will do to you? Amazing game 8.7/10			"

												If you enjoyed Borderlands 2 I would recommend picking this up, preferably when it's on sale. If you haven't played Borderlands 2, pick that up instead and then decide if you want to buy The Pre Sequel or not. It is essentially Borderlands 2 but on space with a few new mechanics. Its story is also shorter than BL2's, which is ironic considering the game has a bunch of padding in it. For example: missions can take a while to complete, and the final boss has 2 different stages with 3 mini stages in them. It's not a bad game, but compared to BL2 it's kind of underwhelming.			"

												So I've put some time into this game, and I can surely say that the pricetag of $60.00 is definetely not worth it. What you're basically getting when you buy this game is a shorter, and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥version of Boderlands 2. If you are new to the series, then start with BL1 or BL2, this is definetely not the game to start on, as it is the worst in the series. Don't get me wrong, the game isn't bad, it just isn't worth $60.00 and definetely doesn't live up to the expectations that I and lots of others had for it.Pros:- Very interesting and well written storyline- Playable characters talk and say different things about the story depending on what character you've chosen- Good replay value- Interesting side quests and characters- Cool looking future DLCCons:- Glitches in missions that prevent you from progressing in the story unless you join an online match- Re-named and re-skined legendaries that don't have the special effects that they had in BL2, Ex: the conference call doesn't shoot from the sides anymore it shoots as a normal shotgun would- Short storyline- Farming for legendaries isn't as strong as it was in BL2, you get them mostly out of the grinder- Connection issues where you can't connect to any games and it just keeps searching for matches in matchmakingOverall, this game is very fun and well made if not compared to BL2. In all honesty the game was a big dissapointment for me, and I would advise waiting for the christmas sales or a price drop. I would say not to go any higher than $30.00 if you really don't want to be dissapointed.			"

												BORDERLANDS: THE PRE-SEQUEL - Refined But RoughI first got into Borderlands with its sequel, Borderlands 2, and was instantly enthralled by its over-the-top personality and offbeat humor. The game had its flaws, but as I rampaged across Pandora I could feel the developers honing their craft and producing an improved product with each DLC. The gameplay got better, the locations more colorful, and the characters rounded out with greater depth and moments of honest sympathy. My hope was to see 2K take all these lessoned learned and use them to produce an absolute blockbuster Borderlands 3. Instead we have The Pre-Sequel, a game which is by no means bad, but feels like a veteran rockstar passing on his carefully tuned axe to a garage band rookie and grimacing as he stumbles over the keys. WE GET IT, YOU'RE FROM SPACE AUSTRALIAThere are a lot of things The Pre-Sequel gets right. The inventory doesn't glitch up on me. The scenery is beautiful. The low-gravity gameplay is well-designed. The vehicles are a great improvement over those from previous games. And there is a plethora of new features attached to your guns and accessories, like the Cryo element. But there are some definite problems. The biggest (for me) is combat. The careful balance 2K achieved between challenging fun and tooth-gnashing repetition has been lost as The Pre-Sequel spawns just enough enemies to make combat tedious, then spawns a bit more, and then a few more. I started to actively avoid combat as the maps--which are much smaller than in BL2--force me to revisit areas over and over to complete objectives. Another problem I had is with the laser weapons, which the game seems so impressed with that several early missions are dedicated just to introducing them over and over again. I found lasers underwhelming, and someone in 2K Australia seems to agree with me: at least two missions gave me the option to take a laser weapon or blow them up to recieve a Torgue weapon instead. Being a fan of Mister Torgue ""High Five"" Flexington and his guns, I took EXPLOSIONS every time.I also took issue with the story and characters. I like the setup of Athena re-telling the story to Lilith, Mordecai and Brick in flash-back, with many of BL2's characters piping in about the story as it goes. Unfortunately the characters in the story itself fail to leave much impact on me. Janey Springs, the ""Meriff,"" and even the game's primary antagonist Zarpedon fail to leave the impact that Tiny Tina or even Sir Hammerlock made on me in BL2. Several missions that were already a slog became absolute torture because the NPC's just wouldn't shut up, going on about Billabongs and Tuckerbags and loving the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of making Aussie slang in-jokes while I sat there running out of oxygen waiting for an objective or waypoint to be assigned so I can get on with the game.And finally there's the Jack problem. The Pre-Sequel sets the Handsome One up as a well-intentioned man slowly corrupted by betrayal and power, but this retcons the sniveling, cowardly, backstabbing schemer we KNOW Jack was long before Borderlands 1 occured. I GET wanting to see more of Jack, but he was memorable for being a truly depicable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in a series where even the protagonists aren't really ""good,"" just ""less douchey.""Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel isn't the sequel I was hoping for. That doesn't make it a bad game, and probably I'm continue playing it and buy up all the DLC to see if 2K Australia can recapture the perfect balance 2K achieved with BL2. I may be more forgiving of it if it does, but for now all I see is 2K's hard work being squandered on a team that hasn't learned the same lessons, nor have enough of its own ideas to make up for it. TL;DR Score: 6/10			"

												This is for the Borderlands fans who wanted something new. It's not really even near the sheer scale or depth of Borderlands 2, but that doesn't mean it's bad by any means. If you're a Borderlands fan and you need a new fix, then buy it. Don't expect this to be Borderlands 3, think of it more as a much needed step in between.The whole 'in space' aspect of the game is stupidly fun and gives it enough of a different feel to be refreshing, without changing the basics of the game. The characters are fantastic as always and the new vault hunters are pretty damn good too! The lasers are interesting to play with, and the new cryo element is cool.It isn't a game without it's flaws, by any means. The fact it doesn' come close to Borderlands 2 in size or variety in Legendary loot does sometimes leave you longing for more of the past games, but it's still stupidly fun. Well worth what I paid, and if you happen to find this game on sale - just buy the damn thing!My one major upset - I miss slag.			"

												So having played the original and BL2 of course I was hyped like crazy to get this. First playthrough I have to say I was a bit disheartened. The story itself felt kinda like it fell flat. Then again, I practically blazed through, skipping almost all of the sidequests, because I was really focused entirely on the storyline. I wanted to know the lore, the reasons behind Handsome Jack, one of the best villians in any game anywhere. I beat the game and it felt pretty dumb.And god those Space Australians ARE annoying. But... read on.I started my 2nd playthrough. Not really sure why. Maybe I just love the pain. Maybe there's something just too fun about playing an intergalactic cowgirl blasting the crap out of anything. Anyway, on my 2nd playthrough I could really just tune out the story, aside from the hilarious quips and Jack being Jack.That's when I realized, I was really playing this game for all the wrong reasons. Borderlands has never had the most solid lore. Why was I playing a game known for not having lore for the lore? Do I go see Michael Bay movies for the plot? Nope. It's literally about loot, guns, and EXPLOSIONS. I started noticing the developers threw in a lot of stuff that simply improved on Borderlands 2 as well. Loot was rare still but not so rare that you couldn't go get something if you wanted it without killing the same boss 10,000 times. There are a few glitches which seem intentional by the developers. Not like exploits, but more like cheat codes that actually take some effort on your part to pull off or at least a friend to help you. Still it reminded me of a time when games were really more about one thing, having fun. You can play the way you want to play.The core gameplay is actually incredibly well thought out and developed. Example: Want to ride around in a vehicle with your friend? You can do that. Want to split off and everyone have their own vehicle? You can do that too. Lost your vehicle? You can spawn one from your friend's vehicle. It's the little things that make this game a real gem.The first playthrough seems like cake because it's easy mode. 2nd playthrough is where it becomes tons of fun. Don't be afraid of the group finder if you're solo, it's a multiplayer game for a reason. The more I play this game the more I love it.Update 12/18/2014:So seeing the Jack Doppleganger pack got me to buy the season pass and for awhile I really was happy with this game. Then for whatever reason the developers behind this game started throwing out nerfs. Nerf the difficult to get overpowered gear, in a game where being overpowered is really the only ultimate goal and doesn't affect anyone but you. Nerf to looting in a game about loot with no fix to many of the loot drops being one time drops.Ugh. Terrible. Okay well, I don't use a lot of that overpowered gear anyway, can I keep playing the game when DLC hits and enjoy that at least?The new arena must have taken one person about an hour to throw together. No new music, the new loot is terrible an unusable, no new enemies, not even half the enemies in the game actually make it in. As Moxxi says 'Seriously?!'It makes me sad to do this since I've always been a fan of Borderlands but this gets a solid downvote. In other news, if you love borderlands as I do, TTG's Tales from the Borderlands is awesome.			"

												Borderlands: The Pre-Sqeuel, the boring ""half-MMORPG""It's basically a 50 euro expansion, because i just don't think there is enough (new) content to call this a game on it's own.I know i may sound like an angry ranting kid but its because i'm so disappointed by how this game turned out.I loved the fast-paced combat and the ""adventure-y"" feel of Borderlands (1) and the game in general (i have played probably several hundred hours of it outside of steam). I liked Borderlands 2, although not as much and not for the same reasons obviously, and only to about lvl 35 (although i got to lvl 63 i didnt enjoy it and only did it because i, for some reason, wanted to get to lvl 72).This, however is just... trash, or a simple cash grab.This game has a more serious tone than its predecessors, which really doesnt work well with all the bad jokes they cram into it, especially the meme-jokes. I dont really think the seriousness fits the borderlands atmosphere in general.They ♥♥♥♥ed up the characters. For example both Moxxy and Lilith are just bossy and ♥♥♥♥♥y, theyre not Moxxy and Lilith. They even had to ♥♥♥♥ up Mr Torgue.The new characters are just annoying and bland, not funny or special in any way. Both Nina and that pesky kid are just annoying clichés that make me wanna bash their heads in whenever they talk.If this game is supposed to tell us how Jack became the person he was in BL2 it doesnt do a very good job. Sure, Jack is sort of a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when you first meet him, but after one certain ""event"" he becomes a psycho and sort of hates everyone. But he's not consistent; he sometimes starts caring in his own way only to switch back to a psycho the next time he talks without anything really happening inbetween.Besides, he should already be sort of a psychopath when you first meet him since he among other things imprisoned Angel before even the first Borderlands (listen to all the ECHO recordings in this game and BL2 and you'll notice that he did evil things before even this game). Speaking of, where is Angel?There seems to be plot holes, inconsistencies and quite a few things left unexplained. It sometimes feel as if theyve skipped parts of the story or rushed them, which doesnt make sense since it's already too short.The playable characters however are sort of good, as characters, but still feel underdeveloped. However what they say sometimes seem out of place, as if they were meant to answer something else, or they just sound weird.The new skill trees are bland, unimaginative and full of skills that grant you stacks of something or gives you a stat boost after you reload your gun or make an enemy bleed, or something like that. It doesn't feel like it makes a big difference and just doesn't feel worthwhile.The whole game has some sort of social justice warrior attitude. I thought games were supposed to be fun and interesting, not about having political opinions shoved in your face. Even if it was, I really dont think this is the kind of game to do it in. (Sometimes it stinks of ""If you don't think like us youre an ignorant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"", which is pretty ironic, and just childish.)They even had to come up with lame replacements for ""bad words"". If we're ok with killing thousands of people and animals i dont think we'll freak out because of some swearing or Jack saying ""♥♥♥♥♥"" (as in ""son of a ..."").Oh, and the gender focus, just drop it already! Sometimes the whole game feels like some kind of  propaganda.The maps dont have enough New-U stations, and youre gonna die a lot, not just because of the enemies but because of the bugs and poor vehicle handling.Everything feels grindy and repetitive, especially since youre forced to walk long distances pretty often just to fetch a certain item or kill # amount of enemies just to go straight back afterwards.Enemies can spawn 5 meters in front of you, in plain sight!Old bugs from Borderlands 2 are in this game. That's just lazy...The environments all look the same. I know the moon is basically a lifeless rock but they should be able to come up with something else except rocks and lava.The novelty of low gravity and the ""oz kits"" wears off quickly. It feels as if youre moving in slow motion and if you jump and use the oz kit to propel forward your just gonna run out of air quickly and youre making yourself an extremely easy target for anyone with a gun. I stopped using it in combat after a while because i would almost always die while trying to butt slam enemies.Writing is just bad, bland and often cheesy. Barely any funny jokes. Its mostly just ""politically correct"", childish and worn out jokes that just aren't funny and you can often see them coming miles away. The worst part with this is that the game thinks its sooo funny when it really isn't, and that tone becomes very annoying.It seems that you will only understand some jokes if you live in australia or are familiar with australian culture. I think that was a stupid decision since, i believe, most players wont understand them.Fetch quests...(I know there were fetch quests in the other games but they were not as simple, tedious and repetitive as in this game.)The objects you have to fetch are often placed in opposite corners of the map that you cant reach with the vehicles, making it take even longer to complete them. Like someone else wrote; theyve decided to make every mission like that ""Fire cult"" mission-line in BL2.Backtracking, way too much, way too often.It's as if this series is slowly changing into an MMO. Missions are boring and generic. Guns are weak and enemies can take a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of damage. I sometimes found myself trying to avoid combat because its so slow and its as if i have to shoot even common/normal enemies 30 times in the face to kill them. I HATE bullet sponges, it makes combat extremely boring, no matter what game we're talking about.I dont really understand why ""fight for your life"" is in the game anymore, every enemy just runs away as soon as you enter it, almost like a child running away from you screaming ""ha, ha! You cant catch me"" after shooting you in the knees. Dont get me wrong i like the concept and mechanic, but it is useless when every enemy quickly runs away and hides as soon as you enter fight for your life.Enemies with railguns or beam guns kill you in about 2 seconds, literally!Loot drops are uncommon, and good loot, blue or better, is very rare (or i was just very unlucky) making the enemies take even longer to kill. Like someone said; it doesnt matter if you have 87 bazillion guns if you only get 60 of them.As i wrote before; the guns are weak, and it seems they buffed recoil on every gun, after a few shots you cant even hit a mech standing 6m away making gatling guns, assault rifles and most SMGs basically useless in most situations. Accuracy overall seems to be reduced as well, a gun with 90 accuracy in this game is like a gun with around 75-80 in BL2.Potential Spoilers- The worst ending in any video game ive played, a pathetic cliché. It's as if theyre trying to open up for a crappy, generic, ""good vs evil"" sci-fi MMO. This is what♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off the most, beyond words.- WTF did they do to the eridian guardians? They look like something out of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anime! Besides, i thought they were supposed to be guardians of the vaults not some ♥♥♥♥ing ""defenders against evil"". Why did this change?- The last boss was just too easy and unimaginative, and, imo, belonged more in a fantasy universe than borderlands (I actually think i've seen something very much like it in another game, cant remember which, though). Weirdly enough the boss before the last one was the hardest, and it was too hard (it carpet bombed the whole arena).The only things i liked about this game is that the player characters actually talk, the laser guns, and the cryo-guns (which, imo, should have been in BL2 instead of slag).

												I uninstalled this game.I've currently spent 438 hours on Borderlands 2.I spent 17 hours on Borderlands: The Pre-Sequal.Borderlands: The Pre-Sequal is the worst game I have ever played. And I'll admit I don't play a lot of games;I am usually content with the decisions I make when I purchasing games. This however, was the first and last straw - when I pre-ordered this game I put my faith in the company to produce me with an enjoyable experience, even if it wasn't to the same extent of Borderlands 2 - it HAD to be enjoyable. I expected an average game and decent amount of content - and this was a mistake on my part and flat out terrible consumer practice. I regret every cent I put towards Borderlands: The Pre-Sequal and the decision made now feels like a cascading nightmare upon my reality.It has become abundantly clear that the developers involved are hell bent on poor business practices. Ripping off consumers by stripping game content to then later sell as ""DLC"". It is blindingly obvious in this game that is already over priced for the amount of content you receive.The truth about this game is that it is Borderlands 2 with its very soul ripped out. If you like Borderlands or want to see what a good borderlands game is like buy / continue playing Borderlands 2. There is absolutly no reason to buy this game over borderlands 2. Otherwise keep clear of these games and be very cynical of developers like 2K Australia (Games) and Gearbox Software.  They have lost another consumer, my deprived wallet will no longer support your bad practices and games. Good riddance.﻿ "

												People called Borderlands 2 ""Borderlands 1.5"". However, comparing BL2 to the Pre-Sequel, this title fits in way more snug with this title.Pros:- Good Story- Fan Favourite Characters- Witty Dialogue- Dark Humour is on Point- Great new playable charactersSo, basically ever Borderlands game so far.Cons:- Copy and Paste of Borderlands 2To expand on this, look at the similarities between Concordia and Sanctuary. They are basically the SAME ♥♥♥♥ING PLACE. Both has a Moxxi's Bar (Moxxi really could've been kept out of this game, she sticks out like a sore thumb), both have the same bland NPCs that walk around and the only difference is the Grinder in Concordia.- They Ruined JackI love Handsome Jack, he kicked ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥in BL2. We LOVED to hate him. His inclusion was warranted, it put ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fan theories at rest, but it took his teeth away a bit... :/ Does anyone else feel like this? Also hearing Jack caring about innocent lives on Elpis and not wanting to kill people was... Disturbing.- You Dun Goofed The FarmingGearbox nerfed our only way of making an endgame. This then leads on to the next con...- You Dun Goofed The DLCSo, TPS launched with no Endgame, so gamers made one: farming Iwajira and the like. Then, Gearbox TOOK thay away, and are now charging you for farming and gaining levels in the new Holodome DLC. I love the Borderlands franchise, BUT COME ON GEARBOX.Overall Verdict:7.5/10 - It's like a Borderlands 2 Chinese knock off. Thankfully, I bought it at half price and not at the full 30 quid it asked for.Greedy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I have many conflicting emotions after finishing this game. These are caused by pros & cons which are visible throughout the gameplay. I'll start with cons, ending up with pros.Cons:- Price of the game :This is a tough one because I know that the company has a right to evaluate their product according to what they think. However, since I'm a customer, I feel quite robbed, knowing that the same amount of money I paid for Borderlands 2 was spent better as the previous game provided the players with much more content.- The game is much shorter than Borderlands 2.I think it didn't take me more than two 10-hour-sittings to finish this game together with all DLCs and side quests. This is a considerable flaw because in the previous game, due to the amount of locations and characters, there was so much more to do.- Smaller variety of locations.The difference is vast. Borderlands 2 provided the player with dead sands, frozen wastes, highlands, volcanic areas, underground mines and that was only the main game. I'll skip the DLCs of BL2. In the Pre-Sequel, there's moon, moon, moon, moon, moon and Hyperion Space Station.- Fewer quests.I think that with big areas provided by developers there should be more quests connected with, I don't know, killing things like Shuggaraths or Rathyds, anything it's easy to come up with such side quests.- Raid Bosses are almost non-existant when compared to Borderlands 2.One Raidboss... Just why, this hurts me more than anything else. There are also three-in-one raid in the DLC but since it's one after another, I count it as one.- Holodrome DLC.Holodome DLC has nothing to offer apart from short dialogues and mindless shooting for crappy loot. The arena is big and it takes more time to find the monsters than killing them. The music there is mind-numbing.- Other annoyances.What I was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off by was the fact that there were no fast-travel stations at some locations. From what I see it was a trick to prolong the gameplay in the most boring way possible.It drives me nuts to see that the Borderlands team did not learn the fact that the dialogues get interrupted by everything. I mean, for the love of God, is there one person who didn't have his or her dialogue cut in the middle by some useless inspire skill or random, nonsense character? I picked echo and was interrupted by Nurse Nina the second after, makes by blood boil.Lesser variery of enemies to kill. Where are goliaths, one-handed scavs, or anything?  I found myself fighting the lost legion and scavs for 85% of the game if not more.Bugs, slowdown bug after leaving the vehicle bursted my veins wide open, lack of attention to model hitboxes was also discouraging and often ended in death or falling down some hole.Pros:- Main story:Although it started rather slowly and ended abruptly, the story is great, the plot-twists, it makes you yearn fore more. I still wait for the thread connected with Angel and Jack's wife as it is significant to completion.- Baroness, Jack and Claptrap DLC:These DLCs are done with attention to detail. Sometimes you'll just want to check the way your character responds to the events. As for Claptrap DLC, it fills a gap for why the Claptrap production line suddenly disappeared.- Characters speak:I think it's a nice addition, to know what your character things of certain situations.-Buttslams and gravity:I loved the idea of sudden slam and watching the enemies fly out of the map, juicy, sweet. The flaw is that it deals low damage at later stages.- Bosses:A big step up, even though there are so few, they are so well done, the cinematics and the models, sounds, everything, lovely areas and graphics.- Hyperion StationI loved the idea of showing the Hyperion Station and its founders, it fills the informational gap. I also loved the R&D area, animal reserve area for its design, ideas of artificial lighting and fake environment are well perserved.Overall :I wouldn't recommend the game because of the current price. Sorry. I'm certain that the developers could have done more in terms of areas or enemies, bosses, quests.I bought this game during Steam Summer Sale on -72% with Season Pass and for 23.23€ which felt like the right price.

												If you are new to the Borderlands franchise, gtfo and buy BL2. If you have completed BL2, I still don't think this game is worth buying UNLESS it is discounted for 70%+. In my first playthrough, I got less than 15-20 hours with some sidequests, yet in BL2 u get twice as much (but nothing compares to BL2). The gameplay itself feels no different to BL2, despite the new mechanic of the 'Butt-slam' and low-grav. You never really find yourself running out of O2 and the Butt-slam is worthless. You may as well be trying to kill people with Zer0's unforseen if you want to use this mechanic lethally.Pros:-New weapon type (it's exciting until you actually try it and you're like....oh....)-New element-New characters (Claptrap!)-Finally we get the Moon dlc we've always wantedCons:-Short as ♥♥♥♥-Reused models (probably the biggest part of this game after completion besides replaying is hunting down uniques)-None of the new features (low-grav, cryo, lazers) are actually good, they're just enticing-Raid-boss mission after the main story is just the last boss again (laziness)-Barely any areas (although most are pretty big, around Wildlife Exploitation size)-Character to character interactivity is crappy (maybe Claptrap is an exception)I wouldn't recommend buying this game at all unless it was on sale.

												8.5/10 More Bordlerlands. For those of us that like that, its great news. The game is very colorful, has a good enough sense of humor, plenty of guns and interesting new characters to try out.  Especially the claptrap and jack. I haven't tried them all, but the story dialogue seems to change for difference characters.Its marketed as a pre-sequel, but the amount of content included pretty much makes this Borderlands 3. Its a full game and not a quick cash grab.  The moon setting makes it different and fun imho.  When I heard about the air-less environment I thought it would be a gimmick, but i think it works and adds to the experience. **just keep your first oz device, for the 50% reduction in O2 jump cost** I like the jump mechanic as it makes avoiding combat on foot a breeze, when you're just trying to get from point A to B without fighting every skag on the way.The last Borderlands I played was launch vanilla part 2, without ALL the dlc that came out later. So for me Pre-sequel is an awesome step up from the previous game. Maybe if you've been religiously buying all the dlc its nothing new. But for me it was.Long story short, I am loving it. Its a game you want to come back to and play til 1am. I will keep playing for a while. In addition, I got a great deal and bought the game plus the season pass for less than the full priced game alone, during the last steam sale. Wait for another one or jump right in any time. I recommend this game with a big F for FUN! "

												Blah blah blah ""I hate its pricing"" blah blah blah ""season pass didn't live up to my expectations"" blah blah blah ""It's like Borderlands 2, but not as good as it!"" blah blah blahIf you read this far, but you somehow don't mind the above statement or the numerous negative reviews about this game, congratulations: you're either not a hardcore fan of the series, or you're in the very small minority who thinks TPS is actually good or even better (gasp!) than the rest of the Borderlands series thus far.It's buggy, it's imbalanced, it's inconsistent. But I found the base game to be a whole lot more fun than base BL2 with the 500+ hours I registered in that. It's a bit of a slice, or a mixture between BL1 and BL2 in terms of loot, scaling, and environmental theme (desolation and being acquainted/sick of it).Each and every one of the playable characters are simply the most well-crafted ones of the series as of now, in both character and gameplay. Double-jumping jetpacks with low gravity and slam attacks is a fun combo for additional combat mechanics to the BL2 formula (but nobody likes the fuel system) while being a more active ""artifact/relic"" system. Vendors are a bit more useful now with higher legendary rates, although not as good as BL1 vendors. Laser weapons are better (and ultimately more varied) iterations on BL1 eridian and BL2 e-tech weapons. Cryo is a better, more balanced support element than BL1 corrosive and BL2 slag. Grinder is a good idea in theory (a sort of halfway mark to full-on crafting), but has terrible content and output. Luneshine adds a second type of mod upgrade to weapons, so there's more grind to get that perfect equipment. The loot and enemy scaling aren't as crazy as BL2, and that includes Ultimate Vault Hunter difficulty. It was nice to have that desolated wasteland feeling of BL1, while looking like a pretty wasteland bathed in cool-temperature tones (Seriously, stop to smell the roses and look up sometimes).Take all of that, and keep it for the next Borderlands game. Or retrofit it into BL2. The rest of TPS isn't as fun. The problem with TPS difficulty isn't because of the scaling, but because of the enemy variety and AIs. They don't do the low-gravity jetpack gameplay any justice. No amount of health/elemental sponging will make the difficulty any better (which is a severe flaw with BL2). I like the idea of an anti-hero and a hero-to-villain story, but the execution was lacking.It's hard for me to recommend replaying TPS for progression, but then again, it's hard for me to recommend replaying ANY of the Borderlands games for any sort of progression, as they're all absolutely dreadful. The entire series in general is not worth any sort of ""Best Of"" accolades. It's a good series, especially for mindless co-op play (It's how I was able to rack up the play hours; I have many Steam friends who constantly played BL2 back then), and I definitely would like to play more. But it's not worth putting on a pedestal, much less using it as an example of pushing the industry forward.Do I recommend this game? If you care about your money/time, I'd say wait for a comfortable range and play it once to see how it is, then decide for yourself if you want to commit time to it. What if you have both? Sure, I recommend it. Because it's fun if you let it. At least it was for me, and it's my favorite of the series at the moment.Does that make me a terrible reviewer? Let me tell you that I think Bioshock 2 is the best of the Bioshock series, and that Majora's Mask is superior to Ocarina of Time.TPS used less reusable assets than those. And I hate farming.EDIT: Oh, but keep the Claptrap DLC. Reminds me how Minerva's Den DLC scored big for Bioshock 2.			"

I expected an average game and decent amount of content - and this was a mistake on my part and flat out terrible consumer practice. I regret every cent I put towards Borderlands: The Pre-Sequal and the decision made now feels like a cascading nightmare upon my reality.It has become abundantly clear that the developers involved are hell bent on poor business practices. Ripping off consumers by stripping game content to then later sell as ""DLC"". It is blindingly obvious in this game that is already over priced for the amount of content you receive.The truth about this game is that it is Borderlands 2 with its very soul ripped out. If you like Borderlands or want to see what a good borderlands game is like buy / continue playing Borderlands 2. There is absolutly no reason to buy this game over borderlands 2. Otherwise keep clear of these games and be very cynical of developers like 2K Australia (Games) and Gearbox Software.  They have lost another consumer, my deprived wallet will no longer support your bad practices and games. Good riddance.﻿ "

												8.5/10 More Bordlerlands. For those of us that like that, its great news. The game is very colorful, has a good enough sense of humor, plenty of guns and interesting new characters to try out.  Especially the claptrap and jack. I haven't tried them all, but the story dialogue seems to change for difference characters.Its marketed as a pre-sequel, but the amount of content included pretty much makes this Borderlands 3. Its a full game and not a quick cash grab.  The moon setting makes it different and fun imho.  When I heard about the air-less environment I thought it would be a gimmick, but i think it works and adds to the experience. **just keep your first oz device, for the 50% reduction in O2 jump cost** I like the jump mechanic as it makes avoiding combat on foot a breeze, when you're just trying to get from point A to B without fighting every skag on the way.The last Borderlands I played was launch vanilla part 2, without ALL the dlc that came out later. So for me Pre-sequel is an awesome step up from the previous game. Maybe if you've been religiously buying all the dlc its nothing new. But for me it was.Long story short, I am loving it. Its a game you want to come back to and play til 1am. I will keep playing for a while. In addition, I got a great deal and bought the game plus the season pass for less than the full priced game alone, during the last steam sale. Wait for another one or jump right in any time. I recommend this game with a big F for FUN! "

												When i started the game with my friend, i was only a human and my friend was a robot, i was super jealous of him, throughout the whole adventure of Handsome Jack, Claptrap and I, i wanted to be a robot, levels upon levels upon levels, he was still a robot and so far i had only 1 robo arm and 1 robo leg and a laser turret on my shoulder, this was just not enough for my wisdom, why does an annoying little creature get to be a robot when i'm much cooler than him, i want to be a robot not a cyborg, once we beaten the game and did true vault hunter mode, i thought i could get more skill points and become more robot, i was getting closer to becoming a robot, i had this ability to go all shocked up when i was about to die, this was the only extra upgrade i got. im still waiting to be a robot, my claptrap friend is only getting more roboty as we venture along. alas a new dlc come out, ignoring the Jack DLC, the holodome, with UVHM, this could be the chance to become robot with my extra 10 points, my dream might finally come true, but unfortunately the only upgrade I got was to cry more tears because claptrap could be a robo-pirate, a Bomb robot and a disco robot. whilst Im still just a cyborg.Gearbox im still waiting for the be more robot DLC, i dont want no destruction of New Haven or that baroness chick, i want to be more robot and Gearbox is the only way, I need to replace my bones with metal and wire. replace my heart with motherboard.

												I've got more than 100 hours on Borderlands 2 and have played more than 5 hours on the Presequel now, and I've got to say that I enjoy playing the Presequel.  I admit that there are some aspects of the presequel that's annoying as hell, such as low gravity jumping, but the main annoying part was that I kept on landing off the map and instantly dying.  It was annoying, but it could have been prevented had I simply jumped shorter distances (aka the safer approach).   Lazers are actually not as powerful as people hype or exagerate them to be, however the Cyro element is.  Spoiler Alert: There are some bosses resistant to cyro, so it's not as game breaking and a sweep through as you think it is.Overall, I love the game and its concept regardless of that minor annoyance (because it's entirely my fault, not the game's fault).   Definite recommend, and I suggest buying only the base game when on sale.  $60 is extremely pricey, I got this for $30 knowing that there will eventually be a GOTY edition later on (it's what always happens), but hey, I wanted to play the game.  It is definitely worth $30, hell probably even $40.  We were spoiled with Borderlands 2 and it being pretty cheap.  Looking at the Presequel without comparing it to BL2, it is a very good game that has fluid controls (a little more fluid than BL2 infact), a pretty good story, a large variety of weapons to choose from, as well as very interesting gameplay.  NOTE: I have not bought or tried any of the DLC's, I was turned off by the reviews and I can understand them saying that the DLC's are fun, BUT overpriced.  I will hold off from them and I suggest that you do too until/unless there is a sale of 50% off or more on them.			"

												If you are a fan of the Borderlands series, you will love this game. It does not break the mold, just more of the same fun stuff Borderlands is famous for. Nothing groundbreaking, but the low gravity in this game makes it a little more interesting. Some folks have dogged it for more of the same, but some of us enjoy that. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. "

Posted: November 3, 2014
												Borderlands: The Pre-Sqeuel, the boring ""half-MMORPG""It's basically a 50 euro expansion, because i just don't think there is enough (new) content to call this a game on it's own.I know i may sound like an angry ranting kid but its because i'm so disappointed by how this game turned out.I loved the fast-paced combat and the ""adventure-y"" feel of Borderlands (1) and the game in general (i have played probably several hundred hours of it outside of steam). I liked Borderlands 2, although not as much and not for the same reasons obviously, and only to about lvl 35 (although i got to lvl 63 i didnt enjoy it and only did it because i, for some reason, wanted to get to lvl 72).This, however is just... trash, or a simple cash grab.This game has a more serious tone than its predecessors, which really doesnt work well with all the bad jokes they cram into it, especially the meme-jokes. I dont really think the seriousness fits the borderlands atmosphere in general.They ♥♥♥♥ed up the characters. For example both Moxxy and Lilith are just bossy and ♥♥♥♥♥y, theyre not Moxxy and Lilith. They even had to ♥♥♥♥ up Mr Torgue.The new characters are just annoying and bland, not funny or special in any way. Both Nina and that pesky kid are just annoying clichés that make me wanna bash their heads in whenever they talk.If this game is supposed to tell us how Jack became the person he was in BL2 it doesnt do a very good job. Sure, Jack is sort of a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when you first meet him, but after one certain ""event"" he becomes a psycho and sort of hates everyone. But he's not consistent; he sometimes starts caring in his own way only to switch back to a psycho the next time he talks without anything really happening inbetween.Besides, he should already be sort of a psychopath when you first meet him since he among other things imprisoned Angel before even the first Borderlands (listen to all the ECHO recordings in this game and BL2 and you'll notice that he did evil things before even this game). Speaking of, where is Angel?There seems to be plot holes, inconsistencies and quite a few things left unexplained. It sometimes feel as if theyve skipped parts of the story or rushed them, which doesnt make sense since it's already too short.The playable characters however are sort of good, as characters, but still feel underdeveloped. However what they say sometimes seem out of place, as if they were meant to answer something else, or they just sound weird.The new skill trees are bland, unimaginative and full of skills that grant you stacks of something or gives you a stat boost after you reload your gun or make an enemy bleed, or something like that. It doesn't feel like it makes a big difference and just doesn't feel worthwhile.The whole game has some sort of social justice warrior attitude. I thought games were supposed to be fun and interesting, not about having political opinions shoved in your face. Even if it was, I really dont think this is the kind of game to do it in. (Sometimes it stinks of ""If you don't think like us youre an ignorant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"", which is pretty ironic, and just childish.)They even had to come up with lame replacements for ""bad words"". If we're ok with killing thousands of people and animals i dont think we'll freak out because of some swearing or Jack saying ""♥♥♥♥♥"" (as in ""son of a ..."").Oh, and the gender focus, just drop it already! Sometimes the whole game feels like some kind of  propaganda.The maps dont have enough New-U stations, and youre gonna die a lot, not just because of the enemies but because of the bugs and poor vehicle handling.Everything feels grindy and repetitive, especially since youre forced to walk long distances pretty often just to fetch a certain item or kill # amount of enemies just to go straight back afterwards.Enemies can spawn 5 meters in front of you, in plain sight!Old bugs from Borderlands 2 are in this game. That's just lazy...The environments all look the same. I know the moon is basically a lifeless rock but they should be able to come up with something else except rocks and lava.The novelty of low gravity and the ""oz kits"" wears off quickly. It feels as if youre moving in slow motion and if you jump and use the oz kit to propel forward your just gonna run out of air quickly and youre making yourself an extremely easy target for anyone with a gun. I stopped using it in combat after a while because i would almost always die while trying to butt slam enemies.Writing is just bad, bland and often cheesy. Barely any funny jokes. Its mostly just ""politically correct"", childish and worn out jokes that just aren't funny and you can often see them coming miles away. The worst part with this is that the game thinks its sooo funny when it really isn't, and that tone becomes very annoying.It seems that you will only understand some jokes if you live in australia or are familiar with australian culture. I think that was a stupid decision since, i believe, most players wont understand them.Fetch quests...(I know there were fetch quests in the other games but they were not as simple, tedious and repetitive as in this game.)The objects you have to fetch are often placed in opposite corners of the map that you cant reach with the vehicles, making it take even longer to complete them. Like someone else wrote; theyve decided to make every mission like that ""Fire cult"" mission-line in BL2.Backtracking, way too much, way too often.It's as if this series is slowly changing into an MMO. Missions are boring and generic. Guns are weak and enemies can take a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of damage. I sometimes found myself trying to avoid combat because its so slow and its as if i have to shoot even common/normal enemies 30 times in the face to kill them. I HATE bullet sponges, it makes combat extremely boring, no matter what game we're talking about.I dont really understand why ""fight for your life"" is in the game anymore, every enemy just runs away as soon as you enter it, almost like a child running away from you screaming ""ha, ha! You cant catch me"" after shooting you in the knees. Dont get me wrong i like the concept and mechanic, but it is useless when every enemy quickly runs away and hides as soon as you enter fight for your life.Enemies with railguns or beam guns kill you in about 2 seconds, literally!Loot drops are uncommon, and good loot, blue or better, is very rare (or i was just very unlucky) making the enemies take even longer to kill. Like someone said; it doesnt matter if you have 87 bazillion guns if you only get 60 of them.As i wrote before; the guns are weak, and it seems they buffed recoil on every gun, after a few shots you cant even hit a mech standing 6m away making gatling guns, assault rifles and most SMGs basically useless in most situations. Accuracy overall seems to be reduced as well, a gun with 90 accuracy in this game is like a gun with around 75-80 in BL2.Potential Spoilers- The worst ending in any video game ive played, a pathetic cliché. It's as if theyre trying to open up for a crappy, generic, ""good vs evil"" sci-fi MMO. This is what♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off the most, beyond words.- WTF did they do to the eridian guardians? They look like something out of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anime! Besides, i thought they were supposed to be guardians of the vaults not some ♥♥♥♥ing ""defenders against evil"". Why did this change?- The last boss was just too easy and unimaginative, and, imo, belonged more in a fantasy universe than borderlands (I actually think i've seen something very much like it in another game, cant remember which, though). Weirdly enough the boss before the last one was the hardest, and it was too hard (it carpet bombed the whole arena).The only things i liked about this game is that the player characters actually talk, the laser guns, and the cryo-guns (which, imo, should have been in BL2 instead of slag).

												People called Borderlands 2 ""Borderlands 1.5"". However, comparing BL2 to the Pre-Sequel, this title fits in way more snug with this title.Pros:- Good Story- Fan Favourite Characters- Witty Dialogue- Dark Humour is on Point- Great new playable charactersSo, basically ever Borderlands game so far.Cons:- Copy and Paste of Borderlands 2To expand on this, look at the similarities between Concordia and Sanctuary. They are basically the SAME ♥♥♥♥ING PLACE. Both has a Moxxi's Bar (Moxxi really could've been kept out of this game, she sticks out like a sore thumb), both have the same bland NPCs that walk around and the only difference is the Grinder in Concordia.- They Ruined JackI love Handsome Jack, he kicked ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥in BL2. We LOVED to hate him. His inclusion was warranted, it put ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fan theories at rest, but it took his teeth away a bit... :/ Does anyone else feel like this? Also hearing Jack caring about innocent lives on Elpis and not wanting to kill people was... Disturbing.- You Dun Goofed The FarmingGearbox nerfed our only way of making an endgame. This then leads on to the next con...- You Dun Goofed The DLCSo, TPS launched with no Endgame, so gamers made one: farming Iwajira and the like. Then, Gearbox TOOK thay away, and are now charging you for farming and gaining levels in the new Holodome DLC. I love the Borderlands franchise, BUT COME ON GEARBOX.Overall Verdict:7.5/10 - It's like a Borderlands 2 Chinese knock off. Thankfully, I bought it at half price and not at the full 30 quid it asked for.Greedy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												A really good game for the whole Borderlands series plot-wise (story-wise). I really enjoyed the story and how it was mixed with the Tales From Borderlands. As a true fan of Borderlands franchise, I can say that The Pre-Sequel is a good installment into the series, though I understand why it receives so much hate from gamers.Why so much hate?!First of all, the story is fairly short and there are not many playable dlcs, therefore the gameplay gets monotonous very quickly. It gets really frustrating to level up one character from level 40 to 70 when you already played the story 2 times and xp gain from turning in missions and killing enemies does not significantly increase as you level up. So either you play the story for 2-3 times again or spawn kill guardians or threshers (spoilers).Basically the main hate comes, because the pre-sequel does not meet the expectations after the Borderlands 2 and only one Claptastic Voyage dlc does not make the game as replayable as the Borderlands 2.Nevertheless, it has some really good features!Playing on the moon is really cool and new to the franchise what was rather enjoyable experience. The more appreciated thing in the game was the main characters and how much you get to know them with individual dialogues (YES, EACH PLAYABLE CHARACTER HAS UNIQUE LINES THROUGOUT THE WHOLE STORY). This makes the game more lively when characters interacts more during missions (unlike in Borderlands 2). Characters are great with individual skill trees and abilities (worth trying all of them).All in all, the game is not even close to the Borderlands 2 (which is one of the best adventure shooters ever made), but for a franchise fan this installment has to be obtained. The story is intriguing, and you have to play a bad guy, what is different in the Borderlands games. Anyway 8/10 because it hyped me a lot for Borderlands 3, which I believe is gonna be something like Borderlands 2 or even better!!!BONZA! "

												Well, where to start, the annoying australian accents on everyone, it was cute at first but eventually you get a headache.  The game in my opinion wasnt finished,  when playing the slots they were so blurry you couldnt see what was coming up until the grenade dropped in front of you in any case then its too late to run and with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ shield i had i was toast.  so i died in the bar playing slots.  Borderlands 2 plus the lack of gravity, although a novelty at first it becomes annoying when you over jump something  then have to run to an air pocket because you are down to 25%. Makes it difficult to do quests, so i ended up leaving them till i had a bigger air supply.  Luckily i got the game on sale for $29.00, the game isnt worth the 60 bucks they were asking and personally i think it shoulda been an add-on to B2.   If anyone has any questions feel free to ask, im a B2 fan and im not impressed			"

Granted, his voice acting is MUCH better, and they even throw in a few quirks (he's afraid of heights,) it still doesn't make up for the fact that the game is BOOORING! I LOVED all the Borderlands games, and I seriously wanted to give this game a chance, but towards the end, I just did the bare minimum to beat the game since A) the story is not good B) the sidequests are unispired and don't add much to the lore/story.Go ahead and replay Borderlands 2. If you want it to look like the Pre Sequel, invert the colors and make a few ""PEW"" sounds.			"

												I totally love the Borderlands series, having invested over 600+ hours and counting in Borderlands 2. I love the artwork, humor, dialogue, quirky characters, and the GUNS. Borderlands 2 was one of the best games I've ever played and will always hold a special place in my heart.However, this review is not on Borderlands 2, but on Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. Yes, it has incurred a ton of criticism for not being as large as Borderlands 2, falling short in places, and it retaining most of the gameplay features and mechanics from Borderlands 2. However, this was to be expected. Gearbox Software had repeatedly stated that Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel would not be as large as Borderlands 2 and would be built off of it, being more of an ""extended"" expansion pack. In addition, the development cycle for the Pre-Sequel was only 2 years, and it would certainly be tough to craft an entirely new game that would wow fans and blow them off their seats at E3.Despite that, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel has some flaws that cannot be denied. (Let's go look at the cons first)1) The unbelievable price tag. Although this game is certainly good and it would be a great thing to support the devs, I feel like forking out $60 USD is definitely not worth the content. Even worse, if you wanted to grab the Season Pass with all the DLC, the price would be even higher. For a game that doesn't contain that much material and substance as Borderlands 2, I find that unacceptable. I bought the Pre-Sequel + The Season Pass bundle for around $25 and I find that a much better buy that is worth the money. $60 for a main game that lasts you barely 20+ hours (including completion of side missions and the main campaign) is not worth the buckaroos in my opinion. 2) The endgame.Borderlands 2 had a great endgame with far more replayability than the Pre-Sequel's endgame. In Borderlands 2, even after you've completed the side missions, you still had tons of stuff to do, bosses to farm, and loot to acquire. In the Pre-Sequel, I felt strangely lost and aimless after completing the main campaign and main side missions. There was not much left to do and I wasn't as motivated to go for multiple playthroughs. With the cons out of the way, let's go into what makes this game stand out from Borderlands 2.1) Player-characters.Let's face it. The Pre-Sequel has the best player-characters in the franchise. I had tons of fun experimenting with WIlhelm, Athena, and Nisha, and I've yet to play as the other 3 characters, which is something I look forward to doing. The difference between each character is noticeable and the playstyle you adopt varies with the character you choose. You can't play Wilhelm the way you play Nisha and vice versa. In addition, I love how some of the dialogue differs with the player-character you pick. It's a small touch, but I feel that it adds to the characterization and personality of each player-character, which was something missing from Borderlands 2. In Borderlands 2, I felt like a silent participant of events. Your character doesn't talk much and doesn't give any verbal responses to questions or happenings in the story; but in the Pre-Sequel, you get to see how each individual player-character responds in the same situation. One of the few reasons I went for multiple playthroughs was to experiment with the different playable characters and hear their unique dialogue. 2) Story.Although the story isn't the most intriguing and engaging one I've experienced as of yet, I felt that while it is shorter than Borderlands 2, it is better in certain aspects. While the story of Borderlands 2 was easy to craft since the Borderlands lore had plenty of area to explore and improvise on, linking the events of Borderlands 2 with another event is something different. I enjoyed seeing how the game portrayed a somewhat heroic and actually likable Jack slowly transforming into the villain he would eventually become in Borderlands 2. This game gives some background information to Borderlands 2 and once you've played this game, you can play Borderlands 2 from a new perspective and view Handsome Jack a little differently. 3) Added features.I personally loved the addition of lasers, the cyro element, and low-g environments since they added new depth to the game. Lasers are diverse and they are extremely fun to tinker with. The glitch weapons from the Claptastic DLC are also awesome and I would recommend getting that DLC or the Season Pass if you want the whole lot of DLCs and playable characters. In conclusion, this reskinned Borderlands 2 has its flaws and upsides, and it does balance them out quite evenly. I wouldn't recommend buying this game at its current price of $60, but buy it during the summer or year-end sale and you'll get something worth your money. If the price is low enough, go ahead and the get the Season Pass too. Just as long as you're a fan of the Borderlands series and are not expected something similar to the scale of Borderlands 2, you won't regret obtaining this game.			"

												This game did exactly what the developers intended to do with it:- It explained all the events prior to Borderlands 2- It sets up the plot for Borderlands 3 (since Borderlands 2 left them with all and no direction to go off of)- It kept the same brand of humor/style as the other Borderlands games- It showed off some unique mechanics like the OZ Kit and Cryo Freezing- It got the Vault Hunters to be more involved dialogue-wise making them dynamic- Include more space-themed easter eggs than you know what to do withThere are others I'm sure, but these are some of the biggest, and mostly overlooked, reasons that this game does not get enough credit. Honestly, I like this game and what it had to offer. With its interesting story, awesome DLC, and immense replay value, this game is honestly like Borderlands 2, but with a nice twist so the gameplay doesn't have to be so stale.This game is not perfect though because:- Driving mechanics suck. The littlest change in direction at full speed make the vehicle unstable.- Explosive shotguns fire bullets about 2 seconds after the shot has been fired.- If you get hit by a cryo blast and exit your vehicle while being damaged by it, you are perma-slowed and need to reload game to return to normal speed.**SPOILER**- Raid boss is not only unoriginal, it's the exact same difficulty as the final boss, but with higher shields and health.But overall, the game is fantastic and I will keep replaying it for everything it's worth until I'm sick of it.

												I like this game. I freaking love it. I was very skeptical at first from all the bad reviews. This game is about the rise of Handsome Jack and it tells the story very well, I'd probably prefer this over Borderlands 3 because of how good a villian Jack is. Jack is my favorite villain of all time. When I beat Borderlands 2, I felt the feeling of accomplishment, and the question: Why? Why is Jack a psychopath? I would say why at more things but I'd hate to spoil Borderlands 2 for those that have yet to play it. (If you're reading this and haven't played Borderlands 2, you need to.) This game gives an amazing story that answers most questions that we had from Borderlands 2.             Let's say you didn't care about the story or anything. This game is still super fun, one of my favorite things to do in Borderlands 2 was to farm bosses for the best loot possible! And if you have three other friends, this game will be your favorite game. Immediately.              I honestly have no negatives about this game, except for half of the legendaries aren't farmable(By ""farmable"" I mean not being able to farm a boss for the item, but they can still be found from random drops.), but that's easily justified with the grinder.10/10 "

												Provides decent backstory and content, but the price is far too steep for what you're getting. The Holodome DLC is funny, but far from worth the $10 for essentially what is an arena sidequest with a free Legendary at the end. Both Vault Hunters are unique and fun to play, don't really have any complaints about them. Claptrap's Mind is on par with Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep quality wise, in my opinion, but it suffers from the same problem that the base game does: it's far too short.I loved Borderlands 2 because even if the base game wasn't that long, the DLC (as mediocre as it was at times) was available to fill the gap in replayability. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel! does not have much in the way of actual content and the level cap increase does little to help this when you're forced through the base game 5 or 6 times to reach it. ince you're there, it has very little boss wise, with only 2 endgame bosses compared to the second game's 11.The first is a pushover and the second is an excercise in patience unless you've got a method of cheesing it. (In a way though, that's a bit nostalgic of BL2's Raid Bosses, which leads me to believe Gearbox can only make fights that swing on either end of the difficulty spectrum.)Overall, I'd advise not picking this up unless it's on sale. I recommend it if you love the series, but certainly not for more than $30.			"

												A really good game for the whole Borderlands series plot-wise (story-wise). I really enjoyed the story and how it was mixed with the Tales From Borderlands. As a true fan of Borderlands franchise, I can say that The Pre-Sequel is a good installment into the series, though I understand why it receives so much hate from gamers.Why so much hate?!First of all, the story is fairly short and there are not many playable dlcs, therefore the gameplay gets monotonous very quickly. It gets really frustrating to level up one character from level 40 to 70 when you already played the story 2 times and xp gain from turning in missions and killing enemies does not significantly increase as you level up. So either you play the story for 2-3 times again or spawn kill guardians or threshers (spoilers).Basically the main hate comes, because the pre-sequel does not meet the expectations after the Borderlands 2 and only one Claptastic Voyage dlc does not make the game as replayable as the Borderlands 2.Nevertheless, it has some really good features!Playing on the moon is really cool and new to the franchise what was rather enjoyable experience. The more appreciated thing in the game was the main characters and how much you get to know them with individual dialogues (YES, EACH PLAYABLE CHARACTER HAS UNIQUE LINES THROUGOUT THE WHOLE STORY). This makes the game more lively when characters interacts more during missions (unlike in Borderlands 2). Characters are great with individual skill trees and abilities (worth trying all of them).All in all, the game is not even close to the Borderlands 2 (which is one of the best adventure shooters ever made), but for a franchise fan this installment has to be obtained. The story is intriguing, and you have to play a bad guy, what is different in the Borderlands games. Anyway 8/10 because it hyped me a lot for Borderlands 3, which I believe is gonna be something like Borderlands 2 or even better!!!BONZA! "

												Well, where to start, the annoying australian accents on everyone, it was cute at first but eventually you get a headache.  The game in my opinion wasnt finished,  when playing the slots they were so blurry you couldnt see what was coming up until the grenade dropped in front of you in any case then its too late to run and with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ shield i had i was toast.  so i died in the bar playing slots.  Borderlands 2 plus the lack of gravity, although a novelty at first it becomes annoying when you over jump something  then have to run to an air pocket because you are down to 25%. Makes it difficult to do quests, so i ended up leaving them till i had a bigger air supply.  Luckily i got the game on sale for $29.00, the game isnt worth the 60 bucks they were asking and personally i think it shoulda been an add-on to B2.   If anyone has any questions feel free to ask, im a B2 fan and im not impressed			"

												Like a lot of other reveiws mentioned, a reskinned version of BL2. I coulden't agree with this more. The few things that are different, seem to be the downfalls. Take terrain for example. In BL2 anyone can memorize exaclty where everything was in Three Horns Divide, because all you did was mess around there for hours with friends. In BLPS all you seem to do is run through these  places, not hunt down bullymongs, soley because if you didn't chose Claptrap, you were racing against time for the next godamn O2 bubble (NOTE: Claptrap in all other respects is the worst. In a playthrough of 4 people I was Claptrap and there wasn't a battle that I didn't go to fight for your life all because of the stupid vault.hunter♥♥♥♥♥♥) This was a sadding aspect when I first got the game. The comedy - not quite there like BL2 was, The story - not as intreguing as BL2, and the ♥♥♥♥ing framerate is♥♥♥♥♥♥for god knows why, where in BL2 I have no issue. 5/10 for the almost contunuation of BL2, one of my favourite games.

												The PreSequel is a good game but unfortunatelly not as good as the Borderlands 2. The story is good, the humour is the same that you experienced before in the other BL games. BUT there is so many annoying things, such as the ""pay everything and got neary nothing"" syndrome, that Gearbox started to do... The DLC's at this time is simple money theft, such as the doppelganger (Jack's double as a playable character) or the newest, the Holodome. Both is incredibly high price for nearly nothing... The replayability is far not so high than in the BL2, a bit boring (in my oppinion).Lets make a pro/kontra:+ Borderlands, that's simple :)+ u can play the pre sequel of the BL2 (between BL1 and Bl2)+ the same humour and story+ new features such as the laser rifles or the zero gravity+ New playable characters+ Claptrap as playable charater (playing with him is really a fun)+ Grinder, you can make new guns,items from your unwanted items (legendary too!)- A bit short playthrough- GB's new attitude as ""play for nothing""- Not respawnable bosses- You don't get endgame, 2 farmable bosses (1raid boss)- Totally the same design,UI, graphics as in the BL2So, summa-summarum TPS is basicly a good game, especially for BL fans with some forgettable negative. So i recommend you this if u like the series or the good action games.			"

												Were do i startThis game had alot of hype for it, and most of it was true. This game is outstanding, but unfoturnetly does not llive up to Borderlands 2. Evan though it does not reach the perfect 10 that borderlands could get, its still a amazing game. This gives you many hours, past the money you pay. Trying to get your charcter up to level 50, Playing online with friends, or trying to overpass evreyone by haveing the best guns. No matter how you play, and what charcter you play, your guarented atleast 24 hours in this game, and thats well worth 60 bucks. Also, Spend the extra 30 and get the season pass, IT IS WORTH IT. If it anything like borderlands 2, it will have atleast 40 dollers of bonuse mission dlc, and then also charcter dlc. So the 30 will be well worth then buying each dlc indavidualy.			"

												Pre-Sequel is much shorter than BL2 despite that it came with $60 tag on release . There are very few side-quest chains and 90% of stages are so similar that you won't feel like exploring them . You may already notice that more people are playing BL2 because there is just so little to do in this game outside of main story  .It is not a bad game on sale but replay value compared to BL2 is very low . There is only 1 decent DLC for side story and we probably not getting another one . BL2 had 5 or 6 ? This game has like 1 raid boss ( no counting recycled story bosses in raid version ) There are few players in multiplayer because there is not one damn thing to do after you beat the game .The biggest issue for me here is the lack of compelling story . New characters that acted as enemies were under developed and I felt rather bored playing it .There is just no feeling of urgency and excitement that I experienced with BL2 . Elemental damage is not used strategically . For example robotic enemies are so far and between that you almost never need corrode damage. Lack of enemies and different enviroments makes it hard to proeprly use elemental guns for specific areas .Most enemies in Pre-Sequel are soldiers in armor and you often have to shoot the guy on harder mode to see what he is resistant to . Combat is slightly better do to low gravity so there is a little bit more depth . You can move a bit faster around the map and there is more platforming.All characters feel different from BL2 roster except maybe Wilhelm who has 2 similar skill trees to Axton . Skills are a bit more balanced in my opinion . In BL2 you had to build characters around few OP skills like Money Shoot on Salvador or you would not do enough damage  . I think Prequal handled that a little bit better by creating more synergy between skills which distributed power spike .Score: 6/10. It is not a terrible game but I was highly disappointed by lack of content, poor stage variety and boring story .Prequal has nothing going for it aside from new characters and gravity mechanic which is a poor follow up to BL2 that was a near perfect game .

												The real star of the show in The Pre-Sequel is Jack. In Borderlands 2 he was perhaps the most gleefully sadistic, and effective video game villain since Final Fantasy 6's Kefka. Seeing his journey from hero to maniac is perhaps the biggest reason to make the 20-or-so-hour trek across Pandora’s moon, Elpis. Writer Anthony Burch shows a real knack for storytelling here, drawing a more sympathetic portrait of Jack without ever making him into the clichéd misunderstood villain. He's every bit the hilarious, ego-centric asshat here that we remember him as, and his excellently written and delivered dialogue is responsible for the lion's share of the laughs.It’s a good thing too, because those laughs were often all there was to carry me through the long stretches of purposeless wandering around with barely anything to fight. This is part of a problem Borderlands has had since the beginning, and The Pre-Sequel hasn’t solved it. The inadequate waypoint system that doesn’t save you from going in circles while looking for your next objective, the boring trek back to your quest-giver at mission’s end… it’s all still here. The early hours on the moon were particularly trying, since everything is incredibly spread out, and every low-gravity jump takes seemingly forever. I just don’t want to walk towards a diamond on my mini-map for god knows how long to get to where the fun is.And I really don’t want to go on a multi-step wild switch hunt to trigger said fun once I get there. The Pre-Sequel is cardinally guilty of this one. Apparently neither the Hyperion or Dahl corporations know how to make doors in space, because almost every single one you need to go through requires you to throw a breaker or manual override somewhere back in the area you just slogged through. In a game about shooting and looting, I should be doing those things almost constantly, but in The Pre-Sequel there were times when 10 or more minutes could easily pass without me doing much of either. Things do pick up in the latter half of the campaign, but this sort of buck-and-stall pacing has plagued the series for years, and it gets harder to forgive with each iteration.But once The Pre-Sequel hits its stride, we get down to what Borderlands has always done best: the bullets start flying, the loot starts dropping, and joyful chaos ensues. The Pre-Sequel delivers a whole lot of that, starting with its four new playable characters and their positively nutty skill trees. Their action skills feel wildly different from one another, and from any of the vault hunters that have preceded them.Wilhelm’s flying drone duo, Wolf and Saint, really stands out. Not only does one of them go on automated bombing runs against nearby enemies, but the other hangs back to heal him, or even your allies with the proper skill points invested. Nisha’s washes the screen in classic Western sepia, turning her into a godless, gunslinging killing machine for a short while, which is a bit more straightforward, but no less satisfying. Athena’s shield allows her to go all Captain America on fools, but Claptrap’s is by far the craziest, granting him different abilities depending on the situation at hand. Those who love a more anarchic, unpredictable approach to combat will get all the mayhem they’d like out of it.In fact, everyone’s  skill trees are flush with abilities that reward specific playstyles with powerful temporary effects, like mini achievements you unlock over and over. Borderlands’ mascot robot Claptrap, now playable for the first time, is the best example. I happen to be a compulsive reloader with a mild death wish, so his Boomtrap skill tree seems to have been made just for me. By rapidly reloading, I can get a variety of big buffs that have explosive results, but at the cost of some health and accuracy. Oh and I have chance of actually griefing my teammates with my action skill (serves you right for joining my game without an invite...jerk). Just reading some of the other characters’ high-level skills made me think, “How does THAT work?” A copy of whatever gun I’m holding appears in my off-hand? I turn into a walking nuclear bomb? I just had to try this stuff out.The Pre-Sequel has a few other tricks up its sleeve too, and most of them work out. Not the new Stingray hovercraft – which handles like a wet mop with a ceiling fan strapped to it – but the new low-gravity mechanics are a success. Coming to grips with my elongated jumps took a while, but once it clicked, I started using my new freedom to deadly effect. It becomes so easy to put space between you and your enemies that sniping becomes a more viable option, and being able to bound over cover to slam down behind your foes’ cover makes getting up close and personal easier, and more satisfying than ever.The new gearing options are a blast too. Freezing enemies solid with cold-based attacks and burning them to a crisp with the new laser-class weapons feels great, but just wait until you see some of the mods that come on the Oz kits that keep you breathing in space. Some grant you accuracy and damage bonuses while airborne, while others give you an entirely different set of buffs depending on whether you’re in vacuum or atmosphere. The Pre-Sequel is really generous with loot, too, so you’ll have plenty of opportunities to shape your character in interesting ways. I mean, my Claptrap basically waltzes into the middle of groups of enemies and decimates them exclusively by reloading and dying. I can’t think of another game I can do that in.Despite its tendency to make you jump through hoops before getting to the good stuff, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel delivers where I expect it to as a Borderlands fan. The new gear and low-gravity mechanics mixed with the zany skill trees makes for a fresh experience, and with Jack at the center driving the story forward, you get a deeper dive into the always entertaining, if well-traveled universe of Borderlands.

												I really enjoyed this chapter of the Borderlands saga. I don't get why people criticize BLTPS, I had lots of fun, I liked the story and its characters, and I really appreciated the implement of PLayale Characters interactions between each others and with NPCs, which was something needed from the first Borderlands game to add details to the gameplay and environment of the game.I only have minor complaints, like the ""boring"" jump mechanic, that is absolutely irrilevant to the gameplay and the overall fun ""stat"" of the game, and the not great variety of sceneries outside of maybe the Helios Station and the Vault, absolutely normal and justified since the whole game is set on the moon.I did not purchase the Baroness DLC, but I like these Vault Hunters and I'm happy we can learn more on characters who only made a small appearence in the previous games.I completed the story a few times alone and I am currenlty waiting for my friends to purchase the game so we can enjoy BLTPS together.In the end, I totally recommend Borderlands the Pre-Sequel expecially if you are a fan of the whole BL saga.

												Borderlands TPS Is one hell of a good entry at Borderlands Franchise and sets up a new story line for next games. Lot of people says this game is more like an DLC for B2 but it's not, ofcourse it costs lot on steam but buy it online or on sale it is worth it! Character Types are different from B2 and Borderlands but it matters not, Most of the weapons are imported from B2 Mostly Legendary ones but I still find them awesome, Lasers ale my new favorite Shotguns! Story is awesome and I get the feeling that this game is longer then B2. DLCs- I haven't payed much attention to Story based DLC but I used the Character DLCs a lot and I gotta say Playing as Jack is awesome. Humor in this game is as good, well sometimes better then in B2 but its made in Australia soo there isn't that much swearing, ofcourse nobody gives a f*ck!Do I recommend this game? Hell yea!Was it Worth my 30 Bucks? Yes!Does Claptrap suck? Why do you ask, you know the answer is yes!			"

												Looking for more Borderlands? Then Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel as you covered. Developed by 2K Australia, this latest addtion to the franchise is set before the events of Borderlands 2, telling the tale of Handsome Jack's rise to power and how Pandora came to be the sandswept hell hole we all know and love. Set on Pandora's moon of Elpis, you'll play as one of  four brand new vault hunters offering a variety of skills to unlock and use in its tradional loot driven combat. Play as Fragtrap, a gun wielding claptrap specially designed to bring havoc to all Jack's enemies, unleashing his randomly selected special skill be it the Axton inspired mini-turret or Gunzerkers dual wielding ability, to name just two. There's also Athena, the Gladiator with her Captain America inspired shield, which can both protect you and be used as an offensive weapon against your enemies, boucing off helpless bandits to your absolute delight. Or maybe Nisha is more your style, the Lawbringer whose 'showdown' skill increases weapon damage to make her the ultimate vault hunter or maybe it's Wilhelm, the Mercenary Enforcer who uses technology to tackle any combat situation with the help of his trusted drones at his side. The Pre-Sequel introduces new laser weapons to your arsenal, these powerful and oh so satisfying death machines come in a variety of forms be it the Ghostbusters-like laser beam or the Star Wars inspired laser shot. But arguably the greatest difference comes in Elpis's gravity, allowing players the ability to jump high and glide as they traverse a large variety of lands on their 25+ hour single playthrough. Best of all, butt-slamming! Yes you heard me right butt-slamming, arguably one of the most satisfying new additions to Borderlands as you use the gravity (or lack there of) of Elpis as a weapon in of itself raining down death to your enemies... oh it's so satisfying. So Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is an easy one to recommend to those who loved Borderlands 2, after all it's almost entirely based off one of the best loot driven shooters in recent years. Learning more about the Universe of Borderlands and the humour many of us have come to love is one of the reasons that The-Pre Sequel works as well as it does, making it feel more worthwhile than you feel it as any right to be. If you're turned off by Borderlands often simple easy humour, than this won't change your mind. But if you're looking for more Borderlands than the Pre-Sequel as you covered. Butt-slamming and all!

												DISCLAIMER: As a veteran of the Borderlands franchise, this review will most definitely be debated based on the content reviewed in this review. Nonetheless, enjoy! :)Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is a good game that tells the story that would lead in to its beloved predecessor, Borderlands 2. While some people says that Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel was a failure as a game, it's no slouch to me. I definitely shout out Gearbox for implementing my favorite BTPS gun aka the Laser Disker. While BTPS fixed some issues that was in Borderlands 2 such as the uneven UVHM endgame balance, there were some very questionable patches to the game after the release such as the nerfs of the Ol' Rosie, Kaneda's Laser, and the Probe. To set some pros and cons out there, like my Borderlands 2 review, I'll put out a chart out there listing both. Hope the chart would help.Pros:-Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode is balanced compared to Borderlands 2 (BL2's UVHM balance is extremely off) -Weapons returning from Borderlands 2 are proven to be more effective in BTPS due to the game balance (weapons such as the Nukem, Mongol, and Pitchfork)-Jack the Doppleganger (my personal favorite character to play as)-Fills the gap of the story told in Borderlands 2-Claptastic Voyage DLC (I really love the setting and concept)-Cryo element (it can compliment Torgue weapons)-Some weapons and gear returning from Borderlands 2 still retain the power that makes them beloved in Borderlands 2 (Lady Fist, Maggie, Sham)-Some skills of characters proves to be as effective as similar skills from Borderlands 2 (Example: Aurelia's I Never Miss Skill = Zer0's Critical Ascension)-Skills of many characters (Athena's Malestrom, Jack's Leadership, Nisha's Tombstone, etc.)-Luneshine (interesting buffs to weapons that also appear without a Luneshine effect)-The Jakobs Pepperbox (likely cut from Borderlands 2 but appears in BTPS only in Glitch rarity in the Claptastic Voyage DLC)-The talking weapons in BTPS isn't as annoying as the Bane seen in Borderlands 2 and some are incredible when used Cons:-The questionable nerfs of some weapons after release (Ol' Rosie, Kaneda's Laser, Probe)-Some weapons are either reskins or renames of weapons seen in Borderlands 2 (not much of a con but still not as creative)-The Holodome DLC (criminally difficult)-The Holodome weapons (the weapons received in the DLC aren't worth really the effort that it takes to beat all the rounds of the Holodome)-No Bee Shield </3 (I'm not that mad or sad about this one since we have the Rerouter but it would've been nice to see the Bee return)-Tales from the Borderlands weapons cannot drop in the game and can only be claimed once (it's a shame because I really love the Company Man and Fast Talker)-A lot of weapons in the game cannot crit without assistance from Nisha's Tombstone skill-Not as much DLCs as Borderlands 1 or Borderlands 2-Many weapons in BTPS is a major downgrade to amazing weapons seen in Borderlands 2 (Example: Snowball is not as good as the Fastball seen in Borderlands 2)-Some weapons that can be farmed from only one boss can't be farmed again for the rest of the playthrough unless you alt + f4 -Eclipse/EOS at the end of the Claptastic Voyage DLC (not as mad about this one, annoyingly difficult to beat but does have a guaranteed legendary drop at the end which is worth it)The chart above is only my opinion and can be debated among the community. While I think that the game served its purpose, some people just don't like the game. Now, I'll leave it up to you if you think it's worth the money to buy this game. In my opinion, I think it's a good game to tell the Borderlands storyline. I think I can definitely recommend this game to those who continue to play the Borderlands franchise. Hope this review helped you to make a decision if you think it's worth it to buy the game. Bye :)			"

												Yes, this game is well-written and it is fun to play and definitely a challenge. I just don't enjoy the fact that, no matter where you go and what you conquer....when you come back the same thing is there waiting for you in almost the same spot. This game wasn't really big on surprises. The story helps out this game, immensely, but the repitition got me down after a little while.Like i always say: If YOU like it...PLAY IT. Don't ever let something someone else says convince / dissuade you on playing any game. A review is simply one person's take (their view) on the game and by NO means makes them any kind of ""authority"". And this is WHY i've wondered (from day ONE) why there is a ""comment"" option on a review. No one person's take is written in stone and comments only serve ONE purpose, to allow a person to be ""attacked"" when others don't agree...because a review isn't a test, it's someone's own take on something.

Posted: November 4, 2014
												A little preface before I get into the main review: yes this game has no differences to borderlands 2 in graphic design, and from just watching random bits of gameplay it may just seem like borderlands 2 with a jumping mod, but there are plenty of reasons to get this game (maybe not for full price however).The Pre-Sequel has a multitude of new weapons and playstyles which makes the game stand out more so than any other expansion, hence why it has been released as a full game. Laser weapons and beam weapons make an appearance and are in my opinion most of the best guns are beam and laser weapons (in the right hands that is). Cryo weapons also make a debut, though only seeming to replace the slag that was seen in the other installments. It is satisfying to freeze and shatter enemies though! The rest of the guns stay relatively intact, with the usual tediore reload mechanic, jakobs and hyperion weapon buffs and dahl buffs. Another neat mechanic comes from the correct use of lower gravity, butt slams (more fun than you'd imagine) and oz kits (upgrades certain abilties in vacuum or in atmosphere, but can also effect air control). There should be enough new guns and playstyles to satisfy each individual player.This leads me on to the classes and the tech tree. The characters this time round are fairly interesting, with some powerful new abilities. Nisha (seemingly the most popular of the 4 characters) has the impressive ability to turn into aimbot with any gun she is wielding, whether it be a pistol or a rocket launcher. All stats relating to guns are improved slightly (gun damage, reload speed, fire rate etc.) and this lasts a certain amount of time (side note - all these abilities have lower starting cooldowns, so use often). This ability  becomes incredibly powerful later on with beam or fast firing weapons that can target critical points really easily. Once you get a cryo beam, you may think it's gg enemies. The tech tree seems to want you to choose between a pistolero fast shooter, a general all guns blazing approach, or a melee/short range brawler with incredible health regen. Less love for the sniper rifle.Athena seems to be the juggernaut of the group mainly due to her ability, which prevents any damage in a 90 degree cone in front of her (where her shield is pointing). This then gets launched at an enemy nearby doing damage relative to damage taken (useful against bosses). This is extremely powerful if used correctly, but is generally hard to use as enemies tend to jump at you and run around the shield if you aren't aware of it. The tech tree allows different applications for your shield, allowing multiple bounces of the shield or allowing cool melee animations.Claptrap is the joker of the 4, as you may expect, and has a very weird set of techs and a weird ability. The ability is a random roulette wheel of awesomeness and terror, providing hp regen/sec but also giving a unique ""action package"" with a unique cooldown depending on the ability. This can range from boosted melee damage but can only melee, to PIRATE SHIP MODE!!! Definitely a hard character to use, especially seeing as all of the techs are mostly good, but have negative sides to them, like reduced accuracy but increased fire rate. Best played with a group of people to fully exploit the buffs/debuffs Claptrap can provide.Finally there is Wilhelm, the support role so to speak. He has a good amount of firepower, and his ability can help during extended fights by providing additonal firepower and sustain through two drones that fly around. His tech tree will improve his drones a lot depending on which tree you go down, and I'd personally recommend it if you are part of a team. One of the tech trees (most prefered) gives him an affinity for laser weapons, making him the powerful tank he wasn't in borderlands 2. Most definitely relies on the tech tree for his power.How about the comedy and the maps?Yes, there is some of each. Being an Australian made game, the NPC's mostly have Australian accents, and some share some Aussie humour, otherwise the game hits the spot on humour (sometimes being crude but Borderlands is generally a crude series). The maps are probably my only complaint, and more specifically the travel between them. Not all areas have fast travel, which does make sense in certain instances but when you have multiple missions in an area without a fast travel, that require you to go back and forth to an area, it can get quite frustrating. So overall? I'd give this an 8/10, definitely a game I enjoyed, great fights and all. I might be slightly biased being a borderlands fan, so anyone new to the genre should treat this as a 7/10. Good levels of humour and enough new content to be treated as a full game. Is it worth the full price? Not in my opinion. I'd say it's a must have at around £15-20, but the few bugs in the game, map travel and lack of appeal for people who aren't fully invested in the Borderlands series takes some of the value away. Otherwise, if you want a game you can play with a couple friends, enjoy and have a good laugh with, this will not disappoint. "

												I'm going to get this out of the way first. There are some who will say that this is just Borderlands 2.5 and that it's basically a DLC pack. I disagree. There are many reasons why this game is so much more than just BL2 DLC.The story is much longer than a BL2 DLC campaign.It takes place before BL2, when some of the BL2 Vault hunters weren't even on Pandora yet. It makes no sense they would be involved in the events of the game. (If this was released as DLC, all the BL2 Vault hunters would be playable. All the new Vault Hunters would also have to be playable in the normal BL2 campaign, which makes no sense on the timeline either)The game removes Slag and introduces Laser Weapons and the Cryo Element, plus uses a new damage multiplier for calculating Damage over Time effects like Fire.The game also has it's own DLC being made for it. If this was just a DLC pack, it would be DLC for DLC. What's the point?There are more reasons than that for why this is deserving of being considered it's own title, but it's about time I started talking about the game itself rather than comparing it to DLC.Just like with previous Borderlands titles, there are 4 main Vault Hunters to play as, plus additional DLC characters. I will not be covering the DLC characters in this review as I do not have any DLC purchased yet as of the time of the review.Athena the Gladiator is a returning character from the Borderlands 1 DLC: The Secret Armory of General Knoxx. She was originally portrayed in the DLC as a swift agile assassin type character who previously worked for the Atlas Corporation before she turned against them. At the start of Borderlands the Pre-Sequel, she is much slower than she appeared in the Knoxx DLC, instead using a Captain America styled Shield weapon which absorbs bullet damage and can  be thrown at an enemy to deal the damage back at them. The shield can be upgraded, and she can also become faster and more assassin like when the right skill tree is invested into. Get good with her and you might not have to use many bullets at all. She plays a bit like Zer0 with her upgraded Melee attack, but overall is pretty unique.Nisha the Lawbringer is a returning character from the Borderlands 2 sidequest area Lynchwood, where she was a tyranical sherriff who was given ownership of the town by Handsome Jack. We finally get to learn more about her in Borderlands the Pre-Sequel, and her action skill allows her to aimbot nearby enemies in the direction she is facing for certain hits very rapidly. She can duel wield Pistols by investing in a certain skill. She plays kinda like Zer0 in that she is really good at doing damage from a distance, and she is also a bit like Salvador with her duel wielding.Wilhelm the Enforcer is a returning character from the main story campaign in Borderlands 2. He was originally portrayed as a Hyperion Mercenary working for Handsome Jack who did pretty much whatever he was ordered to, regardless of how cruel. He was a fusion between man and machine, with his lower half being robot legs, his arms being part robot arm, and his face having robot parts built into it, namely his right eye. He apparently was involved in the destruction of New Haven, but that seems to take place after Pre-Sequel and so more details as to that event are hard to come by. His power at the time far surpassed the original 4 Vault hunters, and he nearly killed them without even taking a scratch. At the start of Pre-Sequel he is still mostly man, but can gain more robot parts as he invests more into his skill trees. He is a brute power defensive tank that is hard to bring down. He plays somewhat like a mix between Gaige and Krieg, with his action skill being similar in concept to Deathtrap and his brute damage and Fight for your Life upgrade being similar to Krieg.Claptrap the Fragtrap is a prototype Claptrap Assassin and is the same Claptrap from Fyrestone in Borderlands 1 and also is the same Claptrap as the one in Borderlands 2. He was reprogrammed by Jack to be a Vault hunter, and can't remember anything about his past. He is the weakest character early on, as he isn't very defensive. His action skill is rather unpredictable and makes many references to other Vault Hunters in the series. Sometimes the action skill is totally OP and does huge damage to enemies, and sometimes it's useless and is a huge waste. He can easily become the best character or the worst depending on the upgrades you choose for him and how you play him. He also doesn't require oxygen to breath because he doesn't breath, so the Oz kits in the game serve only as upgrades to him, similar to the Relics in Borderlands 2.The game exists as an explanation of who Jack is and how and why he became the tyrant we know and hate in Borderlands 2. He starts off as a nice character, merely a low level Hyperion Programmer who wishes to make profit from the Vaults. He was responsible for getting the original 4 Vault Hunters to search for the vault in the first game, knowing that the Eridium inside that vault could make him rich. As the game progresses, he grows less and less patient with the obstacles blocking his progression, and as he gets lied to, betrayed, and even has attempts to murder him bearly thwarted, his mind slowly but surely snaps and his rage takes over.After the main story is over, there isn't as much to do as there was in Borderlands 2. You can complete side quests you haven't finished yet and search for more guns and upgrades for your character, but not very many of the bosses actually return after you kill them so there isn't much of an opportunity to go grind them for rare drops. I imagine that as more DLC comes out they will be adding more to do, but for now after you beat True Vault hunter mode and cap at the current level cap of 50, there isn't much to do other than make a new character and try to cap them as well.However, despite the lack of things to do after the story is over, there are still lots of neat things this game adds to the game for you to screw around with and have general fun, regardless of progression. Completing certain side quests allows you to see fun easter eggs, and there are lots of hidden areas that you are never required to find during the main story, including an entire underground portion to the Factory and a Mario Bros reference. Exploring is definitly recommended.The general feel to this game is very different. While it certainly plays like a Borderlands game, the visual atmosphere is very different. The music is very different as well, and the level design and gameplay is very different from past Borderlands games as well. You are generally encouraged to move around all over the place, even up, and the areas are designed for the new low gravity in mind while you are in places where low gravity is in use. The areas tend to be very large as a result. This is neither a plus or a minus for me. It's different enough that I feel like I am playing a new game, but similar enough that it's still Borderlands. Whether that is a plus or a minus is up to you.Not very many enemies return in this game. Typical Maruaders and Psychos have been replaced by Scavs, and Lost Legion troops are a lot like the Atlas's Crimson Lance troops from the first game. Loaders also make a return, but are allies rather than enemies. The new Moon creatures are almost all totally unique, with none of them feeling like reskins of old enemies. Stalkers make a return from Borderlands 2 late into the game, and Threshers can also be encountered after certain events are triggered. Eridian Guardians from the first game also return, with new varients in addition to old ones.Overall, I like this game. It may not be as large and expansive as Borderlands 2, but it's still it's own game and there is much fun to be had here. It's much more than just a DLC sold as it's own game, and I recommend at least giving it a try.			"

												I was looking forward to this game MORE THAN ANYONE I KNOW! I loved Borderlands 2, one of my favorite games of all time for its improvements and properly streamlined features compared to the introductory game, and also introduced Handsome Jack to us in a PHENOMENAL way! However, this game is both a hit and miss: while space and zero gravity is AWESOME and feels like a natural evolution for the series, other design decisions derivative of the setting are much less stellar.Again, while space jumping is awesome, having to manage your oxygen and lacking ability to double jump when out of it discourages exploration, and makes this awesome world like sailing in uncharted and stormy waters: it may be fun and great looking, with interesting things to do but also requires you to ""check in"" oxygen filled areas or search desperately for enemies to kill, which thankfully now drop O2. Nonetheless, be warned: NEVER GO AFK in open areas.The story here is mediocre: while Jack's rise to power is fascinating, and being related to him directly and working side-by-side with the Handsome crazy himself in fun, the missions structures are annoying and uninteresting at times, with boring NPCs forced down your troat instead of working with Jack, and having objectives tucked away in tiny areas also discourages the SPACE FUNCTION NEW TO THE GAME! Just mind-boggling. At least Concordia and Helios sections are mostly flawless, with some of the better NPCs and side missions; which by the way are interesting and, at times, are MORE INTERESTING AND TELL A BETTER STORY THAN MAIN CAMPAIGN ITSELF! With MORE INTERESTING AND FUNNY CHARACTERS! Plus they feel fewer than EVER, and at just about 30 hours (10-12 of campaign) I almost completed all of them.Finally, this game was supposed to feel more mature and give players an even more complete and polished than Borderlands 2, but instead feels like a wasted opportunity, downright LAZY at times. Also, the inability to access some bosses like Zarpedon after completing main missions and having some bosses drop THE SAME LOOT EVERY TIME without any meaninful legendary occasionally is discusting. Nonetheless, it has a few hits: the space double jump when not constrained, the Grinder which allows you to make weapons and shields relevant, even if you dont want them anymore, lazer guns can be fun though most are not that good, and using moonstones to create lunarshine weapons (including legendaries) is awesome, with extra abilities and perks for the weapon improved. I still recommend it as patches and DLC can make the game more balanced/fun, but overall a dissapointment.*Also, some crazy glitches and bugs still plague the game, even worse than BL2. Nisha players: watch your hands, they will act wonky most times.			"

												Please not, that this is not the finished review for Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel! I'll update it once I played through TVHM with my thoughts on the endgame-content and the way TVHM works out.The Story:I don't want to spoil anything, because pretty much everything that happens will work out in Borderlands 2. Basically, it's the story on how Jack became Handsome Jack, the villain in Borderlands 2. The side missions add cool additional insiders, such as the reason for Treshers living on Pandora. Everything is full of humor again and you'll meet loads of the characters you love from the second game of the series.The onliest thing, which I personally found a bit sad, is, that the villain this time (Zerpadon) is just a regular, evil, witch-like woman. No funny lines, no especial memorizable lines, just the normal villain you'll have in each and every game.It tooks me 22 hours to do each mission (both side-missions and story-missions) in Playthrough 1, the onliest quest, which is left, is the traditional raid-boss at the end, as I haven't found a team, which is able to beat him, yet, and can't solo him, due to a lack of skills.The Classes:There're four playable characters again, without any of the DLCs. I'm playing Athena at the moment, so I can only say little about the other classes.Athena's special skill is her shield. She uses it to absorb damage and then throw it back at her enemies (up to four, if you got the right skill for it). The skill tree is equal in size and complexity to Borderlands 2, there's no overpowered skills or underpowered ones; as long as they fit your gaming-style, they're worth to go for. There's no relation between her and Borderlands 2.Wilhelm, the enforcerer, can summon two drones, which support him in combat. One supports his defensive skills and abilities, the other one actively fights enemies. You fight him in his final form in Borderlands 2 at around level 12-15.Nisha's a bit similar to the gunzerker in Borderlands 2, her special skill allows her to dual wield weapons. Sadly, this mode got an auto-aim this time, which makes it a bit less hard and challenging, else, the skill tree is focused on lawbringer-ish styles. She's the sheriff of Lynchwood in Borderlands 2, who you eventually fight in a side-quest.Claptrap... everyone should know him by now. He's the same annoying but funny robot as he always was. His special skill is a program called ""VaultHunter.exe"" and allows him to scan the battlefield and use special-skills adapted to the situation. The skills include all classes available in Borderlands 2, and also the ""Gun-magician"" and a pirate-ship. Yes, a pirate-ship. It fires cannons at your enemies.The Gameplay:Of course, the main reason for playing game of the series is not enjoying the story. It's the quests, the loot, the gunplay. This can be summarized in only a few words. It's the EXACT same as it was in Borderlands 2, just with the difference, that  you're in space now and there's no oxigen around most of the time. There's less gravity, making the overall experience feel a bit ""slower"" than Borderlands 2. Also, you can double-jump now (which will use some of your oxigen) and smash down on enemies, which is quite useful and feels slightly overpowered with certain Oz-Kits. Those are a new item, which I'll go over in just a second.The Items:The loot-system is the same as it is in Borderlands 2. I can't go over many legendaries by now, as I haven't found many. The ones I found were - as it seems - guaranteed drops by bosses, so nothing too special. A friend of mine had a double-legendary drop once, which was one guaranteed one and a random one. I THINK this wasn't possible in Borderlands 2, or at least I've never heard of it or seen anything like that. Correct me please, if that's wrong.There are a few new items: First off, Laser-guns! These come in an interesting variety, all are classified as Laser-weapons, though. There're shotgun-like Laser-guns, SMG-like ones, and some, which have a kind of laserish fluent coming out of them, consuming ammo in specific amounts of time. Some of them feel overpowered, though, like the Zerpadon-one and the Moxxi-one.Secondly, there are Oz-kids now. You need oxygen in order to survive where's no oxygen, makes sense, huh? Also, it can be used to double jump and replaces the relics in Borderlands 2. Actually, it's like a relic, but with oxygen.The drop rates of greens, blues, purples and legendaries seem to be equal to Borderlands 2, at least to me, and in Playthrough 1 only by now (I spent around 300 hours in Borderlands 2, and it feels pretty much the same), however, I feel like whites are a bit more rare, especially in the later game. That's nice, though, as you won't pick them up except for reselling-purposes anyway.The Difficulty:The game is easier than Borderlands 2. I didn't die at ANY boss, except for the final one, and I only died due to a lack of knowledge on how to fight him, as soon as I found out, I beat him at ""first new try"". I died like 30 times from groups of enemies, besides that I died like 20 times from jumping somewhere where I shouldn't, or getting thrown off the edge by enemies. That's not much for 22 hours of gaming, I remember having a way harder time in the first playthrough in Borderlands 2. I hope, the second playthrough gets a hell load harder. I liked it the challenging way.Oh, I can't solo the raid-boss at the end (I'm level 27 currently, got no legendary in use at the moment and have no super-duper planned build...) and have problems finding a group for him, which doesn't die all the time.Summary:Overall, I think that Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is more than just an AddOn to Borderlands 2. It's motivating, funny, will need at least 70 hours to be beat a 100% I suppose (according to my very own speed) and at least another 30 to farm for some legendaries and nice builds. And this on one character only. I guess it's fair to say, that, including the DLCs, which will come, you can have at least 200-300 hours of fun with this game, if you enjoy the Borderlands universe.			"

												Currentley i like it (not love it) but its endgame is very boring but gearbox is trying to get 2k austalia to fix it by making more bosses farmable, which is a good thing.When you complete it you get true vaulter mode like its been in the series thus far however it feels very bland. The aesthetics is quite boring and most of the areas feels like its just one big area but thats to be expected becuase it is on the moon, there is one big thing about this game that really annoys me is that (personal opinion here) on nearley all main missions have sooo many detours eg. on a perticular area (going try not to reveal a spoiler) when you are meant to get robitc turrents and legs you literally have to go all over the map, but i understand the vanilla game size is quite small (aprox 5.4 GB) so we would have to be thorough on maps to make the most out of it.now with most of the bad stuff out of the way good points: scaling of enemies and wepons is very nicley done, guns are more balanced (not fixed though) than they were in borderlands 2, you will get your first skill point at level 3 and so you will have a few more skills to buy, they have not made cryo as game breakingley over powered as slag in borderlands 2, charcter interact more with each other ,both NPC's and your playable characters, lazers are balanced extremely well to the point that it is your fault if they act good or bad, unless you got the unlucky chance of having a bad one And thats all folks.

												I really enjoyed this chapter of the Borderlands saga. I don't get why people criticize BLTPS, I had lots of fun, I liked the story and its characters, and I really appreciated the implement of PLayale Characters interactions between each others and with NPCs, which was something needed from the first Borderlands game to add details to the gameplay and environment of the game.I only have minor complaints, like the ""boring"" jump mechanic, that is absolutely irrilevant to the gameplay and the overall fun ""stat"" of the game, and the not great variety of sceneries outside of maybe the Helios Station and the Vault, absolutely normal and justified since the whole game is set on the moon.I did not purchase the Baroness DLC, but I like these Vault Hunters and I'm happy we can learn more on characters who only made a small appearence in the previous games.I completed the story a few times alone and I am currenlty waiting for my friends to purchase the game so we can enjoy BLTPS together.In the end, I totally recommend Borderlands the Pre-Sequel expecially if you are a fan of the whole BL saga.

												Borderlands TPS Is one hell of a good entry at Borderlands Franchise and sets up a new story line for next games. Lot of people says this game is more like an DLC for B2 but it's not, ofcourse it costs lot on steam but buy it online or on sale it is worth it! Character Types are different from B2 and Borderlands but it matters not, Most of the weapons are imported from B2 Mostly Legendary ones but I still find them awesome, Lasers ale my new favorite Shotguns! Story is awesome and I get the feeling that this game is longer then B2. DLCs- I haven't payed much attention to Story based DLC but I used the Character DLCs a lot and I gotta say Playing as Jack is awesome. Humor in this game is as good, well sometimes better then in B2 but its made in Australia soo there isn't that much swearing, ofcourse nobody gives a f*ck!Do I recommend this game? Hell yea!Was it Worth my 30 Bucks? Yes!Does Claptrap suck? Why do you ask, you know the answer is yes!			"

												Yup this is a late review but some people might find it handy. Is this a bad game? No. But it is not nearly as good as Borderlands 2. If this had been the first game in the series it would be getting praise across the board... but it isn't the first game and it's going to be damn hard to live up to BL2. The main problem is the game just feels like a large BL2 DLC. It took me 22h to do a playthrough, which is very respectable until you consider it took me 35h to do a playthrough of BL2. And that's that TPS' biggest problem... it is a smaller game than BL2 in every respect (even if we ignore DLC) the first 5-6h of the game take place in a few very boring and samey moon levels. Eventually the game brings you to some awesome locations including a space construction site, a testing facility, and a Hyperion city and these levels are great! I just wish there were more of them. Overall this game has far fewer areas than BL2 and far less environment variation too. The maps are smaller as well. The same goes for the side missions. There's just not a lot of them and many feel kind of like missed opportunities.The story at points feels like it will take an awesome turn and in some ways it is really cool to see the events leading up to the events of BL2, but it feels like 2K was rushed because the story never hits the levels it could have and never goes into the depth we would have loved to have. Before you know it the story is over and it leaves quite a bit of room for more. Old characters return but many never actually appear in game... they say a couple sentences over echo. The game introduces a few new characters but they are mostly forgettable. I've said a lot of negative things up until now, but this is NOT a bad game. I love that the playable characters actually talk and give their own opinions on events and that characters dialogue changes depending on what character you choose to play. For example, playing as Athena I had Springs (female Scooter) hitting on me and I enjoyed the way Athena reacted. The shooting is as fun as ever and the introduction of low gravity is a good one in my opinion. Double jumping and slamming enemies adds an awesome new facet to the gunplay and they nailed it, although I feel like O2 could have been a bit scarcer. You will not die if you run out of air. As for guns, there are new energy guns that are fine, but there's no overhaul here as was done between BL1 and BL2. However the Boganella shotgun was awesome and had me laughing all the while i used it (which was most of the game unfortunately). There are a few new enemies (emphasis on few) that are fun enough, but mostly you fight scavs which are basically bandits. More enemy types would have been cool, and some of the new additions could have been used to more effect.Overall this game is good. It doesn't really do anything wrong, but I can't help but compare it to BL2 and see all the things it isn't. BL2 had me so hooked I bought all the DLC and pumped over 225h into it and would come back for more in a heartbeat. I will likely do a second playthrough of this game, but I feel no need to go beyond that or purchase any of the mostly lackluster DLC (HINT: if the base game is short, character packs are probably not the best idea for DLC). Anyway I can recommend this game because it is a well made and fun game. It is worth playing if you pick it up on sale, just be aware that this is not BL3.			"

												Hmmmmmmmm....Most things has changed in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. such like gravity, Oz kits, gravity slam, LASEEERRRRS. And it's pretty fun when playing on the Jack side. The Scav, like the Bandits of Elpis. Pretty enjoyable gameToo bad, this Borderlands is look too similar to Borderlands 2 in space. Everything: main menu, window HUD, some weapons, is from Borderlands 2 without changing a bit. That's pretty sad.If you want to know this game worth 60$? I can tell....A bit overpriced.This Borderlands is pretty decent 7/10 "

												Borderlands: The Pre Sequel! is the latest addition to the looter shooter series Borderlands. This game is set between Borderlands 1 and 2 and tells the tale of new Vault Hunters working for everyone's favourite charming psychopath Handsome Jack. The new Vault Hunters and the story of Handsome Jack's plight are top notch, however this game is plagued by a fair number of issues. Athena, Wilhelm, Nisha and Claptrap are a blast to play, which they owe to their unique action skills and distinct skill trees. The narrative is enjoyable if somewhat predictable and adds some depth to the demonised Handsome Jack. Now for the bad stuff, essentially this game can be viewed as a large mod for Borderlands 2 as it is built on the same engine. Additionally The Pre Sequel's end game is hampered by un-respawning bosses and an expansive list of unobtainable legendary gear. Many enjoyable boss battles can only be played once per playthrough and most of the legendaries can only be obtained via the grinder. Speaking of legendaries; most of these will be familiar from Borderlands 2, some at least have been renamed in the hopes that we won't notice. With recent patches failing to acknowledge key issues in the game unless you are a true Borderlands fan you won't find much reason to continue playing past playthrough number 1. All in all the Pre Sequel was thoroughly enjoyable on its first playthrough, the inclusion of Ocker Australian humor and the fantastic narrative provided enjoyment but the lack of end is sorely noticed. Is it worth its price tag? Hell no. Get this game when its on sale.			"

												so after beating the game I do feel that  i can now do a comprehensive review of this game. First of all I loved BL2, it had everything right and was such an improvement over 1 and played so much better than anything i played before in the FPS genre. Here its not so much the same. The story is so short it should have just been a dlc pack for bl2 instead of a full blown game. Also, after mucking around in the files i noticed alot of things from bl2 are resused which honestly is just lazy. Glitches riddle the areas such as places where you'll fall out of the map or enemies will float through doors. Honestly don't buy this for 60$ buy it on sale or on console where its much cheaper. overall lazy excuse from gearbox.			"

												Even though I recommend this game as being a fun addition to the Borderlands universe, it is a disappointing sequel to Borderlands 2, I expected more from it and I didn't get it. Here are a few points I have to point out -Cons:- Got lost so many times in this game. SO MANY.- None of the characters are really memorables, except for the cameos from the other Borderlands games. Some are downright annoying and everyone has a bad British accent.- Does all the loot have to be terrible pistols?Pros:- Definitely more challenging than the last in terms of combat and the final boss.- Makes you actually save up your money, unlike BL2 where it stopped being a problem after the first chapter.- Still has all the fun elements of the Borderlands games.- New fun features such as butt-slams and air boosts. Moon gravity FTW!Still recommend the game, but I don't see myself replaying it as much as I did Borderlands 2. That's all. "

												The story in this game is not up to par in comparison with the devs from Borderlands and Borderlands 2, but it offers a good story on the in-betweens of the first two games.  There are a lot of easter eggs, references, memes dispersed throughout like any good Borderlands game.The problem comes into play on the game physics and mechanics.  The game can be very unstable, especially the later in the game you get.  There are times when a side-quest will not flag an objective as complete, and you are unable to drop the mission in order to attempt again.  This will be painful for those who are completionists.With the issues this game has, I would not recommend playing it, which is a shame since the story elements are good.			"

												It is amazing that they actually managed to create a version with a less finished feel than Borderlands 1 and 2. Playing multiplayer is very buggy, simple, easy, and flat out boring. The game has more bugs than its predecessors (collision will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off very quickly, as will getting stuck on EVERY piece of terrain), and lacks any depth. The skill trees are unexciting, the attempt at humor in the storyline falls short of amusing, and the quests are 30 minutes of running with less than 10 guys to kill. I would recommend you play the 1st and 2nd Borderlands and skip what is clearly a half finished attempt at what should have been dlc not a 'new title'.			"

It's a sloppy expansion pack, but it does scratch that Borderlands itch.			"

""booty salads.""cryo > slag, cryo is FUN while not necessary, in -uvhm- bl2 either slags everyone or do no damage, thats why i played krieg a lot *BLEEP* SLAGsterwin forever ;_;moxxtails, i think its a cool concept by giving slight buff and moonstone sinkthe characters are responding when the others activating skill, for example nisha to athena: ""Draw their fire, I'll go for the kill!"" or wilhelm to claptrap: ""DO NOT.

												From what I've seen from other reviews/general opinion from the community, this game is buggy and unenjoyable for the most part. Contrary to that, I believe that this game is a fun twist on the Borderlands formula, very enjoyable mechanics such as boost jumping and low gravity, and fun new item ideas such as the OZ-KIT gear replacing Class Mods; and the cool new addition of lazer weapons. Many of the problems/bugs in Borderlands 2 were fixed in this game and while I do miss the ability to just jump out of the map from time to time due to Borderlands 2 imperfect map boundries, it is a change for the better to provide more freedom of movement, whilst making sure that the boundaries for maps are more secure. I feel like I'm rambling a bit, but either way I'll end the review on this note: If you enjoyed Borderlands 2, you WILL enjoy Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel!			"

												I loved Borderlands when I played it years ago with friends on my console, and Borderlands 2 when I played it with my friends on PC... Especially Jack. Jack was one of the most evil, callous, villainous beings that I could ever imagine and he always got me ready to get going and kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.And then I heard about the Pre-Sequel.And then I played it (with friends, once again).And then I realized that there's a reason behind every single thing he does. His actions are all justified in the mind of a broken man, surrounded by power and unable to trust anyone.At the start of The Pre-Sequel, Jack is a bit odd, but has the entire universe's best interests at heart.By the end, in the most justified and logical descent into madness that I've ever seen, he has become ""Handsome Jack"", the villain we all hate.I have nominated this game for the ""Villain Most in Need of a Hug"" award, because though he may be the villain in Borderlands 2 and not so much the Pre-Sequel, this is where his story is told. This is where we learn the truth.Perhaps it's too late to give him a hug now, but if only we had gotten there in time, maybe the events of 2 could have been avoided.			"

												What's new in the pre-sequel? Lasers, Oz kits, and you can play as Claptrap.I found the storyline to be a bit shorter than BL2, but enjoyed it nonetheless.Did first walkthrough with Wilhelm and his flying robots, had a blast. Started a Nisha and I love her action skill with a sniper rifle, but she dies way too much for my liking. Athena is ok, survives better with her aspis shield action skill but to me she's just meh. Seriously I am having the most fun as Claptrap. His action skill is random ""supposedly"" based on the situation. Sometimes it's helpful, other times not so much. His skill tree doesn't seem as strong as the other classes but his dialogue makes up for it in my opinion. Plus he doesn't need oxygen to breathe but still gets the benefits of an Oz kit.Dahl grinder in Concordia is pretty cool once you complete the mission to activate it, especially at lower levels. Can convert 3 items of same color to a possible item of the next tier. A couple achievements associated with it too.Only real negative? DLC is really lacking for this title compared to BL2.			"

												So far, I have completed normal mode with two characters (Nisha and Claptrap) and played a little bit of TVHM.As others have said, this feels like an extension of Borderlands 2 (but inferior to it). Combat, aesthetics, user interface remained largely the same. Naturally, it makes sense to focus on the differences between the two.The main aspects of TPS that I thought were improvements were more interesting skill trees (more variation in progression of skills and between characters themselves) and likelier legendary drops (I have found quite a few legendaries just in vending machines throughout normal mode). Laser weapons were a fun addition. I also liked that the playable characters partake in dialogue with their own unique lines.There were some things that became non-issues. I wasn't a big fan of the varying levels of gravity in different areas at first, but eventually got used to it. Similarly, I didn't like the oz mods at first, but ultimately, they didn't detract from the experience. If anything, they add another side to combat compared to relics, which merely provided stat boosts.Then there were areas that definitely felt sub-par to BL2. The writing was not nearly as funny or entertaining (though I'm finding that TVHM dialogue is funnier, with Tiny Tina and Brick commentating over the story). Map design is really confusing for anyone on their first playthrough. In addition to excessively vast landscapes and multiple floors, there are often no clear paths or landable platforms. Consequently, you may have to guess where you need to make a leap of faith (usually to your death). Side missions were often tedious, with a lot of running around, and the tedium was usually compounded by the overly expansive map design. Most NPCs were not very interesting at all, and some were just downright annoying.Overall, the reason TPS got such a negative response was because the fans were expecting a game on the level of BL2. On its own, it was a decent game. Its flaws don't discount it entirely, but the disappointment is understandable.UPDATE: My original review of the game still stands, but since then, I have bought the Season Pass. I've now played through at least normal mode with almost all of the characters. With their variety of skills, the characters, including the DLC, are still fun to play. I especially enjoyed the Claptrap DLC campaign and consider it one of the best campaigns across the series. In fact, I enjoyed it more than the main campaign of TPS, as it featured a much more interesting setting, sensible maps, and improved dialogue. Overall, the main story of TPS offers some welcome improvements over BL2, kept many of the mechanics that made me a fan of the Borderlands series, but didn't really build its world and setting as well as its predecessor. Its one DLC campaign showed a glimmer of its former glory, so it makes me hopeful that the Gearbox will take into account the shortcomings of this game to deliver the best sequel they can.			"

												This is just a standalone add-on for Borderlands 2. The game mechanics are pretty much the same, but with new characters, new maps, new storyline, etc.tl;dr: if you enjoyed BL2, you should like TPS as well. If you didn't - don't bother. If you haven't played BL2 at all, you should definitely check it out first. Even though I recommend TPS, I can see why it gets so much hate.Pros:- fun gameplay- fun characters- fun enemies (NO MORE DAMN SURVEYORS)- fun story- fun low gravity physics, adds more variety to the gameplay- fun new cryo element- fun this- fun that- fun everything- just fun- main protagonists have much more dialogue compared to BL2- it's cool to see Handsome Jack playing a pivotal role in the storyline, even more so than in BL2- lengthy base game campaign- the ability to grind unwanted items is a welcome additionCons:- not enough DLC content (unlike BL2, you won't reach max level having played UVHM just once) - it might not live up to the expectations of many- too expensive (€70 for the base game + SP at the moment, w/o discounts)- some of the loot from BL2 is missing, most notably (for me) The Bee and Infinity, also no pearlescent items, and glitch weapons are overall less useful than seraph weapons/items from BL2- just one raid boss, and a lame one at that (pretty much the same as the end boss)- hardware requirements are slightly higher compared to BL2, while the graphics (or anything else for that matter) doesn't seem to justify that- no overpower levels - there's pretty much nothing to do after you hit level 70Overall - Borderlands 2 is cheaper, it has more content and it doesn't feel like a 2 years older game in any way; it's a much better value than TPS. If TPS had more DLCs and was cheaper, it would've been just as good as BL2, if not better. It's a shame that 2K Australia went bust and the plug was pulled way too soon. Why didn't Gearbox pick it up and continue development is beyond me.Base game - recommended, Season Pass - arguably recommended, Shock Drop Slaughter Pit DLC (not included in the SP) - definitely not recommended (waste of money even with discounts).

												Borderlands: The Pre-Sequal, is in line with the rest of the series.  Full of jokes and dark humor just like its predecessors; if you enjoyed the others you will likely enjoy this one.  If you havent played the other games I would say that this one has more to offer as far as options on how you play the game.  These could vary from super mario approach to serious fps style gameplay or run and gun.  Shotguns that shoot rockets, submachineguns shooting giant orbs of electrical death, randomness is what this game thrives upon.Character opinions to follow (Caution: may be some spoilers)Athena- plays as either a tank or a tanky-dps role.  She is very serious throughout the nonsensical moon of Elpis.  (I played a full playthrough with her.)  Her shield makes her immune to frontal attacks for some time.Nisha- She was supposedly developed for casual gamers but honestly I think she is more difficult to play than Wilhelm.  Her ability seems to fire worse than my natural ability to shoot but I play alot of FPS games.  She is the worst character in my honest opinion. Claptrap- He is the most fun to play in my opinion and has very powerful abilities albiet random.  The bouncing mode one pretty much makes you invincible though.  I most enjoy playing Claptrap.    Wilhelm- He plays almost exactly like a mix of Mordecai and Axton.  His two flying turrets make him super easy to play. I have not played the doppleganger at all.I hope this review was helpful for some of you out there.PS: CAUTION: SPOILERSThe second playthrough is better in my opinion since Tiny Tina talks through the game.

												Described as an ""Extra-Large DLC"" to Borderlands 2, that's really a good thing!  As far as developing continuous storylines, creators have the ever-shrinking pool of ideas/stories.  Apply video gaming to it, then more variables further limit resources available.  But ""Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel"" easily surpassed my expectations.  With every sequel aiming to improve its predecessors, the results always  turn into a ""Hit-Miss"" situation.  The Pre-Sequel updated BL2's specs (graphics, sound,...) added a few new gameplay elements, and glued them together with an exciting storyline.  In other words, the Borderland series had been able to sustain their gameplay style, storie humor, degree of challenge, etc.   It's too bad other developers design sequels around unrelated ideas; losing its original fashion.

Nothing spectacular or even funny, except Jack himself. Not worth even the 3€ I payed for it.			"

												Hey, wanna play Borderlands in space? With♥♥♥♥♥slamming? More cool mechanics? Flying around and ♥♥♥♥ing up people? WELL SIR THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU. Just maybe get it on sale if you don't like to buy games over 25$. A good friend of mine gifted it to me, it was really great playing with him. "

												This game is not meant for singleplayer because instead of balancing the game if you're on your own they leave the same♥♥♥♥♥♥that they have for co-op and it becomes a chore to do missions when enemy's are spammed at you like you were a controversial forum. Some missions take forever simply because you are playing alone because the enemies are basically endless and to hit the final nail into the coffin the game crashed and instead of loading me in at my last autosave it put me back like 2 hours earlier into the game at a random spot I was at that was basically like 2 missions back from where i was and I lost my really really REALLY good gun like REEEEEEAAAAAAALLLLLLLLY good. I have completely rage quit from this game because the idea of redoing any of those missions makes me want to vomit. I was Legit having fun despite it's extreme singleplayer flaws too but this is unacceptable.			"

												Borderlands is a game i have played for quite a long time.Border lands the pre-sequel is a game people argue about as to if its just a big DLC to borderlands 2 and its not worth its price, I think this game is Totaly worth it. Its got a long satisfactory ending which prepares you for something big coming up in a possible new game, I wont spoil it though i will tell you, I already hype for borderlands 3 hehe. The dlc sound promising to this game. The first one is supposed to be 'kick♥♥♥♥♥ and Handsome Jack or also known as his Dopple Ganger is to come out on the 11th of november. Already they are releasing dlc to this game s i reccomend buying a season pass if you want all the dlc coming out. This game has added in lots of new things to the borderlands franchise such as LASER WEAPONS which im not such a big fan of, CRYOOOO it works amazinerific seeing your enemys fly off into space in chunks of ice is awesome, OZ KITZ I like this it makes the easter eggs and secrets or even exploits if your like that easier to get to. AND Zer0 Gravity, ""The best thing ever"". SO I RECOMMEND GETTING THIS GAME ITS AWESOME!!!!			"

												If you come into Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel expecting a completely new experience you're going to be disappointed. It's a lot of the same. Same old UI, same old loot system. But they've managed to change just about enough to keep it fresh.A new weapon type here, a new element there and 4 new classes tip it over the edge. The low gravity and ""butt slam"" attacks keep the pace of the game fast and that's what I like the most. It's not a slog and the enemies don't seem as bullet spongy unless you're way underlevelled.The dialogue seems a bit stretched out at times, the main story quests seem to be awkwardly extended with a lot of walking backwards and forwards and the map seems pretty small in comparison to Borderlands 2. However, if you want more Borderlands, this is your game.			"

												Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is a game that Gearbox has previously stated to be shorter in length than Borderlands 2, but longer than Borderlands 1. I’m not entirely sure how long it took me to beat Borderlands 2, but it took around 20 hours to finish The Pre-Sequel. It didn’t feel short, but some parts of the game seemed to drag on longer than others. That is not to say that the pacing in Borderlands 2 was perfect, because it wasn’t; The Pre-Sequel’s plot teetered back and forth between interesting and mediocre, and more often than not did I just want to continue forward to see if it would get better.One of the most interesting characters from Borderlands 2 was Handsome Jack, and the Vault Hunters in The Pre-Sequel are working for him, albeit under a shorter name (without ‘Handsome’, in lieu of not having the mask in The Pre-Sequel.) He still has some enjoyable lines, and an amazing voice actor, and while playing though the game I actually wanted to see the character break down as his hopes and dreams were beginning to unravel. This did happen to an extent, but not to quite the extent I was hoping. Maybe I was asking for too much, I’m not sure. Still, it was refreshing to be able to get a look into some of the backstory of Jack, even if we never did get to find out who his wife/Angel’s mother was.Speaking of which, the villain of The Pre-Sequel is Colonel Zarpedon, a Dahl chief trying to keep the vault on Elpis a secret via any means necessary. When she’s introduced, you feel as if she’s a real threat to you, Jack, and the entire moon, and throughout the game you’re reminded of this when the laser on Hyperion’s Helios base goes off as the noise it produces is unavoidable, and oftentimes you can’t help but look toward it to really make sure you’re not imagining things. Hence why I was very disappointed to not have Zarpedon show up in the game more, even just via radio. Unlike Handsome Jack in Borderlands 2, Zarpedon doesn’t really taunt you, she doesn’t acknowledge your presence throughout most of the game, and she doesn’t talk at all when she shows up as one of the last bosses. There are ECHO logs scattered about the game that give a little backstory to her character, which is nice, but it would have been nicer to see her more in the game. Not every villain needs to be like Jack, per se, but having one that really makes you want to finish the game and enact vengeance upon them definitely livens up the story.Charming characters from past Borderlands games don’t make an appearance, and although this is understandable, as they’re all on Pandora, a nod or two would have been nice. The interrogation between Athena and Lilith could have been more interesting if at least one of the Vault Hunters from Borderlands 2 had shown up, since the ending of that game didn’t give any hint as to where they ended up. One could assume they returned to their respective homes, but that wouldn’t make much sense, as Maya left her home planet to learn, and she may not have been finished learning, and Zer0 probably didn’t really have a home. You may wonder why even Maya couldn’t have been there for the interrogation, as I did. After all, she and Lilith are the only two Sirens left, so you’d think they’d have bonded with one another.The gameplay for The Pre-Sequel is enjoyable, as it mimics Borderlands 2 and adds a few twists of its own. Oxygen is a valuable resource and you have to find stations to replenish it when on Elpis’ surface. At first, this mechanic seems interesting, but it doesn’t take long for it to get old. I’ve never suffocated to death in game, but running out of O2, or Oz, was annoying, especially when it could have been avoided by having more Oz stations around. The low gravity allowed you to jump to places you never would have imagined before, and it was fun trying to find new things, but the abundance of invisible walls made that get old too. The vehicles are even less interesting than the ones in Borderlands 2, especially the Moon Zoomy, and oftentimes I considered not even going for a vehicle at all. There are Moon Zoomy stations where if you get a Stingray and immediately boost, you’ll get stuck in the ceiling. This makes me wonder how much play testing was done on the game, but I’ll get to that in a moment.Guns are more of the same, except the E-tech weapons have been dropped and laser weapons added. Laser weapons are a direct upgrade over E-tech, as all laser guns are useful. Unfortunately, ammo costs more in this game, so filling up on laser ammo can wipe out your funds. The vending machines have a better selection in The Pre-Sequel, and it feels like you have a higher chance of getting a decent gun out of them. One thing that really bothered me about the machines, though, was the inclusion of the exact same Marcus lines in the Guns and the Bullets machines that Borderlands 2 had. That felt nothing short of lazy, especially since the design of all of the machines changed. I understand Marcus is the only gun supplier, and that’s fine, but new lines could have been recorded.Bugs are rampant in this game, and it’s a shame; on True Vault Hunter mode, Jack stopped moving for me and I had to reload the game. I read up on the bug and others had similar ones, and even ones where the moonshot would just break. Quest items could float away, NPCs could stop talking when they needed to, and the vehicles loved to get stuck on things. Oftentimes I would get stuck on a rock trying to walk as if the texture was just placed too high. All of this could have been avoided if more play testing had been done, and it really felt like the game was rushed at the end of development for some reason. Assets being re-used, like the Marcus lines for the vending machines, also prove development was short timed, and also prove a bit of laziness. I didn’t expect a whole new engine for this game, but it looks like Borderlands 2. I also noticed a lot of NPCs wearing helmets in space, which is fine and makes sense, but I do wonder if part of the reason for this was to save on animating their lips when they talked.Did I enjoy The Pre-Sequel? Yes. Would I recommend it? Not for $60. The gameplay is fun, but the bugs and lack of an immersing story make me suggest you wait for it to go on sale for $40 or less. Perhaps the DLC will change this, and I hope it does, but the shortcuts taken in developing this game make me worry. BULLET POINT SUMMARY – The Good    Playable characters are well developed and fun.    PCs will talk back to NPCs and co-op partners.    Butt slams are enjoyable and somewhat useful most of the time.    Still lootin’ and shootin’.BULLET POINT SUMMARY – The Bad    Zarpedon could really be fleshed out more, and be more threatening, a la Jack in BL2.    Oz/Oxygen is a pointless and tedious addition.    Game is very buggy.    Environment can get boring.    Story isn’t as engaging as BL2’s.    Too pricey for what it is right now.RATING: 3 out of 5 - Marking as RECOMMENDED since there is no neutral or numerical option on Steam.View original review with pictures: http://thatwritingthing.com/borderlands-pre-sequel-write-review/ "

												Great game at a bit of a steep price point. Only about 30 hours of content with no DLC for $60.Definitely pick up on sale if you get the chance.I'm just waiting for DLC to get released now because there's no real point in doing True Vault Hunter Mode, unless you like guns that are the same as the first playthrough just with bigger numbers.I recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played a Borderlands game yet, or to any hardcore fans of the Borderlands series. Otherwise you might want to stay away. The game is expensive and really it's just more of Borderlands 2 content with lasers and Cryo weapons and Australian accents as far as the eye can see.			"

												After dropping 200 hours into borderlands 2 and about 60 into the original game, I was excited to get a new set of charaters and a new world to play and loot in. Im sorry to say that Ive only made it to level 13 with my character (Jack). Im just not sucked into this game like I have been with the others. The outragous Australian Accents and unecessary O2/Ground Pound Addition is a huge turn off. Maybe Ill come back to this to finish it someday. but today is not that day.			"

												Just sad to see such a down grade in game play and execution. I really wanted to like the sequels to the original but they  just fall flat. The gravity system and constant lack of air makes exploring feel extremely tedious. The map design is just awful. You'll spend most your time slowly descending from space after hitting an invisible wall adding to the frustration of a bleedingly un-fun level/map design. Hit mechanics are off, AGAIN. The RPG element of shooting something point blank in the face with a GUN and ""missing"" is lost on me. Also for some reason they have cut out most the violence and foul language is bleeped which makes no sense for a M rated title. In all this is one of those vanilla sequels a producer had his ""mass marketing"" hand in too deep and this bland title was the result. After a handful of hours I already have uninstalled this hot mess and regret spending $20. Feel real sorry for the saps that bought this on launch. This is for sure the last nail in the coffin of this dying franchise.			"

												Borderlands 2 is a much better game.There isn’t very much for me to say about this really, the graphics, performance and gameplay have changed very little. This is a good thing, nothing much needed to change. However the story was not as compelling for me to complete, and I didn’t enjoy the betting as much. If you’ve never played a Borderlands game, start with 2 and see how you feel, it’s a much better value package. If you have played Borderlands 2 then it’s up to you, the gameplay is the same but with a worse cast of characters and areas. You will also get a lot less that you did with Borderlands 2, the season pass if not worth it for this game in my opinion. "

												It should be pretty forebodding that a game that's supposed to be a mindless addictant only lasted me about 25 hours. I will admit that most of the new stuff, like the laser and ice weapons, are pretty good, but that is not want arrests my attention. What arrests my attention is that almost nothing was improved from Borderlands 2, even the stuff that would take almost no effort to fix like summoned ""pets"" obstructing your menu. Speaking of the menu, it's still an absolute monstrosity, and probably my biggest problem with the game. The tutorial still sucks, the drop system is still flimsy with common loot and overspecialized with boss loot, there are still bullet sponge enemies everywhere, the lighting is still hard on the eyes, (though a little better because of the lack of variety), the frame rate is inconsistent, enemy level progression is all over the place, and the writing still sucks. What we have here is a Majora's Mask sequel's worst case scenario--a one-off game that with a gimmick that completely changes the way you play, but but is completely and totally inferior to the home series' ""mainstay"" games.

												Gameplay-wise, this is a slight improvement of BL2, nothing that's noteworthy, it just fixed some quirks that BL2 had. Getting weapons is a problem, BL:TPS has the lowest orange drops in the franchise as I see it, though your damage output it's somewhat scaled, sometimes an green weapon that's 5~6 levels below it's still causing quite some damage. That results in less farming, which can be good in a way, but not really what I'd expect for a Borderlands game.Still, what made me hate this game with a passion is the story. Borderlands was never a ""story-heavy"" franchise, but it always took itslef seriosly when it had to. Some characters were classic stereotypes, others were original, but they all were charismatic. Long story short, everyone in TPS is a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Even characters who were in the previous games suddenly are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cliched idiots (only exception being Athena), and every new character is a pile of overused tropes too annoying for anyone to like.My bottom line is that BL:TPS is sort os a good game on it's own right, but the problem of working on an existing franchise is that you expect they to maintain the aspects of the franchise you know. Gameplay-wise they did that, put some new things on the table while still keeping close to the real deal. But the story, the setting and characters... Ugh. I wish this wasn't canon. Just my rant though, feel free to give it a try with a discount, it's a fun game when played co-op.			"

												I will start by saying this is not as good as Borderlands 2, but they set that bar pretty high.That said, it is a fun game, I actually think the low gravity combat is really fun. Being set on a barren moon the game suffers from very dull and repedative settings in comparision to BL2. The writing is not quite as good, and I imagine the humor loses something outside of Australia.But I will reccomend this game, if borderlands 2 was 9.5, then this game is a 7. A 7 is respecatable. While I did role my eyes at some of the back and forth busywork fed ex missions, I still very much enjoyed my time with this game. However, where as I have played BL2 though perhaps a dozen or more times, I only played this through one time and it is doubtful that I will be back, though who knows...if my friends want to co-op it, I would return.

												A huge chunk of this game seems to have been directly copied from BL2. It really is just more of the same with some additions. These are first and foremost: • Unique character responses during the story depending on what characters are present• Laser weapons with four possible barrels that change the behavior of the gun dramatically (i.e. a solid beam or what is essentially a laser shotgun).• A cryo (ice) element for guns which replaces slag. You can freeze people and shatter them if you kill them while frozen. Attacks on frozen enemies do more damage.• ""Oz kits"", which replace the relics from BL2. Since you play a majority of this game on Pandora's moon and there's no atmosphere present you get these to, well, not suffocate. They also allow you to boost yourself once in the air and slam down on the ground if you're airborne, damaging all enemies within a certain radius. These mechanics are very helpful for navigating around since the gravity is even lower than it was in BL2.• (Obviously) new playable characters. Not going too in-depth on them; they all seem interesting and have appeared in the series before. So that's cool.Other than that there are no big changes. It really boils down to being a standalone expansion of BL2, so as for graphics etc. nothing has changed. Except maybe the writing. You can really tell which parts Anthony Burch wrote; his writing is even more cringe-inducing this time around. Luckily he's not the only writer so it's still fairly good and amusing most of the time.It really just boils down to being more Borderlands. I enjoyed BL2 a lot so this is exactly what I wanted out of the Pre-Sequel. Just more of the same with some additions sprinkled over it.If you haven't played any Borderlands yet or aren't a hardcore fan I'd strongly recommend picking up the GOTY whenever that comes out to get all the DLC as well.

												Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel (Shortened to BL:TPS) is kind of a mixed bag and overall interesting title added to the Borderlands series. The game relies more around the story than it does with the other titles but that doesn't make it bad at all (in my opinion more of an improvement).Gameplay 7/10: The game itself has four (six with DLC) classes that are completely different compared to the previous ten Vault Hunter playables, having a melee based tank to a dinky robot with 9-15 different action skills to getting to play (sort of) the main villain of the franchise. There is a new weapon type that expands even more within the Borderlands weapon diversity: lasers, which are always elemental and always do something different, ranging from a shotgun-esque laser to a railgun penetrating rifle. The relic slot is changed to an O2 Kit (Slang Oz Kit) which boosts your jumps, provides air, and gives you the ability to slam; an Area-of-effect attack around you amungst other effects that alter your slams, guns, etc.Now the flaws of the gameplay is other than what's listed above not much has changed, which has made people lovingly call this a ""DLC of Borderlands 2"". A majority of the enemies are similar to those in previous titles to the point where some bosses were very identical to the ones in BL2. One only other complaint is the amount of unfarmable bosses that drop Legendary Loot, and there are plenty of them in this game. This may be remedied by the fact that stores now hold Legendary equipment from time to time, but there's no easy farmable way to gain these weapons.Graphics 8/10: I absolutely love the visuals within the Borderlands franchise and I always feel Stylish graphics > Realistic, because the game becomes much more memorable. Borderlands has done this again with its traditional cell shaded styling. Shadows are barely a problem, while a majority of the characters' portrait artwork is greater than comparison with previous installments and less NPCs are found without their own portrait. The biggest flaw is that there isnt much of difference in terms of graphics between Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The Pre Sequel, making the game being an ""extended DLC"" joke more emphasised. Story 9/10: The story is honestly the best within the series, explaining the rise of Handsome Jack in more detail to the point where a lot of players (including myself) have sympathized with this character unlike the previous installment where a lot of people hated him for his actions. It shows  fairly good developement of Jack's psychopathy aswell as his extreme narcissism, making him a much more greater overall character now than before. You still interact with some of the vault hunters from Borderlands 1, Moxxi and other recognizable characters, while the references from other games and Borderlands humor is there aswell. Lastly, the dialogue within the story telling of Pre sequal is changed from Normal mode and the advanced difficulty; True Vault Hunter mode, which is a great touch from Gearbox.The lack of both Dr. Zed and Marcus (In person only) is my only flaw within the story, but Nurse Nina - the moon's doctor replacement- is not that bad of a addition to the game... In my opinion. On a side note, the majority of new characters being voiced by Australians have irritated a few players aswell, but it was barely a problem for me, personally.Difficulty 7/10: I never found the game to be difficult at all and I've played through a majority of the content. There isn't that one part where the game becomes truely frustrating, yet there isnt really a point when it's at the difficulty where it really gets the adrenaline going until endgame where enemy levels scale with yours. Overall, this game is great, but not as amazing as Borderlands 2, which truely set the bar for upcomming games. I recommend it to those who aren't easily annoyed by Australian voice actors, and really wish for a expansion on Borderlands' story, which it does very well at. Ofcourse, if you're one who prefers to play as the baddie than the good guy, this may also be for you!			"

												TL:DR at the very bottomThis game is mind numbingly boring. From start to finish it's bug, after bug, after bug. My favorite bug I had was when I had an important character bug out completely. She wouldn't update my quest log and even validating didn't fix it. I had to redo my entire save game which I've had to do a two or three times due to the same issues.The story isn't fun either. The characters are annoying to listen to relying solely on poor sexual humor that is as if a child wrote this script. Personally, I find the accents are trying too hard.Another annoying part of the dialogue is how hard they try to show their tolerance towards the LGBT community. Almost every character you run into is gay. It's fine to make your characters whatever sexual oritation you want, but what's not okay is pushing it so hard to make everyone and everything gay and reminding you every conversation. It's just trying too hard in the worst way possible.What about the gameplay? Are the characters fun and unique like in Borderlands 2? No, not really. Elements are kinda useless. Cryo (Slag replacement) is boring to use. Fire is usless when there's no oxygen. Corrosive is okay but I found myself not using it often. Shock is the most useful for the shields but it's not saying much. Gunplay is similar to Borderlands 2 but I never found it rewarding. Playing Athena and only using your shield and melee is amazingly easy. Whatever character you pick it feels like you're playing in god mode. Little to anything stops you which makes gameplay too easy and repetitive.I've played this game solo and with friends but even then nothing can keep me playing without needing breaks. It's so obnoxiously boring and unsatisfying.TL:DRI rarely could get the game to work, provide any sort of fun, or even give me a good ending. Jack's okay story is the only reason to grab it when it's on sale or something.			"

												as many other reviewers have stated, this game lacks alot of the 'fun' factor present in the previous 2 borderlands games.  it is an ok game, and is fun enough, but i can't see myself putting 2000 hours in like i did borderlands 2.  this has mostly to do with an uninspired environment, lack of enemy variety, and poorer writing.  i think moons are inherrently boring, so they had an uphill battle to start with.      while i felt jack was already a bit played out from borderlands 2, who's cleverness struck me as forced and juvenile oftentimes, his lines are now utterly predictable and mostly unfunny.  my assumption is that the writers at the australian leg of the company just arent as talented.     there are a couple of nice additions, which most reviewers have pointed out as well. the grinder is one, and butt-slamming is another. i hope these additions are carried over to borderlands 3, and i hope bl3 is at least as big and full and creative as bl2. as it stands, the lack of variety in areas and the boring writing/ lack of missions makes this game merely mediocre compared to the previous entries. i recommend it, but not wholeheartedly. it will help get you by til the next full entry (bl3) is finished. buy it on sale.tl/dr : great game compared to most other games in general, but not up to the previous bar set by borderlands and, especially, borderlands 2. buy it but wait for a steam sale or price drop, as 60 is clearly a price designed to discount for this game...

												Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is another loot shooter that's a way too similar to Borderlands 2 for its own good.The game is set between the two main Borderlands games and follows Handsome Jack's rise to power. Unfortunately the story is rather poorly written and the jokes are not nearly as funny as in Borderlands 2.Most of the action takes place on Pandora's moon Elpis. This means low gravity combat and oxygen managament for outdoor environments. In practice I didn't really care too much for either mechanic. Oxygen management in particular felt rather tedious without really adding anything to the game.The weakest part of the game, however, is the poor map and mission design. On outdoor maps it's way too easy to fall into holes and cracks that will insta-kill you. Furthermore, a lot of the missions require extensive backtracking. Combined, these two problems get old really quickly.The core gameplay is still fun, but overall it's hard to recommend the Pre-Sequel unless you have already played Borderlands 2 to death and are still left craving for more.I played through the game on Athena.The good:- Fun core gameplay- Nice visual styleThe bad:- Poor writing and the jokes are not funny- Visually boring outdoor environments- Oxygen management is tedious- Way too many cracks and holes that will insta-kill you- Extensive backtracking during missions			"

												This game was made to frustrate you intentionally. Every single quest boils down to being 90% waiting, where you either run back and forth essentially doing nothing particular, just hitting E at different spots. Little to no combat to spice it up, just running. Other quests put you in a sequence of opening doors where they talk for minutes while you stand at the door, waiting for it to open when they finish talking. The dialogue is incredibly boring on top of this, which makes it a miserable experience. The combat has good ideas with the more vertical combat, flying enemies, launch pads and high jumps. But the enemies seem to fly through floors and end up in spots where it is completely unpredictable. Its very unrefined, and so it feels like a lot of deaths are just simply unfair.Driving controls are completely broken, simply hitting the gas launches your car like you are boosting, leaving you with very little time to control. If you hit a slight hill or jump, you will more often than not land and instantly slide turning you around completely. This happens often before big jumps, and either drops you into instant death or just makes you have to drive back for distance to build speed again. Like i said, i believe this game was made frustrating and poor on purpose. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone over borderlands 2.			"

												I'm a big fan of Borderlands series and this game is I would say a big DLC for Borderlands 2. Of course that's not bad. Borderlands TPS adds gravity (BEST STUFF EVER!), laser weapons, new maps and characters! You'll also meet the characters (TINY TINA IS BACK GUYS!) from other Borderlands games! The graphics is good, but I think it needs to be updated in Borderlands 3 (or whatever it would be), gameplay is great as always (best to play with friends).I highly recommend this game whatever you've played a Borderlands game before or not. It's an awesome game for long long hours! you won't be regretted for sure!My rate: 9/10, see you in game!			"

												Game is awesome. For all the haters who say this game is BL2 in space: All the under the hood development of this game was probably recycled, but the visuals, dialogue, environments, and content is ALL new. They don't reuse any content from BL2 other than some weapons. The story and characters were surprisingly interesting and hilarious. Play BL2 and then this.			"

												Shallow and pointless. All the mechanics of Borderlands 2 without the fun. Each goal is like chasing a fart in a whirlwind. Round and round with confusing intro's. I am glad I waited to play this segment of Borderlands. I am not sure who this game caters to but it most certainly is not myself or anyone in my circle of gamers. I don't want to play as Sir Hammerlock's cousin or aunt or sister of red headed step child. Some good character scripting but for the most part, it's just lame. Try again 2K. I love Borderlands and hope to see another addition. Just not this one.			"

												Enjoy the crashes, there will be many.This game came out in 2014 and the dev' team STILL (as of mid 2016) havent fixed some of the graphix issues causing system crashes/freezes. Remedying this will mostly require a hard reset.FYI: Playing this on my old rig went rather smoothly, t'was a piece of trash thou (terrible frame rate, yada yada) but it worked. Even finished a whole playthrou of the game explaining why I have 150+hrs on record.Now that I got myself a new (trashy) hotness PC, I can't even play for 30 mins on medium/high video settings without my poor rig having agonising seizures every time I enter ANY gunfight.All this due to 2K admiting having issues with ""various graphics cards""...Best bet is to krank all graphix option to low with windowed resolution and just MAYBE you'll be able to enjoy a few hours of gameplay. That is if there is not any other app eating up the CPU/graphix card, do not even try to multi task while playing.Can you smell the BS? I sure can. The HELL Gearbox/2K? Get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together!Final word, TPS is a glorified DLC of BL2 having DLC itself filled with game breaking problems... Cheap as fudge, looks like it but sure dont taste like it.

												Wish there was a ""meh"" button...Basically, it explains everything that wasn't explained in Borderlands 2, such as:-Why Handsome Jack wears his mask-Why Threshers are on Pandora-Why Handsome Jack is a jerk-Where Wilhelm came from-What happened to Athena-Who really is the Sheriff of Lynchwood?-Why Hyperion changed their gun color scheme-How Jack came to power of the Hyperion Corporation (which was already sort of explained in Borderlands 2, but I guess that's not really canon anymore)-Where the vast majority of characters came from (Nakayama)DId any of this need to be explained? NOEach game needs a bit of mystery. Gamers don't need an entire game devoted to all this stuff. There's no more mystery with this stuff in Borderlands 2 anymore, which is a real shame. It's pretty obvious Gearbox made this as a way to pump more money into the Borderlands franchise, and not to add any real substance to the series.The gameplay, is Borderlands 2 but with low gravity and the ability to use the air in an oxygen tank to boost to higher areas, and get an edge over opponents. Virtually the same game.Characters are varied here,but I don't find most that interesting. Jack doppleganger is cool, but I don't care much for the other ones.Laser guns are cool. Just replaces E-Tech though, so...Final boss is cool, but the enemies are lame. Most are politcally corrected variations of existing enemies (Midget=Lil' Scav). No need for this change.If you like Borderlands 2, you'll love The Pre-Sequel. Just don't dig too deep, or you'll fall into a deep, spikey pit.EDIT: Took a look at the release date for Colonial Marines and this... This game came out about a year after Colonial Marines, which was basically a torpedo straight into Gearbox's face. I have no doubt in my mind that this game was created to ""cut losses"" from the gigantic financial and critical bomb that was A:CM, and to show that Gearbox ""still has it""EDIT 2: Also feels like a lot of humor was stripped out. Maybe it's still there, but the politically correct ""polish"" makes it hard to find.			"

												It's... just kinda lackluster. If you're thinking of buying this game, then just don't. Here, let me explain why.PROS:- The gameplay and character skilltrees.- The main characters can talk and sometimes interact with the story! (even though some characters do that in some DLC's of the second game, it's a nice touch)- The rise of a great villain, experience it first hand!- Laser weapons? Cryo element? Sign me up!Now, those aren't very many pros.CONS:- The humor. It's just... gone. There's no FEEL. No special Borderlands 2 TOUCH.- The dialouge is just ""go here, do that, gonna tell you this, haha lol butts, go here etc.""- The gameplay is EXACTLY. THE. SAME. There's no difference in pretty much anything!There's not much else to say. It feels like an expansion pack of Borderlands 2. I can't say that it's worth the price tag that they put on it. I'd go for more of a 20 bucks expansion DLC. That'd be something else, becuase that's what it would be worth.If you like Borderlands as a game series, you're gonna be a little dissapointed. If you're here for the gunplay and farming of legendaries, you'd be a little dissapointed too. They removed bossfarming at release. That's when I played it. What's different now? Not much, I'd wager.If anything, I just recommend Borderlands 2. Buy that instead. It's more worth your time.			"

While also knowing that paying for this game would not be worth the hefty 60$.... it would be worth more like 5$... why? Heres why-The UI is exactly the SAME as BL2-There are the SAME annoying quest mechanics that you had to deal with in BL2-The New-U Stations and Ammo Vendors use the SAME dialogue lines-Funny invisible walls that will leave you puzzled-Cruddy Pop-Culture references-Playable characters now have scripted lines, removing the immersion and aspect of the role-play genreThis ""game"" feels like im replaying BL2, and that's not even right because this is a PRE-SEQUELYeah, sure bunny hopping in space and slamming people with your♥♥♥♥♥♥dealing damage seems fun...

												I've tried to like this game, really I have, it's just not for me.   If you are really interested in the Borderlands story it's a good buy, but if you are looking for essentially the next big borderlands game you'll be dissapointed.  It has the general feel of a borderlands 2 DLC with content taken away from it and replaced by characters that don't seem to make much sense, in a world (or in this case moon) that doesn't really feel like a game created in the same spirit the previous borderlands games had.  There are quite a few good and interesting additions I would like to see in Borderlands 3 such as beam weapons and the grinder for recycling weapons, but there are too many gripes I personally have to really enjoy this game.Everybody is Australian and I mean EVERYONE except for a small handful of characters.  If there is some sort of lore behind this please ignore my post, but I feel like this was meant to have some sort of humor element added to the game, which it does at first but gradually just becomes annoying.  The reason for this is because this particular game in the series was made by a different development team based in Australia.Basically what I'm getting at is the game doesn't feel like a Borderlands game.  The things that the Borderlands franchise are known for seem to be hilariously exagurated, which if you can believe it actually becomes a bit too much in my opinion.If you really really REALLY like the Borderlands franchise enough to where you can't stand to not play one of the games, go ahead the game is probably for you, but if you're just looking for another game to pass the time please don't make the same mistake I did and drop the full amount on the game.It's fun, but about $20 worth of fun.

												This was a refreshing 'restart' to the series after the meme-laden travesty of writing that was Borderlands 2. (and that is coming from someone who played through every dlc, every difficulty multiple multiple times for each character. Grindfest of death and Overlevel 8 x4)This brings in old characters, actually gives them points of view, histories, they flesh it out a bit. Eridians are still mysterious, so sorry if you were expecting them to be explained more in depth in this one.The pacing is actually great. You don't get horribly bored with sidequests - they provide what you usually need - a slight boost in xp here, a good weapon upgrade there to proceed along the main storyline with relative ease. The drop rate has improved as well - no more months of waiting for the glimpse of an orange; you can actually see oranges in vending machines and boss fights (as well as a guaranteed orange in a sidequest reward). Not to mention Gearbox spams golden keys so you can have at least decent purples as you level up. The best redeeming quality to me honestly? The final boss fight. It actually FEELS like what a boss fight is supposed to be. Just the right amount of frustrating difficulty and the sense of accomplishment as you pull a Face McShooty on it.Tl;dr: If you hated 2, give this one a go. This one feels like the natural successor.			"

The side quests and character dialogue throughout the game was very fun to listen to. I havent played enough of the game to judge it as a whole.Attaining weapons through drops and crates/boxes makes attaining weapons more fun. The different stats and abilities the weapons provide adds a certain uniquness to YOUR character. Attaining weapons isn't as much of a grindfest as that of Destiny, so I do enjoy that.As of right now I really do enjoy this game and will ask my buddies to join in on the fun.			"

 It's good! ...If by good, you mean okay. Sorry, guys, it just doesn't stand up when compared to Borderlands 2. It's a great game, but other games blew me away in 2014, and this was my own personal most anticipated title. It fell well short of being breathtaking. Maybe the DLC content will make the overall purchase worthy of the full cost of admission. Again, it's not bad.Compared to a lot of the other crap out there, it's really good! However, due to the bar set by Borderlands 2, and certainly by the hype that they put behind the Pre-Sequel, it doesn't stand up. Having to keep track of your oxygen level is kind of dumb, and unless you're playing NIsha, you're going to have a REALLY hard time getting through the game on even a basic level. The vending machines are actually useful now, and laser weapons are awesome. These are two positive aspects. I need to compliment the graphical quality, as well. There was nothing broken, and they didn't fix it. Optimization could've been better, but that might get fixed with subsequent updates. The largest drawback is that there's no clearly defined borders to the maps (..ha, but seriously); you may find yourself just walking along and then BAM you're dead, because something was on the mini map, and it looked like you were able to walk on it, and as it turns out - you weren't. Good, but a disappointment.Make me weep. Oh well, still going to play the crap out of it. Borderlands 2 is better. 7.5/10			"

 Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel  It is not excellence production and differs in many ways from the second part, however, you should give this game a chance. The story according to me is great and it tells the story of most liked antagonist Handsome Jack, who was not so bad as we thought. The gameplay in many ways has not changed. IT is still a cooperative game for 4 people. Characters to choose from in the game is Athena, Wilhelm, Nisha and Gragtrap, Each of these characters has their own unique abilities that we can develop in any diffrent way. What has changed is surely location. This time we visit the Elpis and for that we will have to consider the amount of oxygen. Also they added laser weapon and we visit the Hyperion base, Helios 1. Visually, nothing has changed, still a comic graphics. According to me, it is a nice production for playing with friends, interesting story missions and a large amount of secondary quests increases the time of a game. However, playing alone can be boring at some point. Personally, I recommend this game and if you already have the previous parts from this series, then you can can purchase it very cheaply in the package on steam sale.  "

												Borderlands The Pre Sequel, is Borderlands 2 with a bit of dlc. However, that does not mean it is a bad game. If you liked any of the Borderlands I guarantee you will like this game. As a person who didn't completely spam the hell out of the Borderlands series I really enjoyed this new addition. It informs us of how certain things came around.Gameplay- is enjoyable, it however can be enoying when you die all the time, which WILL happen.Co-op- makes the game so much harder but a good laugh if you dont lag.Changes- OZ kits, lasers, maps.Fun, OP/FUN, annoying parkour.Story- is not compelling until late game but when you see it all it makes you think. (BADASS)Overall, decent game. Don't buy it if your not a fan of Borderlands and/or if you haven't played any of the other Borderlands.			"

												i don't think the game is worth more than $50 but it is worth playing (i've clocked 480hours so far), so wait until the game is on a good sale. Also,i wouldn't bother with all of the DLC as most of it is not used  but i would reccomend the Claptastic Voyage, Dopleganger and Barroness packs (don't really need the level cap to be too high as there's not enough content and you'll end up just grinding to get to level 70.My biggest annouance about this game was how the game keeps making you wait for long winded dialogue (you almost always have to wait blocked in small areas in front of locked doors until characters have finished talking). This really slows the game down and some of the dialogue really isn't interresting or funny so it becomes a bit frustrating after the 4th playthrough (which is relatively short). Also, the game doesn't have enough content and will not go through the kind of expansion borderlands 2 went through. I'm really not reccomending this one unless you can get it with for cheap.As far as this game goes bridging 1 and 2, it doesn't really answer any questions. In fact my friends and I often talked about how this game doesn't really fit into the story very well at all, It avoids answering questions like how Jack came to power, it confuses and conflicts with the established plot and doesn't make a lot sense. It ends up raising more questions than answering them.i originally posted a similair review in Oct 2015 wich i edited again in December 2016 after i revisited the game with a friend (the game is better with friends); but I still feel the same way. playing the game feels like a grind and i'd much rather play borderlands 2.

												Ok, after having completed the game on the first playthrough I will write my review.People seem to be giving this game a lot of crap for ""no new game engine"" ""it's to short"" ""it's to expensive"" etc. etc.Firstly, they don't need a new engine for this game, they have a good formula with what they have done in the past and I see no reason to change that, the game looks great for us PC players, not sure how consoles look.  As the saying goes, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.""Now, this game IS shorter than Borderlands 2 BUT I did every single side quest with the exception of like 6 on my first playthrough and that took me 18 hours,  Now, playthrough times for everyone will vary, I don't speed run through but I don't take my sweet time either.  That being said, minimum of 2 playthroughs for max level, grinding for gear, etc. you absolutely will get your $$$ worth out of the game. Is it a 60$ game?  That depends greatly on the person, I personally would get enough time out of the game to make it worth the 60$ price tag, other people might not, it's all on what you view as worthwhile. My personal rule for games is 1$ per hour of game time makes it worth it for me, got the game through Green Man Gaming for 45$, I'll do that with just the first character easily.TL:DR - In my opinion the game is worth the time and money, enjoy the pre-sequel.  It ties the first 2 games together nicely.			"

												I _love_ the Borderlands game but I don't like this game at all. I put 13 hours in the game and had to stop playing because it's just painfully boring. The game feels incredibly clunky, half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and sloppy. There are glitches and bugs everywhere and it feels like an unfinished DLC, NOT a full release title. I cannot recommend anyone buying this game unless it went on sale for $10.Yes, bugs and glitches can be fixed and maybe some of them have but it wouldn't change the way the game feels. Having some backstory on Jack is cool and all but the game just isn't any fun. It's missing the soul of what Borderlands is.			"

												This is the worst Borderlands game in the series but is not actually a bad game. It does everything a good game should do right with good characters,good classes,good story and so on. It fails because it does everything wrong for a good Borderlands game. It lacks end game content aside from two bosses who don't drop anything noteworthy,after your first or second playthrough going through the story isn't fun anymore unlike Borderlands 2. Aside from the odd uniques and one or two legendaries the guns are the exact same as Borderlands 2 with lasers being a good but under developed addition. Also the majority of guns you either have to get as a world drop or from the grinder since loot midgets no longer exist and the majority of legendaries aren't actually dropped from a boss. As for the DLC aspect of this game it didn't help much. The Holodome was a worse version of the arenas from BL2 that was shipped with 10 levels which due to the scaling issues and lack of areas to farm XP you need to use gibbed to get to level 60 and its even worse for level 70. However the Claptastic Voyage DLC was one of the best things Gearbox has made which actually addressed many of the issues with TPS but the scale of the addressing was too small to actually do anything major along with it being too late to save the game. Once 2K Australia went under work on another DLC was stopped and the game left in a very bad state.If you aren't a big Borderlands fan you might enjoy this game but if you're a big fan of the series and are thinking of picking this up wait till its on sale or just ignore it completely.

												Through the time I've spent on this title, it has become clear to me that it's not what it was hyped to be. Yes! It's still a fun game, though certain aspects of the game are frusterating or even annoying. Like having to manage how much air you have, having to mange the gravity difference. Driving a bunch of terrible cars. Playing with a bunch of characters who are all mainly situational or just terrible all together. Don't let this make it seem like the game is unplayable, it's still another fun and great Borderlands game! In my opinion Borderlands 2 will still remain the best out of the series. Though your still able to complete endless side quests, complete the main story line and get to KILL STUFF! Do note: I make this review sound really negative when I do truly enjoy the game. I was just expecting better.Overall I would give this game a positive review, though there are flaws to the game. It's still fun, I would recommend picking it up on a great sale. 8.5/10			"

												This is a game that I hold very dear to my heart so early after the launch. But let me set things straight first. This game is definitely not for everyone. If you can't stand repetition or re-skinned enemies or similar levels in a game then maybe look somewhere else but chances are if you are here you are interested in this style of game, which still has a few of the broblems from the first games in the series.  Ok now that that is done, I can enjoy telling you about how amazing this game is. I absolutely loved borderlands 1, and when 2 came out I was extremely excited. I played that game a ton, and for me it never got old. One thing that I can already say is that if you enjoyed borderlands 1 and 2 you will definitely have no regrets about buying this game, since it is pretty much the same thing. A lot of people say that this is a bad thing, but to many fans of the series it is definitely not. As soon as you start the game you are immersed in this world that you get pulled into, much the same as the other games. The new features such as double jumping, low gravity and BUTT STOMPS are pretty damn cool and after playing with them for a while they become part of your play style and add even more to the experience. If you are still not sure about buying this game, then go buy borderlands 2 for much, much cheaper and play it with some friends. If you enjoy that enough that you think you would want to play some more of the same style of game, then Borderlands: the pre-sequel is a game for you.			"

												Summary: Fun with friends, good graphics, fun art style, interesting guns, maps, and characters.                  Horrible quests/missions, too much ""unlock this for me i can't do it"", too much backtracking, too much map navigation for meaningless objectives, drawn out gameplay, no memorable bosses, dry and tedious NPCs, lots of fetch quests, boring humor, too time consuming for simple tasks.I have always been a Borderlands fan, but this game was disappointing. I enjoyed the map desgins but most of it felt clunky and repedative as I found myself backtracking 95% of the time. Not to mention the fact that the majority of the areas do not have fast travel so you have to run through WAVES of enemies, reach you objective, only to be told that you have to run back or go to another meaningless objective, only to find out that the enemies you literally just spent 15minutes killing, have respawned. The bosses and characters are just plan boring, I spent more time trying to ignore the overly annoying characters and bosses.If you were looking for good bosses with loot, then you're going to be disappointed. I played solo, and the bosses were just insanely difficult. (yes I was the recommended level for the boss fight) Someitmes during the boss fight I would ask myself, ""Why am I fighting this boss? What is the point of this boss?"" Not to mention they are bullet sponges, horrible bullet sponges with endlessly spawning enemies. I ended up deciding to call boss fights, ""Endless waves of low levels with 1 overpowered high level"". For example, at level 26 you end up fighting a flying boss similar to the BUNK-3R from BL2, but you are encountered with 8x the enemies on the battle grounds with almost no cover. Not to mention their is no timer between mob kills. You kill the dude shooting at you, aaaand he instantly respawns, while fighting a boss that takes 75% of your ammo to kill it. "

												Do not buy this game now. The story and gameplay? Pretty good. Except there's so many things that make the whole game just bad and not worth $60. Most of the maps are either huge and empty moon terrain with a couple craters along the way, OR a Hyperion/Dahl base. You can fall through the map if you try hard enough (it's not very hard) and there are glitches everywhere. Then there's the vehicles. You literally cannot use them as of now, as when you get into one, you lose a good deal of your skills due to a bug. Almost 2 months after release and it's still not fixed. There's another glitch that is triggered once in a while when you get frozen by cryo weapons. Sometimes you will be slowed down permanently, even after the debuff ends, until you save & quit. Same for this one, 2 months after release and it's still there. Then there's the dialogue. Characters keep cutting themselves over and over. And don't even get me started on the end game, this is the #1 issue right now. 80% of all bosses don't respawn. Yes, even the ones with set loot like a legendary weapon. You basically need to use the grinder to get the legendaries you want. It's a looter shooter game in which you cannot farm for loot. How ♥♥♥♥ed up is that? Ah yes, and when one of the rare bosses that is farmable is too easy to kill for the amount of loot they give, the devs decide to nerf their lootpool, what the ♥♥♥♥? Then there's the ONLY raid boss in the game (Borderlands 2 had 2 raid bosses without DLC), who's basically the final boss with more health. There's no way to be lazier than this. Coming up next, the DLC. There's only 4 DLC's coming, all included in the season pass. I bought the season pass myself before knowing that there would only be 1 Campaign, 2 new characters and 1 level cap. This is nothing, and definitely not worth 30 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars. In conclusion, do not buy this game unless it's like 10 bucks or less, that's my advice. This game even taught me a lesson to never preorder games before reviews are out for the game. Borderlands 2 was not a perfect game but my 550+ hours on it made this purchase feel safe. ♥♥♥♥ me, I wasted 90 bucks on this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥Edit 1/27/2015: Skills bug with cars has been fixed, and they announced that all bosses will be respawnable in a month or two, but a bunch of issues are still in the game so I still wouldn't recommend buying this game yet.

												I wanted to like this game, and to a large degree, I do. Broadly, it's an entertaining bit of story, has some fun circumstances and the solid gunplay we've come to expect from the series. Given the time for development I wasn't expecting as drastic a change as from the first to second Borderlands. The new gameplay mechanics help to freshen the experience. Exploring the cracked moon of Elpis yields some amazing vistas.However, after scratching the surface of The Pre-Sequel, it's the details are what get to me. My main beef is treatment of gravity, effects of guns in low-G and the abosolute disregard for being in the vacuum of space. It may as well have been set under water for all that the oxygen kit element adds. While the antagonists get to fly around jet-pack styles the player does not, being limited to some Super Mario double-jump/butt smash shenanigans while trying to integrate anti-asphyxiation into combat tactics. I'll not get into the rediculousness of running around suitless on a moon with so minor of consequences as presented.The story could use a bit more meat in some areas and lot less parade of cameos in others.Fetch quests are a difficult thing to get right, and this game failed, as far as I'm concerned. Too many, too frequent and in such a compact place as Elpis was made to be.I find it difficult to recommend this game, at least at AAA pricing. "

												Borderlands!! The series with over the top humor and ridiculous shiz in general. But does TPS bring anything new/better to the table than its predecessors? Or at least better enough to justify a full-priced purchase? Well, the answer to that is no.While it has some new mechanics such as the ""butt stomp"" and the whole new Oz kit that also serves as a half-as jet pack booster, the innovations for this game ends there. BL2 was my first borderland title, so that's the game I'm comparing TPS to in this review.Here are just a few aspects of the game I'd like to discuss...----Plot----One of the two things I'd say that really keeps TPS a viable successor of BL2 is the plot. For BL fans, we all know this game is centered around the events that transformed Employee Jack into the loveable ""villain"" Handsome Jack. Did the game do a sufficient job at telling us the events that lead to Jack going mad? Of course. Did they do a great job? No, not really. I say this because this game has a BUTT ton of uninteresting dialog. What's worse is, you have to sit there doing nothing while listening to characters talk to each other. In TPS, I found myself hopping around some stationary character half the time they had minute (literally) long conversations with somebody else. It not only kills the flow of the game, it felt like they just didn't bother to streamline the dialog. They were just cramming plot in the form of bunched dialog into the game in chunks that could have been executed much more elegantly. BUT WHO ARE WE KIDDING, this is BL after all, not a series particularly known for their story telling. More importantly, Jack seems to have lost his swag in TPS. At first, how normal and sane he sounded (and the contrast that made between BL2 Jack) made me very hopeful that there was going to be some unforgettable mind-blowing plot twist somewhere down the line, and I was sincerely looking forward to that. Don't get me wrong...there was a plot twist... but holy crap it came in the form of a dialog conversation while I hopped around some stationary character (this time being Jack) again like previously mentioned. Not. Even. A. Flippin'. Cut scene. For one of the biggest moments in BL history. That just SCREAMS laziness beyond anything else from the creators of TPS.His lines were not memorable like the ""what should I name this diamond pony, oh Buttstalion"" line in BL2. Dialog overall just felt dry in TPS, I didn't find myself looking forward to what ridiculous thing the characters were going to say like I did in BL2. Furthermore, the ending is a shameless cut scene that sets up TPS for an uncanny amount of DLC. I don't have a problem with DLCs, the more the merrier as long as they have quality content, but the last ending cut scene just felt so out of place from the rest of the game that there is no doubt it was put there JUST for DLC. But why am I complaining, at least it was a cut scene ending. Sigh.----Characters----If 2k Australia did anything right with TPS, it'd be the 4 new playable vault hunters. Every single one of them are unique in their own ways and hold up very well compared to previous playable vault hunters from other BL titles. Yes, some of the skill sets from the skill trees are recycled, but they are still different enough that it feels like a brand new experience playing with a new Vault hunter. Now, if we talk about NPCs... TPS's NPCs are so... soo... sooo.. boring compared to BL2. Marcus, Moxxi, Mr.Torgue, so on so forth in BL2 all had a very over the top distinct personality that grabbed your attention every time they had something to say. TPS is lacking interesting characters. The most interesting one of them all would probably be nurse Nina. Which says a lot about how interesting the NPCs are in TPS when you only interact with her like.. once and talk to her a few times before her dialog is exhausted. Almost everyone else in TPS are too *coughboringcough* to be memorable.----Gameplay----Aside from the new cryo element, lazer weapons, and butt stomping... it plays like the same dam game as BL2. The Oz Kit ""jet pack"" sorta thing combined with the low gravity gives the game a more dynamic feel to it while you're shooting reskinned skags on the moon and it is quite fun shooting things while being airborne. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! You don't spend the entire game on the moon where there is low gravity! In fact you spend a lot of time OFF the moon. So what does that mean? It means you get put in a place where gravity is a factor again. Which means none of that jetpack, butt stomping thing that's supposed to breathe new life into this title matters anymore. Cause you can't fly up high enough to use execute a butt stomp. At that point it's literally BL2 again. This really boggled my mind, why would you create new mechanics for this title and then STRIP it away from the player for a substantial amount of the game? It could have been as easy as saying the gravitational pulling system (or whatever you'd call it) on the hyperion lazer station (pardon my lack of knowledge of knowing all the names of places) is BROKEN, so that's why you're still all floaty on the space station so that you'll still be able to bring back all these gameplay mechanics that players were introduced to at the beginning of the game. But NOOOOO~ SUCK ON THAT PLAYERS, have some GRAVITY. Ugh. I'm never doing that again. (ha)Guns in TPS are what you would expect from BL2. In fact they are pretty much copy pasted here from BL2. They still feel great, the lazers shoot great, eh you get the idea. The UI is exactly the same so... I guess they were too lazy to update even that just to give the players some sense of ""oh look, a new BL game that actually looks new"". They did, however, add a new Oz meter below your health and shield meters. Mind-blowing, I know.----Atmosphere----I know this game is no Dead Space or The Last of Us where the atmosphere of the game is breath taking, nor will the atmosphere in a BL game make or break the game, but TPS is lacking hard when it comes to atmosphere. Ha, it's not cause we're on the moon either. Anyways...In BL2 the sheer diversity of areas and the colors of the landscape and sky paired with the music when you run into enemies really gave me a positive gaming experience. It felt like I was actually on an adventure through different regions of Pandora trying to stop this lunatic called Handsome Jack from killing everybody for god knows what reason...but we do now (yay). TPS lacks the color and diversity of different regions BL2 had. It was just moon, more moon, Hyperion Station, Ice, and Moon. ----Conclusion----In conclusion, TPS felt like a lazy and empty title throughout for me.It is sub-par compared to BL2, which is why I didn't recommend this game. It had a lot of potential but little of it was really brought out. But at the end of the day, did I have fun playing it? Yes. This game doesn't suck. I've clocked in for nearly 60 hours now, and I had fun shooting things to death in the game with a co-op partner. Maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe I was just expecting TPS to bring BL to another level, even if it was by just a bit, but TPS was honestly kind of a letdown. TPS is the game to quench the thirst of BL addicts who want some more BL action even if it meant putting BL2 on the moon. It's the hopping stone between BL2 and BL3 (If there's gona be BL3). It's a game to keep us busy for the time being before the BL creators think of something that'll really take this series to the next level. So if you're into shooting things to death mindlessly with friends and don't really give a crap about the story (that TPS was pretty much centered around), by all means get this game! If you want to play and experience a true Borderland experience, I'd go with Borderlands 2 instead.But everything is IMO, so it's still up to you! Have a Nice Day!			"

												Overpriced BL2 DLC : The best thing that 2K Australia did was their variation of the 2K logo.After watching the opening cinematic, I had a gut wrenching feeling that I had just wasted $60+ on a knock off. Unfortunately, the next few hours into the game only made me realize my instinct was dead on. FYI, introducing a poorly voiced character with a hard to understand accent who basically says Americans are stupid, is a poor way to lead into your game. For the player to then realize that most of the characters all have the same accent just destroys any immersion we had.This should be a lesson to other studios out there. When your flagship IP is handled by an amazing studio and then gets passed off to a mediocre one to milk it, we can all tell. Follow Pixar's example and when you see something is just bad, REWRITE IT. Didn't Colonial Marines teach anything?I'm a huge Borderlands fan and was looking forward to this release. I didn't want to see any major changes or overhauls, just wanted more of the same awesome thing. Problem is, the writing in this is flat at best. The pacing of the humor is entirely off. Lines said too quickly without any impact, or just of poor taste to begin with.We get it, Australians believe Americans are stupid and they think that's fine to put in the game. However they censored a lot of other things they thought would be offensive, yet insulting their largest target market was deemed ok. I can understand why the impression of us is negative, but if we're going to generalize a nation of people then your penal colony production facility isn't any better, just cheaper to use and less successful at everything.On top of it, you're just not funny. Really. You took a stellar IP and basically turned it into a B movie-direct-to-video production. Congratulations.Low gravity is a gimmick and becomes just an annoyance. Oz kits are basically just relics with a different name to remind you where this garbage was produced.Characters are flat, none of the new playable toons really have any desirable qualities that feel new outside of Claptrop who ironically copies other toon's abilities. Mordecai became Gauge and now becomes Wilhelm. Salvador is a chick now. Not even bothering Miss Captain America and no siren this time around. Speaking of sirens.... Where's Angel? Major plot hole.

												Well it's Borderlands, and the gameplay is exactly what you've come to expect from the genre: it will make you happy.What completely and utterly ♥♥♥♥s this game in the zero-G♥♥♥♥♥♥ is that some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thought it would be a GREAT idea to have it voiced over largely by the most ocker Australian 'voice actors' they could find.SON OF A TAINT!It's sickening, and as an Aussie, it's embarrassing and nothing short of groan-worthy.It's sad because you're in it not just for the loot, but the clever dialogue of the previous games - which I've not seen as yet - and the delivery in those accents (See: Stever Irwin, Noni Hazelhurst and Paul Hogan) honestly make me want to stab myself in the ear with a rusty digeridoo... no really... the death throws of a syphilitic, acid-tripping, deep-throating dropbear digging crusty crabs out of Tony Abbott's budgie smugglers would be a more pleasant sound.Yep.

												Disappointing. The quality of supporting characters is poor (Pickle = the Jar Jar of borderlands), the dialogue is unengaging at best, jimmy rustling at worst. The player characters are well made dialogue wise, skill wise, etc. (except claptrap.), and the plot isn't terrible.Jacks ""character development"" is shaky, as he just seems to go from 0-60 evulz past the first level, and the continuity of the series is stretched a bit, particularly in Lilliths, Rolands and Moxxis involvement in the story, which would logically affect how jack treats them in bl2, however in bl2 he treats them as minor annoyances. Equally, how Lillith treats jack in pre sequel is completely counter to how she does in bl2.Weapons are mediocre, being exactly the same manufacturers (they even didn't change the word ""Bandit"" to ""scav"" in the game files), lasers are badly balanced, cryo is pretty much just a rehash of slag with a little immobility added, and oz kits are just relics but with a timer that counts down to you dying. There are two vehicles in the game, one is a reskin of the Runner from bl2, and the other is just the Manta from UT3. The only difference is that the Manta from UT3 is actually elegant wheras its copied counterpart handles stupidly and its own jump and butt-slam gimick is clumsy and ineffective.The sexuality of the characters was very, very forced. I started to take shots every time Janey Springs announced she was a lesbian, just in case we'd forgotten. On the subject of gender politics, male characters were shown to be homophobes, lonely creeps, or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s more often than not. When compared to the female characters who are shown in a much, much better light, it leaves a little bad taste in your mouth, which didn't help me to overlook the previous flaws.Finally, as the game starts from the end of BL2, it's impossible to play either game in any order, without getting spoilers for the other game, so anyone deciding to play in chronological order (Borderlands, Borderlands Pre-Sequel, Borderlands 2) is gonna have spoilers for BL2, and anyone playing in release order (Borderlands, Borderlands 2, Borderlands Pre-Sequel) is gonna have spoilers for Pre-Sequel.Best aspect of this game? The mapping for Helios Station was incredibly refreshing, the interior and exterior aspects.Worst aspect of this game? The first boss. It tries to go with a ""So bad it's good"" vibe ""(Kill this guy ^)"", but it's just lame.			"

												I really wanted to like this game but unfortunately after playing it some time it ceases to be enjoyable. The story falls short of expectations and is a bit dull and unrealistic character developtment. Quests become repetitive and grindy straight away in a smaller area than previous Borderlands games makes for stale action. Especially when you've become stronger than enemies in any given area. If you get to a new quest hub and get a load of underleveled quests (which has happened several times) it doesn't become enjoyable. The new characters and skills seem solid but the action becomes slow paced and boring quickly. Zero gravity doesn't really add anything groundbreaking to the franchise. It feels like it is missing the fun story of Borderlands 2 and the enjoyable gameplay of Borderlands. Also even though this was made by a small studio a little QA goes far and the game is really buggy, with enemies disappearing through walls and jumping issues and things going mental for no reason. All I can say really is give it a miss.			"

												What does this game need more of? MORE STEREOTYPES!Don't play this game if you're Australian. The okker voice acting is painful to the ears.For an Australian company to produce this, it almost feels like it's rascist.  It isn't, but they should feel ashamed of themselves.The level design is amazing.  Low G combat with air boost is awesome.  New laser weapons are really cool.If you think the Aussie (okker) accent is funny you must play this game.Further, personal, gripes.  Ice weapons make it impossible to see. 1 death from combat, 100 from vehicle control problems.  Auto item pickup radius needs to be larger in Low g.  No Dr. Zed! Weapon with with melee blade, still use default melee animation.Enemies just spawn on top of you so sniper rifles are useless and combat goes from tactical to frenetic.With all the crap happening to your HUD hit markers get lost and you will be searching wildly for where that hit came from.I don't know about ""Butt-Slams"" but I know a ""Ground-Pound"" when I see it.There's so much back-tracking that the wild animals level with you.A man and a company named Torque weren't enough. Let's add a monster called a Tork.The gameplay is great, just like Borderlands 2 but with some additions, I cannot recommend this game for all the other faults.			"

												Low-gravity jumps, butt-slams, airborne vehicles (somewhat), grinder, characters finally alive (with their own dialogue and interactions), skill points from level 3, loot caves, pop culture references, Claptrap, GOODD.Little content, missions becoming tedious (run from point A to C - collect stuff X - go to point B - go back to point A to solve some crap issues - go to point B again etc), non-respawnable bosses, areas not staying blacked-out when you haven't discovered them (bad for Steam cheevos), lackadaisical raid bosses, used humor, BADDD.All in all, Borderlands TPS can be considered as a huge expansion to Borderlands 2, rather than being a strong individual sequel to the series. I do not recommend it to players due to its pricing, but it is nevertheless a good game that Borderlands fans should pick up. For the rest? Pick it up during a sale; Steam does it so often that you probably don't have to wait long anyway. "

												All the maps are new, albeit they contain many, many recognisable items from BL2. There are a few new items, but they tend to look a little out of place and not finished with the same artistic flair that made BL2 such a visual treat. Same with the creatures and weapons. The new ones tend to look a little amateurish and in general most have just had a paint-job. Voice acting is pretty diabolical. Lol. Gameplay has undoubtedly improved, but the battles are still very unbalanced. It’s more balanced than in BL2, but they have made the sniper critical hits too effective now. Why is it they never seem to be able to get this right?As per usual, the enemy have far more health than you. While it may take dozens of shots to beat them, they can cause immense damage to you with just one shot. This makes for very frustrating play. I am amazed that Gearbox never sorted out the terrible game mechanics. The new weapons are fun, but I do think they should have re-worked all the weapons.  Much of the excitement of the game is looting weapons, and too many of them are exactly the same as in BL2.  They did, however, rework the skills, class mods, and various boosts, adding some nice touches in the way of purchasable boosts.  Most of the new maps aren't too well designed. Some having no way back to “sanctuary”. One of the nice features of the original games is that in almost all circumstances you could get back to safe territory relatively easily, should you need to re-supply or level up to defeat a boss. Not the case in this game – it can be very difficult indeed to retrace your steps and consequently much harder than it should be to defeat some bosses if you happen turn up to the fight at too low level or with the wrong equipment. I managed to get one character stuck because it’s level was too low compared to the enemy and had no ammo or appropriate guns, with few options to get back to a safe haven to re-equip or level up. Play is overall easy. I was able to complete most of the game five or six levels below the enemy. With the exception of one, that was true of the bosses too....most are very easy. The final boss just takes time, but having said that, it is good fun. Even in raid mode it's easy, but still good fun.Don’t forget that despite all my criticisms Borderlands is hilarious fun and it remains one of the best coop team games out there. That fact alone is enough for a very large number of people to buy this game. All of the new characters are good, claptrap has been very well implemented - especially his special skills which are pretty hilarious. Should you buy it? I think people will have very mixed views. The game is good, but it's not really different to BL2 and it's way, way too short for the money. I'm going to say no, becuase I can't say maybe! Whatever, but if you do buy it then at least wait until the price comes down.			"

												TL;DR: The game is like a stripped down BL2; it's worth the asking price but don't expect another home run.Don't let all of the hype and advertising persuade you, the Pre-Sequel is not an evolution of Borderlands 2. It is a sort of horizontal upgrade; while you get the new Cryo element, double jumping, and an all new story, this is at the expense of Slag and a worthwile endgame boss, and the whole affiar is half the length of Borderlands 2. Borderlands the Pre Sequel is extremely samey to Borderlands 2, so if you enjoyed that game then you're in good shape. However, the story is a little weaker, the humor a little more forced and the level designs are linear and drab (except for one particular area which is extremely vertical, leading to a lot of confusion when trying to navigate). However many of the parts of Borderlands 2 that were important to endgame play like boss farming have been stripped down or outright removed. Many side quest bosses are killable only once, however it is impossible to cap out without completeing at least a few of them, so those drops are lost. some legendaries simply have no drop location, so the only way to get them is from the new grinder system in Concordia, where you can insert easily farmed legendaries to get new ones. This leads to some irritation when farming for new gear, as you'll just be sitting there farming Iwajira for thingies and sitting in front of the grinder. Moreover, most of the legndaries are recycled from Borderlands 2. So the loot system's kinda silly at the moment. But hey, lasers are cool.Past that, the game on the whole is far too easy. Every character has their own special way to totally break the game, and the endgame raid boss is an absolute joke. you'll burn through both playthroughs with relative ease with only one or two difficulty spkes during the story. the story itself is pretty satisfying and slots in between Borderlands 1 and 2 quite nicely, and even gives some closure to the Borderlands 2 story as well. Moral of the story, should you buy the game? yes. But adjust your expectations first. It's not as good as Borderlands 2, not by a long shot. However, it's more borderlands. If you're into the shoot and loot gameplay of Borderlands 2, the Borderlands the Pre Sequel will hold you over nicely until Borderlands 3.7.5/10 "

												So much negativity out there.tl;dr: If you haven't played Borderlands 2 and/or cannot appreciate attention to detail, go back to playing CoD or whatever lackluster shooter you wile your life away with.I loved the hell out of this game. Not so much because it's new and original and different from BL2, because in large part it isn't. In fact, it not being something completely new and original and different from BL2 was part of the hook. As far as gameplay, why fix what isn't broken? And hell, add some lazers and BUTT SLAMS. But as far as the story goes? Anybody who thinks it's lacking wasn't paying attention at some point in their Borderlands career. Likewise, it is NOT something you can just go and read about online if you want to catch the small details and nuances demonstrate how BL2 came to life. It isn't just about how Jack came to power; it's about how Jack stole the reins to Hyperion and flipped EVERYTHING upside down; it's a play-by-play of the deterioration of his humanity; it's a narrative of how his alliances and rivalries were forged; it's a testament to his ingenuity and how he used Hyperion to seize Pandora. That said, it isn't a game to simply try to breeze through, shooting for the best loot. It's a novelty. A ""(Re)Making of Pandora"" which you get to play a pivotal role in.			"

												Grapics still look good much like borderlands 2. Sounds is good. Lack of legends compared to BL2. The NPC's you meet are sadly mostly boring. The first NPC you meet besides Jack is a girl who is allright. The rest including a boy named Pickles are just boring. BL2 has the edge here. The game really needs  a Tiny Tina someone who is outrageous. They even toned down the guy who gives out upgrades on your backup and upgrades the amount of ammo you can carry.  The game has a low key feel to it. I am playing the girl with a captain america like shield. She is enjoyable. The game feels a lot easier then BL2. I find the humor is good and the missions you play are solid. If you enjoyed BL2 then I think you will like this game. I think it would be a lot more fun with a friend. Still a solid game.Just finished the game. The ending was ok. A little tedious in my opinion. The do re use weapons from BL2 they even stole the mission that the shotgun comes from. Remember the Octo 9 shotgun? You have to fight a tentacle monster to earn it. Still good but could have been so much better. No memorable characters that you want to interact with sadly.			"

*DISCLAIMER* It is very easy to hate this game when you compare it to Borderlands 2, aside from a few rehashed legendary weapons, this is a different enough game that you can enjoy it. That said, having bought it for 59.99$ I feel that I might have spent a bit too much on it. This doesn't make it a bad game, but I encourage anyone who is looking to play it to seek a 40$ or below pricetag. Maybe buy the season pass as well, but for now none of the DLC is high enough quality to warrant purchase (aside from Handsome Jack, we'll talk more about that), While I do recommend this game, it's not perfect and isn't going to be fun for everyone.Pros:-Oz Kits are awesome, easily the most useful and fun mechanic added-Characters are (mostly) all balanced to be playable both solo and co-op-Characters converse with eachother, both on Elpis and Pandora. This adds a great degree of depth.-LASERS, easily some of the best weapons in this game-Action Oriented Tutorial, no more walking through a frozen tundra listening to Claptrap.-The Grinder. Save your loot, you can always trade it up to be better. You can even ""craft"" legendary weapons.Cons:-Non replayable. As far as I know, none of the DLC has added the ability to redo your TVHM playthrough. Yet.-Poor farming mechanics. For some people, this game is fun when they farm. A great deal fo enemies only appear once and happen to be the only way to acquire some legendaries apart from grinding.-Vehicle control. Borderlands has never been known to have terrific vehicles, but the moon buggy happens to control the worst yet.-LASERS, yes they're great but they also happen to overshadow a lot of other weapon types. -Handsome Jack. This is more of a personal issue. Easily the best character in the game now, taking the spot as soon as he was released. Being Jack makes the game easymode.-The Raid Boss... There isn't really one, some prefer to call it The ""Raid Boss"" as it's simply a beefed up version of the final bossThis is a fun game, if you liked previous Borderlands games this one is sure to keep your attention for a little while. After you complete your first and second playthrough however, there isn't much to do unless you find excitement in endless Alt+f4 to not lose your chance at farming legendaries. Legendary farming is an issue, as mentioned a lot of the enemies that drop legendary weapons only spawn once. Literally the very first boss you fight has a chance to drop a legendary weapon and you can only fight him once per playthrough.I can't stress enough, while I personally enjoy this game and would recommend it, it's really not a perfect game. At the very least you should be able to keep the fun around for the first two playthroughs. Any time after that is only as fun as you can make it, whether you're farming some loot or hooking up with friends to level new characters. I'd say the game is a solid 7/10. It's definitely worth playing, but not worth the full price.			"

												This game is terriffic. Just as fun as Borderlands 2 but with space jumps, air crits and all kinds of new pervy humour. The only downside so far is some of the art is fuzzy or not optimized but it's not a big deal. Loving the characters so far and I even picked Nisha who seems to be hated as a playable character. I am loving her as I am sniping everyone with headshots. Very fun game so far, story is excellent, can't wait for BL 3.			"

												Despite accidentally selling my Moxxie's Vibra Pulse about half way through the game, thus making me actually have to work to get kills, this game was a thoroughly enjoyable and suitably long enough follow up to BL1 & 2. Highly recommended.			"

												A super fun twist on the BL formula.  I loved playing as a merc for Jack when he was a not-quite-evil-yet goofball, seeing the background here was really interesting.  I personally prefer BL2's atmosphere (MAWAHAHA), but I do think TPS has better balanced max stats for randomly generated weapons.  Oh yeah, and being able to find legendaries in vending machines and grind your fancy weapons when your cash is maxed out is super useful.  Hopefully if they include a grinder in BL3 there will be a bit less randomness involved though.  Being able to methodically craft specific items would have been nice.  All in all, a very fun game, though I'd prioritize playing through BL2 first if you haven't yet.			"

												Borderlands the Pre-Sequel takes place between B1 and 2 and on the moon. There are some new types of guns and elements like freezing which is really fun to use. And because of the low gravity you can also jump a lot higher. But in the end this is more of the Borderlands which I actually got already bored in B2. I really liked that game but never finished it. I came into this kind of expecting this would be something a bit better, but nope. It's the same well done hilarious Borderlands, if the style of humor just appeals to you. Guns are still fun to use and there're of course plenty of them. But it still feels like nothing has changed. The game is pretty long according to people, but what I played just felt like padding, a crapton of it like it was with Borderlands 1 and 2. Even if the game is long they've never made it exactly interesting to play. This is more Borderlands, if you haven't gotten bored of it you'll most likely like it, for me I want something more already. Hopefully Borderlands 3, if Gearbox is making it, will do something much more.			"

												I liked the game, but it wasn\'t anything new to the franchise.With the main difference being the O2 bar, which is ignored due to constant drops by enemies, and the slam fuction being novel, there are some changed, but it seems to drag the game instead of making things interesting. I\'d recomend waiting for a good sale, and ignoring the dlc\'s.			"

												Borderlands The Pre Sequel serves as backstory on the beloved Handsome Jack and will hold you over until Borderlands 3 drops. The game sorta lacked on memorable characters, except for the player characters themselves. They all have wonderful and unique designs and their stories really give you insight on to the characters from previous games. Their kits are rather enjoyable, too. The game also spiced up combat with ground pounds and O2 jumps. The game is missing the sort of feeling you'd expect from a Borderlands game, but it still provides the looting and shooting fun of Borderlands. Not the best game, but still good.			"

												10/10 Definitely not a DLC- Includes completely 4 new characters- The story behind the story (in BL2)- Hours worth of new voice acting- Completely new maps- Completely new play mechanics (Low Grav/Low Oxygen/Oxy Jump)- Butt Slams- Completely new elemental damage type (Cryo/No Slag Weapons)- Completely new weapon builds including new burst types (Laser/Probably Others)- Classic BL charm- Classic BL attitudeMy only complaint is there isn't more gameplay & story based DLCs.For full experience recommend not playing as Wilhelm unless you plan to go solo all the way. Wilhelm is badass but has the personality of a brick. Unlike Brick who is badass and has the personality of a badass. Also Wolf steals allies revive kills. "

												If you are going to get this game, get the Claptrap DLC, as you will be disappointed in the vanilla ending, but the DLC will help you with your anger. Other than that, every character (apart from the ones from the previous games) has an Australian accent, and there are some recycled jokes from the other games. Added to that, some places seem to literally have recycled textures from the other games, and the level design does have some flaws in some places.However if you take it as a game apart from the rest of the series, then it can supply some good gameplay and overall is an enjoyable experience (again, not just the base game but with the Claptastic Voyage DLC incl.).

												It has its ups and downs. All in all - if you like BL games, you will like BL:PS. The charm and the uniqueness is still there. It doesn't offer much interesting new content besides laser weapons (which are mostly terrible, but a select few are overpowered), but overall, it's still fun and I had a good time. Only thing I did not have a good time with was what happens after level 50 (max level is 70). XP rate is fine up until 50, but then, someone had a GENIUS idea to cut the XP gain rate by about 90% or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ It went from you ""kill a badass, and your XP bar fills up a little"" to ""you kill 100 badasses, and your XP bar fills up so little you can't even notice it"". Just why? Story mission XP is still scaled properly, why not monsters XP? All this does is force the player who wants to get from 50-70 to repeatedly speed-run select portions of the story, which is MIND-NUMBINGLY BORING, and made me quit the game. Where's the satisfaction of the reaching max level? The satisfaction of end-game gear farming? End game builds? Well, unless you cheat, those are not things you will achieve in a reasonable amount of time witih this game. P.S. Relationship spoilers  Jamey x Athena is literally the cutest thing ever, though...<33  "

												This game lives up to its predecessors. The new features are welcome (i.e. low gravity makes you travel faster, new laser type guns, new solo vehicules, etc.).  I really enjoy the sense of humor it got. Really happy to play this with Chouine! ;)			"
