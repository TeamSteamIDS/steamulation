												This is a interesting mix of RTS and dungen crawler (even though it is more linear than most dungeon crawlers) where most of the time you will control a little party of 4 or 5 characters. The RTS part is really limited, but still most of the game is really fun. It has a REALLY elaborated plot, one of thouse plots that make a gamer like me go online searching for more about the story. I just didn't end this game because it is really really long (what I guess is a good thing). At some point of the game I already had some of the best items and most skills but the story just wouldn't come to an end.The biggest flaws in here is the RTS part of game, that is really limited and simplistic, and specially the fact that that the game is quite buggy (some major bugs might even prevent you from continuing some quests).The best part of it is the plot and the combat system. It's kind of hard at first, but once you get used to this different combat mechains you will really enjoy it.			"

												Hybrids of game genres never quite seem to strike it right, but Spellforce 2 is one of those rare exceptions; fixing most of the problems suffered by the original, both its RPG and RTS elements are now considerably more enjoyable and the graphical presentation finally makes the game a serious contender amongst some stiff competition.Spellforce 2 combines the best features of the fantasy RPG and RTS worlds, from strong character development, to massive, resource driven battles-all strewn across gorgeous landscapes. Throw in a wealth of online options-most notably cooperative play-and you have sleeper hit in the making.An ambitious effort, and a definite success. Conveying an interesting story with beautiful graphics, great voice acting, a nice soundtrack, and a tight control scheme, very few flaws are to be found in SpellForce 2.This game is sure to satisfy action-RPG gamers.

												When I started playing Spellforce The Order of Dawn, I absolutely loved the story line, characters and lore. However, the quests , item stats and character/map graphics left much to be desired. These flaws have been very much fixed in Spellforce 2. Although the story was not as good as in Spellforce 1, it still sucks you in and drives you to play trough the whole campaign. The multiplayer would be enjoyable if there where more players, and if the resources would slowely regenerate as they did in Spellforce 1. This way they could be protected, adding more tactics to the game. The talent trees have been overhauled as well, forcing you to choose a certain path, which was not the case in Spellforce 1. All in all I would recommend it mainly because of the story, lore and character designs.			"

Dragon Wars part was a lot better, especially because it continues the story even further - with the knowledge from Spellforce 1, too.			"

												A fun blend of RTS and RPG. The graphics feel very dated and there are some minor bugs at times. However, I really enjoyed it.It is simple, and contains the usual resource gathering from RTS titles like AOE/Settlers/Starcraft etc.. But adds the dimension of having a hero who can level up and gain skills. The units of each faction are interesting, although I feel there could be one or two extra per faction.A minor criticism is that, unlike more modern RTS, it does not make use of cover or terrain. This puts Spellforce 2 in the ""old RTS"" category.If you can pick it up on a steam sale - good for fantasy RTS people. But don't expect AAA graphics or polish.6.5/10			"

												This game is fun especially if you're into rpg-rts games.It's a good buy especially with its price. This has a warcraft feel in it.the camera bug though is progression breaking, however quickly skipping the cinematic will avoid it.What do you get in spellforce 2? it's an old game but it can punch newer games in the RTS genre and knock it out.Graphics isn't really too outdated. (Not the case with cinematics.)In the 100 hours I played I only played it in story mode. In which you'll experience the RPG-RTS in full blast.You can have your fill in fantasy land with this game, with dragons, dragon-blood infused humans who are basically immortal. Elves, Dark Elves, Dwarves, Undead, Orcs ,Shadow beings and many more.Grab it on sale for maximum fun and less wallet gouging!			"

												They have blended the genres in a most excellent way, making this game a pure joy to game. Sure there is a few bugs as well as sudden crashes but as long as you keep in mind to save often, it becomes a minor issue.

												Beautiful sequel with improved game mechanics. If you liked Spellforce 1 you will also enjoy this one.Unfortunately the story is not as good as in Spellforce 1 and they combined the different races into three different alliances, limiting the amount of titans to just three. I can't deny that I missed summoning three titans at once to strengthen my army, but the new titans are well designed and very strong. Seeing that they can turn the tides of a battle gives you sweet satisfaction or despair if it's the enemy ;-)I like the new hero system. They abandoned the rune system and give you permanent fellows instead, which you can skill to your own liking, at least to some point. A simple base orientation is forced upon them to keep the story consistency. Sadly they cut down the magic spells a little bit and removed all permanent auras.Something important that I almost forgot; they added mounted and flying units granting you more strategical possibilities, unfortunately they don't have massive dis-/advantages over other unit types, like it is the case in The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-Earth. Of course there are counterunits, but no real annhilators. (Damn I loved to run down some goblins with my Rohirims, but those phalanx carrier were really scary^^)For those of you, who got tired of all the walking in Spellforce 1, fear not Spellforce 2 is much better in this matter.The addon is also worth playing and comes with a fourth playable faction.In conclusion: You should play this game, I'm certain you will enjoy it, even if you still prefer Spellforce 1, that's what I do.

												While the first Spellforce was a very good game as well, the second part improves in every aspect and feels much more polished and modern.Especially the role-playing part has been vastly developed, and offers real character developement now.Additionaly, the whole game-mechanics have been overworked and optimized, resulting in a more fluid and comfortable experience, and of course, the graphics, especially character textures, have been improved as well.And finally, the second game is still in developement, the last addon has been released only a few month ago.Definitely recommended!

												So I have some pretty mixed feelings about this game.It is an attempt for an RPG RTS crossover. As such both sides suffer a bit in game play. However the story is quite engaging and the game play, despite not being top notch, is still quite fun. I admit I have not explored the multiplayer aspect of this game much. The Campaigns are worthwhile though, the abilities and armies you get to use are diverse and fun.In the end - Not a great game. Probably wouldn't spend much on it personally - however I have had a lot of fun with it and so recommend it to anyone looking for something new.			"

												Alright. About Spellforce 2. It is most definitely one of the best games iv ever played. Great story, long story, catchy story! Many options about your character customization  and .... well, i think its gonna be enough if i say that its like in warcraft 3 but only you are given more freedom about equipment and spell. OH and if u heard, that this game is really  buggy, you heard right, but most of the bugs can be immidietaly repaired by command ingame without loosing your progress and thats only if u are unlucky enough to have these problems.I would definitely recommend this master piece. It is not perfect game but it sure is close to be one.			"

												I had finished the last campaign in SpellForce 1 and jumped straight into this sequel.What I don't like is the fact that when compared to the first game, it feels much more simplified and lacks this specific ""magic"" atmosphere (that's in my personal opinion). There are also several bugs, which force you to save game quite often, just to feel ensured that you won't lose your progress.However, I still have fun with this game. It's not as good as the 1st one but it still delivers. Many things are improved, such as the way the map is revealed or your avatar behavior when close to the enemy. If you liked the first game, you should have some fun with this sequel as well.			"

												As a fan of the Spellforce universe and the RTS genre, this edition was an easy purchase. After playing the Order of Dawn and the expansions several times; I got interested in the unique gameplay and the world of Eo. However this game changed the mechanics of the gameplay and the way you play it, for example, you no longer play as a rune warrior in the campaign but instead you’re a Shaikan, possessing dragon blood with similar features to a rune warrior without the power of using the monuments. The gameplay no longer uses the monuments as a headquarters for army and base building, but now you build small towns from which you build your armies, and although I preferred the old gameplay this was also fun. Your heroes now level up with you, allowing further customization. Instead of managing the six nations like in the previous Spellforce, this one has 3 alliances in which you build armies, the Realm, the Pact and the Clans, the Dragon Storm campaign also adds the Shaikan faction. The base building elements are fun to play like the previous game, but some aspects like the resources for the town and army management was superior in the Order of Dawn, they removed the buildings that doubled the resource income and the resources are on average very limited supply, this also presents more of a challenge because your enemies always possess huge amounts of resource deposits near their bases and you can use this to your advantage in some cases but also forces  you into more rushed tactics. The game also feature the Free game mode, allowing further gameplay and also a bit more challenging than the campaign.I enjoyed the Rune warrior gameplay more than the Shaikan, but I still liked this game. There were some issues with the camera bugs in the Shadow Wars campaign, but fortunately the Dragon Storm expansion was free of them.The soundtrack is beautiful and fitting to the Spellforce Universe. The graphics are also some of the most good looking of the real time strategy genre.Overall, it is a good game and a fine sequel with some changes that might not please every gamer but it is a great addition to the universe.

Now that the final installment of the series has be announced, the only responsible steam-head response is to emplore anyone who may have deprived themselves of this guilty-pleasure to get it before the curtain drops on this epic saga or spend your days in an un-SpellForcee living hell of your own design.

												I really wanted to give this game a positive review and until today I was pretty sure it's going to happen. Let's start by saying, that I've played both main Spell Force games when I was much younger and it was great to remind myself why I enjoyed these games. It's very good combination of rpg and strategy. So why the negative review?Well... First of all, this game is better than the first one. I find it hard to believe that someone without sentiment towards first Spell Force would have a different opinion. Plot is solid, in both games, but Spell Force 2 has better graphic, better music and most importantly, better controls. It's also much better paced. You finally don't feel like you wasting eternity just going from one point on the map to another. It has aged much better that the first game, it's still very enjoyable, you don't get the feeling like the camera or characters movements are clunky. Strategic elements of the game were also improved. The only thing that I've enjoyed better in the first Spell Force was the fact, that it has definitely more freedom in terms of creating your own character.As for Spell Force 2 itself...Pros:+ interesting plot+ original and well done mix between strategy and rpg+ game is truly challenging+ great music+ interesting and useful spells/special abilities that unlocks when you level upCons:- low resolution- lack of truly interesting quests- gaining another level doesn't really feel that rewarding- pretty limited character creation- dialogue scenes are essentially broken - characters not always shows up or does not shows up properly- BUGS.Yeah, I'm sorry, but how can you recommend a game that basically make you feel like you've wasted 16 hours of your life playing it? I am really understanding, I'm not the type of person who gets over frustrated and never wants to play a game after encountering a less or more serious bug. Sure, it's pretty annoying, but if it can be fixed somehow, if I can replay some sequences or just restart the whole mission, I'm still going to do this. So I've encountered few serious, game breaking bugs. Two times restarting missions worked. In other instance, skipping the dialogue was an only way to avoid being literally stuck in the void. And now... Well, now I actually can't finish my quest, because even though I've done everything that was needed to be done, even get a note in journal to go back to the person that is crucial for moving the plot forward... Well, this person does not want to talk to me. At all. There's no scene. No dialogue. Nothing. Replaying the sequence and the whole mission didn't work.Maybe this game works better on older systems (I don't remember having this sort of problems in the past), but with this amount of serious bugs it's not really worth a recommendation. Buy it only if you want to replay it or just remind yourself the whole series.			"

Because it attempts to mash these two genres together however, neither is executed perfectly. Despite this, i feel that this is still a very competent game in this day and age, and is still a joy to play. I'd personally recommend it enough to buy it at full price, but that's just because i'm the kind of person who enjoys playing old games just to see how they differ from today's games.TL:DRit's an enjoyable RTS/RPG experience that is worth your time if you like that sort of thing.

												I have been playing this game many years ago and now returned.I am playing it on a 4k 65inch TV. I set the resolution via the ini file.But now on to the review itself. The game starts kinda slow but stick with it and you won't regret it.It's aged very very well considering that it's 10 years old. The story is really good and evolves slowly. There are also many smaller side quests that are pretty interesting and or funny.I love the mix between RTS and RPG in a party. It's especially nice since it forces you (in a nice way) to update the equipment of your heroes. And make no mistake, these heroes really feel like heroes compared to your normal units.While some reviewers said you don't need any tactics it's not true in later levels. You need to balance your party and als think about what speels and abilties you should use to fight in a certain area or a certain enemy.That being said I can't wait for the story to continue in the third part.PS: If you enjoy the story there are books sold. The background story makes the game even more enjoyable.			"

												Great game. The blend between RTS, Age of Empires style, and RPG is what makes this game pretty much unique. The game is long and the expansion is big, so good value. Looks nice enough. Now, this gold version packs a very annoying bug. The camera got stuck while doing some puzzles (hint: ground puzzles with no levers). There's no workaround other than to introduce some commands, that you can search online, to get out. That's not a fix, just a way to carry on and get back to normal. Saving before touching is a good idea. At times, though, with some effort and some guessing you can actually solve the puzzle with the camera fixed that way, since your character is still able to move, but on a couple of times you just need to avoid it. The good thing is that none of the impossible ones are vital to finish the game or something important. This only happened with the main game, Dragonstorm is fine. Other than that, the game is pretty entertaining. The story is fine, not great, and since you have many quests at one time is kinda hard to follow the whole thing. Nevertheless, this game is one of those that should be a lot more known and awarded with more attention since some elements are quite original and cool. Once you get to play it, you'll finish it. "

												Totaly recomend this game despite that is kinda old (2006) still you can love it <3As an Rpg,Rts its a great game with really nice storie (which is one of few good games that i ever play in this genere)Very good graphic and sound, 35+ hours of singleplayer in rush mode (cause i finish it in rush,it will take you much more if you go after secondary quests :) )But 2 cons of game1st- It is not have the original soundtrack of game ( and i really miss it from original version that i had )2nd - in the normal campain (not the expancion) you will get 2-3 times a camera bug that will freeze your scrin (i have make a guid how to fix it) it wont trouble you much cause it occure only after npc chat or interact with an item (dont afraid it happend me ONLY 3 Times in WHOLE game, 1 of them was in campain and i had a small problem with it but i found a way and fix it) Fix for camera bug if you are afraid of, bring up consol command with Ctrl+] and type exactly as you see the text after arrow,exactly as you see it (if you make a wrong on typo it wont work beacause its ""case sensitive""-----> UI:CameraTrackEnd()But you must write it every time your camera buging ( you can bring up consol,press the arrow down right, click the command and press enter ) I hope that you will enjoy the game if you buy it :D			"

												Everything that was cool about SF1 was stripped here. I could literally make a list of bad things about it :- copper/silver/gold coins system is replaced by gold only- special resources specific to each faction is replaced by lenia for everybody- less units, less balanced- no unit upgrades- female sidekick is just excuse to show half-naked, big-boobed elf. No possible romance.- protagonist is possessed by evil spirit, has aristocratic british accent, is nowhere near as cool as a rune warrior- less items, hard to compare stats.also- appalling optimization : glitchy camera through all cutscenes, glitchy textures, glitchy animations- poor dialogues and less than average voice-acting- plot is unoriginal at bestAnd i must have forgot some other stuff I might add later...All this game can claim is being a good mix of a very standard RTS and a very standard hack'n'slash. It's a crying shame because they could have done so much more with it, they could've made an awesome game. Instead they settled for less than average.5/10 because I loved SF1 for all its imperfections.God help us when SF3 comes out...			"

												After spending 180ish hours beating Spellforce+expansions on hard, I was excited to jump into SF2.  This edition contains the core Spellforce 2 and the first expansion (Dragon Wars).  Overall, I really like the updates they had made to the game.  They worked out a bunch of the issues from the first game (ie. Avatar not attacking, losing units when switching maps, etc.) and made a polished sequel that rivals the first in terms of being enjoyable.GRAPHICS:  9/10 - The game is from 2006 so again, cannot expect much here.  I was pleasantly surprised with the world design and the characters themselves.  For those using a newer system, the FOV console command will be your best friend!  At the start of each level, you'll find your FOV pretty limited.  Do this:  Ctrl + ] to access the console.  Type ""UI:SetCameraFOV(1.060)"" to back the camera out a bit.  The higher the number, the further out you go.STORY: 10/10 - The Spellforce storyline has really come along since the first game.  You could see them hitting their stride as you went through the expansions of the first game and it continues here.  Really enjoy the story!GAMEPLAY: 9/10 - I personally like the new leveling system as it allows more customization between all characters (not just your avatar).  I wish they would allow full customization for all characters but your fellow party members all follow a certain path with only a few skill points allowed to be distributed by the player (ie. Whisper will go Dual Swords, no matter what).  I understand the need to direct the player towards a healer, tank, etc... but maybe allow for a mode where experienced players can completely customize the skills.  Other than that, the gameplay is smooth and fun.  Quite a bit easier than the first game though.SOUND: 9/10 - Once again, the Spellforce music is great and the voiceover is MUCH better than the original.  Still not perfect, but anything was better than SF1.  Overall, this game is definitely worth picking up!  I spent ~90 hours beating it on the hardest difficulty.			"

												Edited review, still keeping 'no' vote. And I have more than two hours in this because I'm a semi-completionist for those who are curious:TL;DR: Great concept of strategy rpg, but very buggy, very simple strategy, very basic rpg and some of the most obvious padding and Macguffins I've ever seen.There is a game-breaking camera glitch. This glitch happens when certain cutscenes/dialogues end; your camera is forced to an awkward location, set looking at the sky or something. You cannot see the world and cannot therefore order units effectively or interact with quest objects. There is a patch that 'seems' to fix most instances, except the dwarven camp where I needed it to fix it. You can mash the space bar/escape button to rush through/skip dialogue. That seems to avoid the camera bug, but NPC behavior can get wonky, since sometimes (at least once) NPCs might need to spawn or despawn during cutscenes.Another bug where you sacrifice 'light worshippers' and one of them doesn't walk properly. Going into 3rd person and bumping her seems to fix. But readers can see the game is buggy. This is all apparently because of the way they mashed two games together to make the 'Gold Edition'. Reminds me of what I've heard of the Homeworld re-releases: apparently not-breaking code during a copy-paste marathon is harder than it sounds... But I'll go onto the game itself now.The story involves you getting reinforcements to stop an army and save your village/city. So you convince a count to give a letter of recommendation (LoR) to a baron, after saving the count from annihilation. You escort the count's son and some supplies to the baron, who you save from annihilation in return for a letter of recommendation to the king. The count's son escorts you to the king, who says 'no'. But there are others who might rally to the cause, you have to convince them to join and bash through the enemy's fortress from behind, because that is the only way back to the village you're trying to save. Through the attackers' main castle. There's a part where you have to wake a passed-out drunk dwarf. That involves a four-part quest with at least four NPCs. The word that describes this is tedious. Much of the plot is 'we need to go to X' but the only way to X happens to be through Y and Z levels. So out of 20 or so regions, 10 of them are padding and 5 or so more hold MacGuffins. Great.You have armies, including semi-unique 'titan' units, which are as ROFL stomping-forgot your bubblegum-s**t just got real-as you'd expect. But I'd rather have the player become that way, well, eventually. For a little bit. Well, anyhow... The strategy element is kiiinda okay, except the difficulty is very arbitrary and base-building is very formulaic. Example: one mission you need to free captured orcs by beating a human base. Except, for no good reason there are giant spiders attacking your base constantly. And when you beat the humans you get surprised dialogue about 'the spiders are coming', suggesting the spiders should have only started spawning at this point. The game also feels like is was made with the Warcraft 3 map editor, with some voiceovers added.You also get access to different cool races! But how this happens is the previous race that you can finally use with all their units, the race whose territories you just saved from annihilation or lead to impossible victory, they give you the finger and for no good reason your defeated foes now trust you to lead their forces. It's just a little better than ""Message from the developers: you're going to play the next part of the game with this new race, starting from the ground up again. Have fun!""There are other gripes, but this is my second REwrite of this review, so I'll leave the smaller things to others.			"

												The Spellforce games have an interesting enogh story, but that's about it. They integrates RPG and RTS well enough, but the controls are awkward as hell. With no obvious way of changing key bindings, as well as no way of automating any of your party members' tasks, the game becomes needlessly frustrating at times. The kindest way to describe the dialogue is ""boring and bad, written by a simpleton with no grasp of the English language."" And just to give me yet another thing to complain about, exploring or otherwise doing anything other than slavishly following orders can and will have horrible consequenses - except when it's arbitrarily rewarded. You never know if straying from the beaten path is going to lead to treasures or call down the wrath of the gods.This, along with infrequent crashes, pointless and timewasting puzzles and a list of bugs that haunts my nightmares, does not make playing these games feel like a beta. It feels like funding a Nigerian royal in exile.Don't buy unless the price is at least 75% marked down.			"

												GAME-BREAKING BUGS!The gameplay itself is fun; I put 35 hours into it and enjoyed nearly all my playtime. It's a great mix between RTS and RPG. The character progression has an old-school feel that gives the player a sense of ownership over the development of his/her party and the loot system meaningfully enhances the experience, giving players a tangible reason to fully explore and complete quests. The RTS elements are lacking, but the RPG elements make up for it. The fact that the game is fun makes it all the more painful when you reach a point where you can't progress; the camera glitches, you can't properly move your character, enemies that are supposed to spawn don't spawn. There is no reasonable fix for this.To quote another Steam user, ""Nothing works. The game is bugged and the developers gave up on it. Move along."" This is not the RTS/RPG game you're looking for.

												Good game and the Gold Edition is worth buying, especially on sale.A good story mixed with innovative gameplay makes it an interesting game.Here you play a top-view action-adventure game, then you are fighting with troops, then you are building a village and castle, etc. Really nice.The only downside for me is that because it is real time tactical game-like, it sometimes takes too much time to go through a mission. It would be nice if the troops were only an aid, not a necessity to finish a mission. At least it should not be the norm so that gameplay is non-repetitive. Hopefully, they can remedy to that in Spellforce 3 if it comes out. I don't like repetitive gameplay.Buy it if you like innovative gameplay.			"

Insert code - and repeat every time you play and the option button in game crashes your game. Fixes:When you go to play Spellforce Platinum go to your steam library/spellforce platinum/launch options and type in -window then go to your c:/program files/steam/steamapps/common/spellforce platinum/spellforce.exe and right click for properties and set it to run as admin. then play the game through steam ..open options in the windowed screen, set your prefered options then close the game and go back to the steam/SFP/properties/launch options and take out the -window.  You can now play the game without having to worry about putting in the code every time and on the settings you want. DO NOT use the option button unless your in -window mode or it will just crash your game as soon as you touch it.			"

												I can not recommend this to any fan of Spellforce 1. So many changes were made that aside from the lore you would say that this is a different game.Cons: 1. Character building was made streamlined to the point of making it fool-proof. You can no longer choose attributes only skills ( which come equipped with said attributes in the armor/weapons they allow to use ).2. Game is not designed to allow retries organically like the 1st. If one of your heroes or your Character die a countdown starts during which you have to ress them with either your Character/hero or at a Life Shrine ( a player made building ) or its GAME OVER. ALSO THERE ARE OBJECTIVES YOU CAN FAIL WTF? I mean yeah sure the 1st game 2nd campaign had you escorting refugees which could be killed except for that one immortal named char but it was keeping in tone with the rest of the game up-to and after that point. I would rather take 1 escort mission with a sily immortal grandpa than Spellforce 2's escort horses,  on the bloody second map, for which the game can't be bothered to tell if they are being attacked. I guess  Falkmar is being passive aggressive.3. Races also seem to have been streamlined. In your very first map you will notice in the new Headquarters building that  there are 3 upgrades named for the 3 Light races. Im sorry but squishing Human, dwarf and elf ( which were 3 distinctly different races if not much by gameplay then by buildings and resource requirements) into 1 race is painful dumbing down. Just because you can't be bothered to make large enough maps for all the buildings required in the previous game does not mean you can suddenly make a all in one building for 3 races ( I mean FFS in the 1st game's second campaign you learn that the elves and dwarfs fought and killed each other at one point).4.This one is tied to 3. You seemingly only use 3 resources now........ Why? No seriously Why? Is it because of the 3 in 1 race thing. Dwarfs stopped using mithril and elfs stopped caring about trees? WTF is this?5.One of the worst pathfinding I have ever seen in a RTS. Have a group of mounted archers attacking through a chokepoint? Get used to the idea that those damned horses will now block any other of your units getting in range, guess they take attack orders a bit too seriously.6.BUGS.Oh and as a last F U to the player, even the music seems to be mimicking Lord of the Rings in the first few missions. You can tell they couldn't be bothered to try and let Spellforce be it's own unique bland of RTS/RPG when the dreaded ''WIDER APPEAL'' feeling kicks in.			"

As result playing this or any of there series of games in laptop or hd desktop widescreen screens are pointless. Without a higher resolution patch/update to reflect the changes in new screen format the game iteself is hard to play in 4:3 look. The developers still have been stagnant on this issue and therefore I cant recommend anyone buying the spellforce games untill this issue can be resolved. As for the games itself they are great and I love them. But I cannot recommend to anyone untill a suiteable update has been  made to reflect in todays changes of computer monitor formats.			"

												If  you are looking for a single-player RTS/RPG hybrid with way more emphasis on the RPG elements, then you might find this game appealing. I bought it because I had been led to believe it is similiar to Warcraft 3, which is more or less true: There are heroes, and there are different races. I have not played the game for a considerable amount of time so I will not comment on the story. What I will comment on is what is probably the laziest programming I have ever seen in a game. The game has 3 modes: Campaign, where you play through the main story and can save at any time.Free mode, where you can play through other campaign-ish maps and custom campaigns at your leisure.And Skirmish mode, which is just straight-up RTS against bots or on Lan.Having gotten over an hour and a half into the main campaign with barely any RTS whatsoever, I decided to try out skirmish mode. Imagine my surprise then, when, after hitting the menu key, I found there was NO SAVE FEATURE. This is also true of free mode. The insane thing is, after doing some digging, I found out that you CAN in fact save, but only through using the case-sensitive console built into the game. So the game is perfectly capable of saving, but apparently it was too much work to add a friggin save button. This is seriously the laziest thing I have EVER seen in a game from a major developer/publisher, especially since they've had years and years to patch it in. As for the RTS part itself, it's rather simplistic, you build buildings to unlock units and you can make heroes. You can't upgrade any units and the hero skills seem horribly unbalanced. You're better off sticking to Age of Empires 2, Warcraft 3, or any of the other RTS/Strategy games if that's what you are looking for.			"

This game is so buggy it crashes in odd places, works some times and crashes again at big transition points disallowing one to continue the main campaign. I've contacted steam to ask for a refund, but unless we all tell them how unhappy we are with this title, they will not give it. They should have fixed this game before selling it to us.

												I realy am not pleased to give this game a bad review, because I like almost everything in this game, but it just destroys every little fun I have on the battlefield where I have to be at 3 diffrent places at the same time and still have no chance on normal difficulty, if I play a game on normal difficulty I don't want to start the same lvl 20 times only to find out how I can survive the 1st 2 minutes off the battle, firstly because something like that is annoying in any game and secondly because that is not how a strategy game should be done. In a strategy game u should have enough time to at least get a look at the situation, analyse it and then create something that could be a plan, there is no strategy behind try and error, that's lame and unintersting and annoying, no one enjoys that.

												This game is pretty addictive I must say, great mix of RPG leveling heroes and building units/buildings/strategy. However, two points that made me give up playing this game. They are the kind of things that leave me in a bad mood for hours:1. The voice acting and script is hilariously childish, almost to the point of being funny. Not much effort put into the storyline and characters I felt (this wasn't so bad though).2. This point being the one that made me want to throw my laptop out of my window. There is no autosave. You spend 2 hours on one hugely long mission, only to discover a 'game over' message appear when a main character dies. Only option is 'main menu' and 'load last save'. When your last save was in the middle of the previous mission, which was over 4 hours play ago, you can imagine getting pretty frustrated at this game.I can't be bothered to continue with it any longer. Maybe I'll come back to it in the future, but I doubt it. It's too frustrating and makes you ashamed of wasting so much time for nothing. If you can get it at a reduced price and still want to play it, be sure to continuously save your game, constantly.			"

												I purchased this game in 2016, hoping that there was still somthing interesting in this game 10 years after its relase given the good reviews and it's more recent extensions. Unfortunatly I think this game is totally outdated now and I really regret spending 15€ on this. The graphics looks quite ugly now but I did not expect much for a game released in 2006. More importantly is the gameplay for me and I found it very dull: it's a mix of a very basic RPG and a basic STR; you just select your characters and send them on the ennemy and you're done. Sometimes you collect a piece of equipment to upgrade the existing one, or you level up gaining a useless ability... no tactic to master, a very simple character management, boring story and boring quest (you will soon be ending up passing all dialogues). To sum up, the gameplay offers no deepness and I don't think this game was much more interesting in 2006.Obviously I don't recommend this game and if you are looking for a mix of RPG & RTS, I suggest you go for  Warhammer Dawn of War 2 instead, it will not give you much more on the RPG side than SpellForce but Dawn of war is much more interesting in terms of strategy and tactic.I don't know how Spellforce 3 will be, but given what I see on the second game, I think there will need radical changes in the gameplay to make it an interesting game.

												I LOVED this game when it came out and I decided to buy it as an homage. Dear God has gaming changed since. No support for high resolutions, no support for widescreen, no improved graphics (it ran maxed when it came out), glitchy, and worst of all, WORST of all, absolutely crappy save management. A story-driven strategy game is supposed to have my back. It only auto-saves when you switch areas, which was 4 ♥♥♥♥ing hours ago, lost all my SevenKeeps progress. I got killed with cheats, because it loves to glitch and kill you even with god mode on.Rage quit and uninstalled. I don't care how good it used to be, I am not playing the last 50 quests again. Don't bother with this game. Ir was a nice blend when it came out, now it's old and decrepit, not even rebuilt for Steam, it still requires a serial key as long as my arm.Why? It's on torrents since 2006, what possible protection do you seek? I'm not saying patch your game if you sell it, you utter crooks, I'm saying crack it for steam. it's 2 bucks, nobody is stealing it. You still have the sources, disable key check, allow black-bar widescreen resolution and add some autosave every 5 minutes.I'm not talking crashed here, no I DIED AND LOST 4 HOURS OF PROGRESS. What is this, 1993?Don't buy it. It's slow, doesn't save, fast travel is stupidly implemented, quests are clunky, magic is underpowered and it's glitchy as heck (not because new hardware, it runs fine, it was always glitchy). Pathfinding is atrocious, units go on the wrong path and get lost. They go in knots for no reason and seem to just attempt to path 40 meters, then another 40, sometimes going in the wrong direction, completely losing sight of their final goal. In combat, this pathing issue is a b*tch, not to mention it has no polite/predictive pathing. If 4 units stop in the door, the others dance around, unable to pass though, around, push units whatever, and get slaughtered.Just buy something modern. Not worth it. Uninstalled.			"

However here, I still suck, but at least I can succeed. The only two problems I have with these games is the voice acting, which is so bad but it has its own little nice quality to  it, and that sometimes you can get rushed without being prepared and lose.

												Bad voice acting, really bad even for a JooWood game. The graphics are dated, but not terrible. The gameplay is very much a RPG/RTS crossbreed, and it works well. Not as detailed as the first Spellforce, but not as dated either. Very solid if you are looking for something different. Basicly, in this 2nd game, you have a skill tree that is split between combat and magic, and all spells are learned by putting points into various magic skills, unlike the first game in which you had to find or buy spells. However, combat and magic is broken up into paths that lead to a general sort of class, though you can have many such classes. You could select magic to get to Necromancy, and you could also invest points in combat to get to platemail, so you could be a necro-tank toon, and there are many such combos. The rts part of the game is very simple, just three things to gather, and not many buildings, again the first Spellforce is more complex, but it is still fun for what it is. 80+ hours			"

												The Spellforce series feels like a mish-mash of  Dungeon Seige and the original Warcraft: a shallow party based dungeon delve attached to a shallow strategy game. You control a band of heroes, and sometimes you get a base to build an army of disposable red-shirts. The heroes level up with you and gain skills, the military units are cannon fodder. That's the crux of it; not much depth here. It does, however, create a nice hybrid game in that you don't have to live and die by either your hero build, or your micro-managing skills as a strategy gamer.What Spellforce bills as a feature to make combat easy actually makes it tedious, but the amount of quick control it gives you is worth it. Once you're over the shock of having to click so many times to control your party, you'll find you can quickly dispatch many different units.The story is on rails, so no replay value; but worth the pricetag if you like BOTH Baldur's and Warcraft.
