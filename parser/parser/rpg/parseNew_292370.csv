												The people that recommended this game must be masochists that enjoy terribly designed repeating-pseudo-random-maps, one dimensional skill sets, counterintuitive skill upgrading/selection, forced consumable item hoarding due to early and CONSTANT poisoning,  unreasonable difficulty curves, LAZY DIOLOGUE,  canned lore, LEVEL GRINDING, and a $15 MSRP to boot.To put it simply... This game has less depth and refinement than many FREE community projects, from the official RPG Maker Forums.Please understand, I am not normally this brutal with my RMVXA reviews and I genuinely TRIED to give this game a good run with around 2 hours of my life (I want back), but this game reeks of a want-a-be artist that couldn't get hired to make a real game so they tried to make their own, and did so... BADLY. And WTF is with obscuring half the battle scene with actor busts during skill selection?!? *BOGGLE*(No those screen shots are NOT battle conversation artwork, but appear EVERY SINGLE BATTLE)If I could, I'd ask for a refund. I truly feel sorry for anyone that paid the MSRP, as I feel cheated having bought it at a deep discount.For the record, I apologize for my tone. But it needed to be said. "

												For about 4 dollars I'd say it was worth it, there was times when it was a challenge (in a good way) and times when it was just 'I'm bored, I should play pokemon this is so bad'. The side quests were hard to do due to the low drop chances (or my horrible luck) and the random generating was so random i found the fairy 10 times and the cave once before giving up.I'll give the story a 6 out of ten, but i played as griselda and was confused until I hit the end of the dark dimension. I like some curious plot twists but I got a little lost there. In the description even it said something about a love story. I didn't see it at all besides the weird flash backs about someone who wasn't even my MC.For 4 bucks if your bored enough to waste 7 some odd hours like I did, I recommend it (Kinda). But for something to play over again to see it through the other characters stories? Nope.			"

												Unskippable cutscenes, unskippable tutorial screens, default RPG Maker menus, tile-based character movement, no saving at start of game, no obvious way to progress the story after you get past the initial cutscene and dialogue (have to talk to all the NPCs before it will let you continue), very bad character art. Nice to see some dynamic lighting/shadow effects, even if it's not adding any element of surprise nor exploration, but I believe that's a common visual effect that the entire RPG Maker community had access to for years.  The story is a little more dynamic than the usual RPG Maker fare but that does not mean it's different enough with each playthrough to warrant more than one go of it.  I would never buy this game for any price, let alone the $15 the developer is asking for.  The only reason I even gave it a try was I got it from a bundle at some point.  Don't waste your time or your money on this.			"

												I own about 300 games, of which 30+ of them are RPG Maker games. I happen to like the RPG Maker genre.DarkEnd is among the very best RPG Maker games that I have played.I spend more than 100+ hours playing this game, and enjoyed it tremendously, and that is why I decide to write a review of DarkEnd to share my experiences.In DarkEnd you can play as one of 4 different Primary Characters, and each of these 4 character has a very unique and intriguing storyline. You can also select a Secondary Character from the remaining 3 characters. The storyline is quite complex and convoluted and you normally would not know who is good or bad until the very end. Each of the character has their own unique reasons to go into the DarkEnd, and the outcome is also different and unique. Playing this game is like reading a detective novel for me, and each stage of the game give me a better glimpse of the story.There is also a lot of replayability because when you finished the game, you can play NG+ and select a different starting character. All the items and gold get carried forward to the next game, but all the quests resets. I like this system very much. There are also lots of optional side quests, and optional dungeons that spawn randomly too.On the negative side, there are some minor gramatical and syntactic errors. However, I personally not mind these errors, and did overlook them because I like the stories, the plot twists and the interesting game play.I had a good time playing DarkEnd and for me, its worth the money spent. I love this game and would highly recommend it.			"

												If you are expecting an epic RPG where a young hero braved an adventure along with colorful people to vanquish evil, you are looking at the wrong place because, in DarkEnd, you will find no such thing.-Story- The core story is very simple. Once, there was a king, who led mankind to prosperity with his magical talents. However, he wished for more power, the power to rival gods, and after messing around with “Primordial Darkness”, the element of creation, he was driven mad and unleashed the destruction upon the land; the DarkEnd. A hero stood up and destroyed the Magus King and stopped the DarkEnd. However, the same mistake was repeated once again due to mankind’s nature. You are one of the four chosen heroes to stop the DarkEnd, once and for all.Although the core story is simple, the game becomes very interesting due to the fact the game uses minimalistic story-telling to reveal the backstory of heroes.  You can choose a main protagonist and a supportive character out of four given heroes. Each hero has his/her own reason to stop the DarkEnd and the game reveals them with relatively smooth pacing.The character development was quite unexpected as the band of heroes seemed very stereotypical at first. However, they evolved very quickly as the game progressed. There is a distinct personality for each hero and their unique dialogues help this. -Gameplay-The gameplay is the meat and bone of this game. Like many dungeon crawlers, this game’s primary gameplay is pretty straightforward. You have to go inside the DarkEnd, floor by floor until you reach the end. There is a town which serves as the “main base” where you can heal, restock items, and buy/sell equips.The battles are unforgiving and very exciting. I’m currently playing with Valiant difficulty (Developer’s recommendation) and I have to say this is probably one of the most challenging RPGs I’ve ever played.  Even a typical battle with normal mob can make you break cold sweat.  Challenge a rare monster or optional boss without preparing and you’ll get the “gameover” screen in your face very quickly. The difficulty, however, is never unfair.  With enough preparation and reasonable strategy, every battle can be won. There is no need to go grind and overpower your characters.The game’s skill tree called “Corridor of Origin” is very unique. In the base town, you can go to a alternative realm called Corridor of Origin, where you can light up the crystals (akin to Sphere Grid in FFX) to earn various skills. Each character has a unique Corridor which allows you to set up multiple combinations of skills for your main and supportive heroes.The best feature of this game is randomly changing dungeons.  There are massive amount of sidequests, sub-dungeons and enemies, which changes every time you reenter the dungeon.  Replay value is very high since you have 4 heroes with unique story line for each and randomly changing dungeon.-Graphic and Sound-The pixel art in the game is very pretty. The game is mostly gloomy and dark, but some of the scenes are simply pretty for a 2D sprite-based game. The character portraits are also very beautiful. Although the cut-scene graphic may be a bit choppy, I have no problem with them. In fact, they reminded me of cut-scenes from old Genesis RPG; Phantasy Star.The music is no less thrilling. The game made use of wild range of captive music from cool, calming ones to upbeat and exciting ones. The battle themes are very catchy and memorable. I found myself humming battle tunes after a few hours.-Conclusion-Story - 8.0/10Gameplay- 9.0/10Graphic&SFX – 7/10Replay Value – 10/10Overall – 8/10DarkEnd, in my opinion, is a nice throwback to olden day’s gameplay-driven RPGs. The game gives me the distinct atmosphere of games such as Etrian Odyssey, Diablo 1 and Dark Souls. So if you are a fan of such kind of RPGs, DarkEnd is worth a try. "

												First off, i wanted to try out this game to see how it is. Sadly, i did not find the game that good. First off, i will post my pro's for this game:ONE OTHER NOTE: This is a rpg-maker game. These don't bother me, but if they bother you, the reader, feel free to pass on this game.  Graphic style also does not bother me. Also, i was not paid to make an review. I don't believe in that method either. Even if i was given a free one, i would use my unbiased review to either give it positive or negative.PRO:`Interesting way to gain abilities. You press ""A"" and you get teleported to a map full of poweres in crystals.`Crystals and boss killing remind me of FF games (early ones).`4 different characters with 4 different storylines. You can also choose a companion with each. Make sure to select one that is good for that character class.`There are some storylines after you kill a boss, which is background info on the character your playing as.`Helpful developer if you email them.`New Game + mode.CON's:`Questing becomes repetitive, especially the girl with dream quests to hunt lucky mouses.`Even though dungeon is somewhat randomized, you go thru it so many times to try to finish quests, it gets boring.`lucky mouse quests....do i need to say more?`a bit of laggy, but still playable on windows 10.` $15.00 for a mediocre game is quite expensive for what it is. Buy on sale only!NOTE: This game only contains pre-made characters. You cannot make your own. Some people will see this as a con of the game . It does not really bother me, but i do like flexibility of character creation. I removed it because it does not bother me and did it when chatting to a friend.OVERALL IMPRESSION: Mediocre. Ive played worse games that don't even work on windows 10. I played beter ones too...don't expect a triple A game, but don't expect an unplayable game either.My personal opinion: Neutral. Mostly this is due to the quest issues i am having in a game. , and some quests are very hard to finish, especially the mouse ones. I would use a neutral setting for this game, but due to not having any, i will leave at negative due to hard quests, like the mouse ones.			"

My playtime: 26:45:59 (based on internal clock, casual (easiest) difficulty, 100% achievement)Grindy Achievement: Yes (12h+)Optional Achievement: Yes (17 achievements, 4 achievements need to be unlocked in second, third, and fourth replay)Developer Response: ~1 weekIntroDarkEnd is a dungeon crawler with turn based battle game made in RPG Maker. As its genre states, the game focuses in exploring a floor-based dungeon with grinding as its spice. You'll be able to play 2 out of 4 characters and uncover the main character's past.MusicI love the music, especially the intro and outro. They really matches with the graphics, especially the outro, because it's timed very well. The music selection for the others are also great, as it brings up the atmosphere of the area. However, Svaz's sfx in the cutscene when he's drinking the phial near the end of the game sounds weird.GraphicsMost, if not all, of the sprites graphics are RTP Assets. The dungeon design is great though, while it has a simple and easy dungeon in the first few area, it's slowly becomes bigger and harder in the next area (except for the extra area, which always gives the same simple map). Dark Dimension area needs some light though. Because it is ""Dark"" Dimension, it doesn't need to be that dark. I am having trouble in seeing the area at first, although i slowly get used to it. But still, it can hurt my eyes.This game has a lot of 2D graphics in the cutscenes. While i think that the feel is great, the graphics need some work, or maybe it's not just my style. I love the ""head"" character graphics though (the one used for talking). StoryThe game will unfold a story about the main character that you choose (you get to choose a main character and a supporting character out of 4 characters). Each character will have a different cutscene (although it still has the same game flow) and some different dialogue based on the character that you choose. Xia's dialogue looks somehow forced to flow with the story though.The cutscene that you'll see will be a fragment of memories of the characters and because of its nature, you will have to figure out how the story works. However, in the ending, the story still holds a great mystery and somehow feels like it's not the true ending. I think that it will be explained after i played all characters, but sadly, it never happens. I still confused with how the story goes (mostly for the continuation after the ending) because it still left some unexplained mysteries.Side QuestsThere will be side quests given by a NPC for each area, which will be either item gathering and boss slaying. The boss slaying quest requires some luck to reach the floors with the boss or hidden entrance in it and the item gathering requires some luck because of the terrible drop rate. There is even a monster with a low spawn chance and the terrible drop rate makes it a great combination. I ended up spending ~12 hours (and ended up to be able to maximize my skill tree in my first playthrough) because of it. Note that you beat the boss at level ~37 and you can max your skill tree at level ~82.There are also other side quests which will spawn directly in one of the floors. Imo, this quest is worse than the one mentioned above because it needs luck at least twice to finish the quest. Also, there is a side quest which will turn out badly for you if you picked the wrong choice. Luckily, the quests reset in New Game+ so you could just ditch all the side quests you are doing in that save and finish it in the other playthrough if you screw it up.The thing that i like about the side quests are the fact that they are logged. But it would be nice to get a notification once you finish the things required for the quest like how the main quests are.The gameThe game will let you choose 2 out of 4 characters and all of them will have different battling style. The dungeon is designed to have 50 floors (with some extra dungeons) with 8 areas and a boss in the end of each area. After you clear an area, more items and side quests will be unlocked. There are four selectable difficulties which can't be changed once you started the game. Although the game might be quite grindy, there is a Milestone Leveling feature to auto level your characters after you reach a certain point. However, it doesn't work in my second playthrough. You still need to grind because of the side quests even with Milestone Leveling turned on though.Because of how the story goes, you have to play all characters as a main character at least once to unfold all stories. Luckily, the levels and items are carried on to the New Game+. However, the key items are not carried on. You'll need some keys in order to proceed to the next floor in the dungeon and i lost them all in New Game+ although i have maxed them in my first playthrough.There is a different skill tree for each characters. The skills are divided into 3 sections: Specials (consumes EP, which is charged by normal attacks), Magics (consumes MP, which can be regenerated by some characters), and Passives. Each characters have its own skill set and although you can choose which one to learn, you won't be able to learn them all unless you put an effort (or trick) into it. Your supporting character will gain a lot of experience after you finish the game and you'll be able to master all skills easily that way. However, all skills reset after each New Game+ so you will have to re-learn them all.The game has no random encounters, but some parts of the floor has been designed to only have one straight tiles which makes it impossible to avoid some fights. There are some unexplained debuffs in game, such as corruption and soaked. I never find out what does it do even after i finished playing the game.I don't know if it's just me, but the game lags a little in the dungeon. It doesn't really ruins the game except the fact that i have a hard time to dodge the enemies because of it. You'll get used it though.There is a preemptive strikes and ambushes in this game. However, i don't know how it works. I tried to ""stab"" the enemies from behind, but it fails. I even got ambused in the process.There are a lot of typos and minor bugs in the game, which makes me wonder whether the game has been tested before sold.Pros:- 2 out of 4 playable characters with different ""story""- Trackable side quests- Difficulty selectionCons:- The ending makes no sense- Terrible item drop rate (which makes the side quest to be grindy)- Luck based (for meeting the NPC and item drop rate)ConclusionThis is a dungeon crawler game which is focused in grinding.Should you buy this game?No.Well, actually i was in a bind thinking whether to recommend it or not. The game is cheap enough if it's on sale (especially when it's on 90%), but thinking how grindy it is and how unclear the story is, not to mention the lag that i received when i played it, i decided to not recommend it. If you like to do the same thing over and over, you'll better buy this game when it's on sale. "

												The game is ok, it's got a nice story line as far as I can tell and I like how the text seem to be specific for each character (like I was treated like a girl and even sometimes people tended to believe I was not so dangerous, in other moments people would sense my dark powers and be apreensive of that, which I guess would be diferent if I chose the knight).Only problem is it crashed twice in 100 minutes of gameplay (that's more than once every hour) and that is really annoying. Also didn't seem to be something related to some item or action, just random crashes.If the crash was fixed I could probably call it a great game (unless something else happens) but as it is it's an ok game.

												Actually quite a good RPGmaker game... 8/10. I have not played so many RPGMaker games yet, but what seemed to stand out to me was:1) its quite tough... especially the start is very difficult... you get poisoned often, which stays after the fight...2) has an auto level adjust option... this is really great! It automatically adjusts your level to a certain level in case you have no reached that level yet, if turned on... saves a lot on grinding, especially in the beginning... later on, I was always way ahead of the auto lv3) boss  and subboss fights require special tactics, which might kill you and make part of the progress gone... its always deciding should you try it now, or rather teleport out and save, to be ready the next time...Basically, the game is a 50 lv dungeon crawler with a small base, and every 6-10 level there is a permanent teleport point, once unlocked... took me much longer than thought for 1 playthrough, and it seems the story is different at the end once all 4 chars have been played.Cons:Some achievements did not unlock, and it was still grindy at times if you try to go for specific quests.

												After playing this game on/off for a few weeks, I gotta say, forget it. Play something else. The Good: The character selection and choices for upgrading is a nice touch. The world seems well thought out.The Bad: Errors in skill descriptions, way too much RNG. When a skill says it removes EVERY status aliment, that better mean every single aliment in the game. Afraid it doesn't remove blind, which made one boss a nightmare.The Ugly: The RNG. The desciprtion says this game is about strategy, but its really more about pray to the RNG goddess and hope. You only have a party of 2, so it only takes one unlucky turn to get a TPK in most battles (especially dungeons 6 and 7). Afraid this developer needs to research the old dungeon crawlers more and what people liked about them, as I can tell it was NOT the RNG that people liked (trust me, no one finds it fun to have your entire party paralyzed or frozen and then unable to move). Look at Eterian Odyessy and see how they did it, and take ideas from that. As it is, this game missed the mark horribly, and instead we got a game that is heavily dependent on the RNG and horribly unbalanced at that.			"

												I’ve played and beaten the non-steam version of this game a while ago. Overall a solid RPG. Recommend it for people who like to enjoy the challenging turnbased RPGs.DarkEnd is somewhat similar to the instant-classic Etarian Odyssey series. Light on story but rather focused on gameplay. The battles are really harsh for unprepared party and could get wiped easily by simple blunder. What I really like about this game is the boss battles. Most RPG maker RPGs I have played have rather simple boss battles. The bosses are only just stronger. All you need to do is use your strongest skills and heal when it is needed. It is not so simple in DarkEnd. Each and every boss, except the first one, has a catch and require special tactic to beat them. Since every spell and skill have cooldown and warm up timer, you have to think carefully which skill to be used at which moment. Spamming the strongest spell/skill without any strategy will only get yourself killed in DarkEnd.Optional bosses are also very challenging. Since you cannot save in the dungeon, it can be a really tensed situation when you try to challenge a rare optional boss in the randomly appeared sub-level.  I wish the developers should give the game some achievements to make challenging boss battles even more worthwhile.The story is nothing revolutionary. There are some interesting plot twists and lore which will be revealed late in game, but the story itself is pretty simple. The characters are well developed, especially Griselda and Lucion. However, the localization is a real let down in this game. Even as a second language user myself, I found some dialogues in game very cheesy and ridden with awkward grammar. Graphically, the game exactly of what you can expect of RPG maker games out there. I noticed the game used the stocked RTP materials mixed with some custom work. The pixel sprites are neat and colorful and some scenes in game are simple beautiful.  The characters’ portrait arts are nice too.Verdict : Have you ever played any of Etarian Series?  Do you like them? Do you like very challenging RPG? If your answer is a “Yes”, buy this (at least at the discount period) and you will enjoy this difficult but very rewarding RPG experience. A solid 7/10 game. "

												I have not yet finished the game, but I do find it somewhat entertaining.  I do like the custom artwork, it adds a nice touch to get a better feel for your character, and the little scenes on the gems made me smile, though im sure they will lead to other things as I progress further in the game.  I do love the option to choose harder difficulties, as I do love a good challenge.The graphics are generic RPG maker as far as I can tell, but the drawings are very good :)The sound is pretty repetative and entertaining.  As for the other reviewers any sound can be muted in your windows volume mixer (if your using windows).The story is simple yet satisfying enough to make me want to find out more about my character and the tragic event that befalls his past.The gameplay does spam poison a lot and I can pretty much predict when my charcter is going to hit or miss...I dont know if this is the generic combat system for rpg maker or a revamped coding, but i wish it was a little less predictable.  For example most fights my lead characters normal attack misses the first term, but special attacks dont miss.  This is with most battles,I have played many rpg maker games, and this is on the better side of the scale.   Do  i think its worth $15? not quite.  But if you can get it on sale for around 7 at most I recommend picking it up for sure, tthe random dungeon feature is entertaining and gives great replayability			"

DarkEnd Review     A solid 2D-RPG & Dungeon Crawler, make by a passionate indie studio ""Kodots Games"" & definitely one of the best traditional RPGs made by RM Engine..     In DarkEnd, You'll play as a pair chosen from 4 unique characters, both gameplay & story-wise, tackling through ever-shifting dungeons.. Battles within these places are of endurance type & how you approach each battle is up to the player with freedom of equipment & accessory choice, flexible skills system, so adapting to each encounter is the key to survival..     The opening scene may ""seems"" generic, but in-game atmosphere & minimalistic story-telling will keep the player intrigued while on the 10-15 hour ride per playthrough, with the brilliant execution of the plot-twists & Informations that answers some questions, while raising some other.. When the player has followed through with the stories of all 4 characters, you'll have your every answers..     & DarkEnd has the most interesting Boss fights.. There's never a dull moment when fighting the bosses, there're many unique twist & turns in these fights, not at all like modern immunity bosses or HP tank bosses..     All in all, DarkEnd is a reminder of everything we loved about playing a traditional RPG & a refresher of how they can be better.. If you're an avid RPG player like me, who's thinking modern RPGs has lost some of the glamour nowadays, You'll enjoy this little treat..			"

			steam http://store.steampowered.com/app/292370/ this game is pretty fun and if you enjoy 2D RPG's then go should look into this but if you are a graphics person then this is not really for you review...		

Dark end is a 2D RPG developed by Kosdots Games and Published by KISS ltd. The game follows the journey of a main character and a secondary character which are both selected at the start of the game from a choice of 4, the game offers a variety of difficulty levels to suit all players from those just interested in the story so do not wish for a hard game, those looking for the usual RPG experience and those in search of a game that will drive you insane with how hard it is. The game takes place after a great and powerful man lusted for power to rival even the Gods, he found power but unleashed the DarkEnd, the man was defeated but as time passes man forgets and the darkness now returns, choose your hero and fight the darkness. You journey to the frontier to fight the DarkEnd, to progress through the DarkEnd you must complete individual floors and leave through the portal but in order to use the portal you need a key, the keys can be found in chests or dropped from enemies and the floor boss, through each level you will encounter enemies and rare enemies. As expected the rarer enemies are well rarer and will put up more of a fight and give you more exp as a reward for killing them. You should not underestimate rare enemies they can be deadly and in the event your party dies you will have a game over and have to start from the last time you saved and that is only at the frontier, don’t lose all your progress out of pride. Do not fear you do not have to do the whole game in 1 run there are serpent gates which act as a checkpoint once activated you can then travel back to the point you left from the frontier after resupplying of course. The levels you progress through may change if you die and start them again they can change in that they have a boss rather than a chest or they can change all together. The game features several very catchy songs as all good RPG’s should. Each character can act each turn at the beginning you are given the option to fight or flee, each character can attack, defend, use magic or use a special the magic attacks use mp and the special attacks use Ep which is generated by attacking and getting hit, not all characters have a special to start with, magic and other abilities can be unlocked using the upgrade system which involves choosing to kindle various crystals. Each floor will differ if you have to repeat it such as loot and if a key spawns in a chest or you have to fight the boss for it, when you characters health is low you can use a potion or a heal spell. All spells and specials have a cool down so be sure to time their uses correctly and choose the right target an enemy with a fire weakness might well die in 1 hit to a fireball and an enemy with a fire resistance almost certainly will not. Spells initially have a warm up period as well meaning at the start you ca’t cast a fireball and destroy the enemy turn 1 but as you upgrade your spells the warm up will no longer be required.Dying in DarkEnd can be very frustrating especially if you are having a good run maybe you found some good loot and then you got cocky and a rare enemy destroyed you, but if you didn’t want a challenge you should have chosen a lower difficulty. Dying and retrying is how you learn anyway, although it can be sad to lose a good run it just encourages you to try again and not make the same mistakes.The combat of the game can be very strategic with you having to time your magic and special attacks to when they are best used for example an attack that provides a stun effect might keep you alive long enough to use a magic that was on cool down next turn.The DarkEnd is split into floors of 5 on the 5th floor you will encounter a boss and also get some story, after the set of 5 floors you will then enter a new area with new music, new enemies(far harder) etc.The art style of the game is just lovely with the majority of the game having the usual 2D RPG look but during tutorials and cut scenes the looks of the characters truly show the time taken to create.Overall from playing DarkEnd I highly recommend it to any 2D RPG fans it has a beautiful look, charming characters, good combat and a catchy soundtrack what more do you need?The only negative is the game has a small resolution meaning if you are a graphics snob this probably isn’t for you.I rate this game highly and would give it an 8/10 for a small indie game it is excellent and is currently in my top 10 games of the year.

												What the blin. Apparently game not like me. Crashed after beat last monster on floor 3. I don't really understand. Back to Fallout i guess.Would have liked hardbass for soundtrack and the ability to squat and it would be a 9/10.Better than No Man's Sky though.Would recommend to people that actually like this type of game(RPG maker or what you call it).

												While it won't win any RPG Maker awards, DarkEnd is an OK attempt at a traditional dungeon crawler. The positives are mostly in design.  The world creation and levels are decently thought out.  It plays well with a controller, my case a Logitech RumblePad.  It has a very old school quest hub system that harkens back to pen and paper D&D.  I loved its use of lighting.  It created a rather unusual fog of war which normally isn't seen in RPGs today.There were two serious drawbacks that keep it from being a great game.  First, it is grindy, even on Casual level.  After a while it, I felt bored playing it.  It was fight after, fight after, fight with very little story telling. It needed more story to break the monotony of battle.  The biggest drawback is questing.  After unlocking all the overland characters, you find one NPC that spams crafting missions.  It totally ruins the experience of completing the side/major quests.  Should have split them into at least two groups.  The other aspect is its randomness prevents completion of some quests as they don't trigger during exploration.  This forces the player to redo previously beat content where you are often so over-powered that it drags.If you like grindy RPGs, this is at least worth a look for at most a $5 spot.			"

												Great game! Not giving DarkEnd a chance simply because it's an RPGMaker game is just unfair. As a classic RPG lover, the grinding and learning tactics the hard way is the most enjoyable part. Reminds me of DarkSouls!			"

												Darkend is the Myanmar's first RPG game which is developed by Kodots Game Studio.Highly recommend for both who love rpg games from NES genration and who start to play classic RPG games since its gameplay is not too hard for beginners ( I'm also RPG game beginner). Highly recommend to Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest fans too......There will be new expansion called ""The Vault of Avalon"" which will include 5 hours + gameplay.DarkEnd has been  described in 9 Best PC indie games of2014.

												DarkEnd.Did it look good?Yes.Was it good?No.The game has a decent story, albeit cliche. World been destroyed. Noted. That's it for story, basically.The game has very tradition RPGMaker gameplay. Which is horrendously outdated. I love Final Fantasy titles with a burning passion, but I cannot play this game to save my life. It's so dull.Is the game challenging? Yes. Too much so in fact. It makes the game unplayable with how difficult it is.I played about 30 mins and can say without a doubt, I regret this purhase completely. If you want a good RPG with better story and much more doable, go play Legionwood, which is free.			"

												An interesting 2D RPG in a tradiontal format. Pick 2 characters from a selection of heros at the start and begin your adventure! Brings back a lot of nostaligia for classic RPG's with simple but easy to understand menus and gameplay. If your a fan of old school adventures then this may be something for you!

												If we had the year 1998, I would totally recommend this game. But nowadays this is just a joke! For 13 Euro you get much better games, with much more fun, better graphics and much better sounds. Even for less money you get better stuff. I wouldn't even recommend this game for 5€! Pros: - It looks interestingNegative:- No sound in cinematics, you got the read EVERYTHING!- Graphics are damn old...even for RPGMaker!- Many flaws in the english text. - Cinematics look like they were made in a MangaMaker Tool. But don't get me wrong...this game ain't bad...it is just not worth the price!			"
