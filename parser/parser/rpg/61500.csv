												tl;dr Yes, but with a warning below.Age of Wonders, despite the age, is still a worthwhile game. It can appear deceptively simple at first, but as you begin to chip away at the abilities and magic system, you realise just how important deeper knowledge of the game mechanics can be.A lot of the game has been covered by other reviewers. Essentially: turn based fantasy strategy game with empire management. Unlike the sequels - and many other games of its type - in Age of Wonders if your leader dies, you lose the game. This adds an extra layer of risk - your leader is powerful and can take down many basic units, but one wrong move and the game's over. It can sound cheap, but it really puts the stress on in major battles, something other strategy games miss out on. There is an option to remove this for the skirmishes, if you're not keen on it.THE WARNING: this game, as it sits on Steam, is faulty. It crashes a lot - A LOT. Some people are fine, but looking at the reviews and the forums, it's wide spread enough for it to be an issue. You can fix this with a Hex editor. Now, I know some basic fixes are acceptable, but having to use a hex editor to fix the game is not. I imagine a lot of people out there don't know what a hex editor is, or how to even use one. Furthermore, I don't see any reason why this can't be done on the developers end - it took me two minutes, and would save everyone else a lot of headache.Anyway, if you know what you're doing, this thread has the instructions: http://steamcommunity.com/app/61500/discussions/0/864973123853580717/I very nearly put this as a thumbs down, but the cheap price, brilliant gameplay, and the fact that a fix is available - courtesy of the fan base (which, by the way, provide more maps and content than you'll ever manage to get through), I really can't bring myself to do it.Thumbs up, only just, though.

												I bought this game mainly due to nostalgia, having played it shortly after it came out in 1999. I knew beforehand there would be some frustration thanks to lacking quality of life improvements we are now accustomed to in modern games.I gave it a shot nevertheless and I'm happy I did it. Sure, it can at times be cumbersome and tiring, especially when the enemy AI sends a lone dwarf across the otherwise impassable mountains to conquer the gold mines in your backyard. *shakes fist*But the gameplay overall was fun. Leveling up your heroes, selecting their new skills and equipping them with loot from the dungeons and haunted ruins you occasionally encounter is what made me love this game all those years ago. And it's still great.This game is not for everyone, I know, and it might be an acquired taste. But I immensely enjoyed playing through it once more.			"

												Considering that age of wonders 3 is out now, you may think that skipping this title and going on to a bigger brighter game might be a good idea, but then you would miss out on the diamond that started this series.  This game is a strategic/tactical game that really has the power to draw you in with its unique armies and keeps you playing due to the overwelming number of strategies, tactics, and options at your disposal.  Be prepared for anything as each upgrade you learn about will seem even more overpowered than the last and be amazed at how well this old school AI keeps up with the varied options at your command.  I guess what I am getting at is, if you think you like turn based strategy games, give this game a shot.  You won't be sorry.			"

												Age of Wonders and its sequels remains the best of the Master of Magic heirs. The game has a number of races to play, two campaigns with branching points, tactical combat, magic systems and customizable characters. Its citybuilding is simplified, however. I'd recommend it and the rest of its family to people looking for a fantasy 4X style game though at this point they are all a bit dated and are not without frustrating gameplay aspects. But they are inexpensive and still enjoyable. I'd recommend this until something newer comes along to topple it, and so far nothing that I've played has.			"

												A great table top style fantasy war game with role-playing elements. Dated graphics to be sure but the unit artwork is immersive as are unit descriptions. I always play as the good guys but you have the option of playing as the evil ones if so desired. Keep your display at 1028 x 760 or 800 x 600 or the units get very tiny. If you like turn-based strategy games you will love this one. 9/10.Music is some of the best ever for fantasy setting.			"

												=== Age of Wonders - Game Review, Turn-based Strategy - 10/10 ===     If you like turn-based strategy, whether it's in a table top game or a video game, Age of Wonders is at the top of the list.     Age of Wonders was released back in 1999, so we're getting pretty close to the grand 20-year mark in age. For such an old game, you might think it would look pretty aged and unable to hold up to present-day gaming. In my opinion, this game is a classic that is still plenty of fun to play and has a great art-style that still looks great even to this day. If you go back to the original pictures of this game before it was released, the art is so simple and would easily have gotten old pretty quick. Thankfully they decided to go in a bit of a different direction which I think looks like someone painted it by hand; this sort of painted-looking art-style is definitely my favourite. Of course the visuals are important when deciding whether or not to play a game, but there's so much more to talk about.     The gameplay is turn-based; if you're really into board games, this will feel just like playing a board game where everybody takes a turn one at a time to plan out their strategy and execute their plan of action to the best of their ability. There are some options such as having the map already explored, whether or not to have your leader as a playable character in the game, and whether the turns are taken simultaneously or one at a time. Personally, I prefer to have to explore everything on my own, have a leader, and have turns played one at a time; though every once in a while I change it up for fun.     Games can be a little as 2-players all the way up to 12 with each player playing a different race; each of which have different advantages and disadvantages. Each game revolves around capturing cities and other landmarks, then using the income from those sources to create the right mixture of units to eliminate your opponents. If you've ever played a turn-based combat game, you may already understand how each attack has a chance to hit or miss. If you really enjoy the strategy of combat, you can choose to control each battle yourself, or have the game automatically generate an outcome for you. Obviously this speeds up the game to have it decide on an outcome for you, but the system has a certain way of doing its calculations which can sometimes give you a completely different outcome from controlling the battle on your own. One example is if you're trying to protect a unit that is low on health, you can choose to have that unit run away on your own, but the computer-generated outcome will run that unit headlong into battle even on 1 health point.     Throughout the game you also have to choose what spells to research to help tip the scales in your favour. Your leader and additional heroes which join you during the course of the game may or may not have the ability to cast spells. These leaders and heroes have an amount of spell points which get refreshed at the beginning of each new turn and from this they can cast spells which each cost a number of spell points. Choices of spells can change the state of the overworld map, enchant units to make them stronger, or can be used in battle to turn the tides in an otherwise unwinnable situation.     I you can't tell, I absolutely love this game and could go on and on about all the great qualities forever, but unfortunately at some point I have to aknowledge the grit of the game. There are some points which can be a little bit painful either due to the age of the game or due to design. Depending on how much time you have, you may enjoy watching all the animations. Some days I like having a relaxing time watching the animations go on, but they can be a little bit slow sometimes which makes an already long game take even longer to play. You can be playing just one map for an entire month without proceeding to the next scenario. This is why I tend to play while running a program which speeds up the game. My only other real gripe about Age of Wonders is that it has a habit of crashing while playing in any kind of windowed mode. This usually isn't a bad thing as I prefer to play on true fullscreen anyways, but there is another problem where if you tab out of the game and tab back in, it likes to either crash or not open back up... which can make it difficult if you have other things going on while you want to play some Age of Wonders. This makes you have to plan sessions to play rather than just opening it up whenever for a bit while doing other things.     Overall, even with the negatives of this game, I have to give Age of Wonders 10 / 10 because it's just so amazing for me. I highly recommend getting this game and playing through it if you're into strategy. The Age of Wonders games are my favourite turn-based strategy series so far (though I haven't managed to start playing the new Age of wonders III yet).

												This is a good game. Do you like Turn Based Strategy games or play tabletop Warhammer back home? Well I didn't either, but suddenly -- after letting myself enough time to understand this in depth fantasy world -- I started to feel like this game was a home. And suddenly I become addicted beyond measure. No... addiction is a cruel world for this mistress... I would say that the hours that can be whisked away playing Age of Wonders is a true seduction of honor.Expect the random map games to make you wonder where your day went. Expect grandest campaigns to last days. Fronts will be strategized, politics will be blumbered, and battles are fought to every fantasy wonder you could dream. This is an age of wonders!			"

												This game is a hidden gem. Not so famous as HoMaM series but definitely with all important mechanics that could make a good game. RPG system for heroes, unit gaining XP and bonuses, magic in battles and magic for overland campaign, magic items from dungeons, city development, multi level maps, siege engines, ship combat, air combat, hell even ships vs. dragon combat is possible :D ....name it you get it. The combat system is easy to understand yet allows quite complex strategies. The AoW2 is better in many aspects (or they managed to polish almost all aspects to perfectness) yet I cannot help myself but have to love feeling and immersion of AoW1. Music, simplistic graphics and campaign maps which could take a lot of time to explore and scout every possible part,dungeon..Yet the size is not overkill as in AoW2 where some maps are literally huge even by my standards.

												Age of Wonders is a fairly old game, but I still very much enjoy its simple yet complex gameplay. While its sequels improved vastly on some aspects of the game, I still feel that combat was the most entertaining in the original.The story is fairly straightforward, and unlike the later titles, allows you to play as the ""Good"" faction or the ""Evil"" faction for the story. At several segments, you'll be presented with a decision to make, but only the second and third decisions will influence the Campaign any. These two decisions will also alter the ending sequence.The combat is one thing I enjoy the most in the original Age of Wonders. There's only a few voices for when units take damage (Most use a halfling-esque gasp or wail, even the orcs and dark elves!) but after a bit of fighting the battlefields truly begin to look like a battlefield  -  blood splatters onto the ground every time a successful attack is landed, and spills out when a unit is killed. These remain until the battle's ended, and really make a long difficult battle with several large stacks look so much more 'epic' to me personally. The map editor isn't much to look at - every piece of decoration and every tile has to be placed manually, and there's no Random Map feature. However, it's still capable of making extra maps to enjoy after the built in scenarios are exhausted, but some effort will have to be put into that. The sequels refined the editors quite a bit, making detailing and carving out a map much more efficient.Power Nodes and Altars and Dungeons... I really enjoyed the dungeon maps when you explore a location, even if they were a bit tedious at times to explore. The sequels replace these with simplified terrain maps, which are much quicker to engage in at the cost of being less aesthetically pleasing in most cases - the same with city sieges. As most of those expansive detailed maps went unused in most cases, this isn't really all that bad gameplay wise.   Power Nodes in the original only provided Magic Income if your leader wielded a sphere of magic of that element. Thus, a leader using just Death and Fire magic would receive no income from owning an Earth, Air, or Life node. In the sequels, you recieve reduced income from opposing nodes.  Altars are a feature that were removed from the sequels. They were map locations that allowed you to cast powerful AoE spells onto the world map, just like the Divine Storm and other similar magics.  Either for free after a long charge period, or immediaely for a cost - and a very steep one if you're impatient. There are a few minor tidbits I fount interesting that don't really affect the gameplay or rating any. First, in the flavor text for the Elementals (Fire Elemental, etc) they are stated they can be called at Gates - but no such locations exist. In fact, it's not until the sequels that you could hire troops from On-Map locations.  The Sea Serpent monster also states that they can be coerced into serving via powerful Water Magic, but no spells of this sort exist. In the sequel however, the ""Great Wyrm"" is indeed a Level 4 Water spell.  Finally, some units claim that they will only serve 'Good' leaders, but they themselves are of a Neutral or Creature alignment,  the latter meaning they'll get along even with Evil and Pure Evil leaders!I also very much loved the portraits that map locations and many creatures had.  Some of these were re-used in the sequel (Like the generic Human Soldier portrait) but others weren't.I really loved this game and the series as a whole, hopefully others may also find enjoyment in this title.

												This is one of those games that I find myself coming back to again and again. I've played the sequels, but none of them can quite recreate the magic (no pun intended) of this classic. Everything from the fairly antiquated, yet still crisp and detailed graphics through the many tactical subtleties of combat which few later games have explored equally, to the absolutely brilliant and very loveable soundtrack. There is no reason why any fan of strategy, RPG and/or fantasy shouldn't have this game in his/her collection. The probably most annoying flaw of the game, is the relatively small number of maps to play, and with no random map generator, you will play through the entire game quite fast. Luckily, there are still fans making and posting maps for everyone to download and rate. And of course, there is included with the game a super simple and intuitive map generator with all the tools you need to make whatever you like. What I love most with this game is the rock solid gameplay, the timeless-without-being-boring take on fantasy races and themes, as well as the amount of units and options avaliable to you, combined with all the little details such as bloody, beaten corpses littering the battlefield and fields disappearing outside a city under siege. It makes for a game where you can instantly tell the team behind it has put their minds and souls into its creation. An attribute few games possess these days.Now, Triumph Studios just need to do the HD remake.			"

												This was definitely a really solid game when it came out.  While going through campaigns it does feel a little too time consuming playing out each fight, while having the fights automatically simulate themselves feels like a cheap way to play through the game.   I enjoy the game at times but other times it just moves way too slow for me and I get bored.  I love games like this where you have tactical battles and able to level up special characters and equip them with different skills or weapons, even the regular units can be leveled up, but it just doesn't feel as rewarding as it should.  This game was ahead of its time though so I really can't give it a bad review.  Alot of different unit types and races, and the storyline in the game is pretty good as well.  If you can get it dirt cheap try it out.			"

												Age of Wonders is an old and trusted Turn Based Strategy game. It takes place in a fantasy world you can choose to either save or conquer, and inorder to do that you have to play diplomacy to other races.A big factor in Age of Wonders is racism. Other races don't harbour well with your character depending on his/her race, and if you conquer a city for instance depending on the force you leave in there they may revolt. The game in general bridges the gap with tradtional strategy games and party based RPGs, it mixes a little of both here and there.It is one of those games that feels very rewarding to play for a very long time and accomplish something. It also features multiplayer and strangely enough, play by Email multiplayer where players take turns over email. There's also a scenario editor and dozens of fanmade campaigns online.			"

												Oh my god, the nostalgia...If you got the same age than me, you should understand, but if you're a young boy or girl, you need to know what this game is.Age of Wonders is a fantasy tactical game where you choose to play as the Good or the Evil side. With a lot of races playables, such as elves, orcs, humans and stuff, you need to clear objectives of each mission of your side.Take some villages, make units of all races, explore some dungeons, level up your character, make him/her learn some new skills and face the other side into epic turn-by-turn or instantly fights.Each move you make can makes you win... Or lose.So, sure, the graphics looks old, but it's still enjoyable for the eyes.The Musics are pure epicness but, for that point, this may be my nostalgia that take effect.You will not find any other strategy game as complete and interresting as this one.

												Back in the day I somehow skipped on Heroes of MnM 3 and picked up this instead. It's a charming little turn-based strategy game where you control small squads of individual units (unlike the stacks in HoMM) and can move unit groups without a hero attached.The game is admittedly simpler than HoMM when it comes to depth and strategy and features a couple of exploits that can turn it into easy-mode cheese but it was an entertaining and beautiful romp nonetheless.The soundtrack by Michiel van den Bos is also quite amazing, especially considering it was Impulse Tracker orchestral tunes.

												Age of Wonders is a game I grew up with and thus I couldn't wait to play it again. The gameplay is turned-based (in both battle and on the map) like Heroes of Might and Magic. However, your hero units actually fight too and should not be lost as then you will lose the match. The music is great and the campaign/scenario's are still great to play with. Though it is somewhat more difficult than I can remember.			"

												I've played this for a couple hours, and it is the best advertisement for their franchise that I could have possibly experienced.  This game is very fun.  Challenging, but not too much. Very unforgiving though, when you do something stupid.  For example, on the second level I took too many turns, so my entire campaign failed, and I had to restart the game.As bad as that sounds, it was a lot of fun, and I look forward to starting the campaign again.Perhaps the most important factor that makes me think I'll be buying the other age of wonders games is that they support 1920x1080 monitor resolution.  An odd thing to care so much about, but this is a really old game.  Even games that are 10 years newer don't support 1920x1080 montiors.  So, it's obvious that they gave the game some loving recently.  A company that will keep their games fresh even when they're releasing newer ones is one that garners my interest aplenty.I can't imagine someone regretting this purchase (especially on sale, I got it for something like 1.99) who is interested in old school games, tactical combat, city conquering and income management.  If you don't like this game, you probably just don't like the genre, or aren't willing to put up with the minor old-school issues like bad graphics or extra clicks to accomplish things.Of note, I have an astigmatism, and, for me, the graphics at 1920x1080 are too small to easily distinguish between units and landscape.  However, the text is legible, which was not my experience with the game Startopia (which is totally unrelated to this game) - that game has text so small that it was pointless for me to try to play it at 1920x1080, but AoW was fine.

												I love this game! One of the bests for me. Great strategy game with fantasy and rpg themes. It has singleplayer/multiplayer/singleplayer-campaign and you can play ""classic style turns"" or ""simultaneous"". You are represented by the lord of your people and can not let him die.  Your character levelup like any good RPG, and his people too.  You can choose abilities and powers from a big list to customize your character and make him a good fighter, mage, or ranged attacker... This game offers 12 fantasy races really cool to play. The look is clean and simple. This comes with a map editor too for those who like it. Also this game has female portraits for girls. Negative side: AI is very stuppid and need to ""cheat"" to be challenger! It has few official big maps with only ""after the fall"" really nice for 12 players.  Some units are unbalanced and schools of magic too. The cities do not have many improvements to make. And the worst is: the game crashs some times. For me the downside does not overcome the positive. Sadly games 2 and 3 of this franchise does not have the same qualities. I support a remake of this game with modern graphics.			"

												Oh my god, the nostalgia...If you got the same age than me, you should understand, but if you're a young boy or girl, you need to know what this game is.Age of Wonders is a fantasy tactical game where you choose to play as the Good or the Evil side. With a lot of races playables, such as elves, orcs, humans and stuff, you need to clear objectives of each mission of your side.Take some villages, make units of all races, explore some dungeons, level up your character, make him/her learn some new skills and face the other side into epic turn-by-turn or instantly fights.Each move you make can makes you win... Or lose.So, sure, the graphics looks old, but it's still enjoyable for the eyes.The Musics are pure epicness but, for that point, this may be my nostalgia that take effect.You will not find any other strategy game as complete and interresting as this one. I purely recommend it !			"

Even today, especially for fans of 4X-Games like CIvilization, although its gamplay-aspects are mostly trimmed down and very straightforward.But the sad thing is I can't get it to work without crashing every 10 to 40 minutes. Since I played a lot of it in my childhood I wanted to experience it again. So don't missunderstand my recommendation, because I have to judge the steam version. And unplayable is still unplayable...Just buy the CD-Version for a Euro and try getting it to work with that, should be easier and without trouble. The game itself is easy enough to pick up and play through! And the custom map editor is pretty cool too!I heard the second Game is even better.Gonna try that next!Although if you rather want something modern, try Endless Legend!			"

Also customizable leaders is a great part of the game.  You can pick the types of magic your leader focuses on.  NOTE:  If you are having the same problems that some people have experienced with this game (including myself) where the game plays but the screen just freezes and you still get video or the main menu, just hit alt+enter to change the game to windowed mode at the main menu.  It should solve the problem and once you exit the game correctly it will remember that it works in the windowed version.  Hope this helps some people to get the game to work!			"

												This is a very good game, with interesting story, lots of campaign missions, offline and multiplayer scenarios to play.  This is the quite simply a really good turn based strategy game. You fight your way through many different scenarios playing how you want to play, either allying with other factions to work together against your enemies, or crushing all who would oppose you. Beside the many scenarios, there is a huge campaign which can be played from two perspectives: The Keepers who choose the path of light and seek to return the world to peace and tranquility, and The Cult of Storms who would seek death to the humans who removed them from their position of power. With an amazing soundtrack, endless hours of entertainment and a huge fan base offering hundreds of mods and additional scenarios that is still alive even now years later. However, I can't recommend the game because on a Windows 10 system, it constantly crashes. Regardless of type of compatability mode I try. It's sad, because this is truly a fun game.			"

I would have liked this game when it first came out but now I find it a bit dragging out at late game, the teleporting shrines do get annoying. Heroes are important, a single hero can wipe out whole enemy armies so take care of them and level them up. Downside you don't get to take all your magic armor, weapons or heros with you to the next level. Regular units aren't worth producing unless they are the high tier ones, but that takes time.Only get this game if your really into the genre.			"

												I highly recommend this classic fantasy strategy gem. For anyone that grew up playing the Heroes series, Age of Empires, Civ, etc. they will find a lot to like here. It has a nice mix of light empire building, strategy, deep combat, and a branching quest for both the heroes (Keepers) and villains (Cult of Storms). It also offers a plethora of non campaign missions which are great once you've beaten the main game. There is also a custom mapmaker for those who want to craft their own quests. Well worth a try, and if you factor in all of the content, it's a great deal for the money! If you like this one, I also recommend picking up the trilogy pack (Age of Wonders II and the Shadow Magic add-on) as the sequels expand on the solid gameplay mechanics. Recently, the highly anticipated Age of Wonders III finally released so if you have played that title and like what you see, try out the original games which inspired it.UPDATE: With the Steam awards being announced, I decided to nominate this fantastic game for the ""Test of Time"" game award. Hope it wins!			"

												The game plays like Heroes of Might and Magic 4 which you can't buy on Steam.  They only let you get 3, 5, and 6 for whatever reason.Still, the economy is very basic.  The campaign is very weird.  The AI suffers from either having an abundance of spammed units, or having a large economy that lets it spawn more spams.  I don't know why people think it adapts to upgraded tactics at all.  The game seems to succumb very easily to upgraded spells and units unless it just has a ton of units or premade units to counter with.   Often, the easy way to win is just raze a ton of enemy controlled cities so they can't spawn spams anymore since they don't have cities to build with or afford upkeep.  Thankfully, despite the morale system, there's also a race system.  That means the enemy will usually contain races that you don't contain, so when you raze their cities, it doesn't impact your own troops' morale.  I basically just played this game like Atilla the Hun, and it never really got challenging.  The only times you don't raze cities is if the computer was dumb enough to not conquer them in the first place.  Then, you just amass troops, and rush the enemy capital.   There's no need to bother with attacking independents if they just slow you down after you accepted the independents you're compatible with.Honestly, Battle of Wesnoth is better... and it's free.

												May be a good game, but never got far enough in it to see. The screen kept annoyingly flickering regardless of what fix I tried, and the game bears signs of its generation - namely counter-intuitive UI and a not too comprehensive tutorial.This day and age it isn't worth more of my time.

												I have nearly 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews.One Hour Reviews - Game 3Age of WondersPurchase Date: 5/22/2014I'd never played any of the Age of Wonders series.  This one I picked up as part of a Humble Bundle last year.    Humble is one of the reasons I ended up with as many games as I have, as they are a great excuse to donate a few dollars to a good cause and pick up a bundle of games while you are at it.  I get a lot of of games I wouldn't otherwise try this way.As soon as I got into the game, I was immediately reminded of Heroes of Might and Magic.  Anyone who has ever played any of those games will be familar here.  I saw a lot of the same concepts here, with an emphasis on tactical turn based combat, along with exploration and town management.Even though it's an older game, it ran absolutely fine on my system, and I could run at my native 1920x1080 resolution.  The text is a little small to read at that resolution, but otherwise I had no issues.    I had recently played Age of Empires II, and like that game, I found myself wanting to use the scrollwheel on my mouse to zoom in and out of the map, forgetting that scrollwheels weren't used in games back then.  Graphically speaking, the maps looked good, but I wasn't as impressed with the units, particularly the animation.I started by going through the tutorial, which is pretty basic.  It covers the basics of getting around and how to issue commands to your party, but when it comes to actual strategy you are on your own.  It doesn't give you any sense for what you are about to get yourself into.  And I say this because this is not an easy game for someone just starting out.  In fact, I actually managed to die during the tutorial and had to start over.  It was my own fault, I sent my party leader to the front lines and he got himself killed, which immediately ended the game.Once you finish the campaign, Age of Wonders offers you a campaign mode, which you can play from one of 2 sides, either the elves or the goblins.  The game also comes with a number of scenarios that you can play as well.  Since this is only an hour review, I did not look at any of the multiplayer, but I did find it interesting that the game has a play by email option.  I'm not used to seeing that in a lot of games.I played a quick game though each side of the campaign.  I say quick game because Age of Wonders is not a kind game, and you can get yourself killed very quickly.  I did a little better when I played a scenario, but even then it wasn't terribly long before I was wiped out.  This is a game that expects you to learn from your mistakes, like any strategy game.  Ultimately I don't think this is really a game for me.    I didn't really see anything about this game to make it stand out.   Playing this just made me think back to playing the old Heroes of Might and Magic games.Overall Recommendation:  Pass "

												ok in all honesty this is one of my favorite games. i've owned it for a long time before i got it on steam (because i lost it). i lovethe game its a fantastic game. however, i dont know if there is a problem with the coding of the game on steam or if its because ofwindows 8 but anytime i minimixethe game it glitches and distorts all colors and duplicates the screen. im actually very dissappointed with this since i usually either will accidently hit it or i often do multiple things at once. i give the game itself a 9/10 but bacause of this glitch i have to lower the official score to 5/10. very dissapointed with the glitch.

												I really don't understand how this game could have scored so many positive reviews. They are probably all from people who don't know the original games this one is a pale copy from. If you want some good turn-based strategy, stick to Heroes of Might and Magic 3, or try Masters of Magic. Ok, now, what is my problem with this game? It really doesn't take long to explain: it just lacks content. It gets boring after few hours. Not only is there nothing I haven't seen before in other games, there are also missing many elements that make other games interesting. For example, there are only two(!) ressources, mana and gold. All upgrades to your cities only produce units, there are no other boons (like, gaining items, some ressources or boosts to hero stats). The AI is rather stupid, even after a few hours of playing it's totally simple to win fights with few losses even when you're outnumbered. The diplomacy screen is a joke, you can't even trade technologies (i.e. spells). I have to admit that I haven't played long enough to see even a fraction of the spells available, those might still cut it. I'll play on a bit (though bored already) and if they do, I might change my review.			"

												I loved this game when i was a kid. These steam ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s destroyed it. The AI is now ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, lifesteal is now a waste of time to get, and theres all sorts of strange bugs that cause the game to pull a derp and shutdown like when you scroll across the map when you have fog of war disabled. Say you want to see how far away the next city is, games gonna pull a derp and shutdown. The AI in this game used to be fun. There was squire (easiest) and lord (hardest). That's what i remember, good AI even on the squire setting. I tried it out with the new hardest AI setting which is something called Emperor. Turns out all that does now is make their leader level up faster. Doesnt do ♥♥♥♥ for strategy or anything of that sort. The old ♥♥♥ game that i played i gave a 10/10. It was amazing. This steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ i give a 4/10 simply because it seems they kept most of the music and lore from the original. At least you can still edit and make your maps though that's pointless now since the AI is absolute fail.			"

Welp, this is one of them, but it's not just any ordinatey late 90's/ early 2000's turn base stradegy game, oh no sirey bob, this is top tier ♥♥♥♥. You pick your side, evil or slightly less evil, load out your hero guys cast type (Fire, Water, Air, Blood of the innocent, ect.), pick your race (If you pick anything less than Orc or Highmen, than good luck with that) and work your way through a nice story that I didn't care to read because i'm here to kick ♥♥♥, not read fairy tales.Loads of enjoyment to be had in it's fairly lengthy campain with plenty of rage inducing battles where you learn your once invinsible undead unit can be one-hit-killed with a holy strike.

												I know I dont have many hours of play on this game and I dont usually review games if I have not played them for long but I have played AoW it when it first came out in 1999 and many years afterwards until my copy was lost. I think it's safe for me to review this version.There is a bug that causes the game to freeze every 40 turns but frequent saving at the start of your turns makes this a minor issue. Simply restart your game and you're set. With that addressed this steam version is worth your money if multi unit turn-based strategy is your thing. You can find items in dungeons, caves, and castle ruins and level your heroes. Upon leveling you can pick new talents making this game rather customizable. You can play up to 12 different racial leaders in an effort to conquer the map. Each race is uniquely different than the others. You simply recruit your army through the cities you capture and upgrade the cities for more capable units. Great fun with friends either pvp or coop. The computer players have several difficulty settings. I cannot begin to tell you how much time I've spent playing this game. It has a high level of replay value due to the number of maps available. And I forgot to tell you that you can MAKE your own maps. Also there are a few fan-based sites that are STILL making downloadable maps. After 15 years fans are still releasing maps for this game.Anyhow it's worth the five bucks. Also a caution: It can really suck you in and soak up your time. I catch myself saying 'just one more turn. Just one more battle. One more dungeon.' ... I said that an hour ago. Have Fun!			"

I haven't tried the keepers yet, but the cult of storms will chew you up and spit you out.Despite these things, the came keeps me coming back.  After every crash I reload and open up the last autosave and get right back to it.  The autosave is at the beginning of each turn, so you rarely lose that much progress.The gameplay is fun.  Each race is unique in their playstyles.  The artwork is very attractive.

												I have a friend that lives about 2,000 miles away and every time we visit, we spend nearly a day playing this game.  Part of that is nostalgia, but part of it is that it's still so incredibly enjoyable all these years later.  Age of Wonders 3 is a fitting and more modern update, but it's still worth coming back to the original.Pro Tip:  Skip the tactical combat if it's not for you, the game doesn't require it to be enjoyable.

												Well, ok, Heroes III is da best TBS, yeah I know but I do not agree and if you lost interest in my review you should not continue reading this. ;)Well, Age of Wonders was not a big hit back in the days in Hungary. Most guys already played HoMM II or III, so they were kinda occupied. I was not as I was a fresh gamer myself with my first PC. In addition I loved fantasy, read a lot of books and had fun discovering LotR. And one day I got a demo of this game with a magazine. In the demo there was only 2 maps: First Conflict and the tutorial. I was playing this game of hours, over and over again. Playing the same map with the 4 different factions again, and again. Saying to myself: look, orcs, halflings, elves...just in LotR, and the magic happened! :)When I finally got the full version I did not stop playing this game for months. Imagine a fantasy TBS game with 12 different factions, some are friends, some are not, some just does no care about the others, while others are keeping the possibilities to change sides, if.... Each of these factions had at least 8-10 unique units to unlock and to play with in a beautiful fantasy environment. The whole story is so fascinating that I would still buy if someone would have the time to write a book from it. The music there was not recorded by a big orchestra but it is so pulling you in to the world of AoW that you loose reality and suddenly you fight for Julia on Keepers side, or for Meandor on the side of the Cult of Storm...Clearly an exciting story telling, beautiful fantasy world, lots of factions and units and one of the best TBS experience ever made. One of my favourite games of all time...:)			"

												I already wrote a ton of recommendations but I guess they don't count SO HERE IS ANOTHER. Age of Wonders is an awesome, older-school turn based strategy game, thick Might and Magic style. Bunches of races, bunches of schools of magic, tons of units, storylines, items, etc. Classic and damn solid. Also sweet music.			"

												Well, to be honest I love this game from a very long time. It's old but it does never became outdated. And there is a great community (search in the web and you shall find it quite easily) that makes a lot of good maps. Well I suggest you to start from this one, and if you like the genre and the gameplay go play the other 2 sequels: AoW2 and AoW Shadow Magic. I still don't have played AoWIII so I won't say anithing about it, but for the videos it seems quite cool.			"

												Easily one of my favorites and still addicted after 10+ years! This game is challenging and rewarding. Also the editor is the best part. I will say that for some reason it has interruptions that kill the game relatively often but I'm still trying to figure out if it is something with my computer or what.			"

												Still a fun game after all these years. I like all the different race and spell combinations. While it might not be as well balanced as some of its successors, it was still a lot of fun playing the lizardmen who can walk on water and flooding most the map. I also like having your main hero in the action more instead of sitting in a tower like in AoW2.			"

												An old game, you'd think. Boring, simple. You'd be wrong. Age of Wonders is a true strategy classic, with strong RPG elements. Any fan of strategy gaming and/or classic Tolkienian fantasy would be well pleased with this game.			"

												When I first started to play this game, I felt little bored, but after getting really into it, I can feel it's addictevness. You can spend hours and hours on this, campaign feels pretty hard and you really have to think about your every move and remember to save often ;) Graphics are old, and gameplay a bit dated, I rather take the automatic combats than the tactics, as I feel that you have advantage on the automatic. But solid startegy game a little bit same manner as HOMM games, but I like the heroes games better.			"

												This is easily the best TBS of its era, pioneering many of the concepts we now take for granted. It holds up pretty well for a game its age, but as others have mentioned you do need to modify the .exe with a hex editor to make it stable on modern computers.			"

												This is one of the first games I've ever played (along with Age of Empires II, Jedi Knight, Diablo II, and the Heroes of Might and Magic series), so this game has a great deal of nostalgic value for me.That being said, Age of Wonders is still one of the best games I've ever played, and definately one of my absolute favorites. It truly offers a unique experience that's unseen in other fantasy/strategy games. I'd highly recommend it to anyone.			"

												Once you get past the graphics (the games over ten years old) Its a really good turn based stratergy with a lot of diversity from the different races and though the A.I. is a bit iffy (again its over ten years old) its really entertaining to play against friends.			"

												My original game CD was broken, so I bought the Steam AoW Trilogy version. But what a shame that the game isn't offered by Steam as multiligual version, especially if the original IS/WAS multilingual! Apart from that it's a good old fantasy strategy game, which I’ve played for 100+ hours.			"

												A classic that won my heart years ago. While not as indepth and lacking the production quality of current Sid Meir games, Age of Wonders has awesome races, great artwork, well designed (and race specific) sprite-art units, and a unrivaled strategic battle component that will have you coming back for me.

												I'm going to go ahead and get this out of the way.  It crashes.  Like.  A lot.  If anyone has discovered how to keep it from crashing on a Windows 8.1 computer, then please private message me.It has a learning curve that I could hang myself from.  I haven't tried the keepers yet, but the cult of storms will chew you up and spit you out.Despite these things, the came keeps me coming back.  After every crash I reload and open up the last autosave and get right back to it.  The autosave is at the beginning of each turn, so you rarely lose that much progress.The gameplay is fun.  Each race is unique in their playstyles.  The artwork is very attractive.  Its over all, a masterfull game that holds together very well.8/10+ Gorgeous+ Fun+ Very replayable- Can be rough at first- Annoying Crashes- Online support for the first game is difficult to find			"
