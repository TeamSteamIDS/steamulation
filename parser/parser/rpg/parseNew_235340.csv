												Half way decent MOBA.  Too bad this company is being run by incompitent thieves.   Do NOT, and I repeat, do NOT invest any of your money in this game.  Period.  Don't give them a single cent.  I played for a couple of months, spent some money so I could buy some in game items and whatnot.  Then my account gets corrupted.  I report it, and they tell me to create a new account so they can compensate the new account and remove the old one.I do this and respond with the information for the new account.  They then tell me that they won't fix it this way, and that I'll have to wait for the next patch to see if the next patch fixes my account instead.  Beause apparently they just wanted to not have to do their jobs.  Wait a week for new patch, it fixes nothing.  I tell them it's fixed nothing, and demand that they now actually do their jobs and fix my account.  They tell me that they'll fix the account, but I'm being rude to them (I told them that the needed to fix my problem rather than waiting to see if someone would do their job for them) and then threatened to ban me and closed the ticket.  I open a NEW ticket because my account still hasn't been compensated.  Explain what happened.  Account banned.I'm currently investigating what legal action may be taken against the company, but it seems that with the small amount of moneey I've spent it wouldn't be worth all the time and effort that it would take to try to get the money back, and court costs are out.  So you want my advice?  Don't do business with this company and don't play this game.			"

												I really wanted to like this game -- the characters are fascinating, and it does have good gameplay.  But this is one of the most cynical MOBAs out there.  Take League of Legends, and cross it with some of the more obnoxious Facebook games.  Energy mechanics to play specific characters (although you can spend in-game cash to reset them), Farmville mechanics to gather resources necessary to get boosts.  Rather than League's runes, masteries, and normal 'Q/W/E/R' levelling, you set up 36 possible levels in their own Rune system -- but those runes have Gacha style randomness, different levels of rarity / effectiveness, and you can combine runes together to level them up to level 5.  These set up the level up bonuses that you get in match -- and their strength also contributes to the normal level up bonuses you get.At all steps you're given incentives to pay money -- money can get you double XP towards your characters to increase their stats in a small way, double your rune drops, turn off the green (common, and incredibly weak) drops entirely, and many other things.  While this game is ostensibly free to play...it's incredibly pay to win, as well.  A person who spends money can buy some legendary runes to start off with that are a good headstart, buy the ability to pick up runes more easily, and buy the ability to get their resources faster to level things up.The gameplay is fun...but I can't continue to play it with just how horrible the metagame is.  Add to this the fact that the game is mostly popular in Russia and other Asian countries, with no regional servers--so you will almost always be matched with 3 or 4 players that do not speak your language, and it's just not for me anymore.

												Positives:-The support that I've received has been very helpful. -The town / economy building section is pretty neat-Earning exp and gold (same thing) in game to spend on abilities or pots/truesight/scrolls is interesting, being rewarded with more ""exp"" for last hitting is neat.-Multiple game modes, including the standard 3 lane 5v5, a pve mode, and others that are rotated on a clock schedule-It can be a refreshing game change if you need a break from other more demanding mobas, like Dota or even League_____________________________________________Neutral:-Bought heroes. I have the opinion that, like LoL and every other game that does this, if you limit core mechanics with currency then it can never be a truly competitive game. Does LoL have competitions and is extremely popular and makes a lot of money? Yes, but McDonalds is extremely popular and makes a lot of money, but I wouldn't call that food.If you want something to be truly competitive and legitimate on a general playerbase level, you can't limit core mechanics to anyone.However, it adds incentive to grind and play, and some people prefer that.-Very simple. It may not seem that way at first with the flood of new information, but once you learn the Talent groups and get the gist of things it's a very simple game. Last hitting or being near creep deaths earns resource which you use to buy your abilities and stats, which levels you up._____________________________________________Negatives:-Matchmaking. As a newish player, though a moba veteran, I find myself going against people with max level heroes and full rare or epic talent sets, and even some unique ones, when I myself have new heroes with no bonus stats and standard or uncommon talents. This is akin to a level 1 League player with no runes or masteries fighting level 30 players. It doesn't matter your skill level, or even if you're better than they are, there's just a very heavy disadvantage stat wise from the start. This makes carrying any allies very hard, especially if they feed. Normally you would be able to overcome that, but not with the stat advantage in addition.-Language barrier. Over my hours on this game, I've run into one other person who wasn't a friend that spoke or understood English. This could be overcome by a translational chat wheel, or other similar device. One type of ping is not enough to communicate, especially when they're often spammed. As a side note, after playing this game you will actually be thankful for ""that one guy"" on your team in Dota or League who you thought was bad.I'm going to give this game more time and chances. At the very least, it's nice to go to when I don't want to exert myself on more complex mobas.Until they fix the matchmaking however, I can't recommend this game.			"

												Prime world is a dying game which does not address the matchmaking (which is broken) and the players that play on the Keeper side will sandbag every match in order to win. They enter with overleveled characters and stomp the competition with 4 and 5 man premade teams. If you are going to download this game, wait until they fix it first.EDIT:this game is ONLY good if you play it for as many hours as i did, if you play, play on the overpowered characters (listed by their brokenness Blademaster/Sesha, Witch/Moira, Nox/Vryl, Haka/Daka, Firefox, Cryo, or Jaegar/wolfmaster) because if you don't you'll get stomped and left in the dust. there are some of these heroes just mentioned that are raking in the resources because they are so easy to play, (i played my blademaster with crappy stuff on him and retired him when he was level 12 because i was so bored, seriously, he's immortal after level 13). I still wouldn't recommend this game because the heroes are so underbalanced and there is a definate lack of initiative on balancing the characters. Until the characters are balanced, my recommendation stands, don't play it if you are NEW.TLDR: don't play it if you're new, you'll get stomped.			"

YouTube™ Video: Prime World Review 

			Views: 1,266		

			Prime World Review that should have been done when steam version came out, but oh well better now than never. This game is something that i spent reasonable amount of time when it came out from...		

Game that had PotentialI have played Prime World since its infancy on west - the game offers lot of customization through talent system which is great this is probablies the best part of the game and worst part of the game same time, why? Because it makes you grind so much for good talents and you have to get them for all characters your about to play, this leads to huge player level caps in que system.When you have very big difference is in skill cap terms of talents, you need bigger pool of players for the game, because otherwise you end up playing very unbalanced matches all the time = this is what the game is now.Also i have to say that the graphics are decent, but not best par with current MOBA competition, there is little to no customization when it comes to graphical setings, no anti-alias and colorblind modes are present. Castle building can be fun for while, it is certainly thing to hate or love, it lets you actually do something while you in que for the game which is super nice. I have to say hero designs are really bland and they make hardly any effort to be unique or very interesting to play (Invoker, Mina, Lee Sin and Orianna).I think the game had potential, but i think talent system limits balanced matches, games high skin prices are also to be taken consideration when choosing a moba as well. I have to give it thumbs down, since you can't give neutral between thumbs up :/			"

												At this point this game is just a ""LoL dota 2"" clone and it's done bad the whole Castle building is just a cash grab. You would think they would try something diffent like more of PvE nope. Just sick of the que time's the lopsided matchmaking and the A-holes. The most fun I have playing this game is the 5v5 bots battle but I get noting for it, I get that they don't want people farming the bots for drop's so way not just a PvE leveling and drops that can't be used in PvP. I really wanted to like this game and I have bought 50$ worth of gold to help my self and Nival. Having something like this would be different then LoL and dota2 and set them a part from the big two.I really just want this game to do well, and have fun playing it. But it is going down the  path of Rise of Immortals Battle for Graxia. A game that was on steam and failed and so will this one. "

												This is a good game.  That being said, it lacks server stability.  The matching sucks.  For instance they will put one player with legendary gear in a group with all rare gear.  That is like putting one level 30 champion in Legue of Legends with all level 15 champions.  So if the enemy team has one player with a red name and your team has none you just lost the game.  I was fighting one earlier that just stood in place for about 15 sec. while i hit it with every thing I had and when I finally took his health bar down one notch he hit me 3 times and I was dead.  I will keep playing it sometimes in hopes they will fix that but I would not recommend it to anyone who can't accept that when you see that red name in the load screen you are about to waste 10 min. until you can surrender.  Also if you only speak enlish you will not be able to chat with your team and the pings are very limitted the game will only allow you to ping a couple times with a very easily missed sound.  OK maybe I will talk about some of the many other flaws in another reveiw but this one has become quite long winded.  The pay to win aspect is starting to get really bad.  The new heros are becoming more and more over powered.  I don't think it can get any worse and still countinue.			"

												One day I was tired of Dota and decided to play this.. thing. It is a horrible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ son of Dota, LoL and Farmville. It could work out, if the developers decided to make something good and playable and interesting. Who would like to have his own castle? But developers weren't interested in making a game - they want to make cash, as much and as soon as possible. So, you either spend months to get needed items, to build your castle, to buy new heroes, to get needed items... or you can spend a buck or two (or few hundreds). The game always reminds you of thiss possibility. ""looks like you are building a house to store your items.. spend some cash and you won't have to wait 5 hours to finish it"".			"

												Was a fun game until everything in North America showed up in Russian after april 2nd. Can't tell if its an improvement or indication that the servers gave up trying to find a player base of anyone other then Russians.Company seems confused,  Play Dota or League, or Infinite crisis , Heck Heroes of the Storm. Just dont expect much with this game. They took half of everyones buildings away, gave everyone and Empty castle, and the most recent champion was Mr Freeze.

												The game itself is awesome and fun. Especially the castle buildup. But it's made by Russian developers. Do I need to say more? They have somehow the tendency to ruin games in a weird way. In this case it's greed (pay a lot of money for the best heroes) and a neglect for players/servers not Russian. Playing is a pain as most players are Russian. They seem to be the biggest cowards (always quit), worst players (always do the most stupid things) and rude (just glad I don't speak Russian). Try it, but I might suggest you better go and play League of Legends.			"

												   This game tried to be too much, and fails at just about everything it sets out to do. The Action diablo-esque segments are awful, Go on way too long, are repetitive and boring. The storyline is laughable and pointless. Voice acting in this game is just some of the worst I've ever heard in my life. Facebook games and MOBAs were kept seperate all this time for a reason, also.   Go figure the one thing they did okay at was the MOBA part. It's clunky and kind of outdated, but a lot of the abilities and concepts are really unique. The land control aspect is really neat, The spells do different things depending on what type of land you're on, and there's a male and female version of every class, with specific gender interactions for each skill! This all sounds good on paper, but its a mess.  Having to pay to turn a hero from one gender to another, then making gender a mechanic for certain spells was a completely dumb move.    I did, however, have fun with the ""scroll maker"" in base. You basically play a little puzzle game on varying difficulties, and if you win you get a scroll that you can give to one of your allies on the battlefield. The scrolls do all manner of things from blinding enemies, doing aoe damage, healing, etc. This was a really wierd yet fun concept that I enjoyed. I wouldn't mind seeing this in other games in the future. Its kind of like this games version of jungling.			"

												At a first glance this game is a moba yet doesnt meet my standerds for quality or enjoyment. If you have played dota this game is basicly a farmvill version of dota with out the charm or skill caps of it nor are the sides unique they are just reskined to look diferent but function the same. To sum up what i said above this game is highly unrewarding and lacks any form of strategy as you pick your character before you even get match maked and pvp doesnt feel interesting but rather locked or rails along with questionable mechanics that make little to no sence.

												This game takes the fun of a MOBA and weighs it down with the tedium of a facebook game. Building up your base takes real time, unless you want to spend to build faster. Heroes lose stamina as you use them, and take time to regain it, again, unless you want to spend money to expedite it. Anyone who doesn't dump money into this trainwreck will take weeks to do what a paying player can do in a day.Beyond the obvious cash grab monetization set up, the gameplay itself is terrible. Balance is horrendous, and matchmaking is so broken it's baffling. No items and character growth could have been interesting, but instead it just makes it so that the team that pulls ahead first steamrolls all game. Avoid this game like the plague.			"

Posted: October 5, 2014
												A foreword about me: I played a lot of DotA back when it was called DotA 3.3 as a WarCraft 3 non-expansion custom map. I played succeeding versions up to 3.7, Danite's Hell, and those that supported game modes such as -aram. I've also been a progression and hardmore raider in WoW and SWTOR. I play League of Legends casually.Now about Prime World:This is a MOBA but it's not just a MOBA.It has the grind of an MMO that both casual and hardcore players can enjoy.Casuals might like the city-building and city-management aspects of the game. You build buildings and order them to produce wood, ore, food, silver, crystals, or gold (cash shop currency). These resources can be used to buy heroes (like LoL champions), buy hero skins, buy talents, upgrade buildings, upgrade talents, send heroes on quests at the tavern, or rest heroes at the inn (heroes need to rest after a match or quest).Casuals might also like the Zuma-type game in the actual MOBA part of the game. On the 5v5 map, you can have 3 laners, 1 jungler, and 1 playing Zuma, which helps your team maximize everybody's XP gain. When playing Zuma, a successful game rewards you with a one-time consumable scroll that you can send to anyone on your team, including yourself. The spell on the scroll, and the strength of the spell, is something you select before each Zuma game. For instance, you could start the 5v5 match and play Zuma to create a level 1 healing scroll for your jungler, or a level 5 AoE damage scroll for an early lane push.Finally, for casuals, there is also a PvE map, ranging from easy, medium, hard, to very hard difficulty. And by PvE, I don't mean a ""vs AI"" game, where you're still in an arena but fighting bot players. This map involves protecting a central location from waves of enemies. There are also side quests throughout the ""match"", such as escorting an NPC down a lane or defeating all of a specific type of enemy on the map. Hardcore players can enjoy the endgame, because there is quite a grind when you want to pwn with the best in the world. Your city can produce talents, but you are also rewarded talents when you play and especially when you win. Talent rarity is similar to WoW's, where some are junk and others are legendary, going from yellow, green, blue, purple, to orange. Each talent also has five ranks each, and you can, using WoW terms, disenchant all your junk talents in order to enchant your purples and oranges.Endgame players can also enjoy the theorycrafting that comes with the flexibility of talent and stat builds. Using LoL terms, some heroes can be built for AD or AP (like LoL's Ezreal or Tristana), and some benefit from both (Akali). Most talents give you passive stat upgrades (+7 agility or +2.2 health regeneration), but others give you a usable skill (temporary invulnerability or immobilize enemy or self heal). I have only three complaints about Prime World.1) Matchmaking can sometimes fail you horribly (or benefit you immensely), matching up lesser geared/experienced teams against epicced out players. Mind you, bad matchmaking does not always guarantee a loss for the underdog.2) Disconnects are an issue. On a good day, all my games go smoothly and everybody has good games. On a bad day, half my games turn into 5v4 or 5v3.3) My biggest complaint is that all players globally play on the same server, and most are Russian, which leads to ZERO communication. The best you can do is to know the game, know every class, have good map awareness, and hope that your team is as good as you are.Bottom line: I love this game now. I would say it's more casual than LoL, where people rage on you for being new and not executing your skillshots or timing your CCs perfectly. But then again, maybe they do rage here in Prime World and I just can't understand the Cyrillic alphabet. :)			"

												900+ hours in this game - I obviously know the game inside and out so here we go in a nutshell. The most powerful aspect of the game is the talent system. It lets you customize the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your character. This is pretty sweet considering you can make an assasin more tanky or design any character from the ground up and truly customize how they play. Theres a ton of talents u get over the course of many games. You loot them as you go win/loose. Game cues are usually around 3-7 minutes. Aside from the amazing talent feature the game has been completely ruined over time by other issues. I dumped lots of money into this game and got trapped playing it. At first it wasnt so bad with the shop, but then they just caved and its 100% pay to win. Oh did i mention the english speaking players are about 10% in every game? They shut down the US servers and went full Russian. Aside from a few occasional russian fonts in the menu they forget to translate sometimes i still played. Hell i even played with these russians. Its always great when u cant understand your team... But then things got even worse. Players for some reason just quit. They rage quit, they quit for no reason, they idle, they vote surrender as soon as they can, they afk, u name it. You cant kick them. I cant believe after all these years they havnt added a system to drop the player and replace with someone else but they havnt. You get stuck with lots of players in your rank that dont know how to play mixed with afk or rage quitters. Honestly its just loaded with idiots now. This leads to an endless loop of winning 1 loosing 3 on average. Ive tried every tactic. Use my totally pimped out characters to help carry the team but the team has 1 DC and 1 AFK and they wanna quit. Its just useless to play with pickup groups. If you are in a guild of friends this game could be good since you will bypass the russian playerbase and could have a premade group but its only a matter of time before you feel the effects of ""pay to win"" and rage quitters. Its plauged with em. After 900+ hours i finaly pulled the plug. I lost hundreds on this game and although i obviously had some fun along the way, they killed it and its no longer worth playing. I since moved on to Heroes of the Storm to get my MOBA fix and uninstalled this game after playing it since launch.. #fail #imoverit			"

												*sigh* oh boy, where do i start ?first of all you can add another 1000 hours on top of the current time since i quit the steam version rather soon due to a patch switching the language and being unable to change it ever againits a russian game, from a russian company with 99,9% russian playerssome had more problems due to this than others, but thats simply how it isit always suffered from bad coding, bad ping, bugs, lags, bad servers etcbut it didnt bother me as much as otherstho it got on my nerves eventuallyduring 2014 and early 2015 at its pinnacle the EN community was small but tight knit and we had a great time on the forums and in game during its timethis game was good fun back then and had lots of customization but thats all the pastit always was somehow p2w and required lots of grindingbut at least it was fun and my time played reflects thatnow that has changed,with a single patch they destroyed their own game and in effect alot of their russian playerbase left as well as the majority of EN as wellso what happened ? each hero can be customized with 28 talents that act has items/gearthose talents droped from battles but could also be crafted for a crystal currency available for either real money or ingame activitythey had various rarities increasing in power with each stopblue->purple->orangewith orange being the most powerful, all of them scaling with levelsto give a comparison at the start of a game a full blue has similar power to a full orangeat max level 36 (30+ minutes in the game) the blue stands absolutely no chance against the orangeyes, it was hard grinding all those talents, and it costed a quite bit gearing up to 40 of the available heroes all with decent talentsso what happended with the patch was... they added a new talent rarity on top of it-> redswith tremendous power gains, when equipednullifing most of the achievend gains from the past yearsalso dont forget, its not a MMO where you play a single hero and maybe an altyou need to gear up dozends of heroes, if you want to play themnow those reds costed literally a fortune, about 10 times as much as the orange talentsand if you wanted to grind them ingame with daily quests, the time investment was absurd,prime world would turn into nothing less but a full time job from now on, every day of the weeki gave it a chance, and after a month playing casual, i was able to gather a single random red talent xDout of maybe a dozend specific needed for a single hero and then x40 for each of themthat was in late 2015 and i quit immediatelly not looking back since thenTLDR;so the verdict can only be NOT RECOMMENDED in its current form, and most likely never againit was somewhat enjoyable 2 years ago, even with all the techincal/personal problems but now thats completely impossibleinsane grind and absolute p2w			"

												Pretty standard MOBA like League of Legends but with the twist of abilities being drops from matches.  I really like the ability system as it gives each match a loot feel to it, as you never know what you might get.  There is a bit of a pay to win aspect to the game as you can buy easier heroes to play with using money but even the cheapest hero can be overcome with a good team.  The game is based in Russia I think as the VAST majority of players tend to be Russian which make communication with pickup groups nearly impossible but if you have some friends you can group with defintely recommend it.

												I don't usually write review but I do you know the game is HORRIFIC! First of all this game's matchmaking time is so long theres a  farmvill clone to keep you distracted while you wait for the worst games of your life! Secondly theres a mini-game in one of the maps and its pretty much a maching colours mini game. The sad thing is this generic colour game is SO more fun than the game it self. Furthermore the matchmaking is so and unfair the game is completely broken. This is also a pay to win game because it is technically impossible to buy high end heros to play with unless you can play this sorry exuese of a game for months. I played this game before and i decided to give it another try. When I got into a match no one was speaking english EVERYONE and I MEAN EVERYONE SPOKE RUSSIAN. It is honestly a pain in the rear end to communicate with teamates. I really wonder why this game still exists and many game that are actually worth playing either dead and/or gone from existance.

												Russian game, should I say more?If yes than I have to say first of all that I am not a damn racist, nazi or some kind of guy who feels superior to others just because of the state I was born in, however, the reasons this game is terrible are following:1. Stupid russians and ukrainians that are struggling even with their own bloody language (I am not even going to speak about English language, as they know only few words and all of them are the most unimaginative and boring curses I've ever read).2. Stupid representatives of other nations (mostly turkish players and they act as if they play in totally different game).3. Constant lags and the main reason of lags (surprise-surprise) is YOU. Well it is so, because as I've understood from the developers logic: 'We've made everything perfect, all technical problems is purely your personal fault', 'cause how dare you to live somewhere in Europe or America (still, my russian and ukrainian friends faced the same issues sometimes, so probably it is tolerant to all nations once in a while).4. It could be really great and interesting game with unique approach towards gameplay, but developers slaughtered it because of their greediness.			"

												Graphics - 7/10 - Average - I did not participate in Beta just because of the Graphics, it deter'ed me from playing.Gameplay - 9/10* - Spectacular~! Note*: However, the game is based off of having good talents which if you come a bit late or party with higher ranked people - It's extremely difficult, sometimes impossible to win. Against your own however, it's damn fun.Community - 6/10 - The community is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but if I was comparing to other MOBA's it'd be average 7/8.Customization - 9/10 - Just play and you'll understand, I'd give this a 10/10 but you can't really customize your Character Looks, nor does ""Castle Customization"" have anything to do ingame neither (Like a Strategy Game set-up prior to MOBA).Replayability 8.5/10 - The game's different characters/classes vary so much that everytime it's something different, each person brings a different build to the table, forever changing, and forever being different. However, it is still a MOBA, you just play it over and over.			"

So the baze problem in this game is that iff you want to play PW u have to f** learn russ, because the admin will do nothing fore the simple reason low number off players so u have to stuck up whit no comunication with players that only know birth native language, the rest is good is developing well.

												This game had a lot of potential as a game that combined the genres of MOBA/ARTS and city-building. I had thought Nival was interested in the Prime World universe and creating an experience across genres, especially when I heard about the Tower Defense game. However, the two games are separate.Ultimately, the city-building aspect never reached a point beyond a simple, boring Farmville-type knockoff that took the place of the usual ""daily rewards"" system that underwhelming games use these days to coax players to log back in and hopefully score a gold purchase from a player that might otherwise never bothered to log back in.The deck system also had a lot of potential, but instead it serves as another vector to drain gold from a player. To be competitive you need rare talents and you need these rare talents to be leveled up. There aren't restrictions on the level of talents you have equipped, but they do increase your characters' rating which may affect match-making. The match-making however, leaves something to desire.For English-speaking players it should be noted that a long time ago Nival took down the western servers, so if you solo-queue you will often be matched into a game of 9 Russian-speaking players.It's an alternative to League of Legends, I guess.

												Introduction:It's a fun game. It's another MOBA-type of game, similar to famous games like DotA2, LoL and HoN.It has a very unique system, where your passive skills are equipable instead of simply having it. Ingame, you buy your skills with your money, instead of items to boost your stats.Also you have a ""town-like"" system, where you can build buildings and get points, which in the end are usable to upgrade and/or get new skills.The character selection is rather small and characters can only be unlocked by leveling your account or with real life money.Story0/0:Gameplay 4/10:Character-balancing is not handled well, some characters and animations are far too good, while others are terrible. And if you play against someone who has better passives, you probably won't win, because he will at some point outstat you. Also, you can play a ""mini-game"" to gain experience/money and give free special items to your team members, which is kind of nice. But sadly, even though that the town-system and equipable skills-system are definitly something new, they overall can't fix a broken game.Graphics 3/10:It's not really good looking, the map looks lifeless and the character-models all look dull and straight out of something between a PS1 and PS2 game.Conclusion:It's not a good game, the cons are overpowering the pros. If you want to mess around with friends or something like that, it's fun. But if you want to play it seriously, go and play some other MOBA.Total Rating:3,5/10			"

												Prime World suffers from a few major problems.1: It is free to play with mechanics that strongly benefit paying customers.2: It is a MOBA. Yes this is a problem. MOBAs aren't inherently bad games but they are made so by the horrid userbase that plays them. People are far too competetive and simply joining random games with the intent of having fun seems rare/impossible most of the time. The game is targetted at hardcore gamers so if you aren't a hardcore MOBA gamer stay away.3: Progression feels too grindy. Games like this, which rely on players being put on fairly equal footing, stick in leveling+progression almost arbitrarily. Sure your heroes get stronger but you're only ever put onto the playing field with others in your general tier of power, which makes progression much less about empowering your character and more about pigeon-holing you against stronger opponents (the more you play the more competetive+less fun the game becomes).Basically stay away from this game if you're not a hardcore MOBA player. It is just not fun for casual play.			"

												Such a waste.Really great game that is absolutely ruined by the worst matchmaking system ever devised. It's already dying due to a matchmaking system that's never been addressed even though the mechanics of customisation and power ratios mean there is  already an easy fix that was just never implemented.It allows top tier purple talent teams to stack against fresh new white/green players. This is regardless of any skill ratio beforehand where it should just tell them 'no match available, reduce power'.The game has great customisation, great art and unique champions and playmodes. All sadly marred and not worth praising properly due to the glaring matchmaking problem. Coupled with the fact the playmodes are on a rotating basis rather than player choice means you may not even be able to queue for your favourite (or fairest) mode.			"

												The fact that you cannot play a game without queuing with all English speaking players to have more then one other English speaking person on your team is stupid. There is not even an option to change your prefrence to English speaking players. The lack of communication from this language barrier makes this game nigh on unplayable. There is also the issue of the all of the expensive heroes being clearly stronger and never getting nerfed compared to the weaker, cheaper heroes that most players will have. This allows players that put money into the game to have a clear advantage.Another advantage that players who put money into the game have it TALENTS. Talents are a great idea, and i think they could have made it work, if not for the fact that you can almost directly get some of the best talents from SPENDING MONEY. This added onto the fact that the most expensive champions (that you can buy with money before the level you are supposed to be able to) means that those who put money into the game have a Huge Advantage over those who don't,			"

												A moba game with its roots coming from Russia.The game consists of various unique features which are for example : + 2 Factions that war against eachother, you have to pick 1 faction to join, based on which faction you choose there are 2 unique heroes to play. + The ""lobby"" in this game is your castle, you are a castle lord and you can construct buildings that produce ressources and forge talents for your heroes to use + Previous mentioned talents are the ""items"" (more of less) of the heroes you play, you can equip a total of 36 talents on 1 Hero and every learned talent represents 1 Lvl. + Most heroes can be played differently based on your preference, for example the hero ""Mage / Sorcerer"" can be played either INT to increase Fire Flail damage on impact and Demon Summon passive AoE damage, or you can build him STR to increase Demon Summon ATK dmg, Transformation DoT and Energy Barrier DoT. + Different game modes depending on the time of the day, Dragonwald, 3v3, Native Terrain and more.One huge negative aspect though:HUGE language barrier because the communtiy consists 97% of russian players.There was an english server once but it wasn't popular enough and merged with the russian one.For some people it's a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to play because of the language barrier but as I mostly only play with friends it's not that bad.Also, typical for a moba, this game will probably make you rage about how stupid some people can be, but that's a given!

												they tried to go with the moba feels like league has... but it ended up being all rubbish. I like the fact that I get my own castle and to build it all up, not to mention leveling up heroes and getting custom items to them. however when they release a new character... that's where it gets all bad.... either the guy they introduced is to OVER POWERED or just broken. I remember this scorpion guy who could place eggs on the ground. when you killed him he would come out a new from his egg which was far behind the tower.Well beside this... the game have a reason for you to go afk... in the base there is a board thing which plays like ZUMBA oh damn oh damn it's fun, but if you play ''Zumba'' for to long... your team will rage. the only good reason to play ''Zumba'' is to get these scrolls which you can choose what they will give to which of your allies. I normally give it to the guy who is doing the best.Oh yeah I forgot there is some questing where you play PVE to level up and gear up..... at times your allies will be very stupid.... unless you are premade 5 people which makes it a ton easyer.Enough said... Do I recommend this game even for all it's broken and OP stuff.... Yes it's an diffrent experince and it's quite fun when you start to win and get powerful yourself.

The forum moderators are a real piece of work as well, they will go in and delete valid threads, or edit them into something completely unrelated.  Nival doesn't listen to the player base.

Prime World - An outstanding MOBAHey guys,I've been playing Prime World for 2 months now or in other words ~500 hours of playing time. As I played League of Legends and DotA2 before I was wondering what another MOBA might bring to the table to make me stick with it.But I can tell you: There were things that did.First of all a short overview:+ Several unique Heros all with their own playstyle+ Different game modes+ Talent-System+ Nice graphics+ Castle-System+ Easy to learn+ Mostly polite and nice gamers around there- Low playerbase -> therfor sometimes real terrible matchmaking- Talent-System (yes it's also negative sometimes, more on that later)As you might know Prime World is another MOBA title. But there are two things that are making this one really unique. The Talent-System and the Castle-System.For the Castle-System: It is nothing spectacular and reminds me of some tycoon style games on facebook. You have your buildings to get some additional Income or Talents. Productions take from 30 Minutes up to 23 hours. But it's fun to organize and manage your castle during your Queue Times.The Talent-System is what makes the game unique to play. There is no exp or gold in the matches, only prime. With Prime you can unlock the heros talents which you organize and plan in the castle before even going to the battlefield. This offers you some tactical decision making aswell as the opportunity to play heros in really different ways. Also you can determinate if you want to specialize on something with your hero or be more like an allrounder.After every match you get some talents. Some of those are more common, some of those are really rare and therfor more powerful.For me it is really fun to play many matches and it's awesome to finally get a much desired Talent after many games. But I guess it can also be really frustrating, especially as the quality of your heros talents also determinates the power of your hero ingame. So if you're exactly on the same skill level like your opponent and even playing the same hero, but he is epic talented and you are only common you will lose. So it takes some time to get heros strong. If you like this talent farming, like me, it's awesome for sure, but if you just want a smooth start in the game without any disadvantages at start you should probably play DotA2 instead.What the game mostly suffers from is its low playerbase. The matchmaking really sucks often because there are just not enough players to make it work.Also when you start playing the game you get Tutorial Quests. One of them is winning 10 pvp games. You have a own Queue for people having this quest pending which would be nice if there just were some more of them. This way new players face terrible queue times (1h+) and most likely quit before even giving the game the chance it deserves for sure. You can get around this by looking for people in the world chat who already finished this quest and ask them to group with you. But this way you get much higher opponents which might not only be frustrating, but also tends to make reaching 10 wins a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥Still I like this MOBA most of all those out there, as it is more about teamwork and tactical decision making than individual skill, like in League or DotA. Hopefully it will at some point get the love it deserves and the playerbase to run smooth. There is so much potential and it is definitely worth a try!			"

												Prime World is a free to play PVP MOBA that is simillar but different to League of Legends.  It worked, looked good, sounded ok, played ok, was understandable.  The rules and gameplay is a bit different than other MOBAs. Has RPG, base building and minigame elements added.  Looked laggy on my computer with all the busy animations.

												I just finished watching the trailer for Prime World on Steam. I am only going to make this one and only comment because anything more will sound like a rant. Neverwinter Nights 1(the very first game) looks better then this piece of junk. NWN came out in 2002 on PC so the graphics really old and if they look better than a free to play game of 2013, the programmers have a serious problem.			"

												Pretty unique aspect to the moba genre. The queue times are long at the moment and sometimes you get paired up with the most unbalanced teams but i think that is a lack of community so if people start joining it the faults will disappear. pretty easy to understand after a few games but then again that is coming from a moba background so try it your self.

												it is an alright game, a bit on farming for talents. Unfortunately the builds you cannot alter during game. Some people says extra ""talents"" per stage are used as alternatives (you use 4/6 talents per stage generally speaking), but i feel that you are so locked in during a game, minor changes don't really change a build.Most of the time i see the teams are extremely lobsided (too low player base probably). Outranking and out talented the other team. Your character names changes based on how strong of talents you get. yellow<green<blue<purple. Think of it this way, if both person at equally skilled, a lvl 28 yellow character is roughly the same stats as a lvl 18 purple character[estimating]. (max lvl is 36). so If your team is all purples and enemies are all yellows, the yellows can barely do anything against team purple (unless team purple is stupid). Early game is defined by player skills (like roughly up to lvl 13 iish). After that the amount of stronger talents your team have vs enemy team usually dictate the game after about lvl 24.Can't choose your characters after game finds match. Meaning I've been stuck with a game with 2 supports 3 tanks. Not my favorite situations. Granted we couldn't die at all until late game, we didn't have enough pushing power. Enemies just kept split pushing easy and we had no way to stop.Last hitting is made to be a child's game, you hit a minion, if it dies within the next 1-2 seconds, the money goes to you. (like i hit a minion right before turret hits it, even if i don't kill with that hit, i get full money from killing the minion)Last bit is voice acting, some of them are really really annoying to listen to. Good thing you can turn off voices though.Good part is the zuma they put into the game, it is alternative way of getting money. (money = levels in this game). There are many modes of this game, i personally like appocolypse where you kill minion and they turn into a zombie for your team.Overall i think this game is not bad, but don't get too irratated when match making is bad (sometimes it runs for like 8 min, keep in mind the longer the queue time, the more lobsided teams are usually, i generally requeue at 2 min) Farming for talent is surprisingly addicting.

												ok, let me give you guys a bit more up to date review and one coming from a guy that plays often and more than few hours ;)the game is a decent moba with few twists to keep things interesting. it follows standard moba strategies, so if you can do well somewhere else u can do well here. there are few peculiarities about heroes, but each one has its own thing/combo and once u understand the mechanics, you will do very well. game keeps being updated often and matchmaking/balance is quite fine. yes, there are ppl that have no clue what to do, but keep playing/learning your heroes and soon you will be able to carry. a lot complain how hard it is to get talents etc. true, but you dont need that that much. you can get a perfectly fins build with purples and still pawn ppl if you understand mechanics. i play few matches to get my daylies and find myself progressing fantasticly well. chill, learn, enjoy :)good luck!

												Honestly this game is a city builder from facebook merged with a MoBA. The problem with that is I don't want to have to upgrade my town hall so I can do this and that and the other around my home just to get another hero. Not only that but there's the bizarre minigame that one can play for a reward that isn't even that great. The heroes between the factions are identical but with different art directions, and almost every hero feels the exact same. It's pretty, it tried to take a step in a unique direction for Mobas, but unfortunately for me it just fell short.			"

												The game-trailer is claiming that the game is all about building you castle and competing against other players castle, but is really more of a DOTA-game with a nice looking farmville-esque progression tree.

												Prime World fails to follow through on many of its innovative ideas. From boring castle-building to unrewarding single-player and a typical map, there isn’t much reason to choose it over any other free-to-play MOBA.With all the additional features that expand Prime World beyond traditional genre definitions, the game lacks the heart and focus needed to keep you invested in each match.Naturally you will find great value for the cost of nothing with Prime World. It’s also a fairly small download, so there’s no real reason why you shouldn’t try the game if you’re a fan of the MOBA genre.However compared to famous names like League of Legends and Dota2 this game is rather dull and mediocre.Overall 6/10.

And in order to progress in this game is by winning so you understand how hard it is to achieve.Developers need to think over how to bring the people back, and until then, I will be sad I cannot play any furthur a game I enjoyed.

												Very fun game! Currently it lacks a large community, but it is still in 'Open Beta'.The game has one big flaw in my opinion: The Matchmaking System. It can sometimes matchup a low ranked team with a high ranked team. They've announced that they'll fix the issue in the next update.Heroes are fairly balanced, however some rare talent combinations make some heroes much stronger than others.I would still call the game balanced, because nothing beats good teamwork.The game has good support, and is updated regularly. Everything (except custom skins) can be unlocked through playing, however there is an option to buy heroes with real money.The castle element to the game is interesting at first, but by the time you're level 25ish, it's basically a waiting screen for your next match. There is a lot of customization for heroes, and the game is very straightforward and easy to learn.			"

												Well at a very brave elobarate attempt to mimic DoTa and League of Legends, sadly possibly one of the worst attempts ive ever seen. The only concept of these style games it got right was the lane/minion concept. frankly the gameplay is just something as sluggish as what i would expect from playing a 16 bit console,Visually quite decent, good effort into effects and artwork, sadly the limited control an click functionality ruined any level of playability. Having reached Diamond Elo on League of Legends this concept game is no stranger to me so was actually quite excited to try this. However these developers need to go back to the drawing board as this is quite frankly several years away being even close to ready for public consumption.Visuals: 7/10Themeatics/Concept: 6/10Originality : 5/10Gameplay : 1/10Lastability : If you make it past the initial ""tutorial"" your doing good, sadly I expect 90% of players will play their first legit matchup against players and go ummm yeah recycle bin for you.

												An unusual MOBA akin to the older WC3 Dota maps. Instead of making linear 6 item builds, the game utilizes a 'Talent' tree, each rank from 1-7 offering 5 appropriate level 'skills'. These 'skills' can be actives, such as actual abilities, or passive boosts, such as regen, chance to hit effects, strength boosts, etc. These skills can be switched out outside of the game for ones you're awarded from games, or craft. They come with raritiest ranging from yellow, to legendary oranges.The game mixes a combination of MOBA, rts, and 'MMORPG' elements, sometimes a little inneffectioally. Regardless, its a fun game, and the leveling is loose like Heroes of the Storm, with the ability to craft your own custom hero, essentially, with the classes being more a 'guide' than hard core choice.Perhaps not as competitive as other MOBAs, one to be enjoyed by more casual or grind-enjoying enthusiasts. The one downside is the lack of NA population, resulting in quite alot of matches with Russians.			"

												The game has a lot of good ideas, very unique. I personally had lots of fun early on, but then I got to the point where the complete inbalance kicked in. As it is in it's current state, the great unique ideas they have need to be tuned or matchmaking needs to be fixed. Right now you will be a new player and get matched against someone a lot higher character level giving them a huge stat advantage which in turn allows them to easily dominate their match. Match making doesnt work well becuase every player levels up each of their champions individually. So if I was matched with high level people because I had a single champion like level 25, I couldn't play any other of my champions because my stats would be no where high enough to allow me a chance to win. This game right now is find a single champion and play nothing but that one or you become gimped and wont win matches.			"

												First I thought this was a random MOBA type game, but it's not. Besides the usual regular map similar to other games, it brings several other modes, including an Outpost mode where you battle 3x3 on a one lane area, a native land arena, where your abilities are stronger depending on how much land your team owns, a dragon 4x4 fight where you battle mobs towards the middle, fight the dragon then get to fight the other team and a zombie arena where your enemies are turned to zombies allied with you when they die. As a major difference from regular MOBAs, the hero does not need to buy artifacts inside the fighting game, but they get time to arrange their talents before the battle in their town. After each battle you win some talents and you can progress your heroes using these talents creating an unique hero. The player can add abilities to their hero with these talents and alter the stats to their desire. Of course for newer players some suggested stats that a hero usually uses are highlighted so the player can have an idea of what talents they could try.Besides this hero fighting game, the game offers a base building mechanic. I shall admit that this isn't extremely polished and could use some work, but the idea is a good one. The base acts as a home for the heroes, where you can produce talents and train your heroes. The drawbacks of the game are the lower population playing it and the matchmaking sytem, which, because of lower population, sometimes ends putting players with huge differences of skill in opposite teams. Overall, the game is fun to play.Edit: I have found a major turn-off. Heroes are not well balanced against eachother. Some heroes are too strong from start. And because of the skewed matchmaking system, you may end up being matched with people who have both good heroes and some of the best artifacts, which will mean that you'll start losing the game from the start and it progresses it will only become easier for the enemies.

Ive played HON, LoL, and a few lesser mobas and let me tell you this one has my attition. You have the regular battle grounds and somthing kind of like LoL where you get items to upgrade the stats and skills on your charactors. But with that you also have a ""base"" to build to help you further your self and gain more. The game is beautiful even on my old rig on LOW graphics. I still have lots to discover about this game and will keep playing. We need more USA players i think thats the only downfall that i can see so far. Give it a shot!			"

												I love this game, and hate it, but mostly love it. I love it because there is so much progression, you are leveling up stuff all the time. You have a castle and a Lord(you) that you level up, buildings in the castle you level, you have champs that you level up, and you level up their gear(called talents), and you can make/join a clan, and level that up. Gameplay is fun, and you have plenty PvE to do. You can do challenge maps for gear, and various bot games. So why hate it at all? PvP. You must understand that it is not balanced, and that doesn't mean it's bad. Right now the game is set to match you up based on your performance, based on wins. However, gear and character level play a huge role in balance. Gear is divided into levels, like World of Warcraft and other games, based on color and stats. Yellow gear, Green, Blue, Purple, Orange, and each piece has different active or passive abilities or stat increases, as well as the ability to boost your overall stats. Your character has a power rating based on gear score, so you may be in all yellow and green gear with a 1200 power score, and have to fight someone in rare and epic gear whose character level may also be higher, and sometimes, your entire team will be lower level and outgeared, even though your ranking may be similar. Each character level lets you put a couple skill points into your character, so you may face the same champ in lane as you, similarly geared, but if the level difference going in is significant, you are weaker. Skill can overcome that, but skill can't overcome both significant level and gear differences. Factor in that you will often have quitters and afkers, and at the moment no way to report them, and you could easily find yourself wanting to punch a hole in the wall.But if you know that is the way it is, and don't expect that just cause you are better skilled but may still lose...a lot, then you will have fun, imo.

												I love this game.  Unlike LoL, you do not start out with all of your ""rewards"" for level up.  So at level one you are at the same playing field as other level 1s.  If you can get the upper hand as a team, then it does not matter that your opposition has better talents.  I just wish we could trade talents amoungst other players as some players keep getting 4 or 5 of the same drop and its the last one you need and it just is not dropping.  At the same time it gives you that ohhhhhh shinny what did I win factor at the end of each match that you won.  You also get to play ""sim castle"" to help you out.  You can build up some of your towns houses in order to research and get more talents.  they give you several options on how to get better gear.  The tutorial is very RPG that gets you into the story.  Another thing about the game that is better than LoL is that you can collect plenty of silver rather fast so that you can purchse the higher level chrs.  LoL you have to grind allllllllllll month long sometime just to get enough to purchase the toon. I also like that fact that it is talent based.  Not going back to the store to buy your items based.  You can level up right out in the field. There are two factions and each faction DOES have a few characters that is only avalible for that particualr faction.  I would sugget going to the website first and learning what they are before choosing.  Other wise it will cost real money to switch factions.  If you can get into the community base, then they are helpful and nice.  You will get the jerks like all games,  But.. I love how this game plays out... and yes sometimes the queue can get rather long but I use it to read up on stratigies and really read what each talent does so that I know what talents I should stack in order to get the best output.

												Downloaded this over the weekend and can't seem to put it down. Much more involved than your usual MOBA like LOL or DOTA. I love the extra features like building your own skills through the ones you earn. The more you use a champion the stronger it becomes. I love the castle building outside of the game itself. I love that they have other game modes outside of the 5V5 classic 3 lane fight. I really enjoy the PVE quest things you can do. I love the more RPG esque map where its 4V4 and you need to build up your champ's then take the middle dragon down. My only gripes are, MORE PEOPLE NEED TO PLAY THIS GAME! I doesnt take that long for a match and I like how it will just load me up once its ready so I don't have to be worried about missing it but if more people played it would be much quicker. Its new so I am not to worried. The other thing is balancing and matching. Sometimes it feels skill levels are mismatched but this might also stem from my first gripe. It has a great system for your personal exp and your champion exp, once there are more players I can see this really taking off once more people from NA start to give it a try.			"

												My review is about who have more than 1300 hrs played (me), so i really know about what i'm talking.I like this game, but i stay playing it because its very addictive and i can solve 1 of the principal problem (Pay-to-Win) using my money to put heros strong and winning lane easy because 2 reason: 1) My heros are stronger than others, i paid to win / 2) People are not skilled in this game, with 320 ms ping i can beat players with 20 ms ping easily.List about problems what need to be solved from developers to do this game something equal to all players:- Have too much bugs and Overpowered heroes (who can kill you in like 1 hit or heroes too powerful on lane phase who can make other heros go to base all game and being underfarmed) and some half-useless heroes too;- Have a lot of problems to reconnect: If you lose your Internet Connection for 3 minutes and try to back to the game, you can't;- 30% of the players are abble to Trolling the game and they can do it because the fail actual raiting system (per hero). Developers can fix it doing changes on Raiting System, making it on Unique Raiting (per player), like in Dota 2, but they don't want to improve their game and the penalty to trolls are like inexistent and if people want to avoid trolls receive 5 minutes on penalty;- Barrier language (95% are Russian/Ukranian players), and have no integrated translator to help about full communication;- The Talent's upgrading system is PAY TO WIN;- You need to pay about anything you want to change (Ex.: Unassing talent to put on another heros);- If you want to get Good talents, prepare to PAY!;- This game have server only in Europe (Netherlands), and he's not Supported to use WTF Fast Private Network, and the developers don't do anything about it... WTF Fast can fix the LAG problems on this game, but it is not available to players;Then, if proplerly changed, this game can be nice.Atm, the best moba is Dota 2.PS.: This game need Private Network (WTFast) to change the problem about lags and need to be reworked to be like Dota2, in Dota we pay only to get Cosmectics, not to do interferences on gameplay (on Prime World 1 player who spend money have better talents or upgraded talents while other doesn't have it). To be strong on decent mobas, you need to farm creeps/jungle or kill heros/going assistences, not using money!That's my tip.			"

												I'm recommending this game only because it's free and everyone should give it a try. The graphics are average for today. The tutorial could use a little more clarification. The minigames are not appealing to me, while I know they are to many others.  I did not play long because it is not appealing to me overall. Judge for yourself if you can handle the download time (which isn't bad compared to some out there).			"

												I really have no idea what exactly to write about this one. You get dropped off in the world with absolutely no idea what to do. There are some flashing icons so you start clicking on them. The ones on the left of the screen are what act as your guide - took some clicking around to figure this one out. Once I did, it wasn't that hard to figure out until I got to the battle portion. What a freaking mess that was. Not only did I have no idea what to do, I also didn't know how to play my character. I'm thinking the makers expect everyone to have ESP and know exactly what to do. I definitely would not recommend anyone download and play this game.			"

												Let me start by stating the main reason for not recommending is simply because I don't like games that require me to check in on a daily basis nor require me to wait constantly for a timer. I also especially don't care for the Play to Win games. That being said...The GoodGraphically the Prime World is pleasant, if cartoon like, which I'm sure is part of the appeal to the fans of PW.The mechanics are much like most other strategy war games similar to the phone apps out there where you build up your city with buildings for resources, troop production, research and defenses. I've listed this as a Good point because it makes it familiar.The BadWait, wait, wait, wait, wait... You get the point.The Extremely UglyPay to Win "

												Went 16/3 KDA. Enemy was 4/4. Enemy now has so much armor and regen that he can literally stand in all my aoe and two turrets while still healing. He can dance or autoattack turrets and destroy them because he is healing faster than all the damage combined. This is not one game. This is every game. In the US it takes us about 8 minutes to queue for a match. Unless you speak russian there will be no chance for you to communicate with your team. the matches take about 20 minutes. If the designers of this company offered me $50 to reinstall this game and play it for another day, I would punch them in the face for designing such a crap game and steal their $50 and spend it all on ANY other game.

												This game would be good, if there was not soooo many flaws. Example, I click download game, stupid outside game window pops up (I am not a fan of those) I start downloading updates, then the window closes itself. I re-open and start to download again, and would'nt ya know it happens again. Bad first impression. Like if the game does not want you to play it, then take it as a sign, is what I say. But nope I did not listen to my instinct and kept trying. So I finally get the♥♥♥♥♥♥downloaded and open game, but it appears as if nothing happens. Then I realize that it is running, but did not have the god damn common courtesy to open for me, nice. So I click and the taskbar icon and it pops up. But the game does not bring me to any kind of main menu or any crazy thing like that, it throws me straight into a tutorial bot match, ok. So I start trying to fimiliarize myself with the controls and the game, wait left click is to move.....WHY? I start clicking around to move and my hero just stands there, then a minute and a half later he starts moving all around the place randomly. Like near where I click but then backwards and fowards and all over the place nowhere near where I clicked. Ok so he has a mind of his own cool. I know it's not my internet connection, cus I never, ever lag and I have fiber optic wiring and also I am in a friggin bot match so should not matter. Only thing left is my Fps is not good, some turtle symbol pops up and says lower graphics setting, ok ......wait there is no way to use options during a match? WOW! SERIOUSLY? So I close game, restart, find graphics setting in my beloved out of game window, lower to minimum, enter back into game, and still dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ My PC is not great, but I can play DayZ on minimum, and other games work perfectly.  So it's in fact the game that sux and not my PC or connection.♥♥♥♥♥♥THIS GAME!!!! Uninstall worked fine, most functional part of the game. GG			"

												THE MOST UNBALANCED GAME! You need just play one game(maybe two if you have good luck) so you can feel how it is when your team from 5 players diyng against 2 players enemy team. Ofcourse if you have to many bags with cash you can donate and normal play.......1 maybe 2 mounts before you reaching normal rating. Then all you can it`s find team ( what impossible in this game) or delete game. It`s all options what you have. Atleast you like pain,suffering,peopele who automatically hates you  and who wil be ruin you game jus beacuse they dont like you, your flag,country or language( yes in this game too many racists even in postal 2 less racists).This is the reason why you no need to play in it and why so many bad reviews.

												If you like faction fighting ( only 2 factions in Prime World ) and you know some people who play, then this free game is for you.  But friends or acquaintances are mandatory for Castle developement ( a fun side project if you're into that thing ). Without other players at your level, you are doomed to very few fighting actions, and it is both boring and frustrating as all get out.I guess the open border fight is the only Robot combat possibility, so I have been beating my brain to score a win against Robots (the only type of fight a solo Noble can play).  This means I am trying to understand and combine the Heroes' Talents by hit or miss.  There are mini-manuals to explain some of this complication in warfare, but I still cannot figure out how to call up the help document while playing.  So my stats as a player are lousy, but there are several gaming forums, and player-created groups, which means I am just slow connecting with people.  Once I know some in my faction...  I think this game qualifies as a good one but with a steep learning curve.  That means hitting player manuals and game-maker documents will complete your beginning training,  Those who hate to read will be at a diadvantage.I like the graphics, fighting/magic system, the potential of this dynamic game.  Prime World.  Try it,  You'll like or hate it, but you'll know! And I call it fun enough to learn the combat system.			"

												Interesting. There are so many things in one game. However, I think Prime World Thrones tries to be too many things at once and doesn't integrate it together. I believe they just found a whole bunch of concepts from click-farming, MOBA, MMORPG and city building and just mashed it all up into PW:T. It's horrible.PROS1. Fun StuffThere are mini-games that resembe Zuma, a bubble popping game that has you shooting bubbles to makes combine 3 of a colour on a snake-like trail.2. Defense maps / ChallengesHordes of monsters just keep pouring on and you have got to kill them all.3. Easy unlocking of heroesThere are quests you can do in the other mini-games that unlock the heroes. As long as you reach level 36 and have enough silver, you should be able to get all the heroes. However, locking the core mechanic of the game away from players is mostly stupidity on the developer's end.CONS1. Doesn't gelAll the mini-games do not gel. How could you have a Zuma game in the middle of a MOBA battle just to produce a scroll? That will mean 1 afk player aiming to build a specific scroll.2. Pay-to-WinYou actually have to rest your hero so that you can use him. His Vigour needs to be restored at a Spa. Not only that, they make you buy things called Talents to upgrade your hero with gold (cash currency). Talents are special skills that you get in-game when you level up during MOBA combat, a wrong combination will make you very weak or very strong.3. City BuilderThis begun to get pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ once I started seeing a need to click-farm and build a city. You have to play multiple games in that don't make sense. You build a city to produce housing, food, silver, thread, Prime and a spa. What are they trying to do with this?4. Hero UpgradingThere are Mastery points, which are stat points, and Talents that severely imbalance a game. If you play the game till max level and you get enough Master points, your hero's stats will be far superior to another player's. If you get super rare and powerful Talents that you equip on your hero, you will also be imbalanced.5. Hero ListsMirror Image. The same heroes for the Imperium are in Adornia, just with different skins.			"

												nothing short of garbage thrown together, it's worse about attempting to get people to pay money than any other moba I've seen. If you are to get anything from prime world, I sincerely recommend the game Prime World: DEFENDER, it's a tower defense game that won't force you to pay money to get good items and has a nice spin on tower defense with upgrading towers and magic cards outside of the levels. so this, the moba, no buy buy, the tower defense yes buy buy			"

												So, I've played this game for a while 300 hours or so, and I must say, after getting my first Hero to level 15, this game is not a bad game at all. I took my sweet time playing a few different classes and variety's settling to see Which Hero I would take on the endeavor. The Healer caught my eye instantly and allowed me to roam maps, learn the different settings placings and ranges for most of the different Heroes that I've been put up against. Plus it's awesome running around the map with the clearest head not worrying about having to score kills, but tank some tower shots and heal everyone else. This helps when i transition to play another Hero as well, I for one love the Master Splinter skin in this game, but there's a good variety at the beginning allowing you to choose from a basic set that's cheaply available, however A good portion of Hero's are going to take some grinding and some smart resource investing to attain. If there's one thing I HAVE to mention is to TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GOLDEN AGE, I'm not sure how many people quiet understand this when they first begin their adventure in Prime World, however I do hope that whenever A player sees this active on their profile, they should immediatly play a couple more games than usual, just for the sake of nabbing a wholesale amount of Talents per game, plus it gives extra to your mates as well. I'm probably going to start a Guild when I get enough Silver So when that happens Give a holler and we'll play together.			"

												Ignore the guys that say it's pay to win - they weren't able to invest the time into it necessary to upgrade with in-game points, and even the basic heroes can do really well.  I was maxing out the guy riding the hoverboard and going toe-to-toe with the guys who unlocked other heroes with cash.  Just because you can purchase a hero, doesn't automatically make you boss, in this game specifically - you can unlock new heroes with money but you still have to learn how to play them effectively and you cannot buy runes or ability unlocks with cash.  I really really enjoyed this one.  If your a fan of League of Legends, but your looking for something out of the box that has RTS and facebook farmville type gameplay then you'll love this one.			"

Получившей награду в Вашингтоне с пометкой  ""за незаурядную работу по инвестированию в технологический сектор российской экономики"" . Хозяин данной благодетельной компании - простой выпускник Московского университета, который почему-то неожиданно включён в 2000 году в первый в истории  Форума  список «пионеров в области технологий». Тот самый  Форум  не просто клуб задpотов, а ""Всемирный экономический форуме в Давосе"" - да-да, вы не ослышались, тот самый. Помимо этого, самый обыкновенный парень, является одним из спонсоров и стратегических консультантов B612 Foundation (частный некомерческий фонд США).После всего этого не удивляйтесь, что игра стала аппаратом, с помощью которого нацики, с татуировками на лбу (но уже не со свастиками, а со звёздами давида и пейсами), доят вас как скотов - ничего не соображающих гоев. И всё это надоенное бабло, переводится в национальный банк Израиля и в военный фонд США.И пока вы бараны, добровольно продолжаете носить свои деньги этим тварям. Они на каждый Шабат ставят свечи в менору и пьют за здоровье тупого русского народа, который обеспечил им безбедную старость и процветание той самой национальности.-----------------Game Developer - Russian racially-correct company ""Nival"", which just received a tranche of $ 6 million from Almaz Capital Partners company.

The same  Forum  is not just a club nerds, and ""The World Economic Forum in Davos"" - yes, you heard right, the same. In addition, a very ordinary man, is one of the sponsors and strategic consultants B612 Foundation (a private US Non-Profit Foundation).After all this, do not be surprised that the game has become a device by which the Nazis tattooed on the forehead (but not with swastikas but with stars of David and sidelocks), you milked like cattle - nothing to think the goyim. And all this stolen loot, transferred to the National Bank of Israel and in the US military fund.And while you sheep go voluntarily wearing their money these bаstаrds.

												A curious combination of Farmville and DotA.It tries to take casual Facebook game elements and sticks them to a MOBA metagame for leveling up your heroes and gaining hold of more. It is advertised as an MMO game, but it is entirely match based. It is at best as much an MMO as IRC. (There is a global player chat room for arranging matches and clans).There seem to be many large balance issues with the different champions.Try it if you're looking for a time sink with pretty pixels and a few curious game mechanics.It's not bad per se. However, if you're looking for an objectively great game, keep looking.			"

												Altough I am still fairly new to this game, I feel like I can say that it is: #1 Fun#2 UniqueIf you are looking for something with a change of pace that is different then the ususal games, it offers several interesting, dynamc features such as having a ""city"" as your post game lobby where you manage a castle to gain resources to collect, ultimately, scrolls. Scrolls are talents that you use to enhance your hero very similarily to how you get runes in League of Legends. There requirements to have good scrolls is a little steeper then needing good runes, but if you put the time in you'l enjoy it. It definately isn't a game to play if you're looking for the next blockbuster, but if you want something that is unique and a bit fun, give it a try. There's no loss because it is F2P.			"

												Clunky, unbalanced and no player base.This slow and unfair game features pay to win and overpowered heroes. The gameplay itself is very simple and tries to hard to be a MOBA, when what your really playing is an RPG that lasts 20 minutes. With assists being pointless, the game places emphasis on stealing kills and farming your allies for levels. It doesnt help you have basically no hero selection unless you expect to play many hours or pay out of your wallet.And since no one plays this, and the match times are 6+ minutes each, have fun wasting all your time inside the lobby staring at your custom castle which you also need to either spend more real money on or waste even more time making it look decent.Just stay away from this russian attempt to copy giants like Dota 2 or League of Legends.I played two games and decided that was enough of this game.Personal Rating: 1/5			"

												Hello Primeworld, i love you.But after the merge and official start.The community for worldwide players died.... horrible...Why you ask?Cause except for premades of 5 (which gets to que against 1 or 2 Rank higher Enemys).Your Stuck with playing an all Russian Random Game.Dont get me wrong i am not a racist.But gosh... 90% of these Russians neither can talk in english nor even play the basic conecpt of a moba game.And 5% are just trolling you cause your ""emarican"" to them.... i know cause i translated alot of the chats afterwards..As long as they dont maken an option ""dont want to play with russians in a team, but gladly fight against them"", like they had done before the last merge for a time... I will stay away from it.The old Que was about 1min to 15 Min Wait time. For a fun matchs.Now its 20 seconds to 2 Mins... for a ""Full Random"" 1 man Que match, thats unplayable most times. And needs you to be the extrem carry...Dont even think about newbie que... People seem so stupid there.. that it hurts...Lost my trusth in humanintys strengths.. while i checked out how russians do in the newbie que compared to old worldwide que..THEY are far worse then the Worldwide Que... And these were already mindnumbing bad begginers... who never seemed to have played an moba before.. And that behavior is what you get till rank 1800+ now.. where in the odl system having a rank 1400+ made you play decent matches atleast..I would wait till they fix the game... or atleast only go in it when you got 3~4 Friends wanting to play with you.

												It's just your standard MOBA, but badly done.  It has a couple of unique modes, however none are groundbreaking whereas they haven't been seen elsewhere.  The talent building is decent and allows you to customize a character.  The castle mode is a joke; it's literally a waste and the game would be so much better without it.  Lastly, the matchmaking in the game is a complete joke.  If you think LoL was bad, the MM in this game makes it look flawless.  It's common to find yourself a ""newbie team"" vs. a team of hysterically higher power levels.It leaves little to wonder why the game has less than 1k players.			"

												This game is terrible. It starts out with a tutorial where, the first thing you will notice is that you have a sluggish character. For this period of time, you spend the time with a lightning character using abilities ripped and mismatched from all the other MOBAs you can think of. During this game, you are given the opportunity to play a game like Bust a Move and Centipede combined for 2 minutes to get a scroll that may or may not help your team. This may be the most enjoyable part of this game, which is not saying much because the rest feels like a chore to play. I can only assume that in a live game, during the time spent playing the minigame that resembles fun, your team would be upset, but I can't tell because the online matchmaking seems to be broken.After you finish your slow crawl to beating the bots, you get put into a kingdom which puts all the fin of the mobile games that try to get you to pay money to accelerate things into the middle of your MOBA. During this time, you need to do things like level up your kingdom so you can buy heroes using the same currency that you also use to have the privilege of continuing to have your current heroes at full power. You can also set your buildings to create materials that are used solely to make more buildings which create more materials, sometimes skills, and heal your heroes. You have missions at this point, but, again, good luck getting matchmaking to work.This game is terrible. Don't play it, if you want to play MOBAs on steam, DOTA2 is free and has the mobile game section removed. The Bust a Move minigame is also gone, but I'm sure you can find that somewhere online if you really want that game. In short, play DOTA, League, Dawngate, Strife, Smite, Heroes of Newerth, whatever you want, just do not bother with this game.			"

												i love the battles and the teamwork that is required and i play it every day I recommend that you only use it with a steam account though.  The game used through Nival's official site/server freezes up and you get dropped from battles. The account i have through steam does not do that "

												I really liked this game, I liked how you had a lot of choice in characters and play-styles, that you for once didn't have to pay to enjoy the game fully. It should've worked, really. If only they did something about the matchmaking. You wait your fair turn to match up with equally leveled players, only to end up in a team of ... that are eons ahead of you level- and gearwise, who doesn't seem to have spent any spare time outside their computer rooms in weeks cause they are just ""hardcore to the core"". And they always put people down. I play for fun and to spend time with the hubby who loves gaming. I hate seeing other people abused and I can't really take it when I'm on the receiving end either. I often speak up, which is my own fault I suppose. I tossed in the towel at several occations, I tried to inactivate the chat window by having it scrolled all the way up, but that did nothing for the team playing aspect ;-). Finally I abandoned the game, it wasn't worth it. It's a shame when the users are the one thing that ruins a game. I know they struggle with the balance of fast ques vs. equal matchmaking but the problem seemed to get worse rather than better. They also tried to get the community involved with setting up codes of conduct which was a valiant attempt at approaching the issue of abuse. If they'd have block feature, I'd probably still be playing.			"

												Mechanically very interesting, but very quirky. The inability to counterbuild is rather upsetting, as a massive hunk of strategy is hewn from the game, and some mechanics seem arbitrarily complex, but it plays with interesting concepts. The idea of having a minor castle-sim game active as a resource generator to improve your Heroes is particularly welcome, as it allows for slow progression through idle action, should players not be able to or not have the inclination to play a full round.All in all, B+ game. Flawed, but shows promise and a genuine desire to experiment with the MOBA genre as opposed to just being a ""Dota clone"" like some other games (CoughHoNCough).			"

												An interesting game for sure, not only that you have two different games in one, but you can also get wrecked by level 1 player who thought he wants to sponsor the game and hired a hero for level 70 or higher (for real money of course). If you put that fact aside, it begins to get interesting - the game throws at you its two parts. Your castle (a base from which you manage battles, quests, building commands,...) and the battlefield itself, which changes depending on what mode you want to play - a pvp? Co-op? Pvp co-op? The game has it all. AND if its not difficult enough for you, you can alwys raise up the difficulty on the co-ops. The more you play each hero, the better it gets. Ability system is absolutely different from any other moba - you collect items which work as your hero´s abilities - sure some heroes are limited to some abilities, but by destroying other items you can upgrade the one you chose (making it VERY effective by the time you get to know what to do with it, and mainly when to activate it)11/10, would DotA again.

												The game is fun, except for the part where it stops being fun after the first match. Hero customization is cute, match making is horrible, everyone is a smurf and if anything cheap has been done early on the whole match falls apart. The game lacks in some seriously needed buffing and nerfing in different sections. You'll find yourself logging in solely to grab resources from your ""Farmville"" like castle only to log out and log back in the next day so you can collect again. Ignore this game, it's one of those turds fresh out of Russia.			"

												As many reviewers have stated previously, the balancing in this game does need to be adjusted. Also, the pacing is clearly geared towards those that pay for additional help in game. I can already see that the pace is slowing down the longer you play and advance. But for a freemium title it isn't all that bad and is good for killing a few minutes when you're bored.			"

												Interesing Meta Game in this is that you have a Farmville like engine for upgrading your ""Castle""... this has effects on your gme characters as it produces the resources needed to get your characters new skills and abilities called ""tallents"".The game is free, and even if you don't have enough time to play... logging in once every day to upgrade your village can produce over time a far more powerful character than you might get with equivalent time invested in actual gameplay. (It just takes a lot of elapsed time)So do get this game even if you have no time to play it right now. As long you plan to eventually, downloading early to set up your Farmville Castle will pay off with long term benefits.			"

												The game itself is a well developed and throughly thought out game. It has amazing attention to detail and great game idea's that have been thought out well. However the lack of players and the lag (which is why there is lack of players) have ruined all future hope for this game in my eyes. One member of the game was waiting for a battle to start for over 1hour... I myself waited for 10mins before calling it quits. Its a shame though it could have been amazing			"

												This game I would describe as: MOV for casual gamers. Nice graphics, a couple of interesting ideas, simple gameplay. If you are a guru pillboxes - you have nothing to do here. The game is perfect for those who want to play without too much straining at your pleasure. This does not mean that there can play carelessly, but it is not as high level as a pillbox or other LoL'y and HoN'y. UPD. The farther into the forest, the more wood. Alas, but the project makes no headway (in spite of the new modes) because the most important and key points are not addressed. Awful curve MM (aka balancer) and the dubious quality of the servers (there are frequent departures of players, logs), make the game less comfortable than it could and should have been. And yes, even though we think that direct Donat gameplay has no effect - it is only at first glance, is an illusion. Without the Golden Age (premium subscription), rely on the collection of high-quality talent is not necessary, drop rate is negligibly low. But even with a premium subscription, random loot is terrible: some talents do not fall months. In such circumstances, it is insulting to see a few players with sharpened at 5 talami and superior power. After all, as the developers did not deny the obvious fact, all the monetization of the game is built around power and Rola it, because it is their talent and quality, the most direct and immediate influence on the combat effectiveness of the hero. Something. how well you take advantage of these opportunities - is another matter and discuss it makes no sense, because that finger to the sky. But at the same time, no matter how good you would not be, if you have nothing to counter the enemy - you lose. It's like the coolest racer in the world to put behind Lada and say ""you're a pro, udelali this sucker with a Ferrari ..."" It seems to me a very apt analogy and fully transmitting MAT the problem. In fact, we have some interesting solutions to the implementation of the curve.			"

												One of the best MOBA' game genre's thats actually ever made, it has its Pro's and Con's compared to other of the same type.Some of the Pro's.- The unique skill/talent system,- Very friendly users / players compared to games like LoL / HoN /Dota2- Great Community with help for new people both ingame and at the forums if you got questions- Several game modes including Borderlands(5v5), Outpost(3v3), Dragonwald(4v4), and some of the less played modes Switcharoo(5v5), Apoc mode(5v5), 3 differant challange modes (5vAI).- They actually do something about the reports you do (through webform reports).- Can't stress this enough as a advantage, its FREE.Some of the Con's.- Talents do matter later on in gameplay- Playerbase isnt as big as the more known games like LoL / Dota2 etc. så it can take some time to get a decent random group- Laggish server sometimes.- Mostly US based users so for the people in EU its harder to get some decent groups.- They havnt sorted a small bug problem with people using BOT's- Their report system needs to be updated- Better ways to inform players ingame about community events.theres some more, but heres a few Pro's and Con's to start out with, overall i would actually give it a 4/5 rating, it still needs some improvements, but yet still a game i would recommend to people that like the MOBA genre, give it a try, why wouldn't you its FREE.

												Ok so prime.. Compare to dota 2. Pretty much the same concept to the T. Except its more 3d and the graphics are oddly nice. but the cons to this game clearly out way the pros. Horrible long wait times to join a game. Not to mention if its you're first time playing it. Good luck finding out global chat box to right click on names to start a group or just click the battle button. Over all id say as of now not worth down loading. if the game did some construction in the right way with patches and better friend and game joining set ups. because of now its kind of like the game just loads with crap tons of content with no direction. its pretty much just click on everything and figure it out your self. the game has great potential but falls short of greatness. GET IT TOGETHER!, : ).			"

												От создателей Ночного дозора и Дневного дозора. Prime World - это Русская дота, только не так требовательна к золоту и навыкам игры. Есть возможность строить СВОИХ кузнецов и фермы. Всё это проделывается в главном меню игры, можно выполнять всякие квесты у замка,  а также  играть одному или с другом .Атмосфера у игры не такая депрессивная(серьёзная) как у родной доты, управление очень похоже на Дневной дозор.Имеется РУССКАЯ ОЗВУЧКА и ТЕКСТ. Озвучка очень классная, диалоги в стиле ""матушка Русь треся врагов наших"" и т.д .Можно пикать одинаковых персов, графика очень даже неплоха .Саппорты тут короли, игра даже восхваляет за помощь добивания врага или когда товарищ убивает врага.

												I did not like the game! The reason, the game requires too much infusion of cash! No donation you will spend a very, very long time just to get to the more or less adequate and decent set of players talent pool on which characters you want to play. Also, the game is not at all any balance, and if there is very weak.The game itself can be and interesting than that, but it's a drop in the sea! Too many flaws that do not who do not hurry to fix. should not list them because the game is free, everyone can come and try. But I would not advise to do it there are more worthy games in this genre, which is worth seeing.game on 3/10. "

												2 year old ""open beta"" with a three month long standing promise to fix unbalanced matchmaking.  Unbalanced classes abound and the game works numerous gimicks in order to extract money from its players, such as charging players $1 in real money in order to move a rare talent from one character to another.  In the end, either play Dota 2 or wait for Heart of the Storm.  This game is not worth your time, and definitely not your money.			"

												I really love this game, it's waaaay better than League. I mean along with dota style matches in PVP,  there is survival mode, and the fact you build a kingdom and follow a storyline. The survival mode you face off against hords of enemies. I have watched this game grow from the alpha and it makes me proud! Get this game, i highly recommend it! If you get it, contact me and we can become allies, play together, and rule the realm. "

												I installed it as it was a free to play game.The tutorial was not bad, one got explained the hero pretty good.But then one to the negativ points:- I tried 2 games, but they didnt respond in chat in an understandable language (i dont mean 1337)- the game design is similar to summoners rift, 3 roads a bit jungle in between, towers, - sadly few info about the ingame options, suddenly i find a minigame where you get a scroll- it seems like there are no items to be bought except some health potions or tp scrolls likefrom what i understood is that building the castle and the longer you are playing the stronger you can get=> this is no lets play a game and everyone has the same chances (for lol at least on lvl 30)=> the capture the flag + teleport design is interesting but didnt work multible times for meas it is free if you are not sure just give it a try, you are not loosing anything at most a bit of time			"

												So, I really used to love this game during the beta phase but now the DEVS just neglect the English/South American players. The matchmaking now is total crap, fast? yes only because its with JUST russians. No communicartion what so ever, the differences betweeen premium and normal accounts is outragesouly different and the system for obtaining better items is rediculously hard to do specially for new players. Originally I would reccommend thiss game to anyone an everyone but there isnt a chance in hell id do that now. Which is so sad beCuase while during beta you may have waited to find a match atleast 5-10min for english players it was totally worth it.			"

But oh dear god last days every evening some rounds of that game.Its interesting and really better than any other game in this genre. You can form your Heros and there is a wide range of possibillities!The balancing is good between all classes and the fights are interesting.Only negative is that there are really unfriendly people, sadly most time under russian flag.But on every other aspect I can really say: Play this Game before you judge it as a lame Copy. Its definetly not!			"

												Though I have spent a lot of time playing, its hard for me to recommend Prime world. My main problem is the match making. The server matches you with non english speaking people therefore making it really hard to comunicate. It's played best with real life friends, but If you happen to have none that play this game then it becomes a very hard game to get into. Mainly because of it Complexity.Calling this a MOBA feels short because of everthing that it brings to the table. Pick it up for yourself and experience the Prime World.?/10			"

												This is a poor attempt at trying to capitalize on the MOBA market and other FTP city builders such as Age of Empires Online. The design is garbage, gameplay is so broken and there has been little in terms of balancing. Not to mention, if you're playing in the US, you'll be getting very few US teammates (seems like to norm for any game on steam). The only fun you might have is if you get a full 5-man team. Avoid if you're looking for a new MOBA, personally reccomend Smite, DOTA 2 and League of Legends are both falling apart.			"

												It's another MOBA game like many more. But this one is different. It's a combination of a tycoon game and a MOBA game. This doesnt focusses that much on the heroes but more on the play styles. You can't but items in-game for bonus hp or some extra damage. You get points for last hitting and destroying a tower and all the other stuff. You can spend these points on potions for HP regen, energy(the mana of Prime World) regen, or some bonus move speed for a limited time. but also on skills. And every time you buy a skill with these points youll level up.Well I think I've said enough about the game. Lets look at the pros and cons.Pros:-It isn't pay-to-win-You can customize your skills-There are a lot of different skills-There's a lot of potentialCons:-It runs bad for it's graphics-It doesn't tell you when you got a game, you just go into the game-Not really anything more to do with your points then buying a skill-It's actually pretty bad, a lot of things are brokenI give this game a 4/10			"

												I do appreciate how different this game is compared to other MOBAs. I also really like how creative the developers were with the maps and different game modes.But the ability to farm talents up combined with how broken the match making system, pairing up lower powered players with over powered ones, talent wise, is really makes it not very fun. Additionally, the fact that you choose your champion before you go into match making makes a meta, or strategy nearly impossible. Finally, after trying to reinstall this to see if there had been any changes, it is literally unplayable.  "

												At first glance the game looks promising. A wide variety of talents to assign to your hero and with that a Flametail can be very different from another Flametail, they don't even have to look the same. Despite all the negative reviews I decided to download and give it a shot ... but will uninstall now. Base line is: If you are new to MOBA ... don't even try. If you don't want to spend a lot of money ... don't play THIS game. If you're not good in English (or Russian) ... don't try this one. If you are easily fed up and annoyed with your fellow players ... really, do everyone a favour and don't strain your nerves on this one, cause the matchmaking is useless and you will get fed up and angry.To make it more detailed: There is good stuff, don't get me wrong. I do like the many different heroes, the look of the game, the varieties of talents and I even like the castle and building it all, earning silver, silk and other ressources to improve your castle. I quite enjoyed the PvE aspect (yes, I know, it's a MOBA and not a single-player RPG or god knows what ^^) as it helps to get to know your hero and the way the game is played. However. Once you have the first PvP quests the fun is over. The matchmaking is indeed catastrophic. I never had to wait long, but honestly I'd prefer to wait some more rather than being matched up against a bunch of players that have high ranking heroes with great talents while I'm having a yellow, basic hero with mainly crappy talents. There is no kick- or vote-off-the-team-option for AFK players and there is a great deal of people who either tab out of the game and forget they entered the queue or who only need a win for a quest and decide to let the others do the work and let the programme run while they go do something else. So you are one or two men down already and matched up against an active 5-player-team with at least one monster hero on their side. Perfect recipe for fed up players and for rudeness. The verbal abuse this community is producing, cursing, shouting, screaming at the 'noobs' is seriously discouraging. Usually they are experienced players levelling up a lower character and having better talents than someone who just started and yes, they are fed up for good reason but it's not the noobs fault - and I'm including myself - that the matchmaking in the game is so bad. If it's your second or third match you make mistakes and you act stupid simply because you don't know any better. And the rudeness level goes from 0 to 100 within the first death in the own ranks no matter who died. Seen that many times, unfortunately. Of course you can enhance your chances and game experience a lot. You just need to spend enough money on gold to buy the best heroes and talents real money can buy. Of course a F2P game needs some sort of revenue to survive but this way the game is extremely unbalanced.There is also little in terms of introduction to the different styles of heroes and such. They have different strengths and weaknesses, but that's for you to figure out (or read up on. I'm sure there's a ton of guides) but if you're not someone who wants to read up for ages before even attempting to play, you're pretty much lost.Anyway, there's some good ideas behind this, but as it stands at the moment, I would not recommend it to anyone and I deleted the game now. Shame, really, but I play to have fun and not read people shouting and coursing at each other in the worst way ever (and the mature language filter is not helping, either).			"

												This is a poor attempt at trying to capitalize on the MOBA market and other FTP city builders such as Age of Empires Online. The design is garbage, gameplay is so broken and there has been little in terms of balancing. Not to mention, if you're playing in the US, you'll be getting very few US teammates (seems like to norm for any game on steam). The only fun you might have is if you get a full 5-man team. Avoid if you're looking for a new MOBA, personally reccomend Smite, DOTA 2 and League of Legends are both falling apart.			"

												Summary:At first glance, Prime World appears an ambitious MOBA that tries to take the genre to the next level.  While I don't think it necessary does that, if you're a fan of the genre, this game would be worth a look, at the very least... if the community wasn't trash.---------------Pros:Exp and currency are tied together into something called ""prime"".  You spend prime to level up, buy potions, buy scrolls, etc.The native terrain element rewards smart, tactical play with some nice bonuses.The zuma element is an interesting ""second jungle"" with team-wide benefits, adding additional laning and support possibilities in the early game.Starter heroes are completely viable against more expensive heroes, as long as you know how to use them.PvE ""Challenge"" maps allow for a more relaxed atmosphere to learn how a class works, before you jump into the fire.The cash shop is strictly a pay to advance faster system, as opposed to a pay to win system.  You don't need to spend a dime on the game to be considered good at the game.---------------Cons:The tutorial system assumes that you're capable of learning a lot of stuff on your own.  All it really teaches you to do is how to play the laning phase and how to ultimately win the match.Talent farming.  In a nutshell, the more you play, the more likely you are to get good talents, which are effectively where your power comes from.  The grind element can be a bit tedious early on, when you're still trying to gear up, leading to some matches where you're just going to be out-scaled no matter what you do.A horrible newbie matchmaking system causes long queues when trying to obtain your first ten wins, with leavers, bots, ragers, etc flooding that entire queue.  The devs have stated that the issue stems from a lack of people in that queue, and changes are coming to fix it.  In the meantime, it's still a horrible queue.  The game gets a lot better after those first ten wins, in which you'll escape that queue, but those first few matches do turn a lot of people away from the game.No counterbuilds on the fly.  What you load into your profile before the match is what you get, no matter how good or bad it is against the other team's composition.  Some pro players may not like this.The castle system.  I'm not a big fan of it.  The whole point of it appears to be to fuel your ability to obtain new heroes, obtain new talents, and help your heroes recover.  It seems like a restrictive system designed to make you want to drop some cash on the game.A horrible community that punishes people for ""doing it right"".  If you're not suicide rushing into a 2v4 situation to save a feeder, you're doing it wrong, according to this community.  And you're going to be seeing this happen.  Every.  Single.  Match.  No avoiding it.---------------Do I recommend this game?Not just no, but heck no.  If this small community comprehended proper MOBA mechanics, it's a nice niche game.  But it's just full of people who don't comprehend the genre, coupled with an incredibly small community, making for long wait times.  The game is decent, but the community just makes it unbearable.  Stay away if you value your sanity.			"

												Well... I really want to recommend it cause it might fix some of the issues with the game, but I cant. The game is great in theory, but it takes way way too long to get into a battle, and when you finally do get into a battle, there is nothing to keep people from just ditching if if goes badly. So since it takes so long, people just ditch at the first sign of trouble and queue up again. I like the concept, but it needs some serious adjustments if its going to become fun.			"

												This game is highly unorganised! There are not enough players, it can take up to 20 mintues to get into a match, and, if you dont do what you are told, everyone yells at you, harrasses you and tells you to quit. (P.s: if you report the players, there are no consequences to them!). Also, some characters (mostly thre more expensive ones), have a high advantage and usually always win!

You can form your Heros and there is a wide range of possibillities!The balancing is good between all classes and the fights are interesting.Only negative is that there are really unfriendly people, sadly most time under russian flag.But on every other aspect I can really say: Play this Game before you judge it as a lame Copy.

												It's another MOBA game like many more. But this one is different. It's a combination of a tycoon game and a MOBA game. This doesnt focusses that much on the heroes but more on the play styles. You can't but items in-game for bonus hp or some extra damage. You get points for last hitting and destroying a tower and all the other stuff. You can spend these points on potions for HP regen, energy(the mana of Prime World) regen, or some bonus move speed for a limited time. but also on skills. And every time you buy a skill with these points youll level up.Well I think I've said enough about the game. Lets look at the pros and cons.Pros:-It isn't pay-to-win-You can customize your skills-There are a lot of different skills-There's a lot of potentialCons:-It runs bad for it's graphics-It doesn't tell you when you got a game, you just go into the game-Not really anything more to do with your points then buying a skill-It's actually pretty bad, a lot of things are brokenI give this game a 4/10			"

												Lacks in debth, very repetitive, almost anoyingNot very coop based with the existant xp rewarding system that leads to solo-play and steal kills to get the rewarding killing blowA barely o.k. game when you got not much to do and wanna have a hand free...to eat, drink...The characters and classes are so unbalanced that it totaly kills it.  They probably tried to hard to diversify the roles but it lead to lots of inequalities.  In the end it only leaves 3-4  viable characters out of....25.... to play with and forget about the only healing class. it hits 10x weaker than any other class and it healing power is so weak that you are useless and unreliable (average damage per sec at lvl 30 is 400-1000 per second for most classes (except healer) /  healing is around 70-150 per second but you can only heal every 3 seconds,make the maths.                                My score:  4/10.Its the 3rd game developed in Russia I play this year, all of em are in my top 10 of the worsts games of the year.    Wonder why the Russian Iron curtain empire has fallen...euh..not!  Takes about 20 hours to noticed how big the gap is in between classes.  I dont know why the developpers didnt see, notice ,feel and fix that huge evidence/bug.So you get to play a solo-focused-team-game with classes that cant get a single kill because of their flaws and on the other hand you get to play classes with which you can♥♥♥♥♥♥3 guys and a tower simultinously without losing any health.  But if you still wanna try it, then ill give you a Q on what classes to buy  (Snake, warewolf + the last character which is a pay-to-win char) these 3 classes generally get 5 to 10 times more kills than any other classes (except Blizzard with is OP aoe that keep stealing kills) all other class must rely upon stealing the kills form others to get the killing blow xps.JUST PATHETIC!!!!  This game is a big demonstration of incompetence.Its 2014, and yet there is still crappy games on old out-of-date crappy platform coming out...sigh.... If we gamers would ask for more we d get it, its all about the money. Games are evolving at the pace of the market, it should be pushed by the consumers. As long as gamers dont stand up and ask for quality, we'll keep getting bad unpolished/unfinished games on out-of-date platforms because we tolerate it.. technology in game developpement is far more developped than they want us to think.

												Summary:At first glance, Prime World appears an ambitious MOBA that tries to take the genre to the next level.  While I don't think it necessary does that, if you're a fan of the genre, this game would be worth a look, at the very least... if the community wasn't trash.---------------Pros:Exp and currency are tied together into something called ""prime"".  You spend prime to level up, buy potions, buy scrolls, etc.The native terrain element rewards smart, tactical play with some nice bonuses.The zuma element is an interesting ""second jungle"" with team-wide benefits, adding additional laning and support possibilities in the early game.Starter heroes are completely viable against more expensive heroes, as long as you know how to use them.PvE ""Challenge"" maps allow for a more relaxed atmosphere to learn how a class works, before you jump into the fire.The cash shop is strictly a pay to advance faster system, as opposed to a pay to win system.  You don't need to spend a dime on the game to be considered good at the game.---------------Cons:The tutorial system assumes that you're capable of learning a lot of stuff on your own.  All it really teaches you to do is how to play the laning phase and how to ultimately win the match.Talent farming.  In a nutshell, the more you play, the more likely you are to get good talents, which are effectively where your power comes from.  The grind element can be a bit tedious early on, when you're still trying to gear up, leading to some matches where you're just going to be out-scaled no matter what you do.A horrible newbie matchmaking system causes long queues when trying to obtain your first ten wins, with leavers, bots, ragers, etc flooding that entire queue.  The devs have stated that the issue stems from a lack of people in that queue, and changes are coming to fix it.  In the meantime, it's still a horrible queue.  The game gets a lot better after those first ten wins, in which you'll escape that queue, but those first few matches do turn a lot of people away from the game.No counterbuilds on the fly.  What you load into your profile before the match is what you get, no matter how good or bad it is against the other team's composition.  Some pro players may not like this.The castle system.  I'm not a big fan of it.  The whole point of it appears to be to fuel your ability to obtain new heroes, obtain new talents, and help your heroes recover.  It seems like a restrictive system designed to make you want to drop some cash on the game.A horrible community that punishes people for ""doing it right"".  If you're not suicide rushing into a 2v4 situation to save a feeder, you're doing it wrong, according to this community.  And you're going to be seeing this happen.  Every.  Single.  Match.  No avoiding it.---------------Do I recommend this game?Not just no, but heck no.  If this small community comprehended proper MOBA mechanics, it's a nice niche game.  But it's just full of people who don't comprehend the genre, coupled with an incredibly small community, making for long wait times.  The game is decent, but the community just makes it unbearable.  Stay away if you value your sanity.			"

												It's a pretty game, the music is great. I love the graphics and the characters are unique. What I couldn't stand was the long wait time for battle. There is an average count time for battle queue, and I always had to wait longer than that. Battles were long, so if you like playing for long stretches of time, and enjoy simulations, this is a game for you.			"

												this game is fun and visually pleasing and when you can get it to work its fun.. they have many characters, the only negatives i have is the missions they have are mostly PVP which is great, but if no one is playing the game than you can't continue your path..  So the developers should make certain missions PVP or PVE, where you can use other characters because come on who wants to play a game that is constantly PVP all the time..  I can not progress my campaign because no one is logged in to play with me, thats an issue you have with Ninetendo 64 or PS1,  for that to happen on a Computer game is unheard of, and crap!!  Plus i found a huge bug, that i won't discuss unless the developers ask for it..  I used to be a QA tester and i know don't give out certain info without being commisioned for it..			"

												Lacks in debth, very repetitive, almost anoyingNot very coop based with the existant xp rewarding system that leads to solo-play and steal kills to get the rewarding killing blowA barely o.k. game when you got not much to do and wanna have a hand free...to eat, drink...The characters and classes are so unbalanced that it totaly kills it.  They probably tried to hard to diversify the roles but it lead to lots of inequalities.  In the end it only leaves 3-4  viable characters out of....25.... to play with and forget about the only healing class. it hits 10x weaker than any other class and it healing power is so weak that you are useless and unreliable (average damage per sec at lvl 30 is 400-1000 per second for most classes (except healer) /  healing is around 70-150 per second but you can only heal every 3 seconds,make the maths.                                My score:  4/10.Its the 3rd game developed in Russia I play this year, all of em are in my top 10 of the worsts games of the year.    Wonder why the Russian Iron curtain empire has fallen...euh..not!  Takes about 20 hours to noticed how big the gap is in between classes.  I dont know why the developpers didnt see, notice ,feel and fix that huge evidence/bug.So you get to play a solo-focused-team-game with classes that cant get a single kill because of their flaws and on the other hand you get to play classes with which you can♥♥♥♥♥♥3 guys and a tower simultinously without losing any health.  But if you still wanna try it, then ill give you a Q on what classes to buy  (Snake, warewolf + the last character which is a pay-to-win char) these 3 classes generally get 5 to 10 times more kills than any other classes (except Blizzard with is OP aoe that keep stealing kills) all other class must rely upon stealing the kills form others to get the killing blow xps.JUST PATHETIC!!!!  This game is a big demonstration of incompetence.Its 2014, and yet there is still crappy games on old out-of-date crappy platform coming out...sigh.... If we gamers would ask for more we d get it, its all about the money. Games are evolving at the pace of the market, it should be pushed by the consumers. As long as gamers dont stand up and ask for quality, we'll keep getting bad unpolished/unfinished games on out-of-date platforms because we tolerate it.. technology in game developpement is far more developped than they want us to think.

												So, I really used to love this game during the beta phase but now the DEVS just neglect the English/South American players. The matchmaking now is total crap, fast? yes only because its with JUST russians. No communicartion what so ever, the differences betweeen premium and normal accounts is outragesouly different and the system for obtaining better items is rediculously hard to do specially for new players. Originally I would reccommend thiss game to anyone an everyone but there isnt a chance in hell id do that now. Which is so sad beCuase while during beta you may have waited to find a match atleast 5-10min for english players it was totally worth it.			"

												Это многопользовательская стратегия, сюжет которой построен так, что персонажи мужского и женского пола должны действовать сообща. Девушки выступают в роли целительниц, хранительниц и вдохновительниц, а суровые мужи привычно расправляются с врагами на передовой. Причем чем успешнее сражаются воины, тем больше полезных способностей появляется у их спутниц и наоборот. Таким образом, игрокам предоставляется возможность не только объединить усилия, но также познакомиться и пообщаться друг с другом, подыскивая напарников и напарниц во время матча.Геймплей соответствующий – азартный, но изрядно опостылевший. Команда вооруженных героев иллюстрирует броуновское движение, хаотично перемещаясь по игровой карте. Они раздают тумаков вражеским войскам, берут ключевые точки (некоторые способности работают лучше на «своей» территории), жалят сторожевые башни, возможно даже, жгут деревни и проделывают непристойные вещи с гусями – до тех пор, пока не осознают, что оказавшаяся более слаженной, смышленой и менее падкой на гусей команда противника вовсю штурмует шахту по добыче прайма.Поясним. Для развития героя в той же DotA важно было регулярно наведываться в игровую лавку, оставляя незримым продавцам горы золота в обмен на доспехи и свитки. На полках аналогичных магазинчиков из Prime World стоят разве что нехитрые зелья, да свиток перемещения, что поначалу вводит в небольшой ступор.			"

												2 year old ""open beta"" with a three month long standing promise to fix unbalanced matchmaking.  Unbalanced classes abound and the game works numerous gimicks in order to extract money from its players, such as charging players $1 in real money in order to move a rare talent from one character to another.  In the end, either play Dota 2 or wait for Heart of the Storm.  This game is not worth your time, and definitely not your money.			"

												This game was meant for the Russian public only (at least they are the only country to be up to date with skins and champs. So I’ve read). It looked promising but I got stuck when I was forced to play vs AI with AI in my team. The AI programming is like this: 1 top,2 mid and 2 bot (probably the meta. -.-‘). You are forced to go mid, because no other bot will give up his lane if you go some were else. And if you go to another lane, mid will get rolled so hard you will lose the game. And what happens when you are lvl 1 “ruler” (whatever it’s called) and you have the noob champ lvl 2? You are close to useless. And how the AI plays? He goes into lane farming, but if he sees an enemy champ he starts attacking and only backs of when he is below 10 %, or he gets killed. Now, this means that he gets rolled easily by you and takes lots of damage from every freaking stuff in the lane. But this is bad for your team, because you will see your mid lane partner getting killed stupidly or getting low hp in 5 secs and returns to base, then comes to lane and in 5 secs he comes back to base, then comes to lane and gets low hp or dies again and again. You have a bad champ vs OP champs that focus you, you can get some kills, but you have to return to heal some times, and here you lose all mid lane towers. Now, what happens when you have them almost destroying your last structure -> no other lane helps defending. You are vs 2 fed OP champs and with only 1 team mate that is stupid, has close to zero cs, low lvl and he continues to go balls deep vs 2 alone, feeding even more.Now the farmvile mechanic on the castle is not for me. It’s not rewarding having to sit in your thumb waiting for resources. I have heard that the MM is awefull, making you go against higher lvl players that will roll you any time any day because they have better talents and champs than you. You don’t have a shop were you have access to the same gear to deal dmg has everyone else. You have to upgrade and buy stuff off game so you can be better in game. How easily rolled can you get by this mechanic, omg. Everyone will beat you easily, because even if they have the same champ as you, they will have better talents and will faceroll you easily.its hard to get a pvp game or help because no one is playing this crap    -.-'Toxic community and bot program users. Will you have fun? NNNNNNOOOOOOOOOO. Period.Like I’ve said, the game has potential but it doesn’t work at all.			"

On the exterior it seems like a good MOBA, with interesting aspects that make it new and different, namely the Castle Managment and Talent (Skill/Abilities)  Swithcing. But the Castle makes me feel like it's a Zynga game, while the Talent pool leaves me more confused than helped. If you like MOBAs such as LoL, HoN, and DotA go for this one for a fresh break. If you aren't a hard core fan, still give it a try but keep a cursor over the uninstall button.			"

												I've been playing this on and off, coming back to the game to check out any new features... The game, while in early beta, was at a stage you'd expect the game to be in, slightly unbalanced, since they didn't have a lot of players to get feedback and stats from, but from there it went downhill. The game became more and more a money-♥♥♥♥♥ and they then tried to get old players back by giving them an ABSURD amount of premium currency. The game itself has gone downhill from there, as the balancing has been thrown more off... some heroes are stupidly overpowered, while others lack so far behind, they can barely kill creeps. The game can be won singlehandedly by a select few heroes, even if the rest of the team is so far behind, they are but a breeze...Besides that, the game itself lacks pace and music, in other MOBA-games, you do not feel like falling asleep after 10 minutes has passed. If you ejoy watching master chess players with infinite time playing, along with watching paint dry, this is the game for you.			"

												Well I've thouroughly enjoyed my experience so far. The persistance and other rpg elements combined with a solid moba is well done I have to say.			"

												Ok let's get the bad points over with:1) Is a watered-down MOBA - don't expect anything too fancy2) Primarily an eastern europe community -all very nice and friendly - but difficult for english speakers to understand3) Can be difficult to jump right into a match.All that said, it is a fun, silly MOBA -lots of fun to goof around with your friends. It is also much more relaxing than your standard MOBADespite what people say - it is not Freemium - it is balanced - it just takes a little getting used to.			"

												Though I have spent a lot of time playing, its hard for me to recommend Prime world. My main problem is the match making. The server matches you with non english speaking people therefore making it really hard to comunicate. It's played best with real life friends, but If you happen to have none that play this game then it becomes a very hard game to get into. Mainly because of it Complexity.Calling this a MOBA feels short because of everthing that it brings to the table. Pick it up for yourself and experience the Prime World.?/10			"
