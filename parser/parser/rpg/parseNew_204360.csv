 Do you like?  Brutally slaughtering your friends to get a kiss? Making people explode? Poop jokes? General hilarity? Sandwiches that not only taste great, but also are packed with steriods?If you answered yes to any of these questions then this game is for you In short  castle crashers is a medieval hack and slash adventure which you can play by yourself or with up to 3 friends (Four player Co-op). It possesses an amazing cast of unlockable characters, enough stupid moments to last a decade, and cartoony graphics which will never get old.Have Fun!9/10			"

												Introduction:Castle Crashers was my personal favorite Xbox Live Arcade game when it was first released back in 2008. The Behemoth continued to give this game more life with it's DLC of character's that had unique abilities, animal orbs that would accompany you throughout the game, and weapons that would improve your character's growth (or vice versa if you are looking for a challenge). The game was later ported to the Playstation Network with exclusive mini-games in 2010. Castle Crashers eventually was ported onto Steam, but was ported badly onto PC on launch; however, the game was redeemed to be fun and playable again after The Behemoth made necessary updates. Verdict:This title is a hack and slash RPG, and has been widely recieved by many gamers who appreciate the genre (even those who don't). The game can feel a bit tedious at times, but as you level your character(s) the gameplay will feel slightly different before it tends to get repetitive once again. However, the game keeps the game fresh upon every level with unique scenary, opponents, and even jokes. If you plan on purchasing this title it's obviously more fun to play it with friends then it is with complete strangers, so try to convince your friends (and if they've convinced you to buy it listen to them). Completing the title will be a mission, but personally I think that's half the fun of trying to unlock every single character, find every animal orb and weapons. Give this game a try by downloading the demo. If you find the game a bit pricey than wait for a discount (or a Humble Indie Bundle that has this game packaged with it).			"

												A great game to play with a room full of friends, a pizza, and some drinks. The game is decent by itself, but with friends in a local coop setting, it's wonderful. The game is mostly you verses monsters, but occasionally you have to duke it out amongst yourselves for the hand of a lovely maiden. It has wonderful items, and challenging gameplay. I'd highly recommend picking up a 4-pack on sale to play with your buddies some time.			"

												Castle Crashers is a 2D beat 'em up with some RPG elements. I'd heard a lot of people talk it up and even tried the demo before deciding to get this bad boy when it was on sale for Halloween. You get four characters to choose from, so you can potentially play a 1-4 player game right out of the gate. Each character has their own starting weapon, magical element, and appearance. You go through levels beating up bad guys and trying to save princesses. Along the way, you'll find some cool weapons and animal orbs that give you special perks, You can switch between them between levels by visiting the blacksmith. I don't typically enjoy beat 'em ups. They tend to get stale and boring, despite how many combos or different weapons the game wants to throw my way. But Castle Crashers adds in some RPG elements to keep it interesting. Sure, the different weapons, different characters with their magic, and different animal buddies all add some customization, but the leveling system is what truly gives this game replayability and a sense of progression. Upon leveling up, you'll gain points that can be put into any of the four stats you have, strength, defense, magic, and agility. Depending on what kind of playstyle you want to use or what role you have on the team, you can build accordingly. Do you want to focus on one or two stats? Or would you rather be more well rounded? How will you compliment your teammates? Or what is best for solo play? It gives some complexity to the otherwise simple concept, which is great. The ability to play locally, cooperatively, or solo is nice for varied options and experiences. Essentially, each character you use equals one campaign. And there are a lot of unlockable characters, so this game does have a lot of replayability and lifespan. I also like the simple cartoony art style and some of the music is pretty cool. The main game with single and multiplayer, insane mode, two mini games, achievements, there's a lot of hours to be had with this title. However, I DO need to point out a few flaws in the game. Castle Crashers is a game of diminishing returns. When you start, there's lots of new and exciting things to keep you hooked. New characters, new weapons, new animal buddies, new secondary items, new levels, and a blank slate to upgrage how you see fit. But after a while... it loses its luster. There are only so many characters, items, animal buddies, weapons, and levels in the game. Your upgrades get harder and harder to improve as the game goes on and you will start to gain less points per level. You max out at 78 and from then on it's very little change between levels. Insane mode, aside from a few exceptions, is basically the same as the normal game... excpet enemies take longer to kill and can kill you faster. More frustrating and time consuming than an increase in challenge. Also, the online isn't always the best. It depends on game settings, connection speeds, and the locations of the players for sure, but laggy games can be tough to get through, especially in crucial moments the requre precision. Not to mention that when the game literally has to stop and wait for the other players, it can get very annoying and tiresome. So I'd recommend finding people close enough for online, or simply doing local play if you're going to do multiplayer.I like Castle Crashers. Sure, it has diminishing returns, and if you want to complete it with everyone at maximum everything... you'll be playing longer than you enjoy. But playing in moderation, trying to win rather than max everything, playing with other people... all of this can easily extend the playtime of the game while keeping it fun. Is it worth $15? Well... it really depends. If you like beat 'em ups a lot, then probably. Try out the demo and gauge your excitement. I'd say this game is probably worth about $10 generally, and when it goes on sale it tends to be cheaper anyway, so definitely go for it. I'd give Castle Crashers a solid 7/10. A good game, great for fans of beat 'em ups, but still alright for people who don't much care for them as well. I'm sure I'll get lots of hours in this game over the years, and you might too.			"

												I first played this game on the Xbox 360 and I have just loved the game ever since. I obviously have done a lot with the game, considering that I have over 300 hours in it.GameplayThe gameplay is absolutely perfect. The arena asset of it where you must kill every enemy before you proceed is very fitting for a game like this. The enemy AI is also great, as they seem to get more agressive as you progress more through the game, and then once you beat the game, you have the option of doing it all over again, but with a brutally difficult twist where almost all of the enemies get nearly x10 health, damage, and everything.Playing with another friend is highly recommended for this game, simply because it's just one of those games that's better with friends, however I would say the only fault with it is when there's connection problems, causing the entire game to just pause to let the other players catch up. The difficulty in general is great and increases at the perfect rate, the ending of the game is actually nice and hard, even on Insane Mode it's probably one of the most difficult things in the entire game once you get at the end, but it feels good to beat it once you kill that damn Necromancer.The StoryI find the story of this game comedic and silly, while it still gives a clear representation of what is going on and what you must achieve in the end. The ending does feel very rewarding and it makes you realize how big of a thing it is that you're at the end of the game. With how everything is set up in the story, it makes you realize that it's a long and difficult journey to save the princesses.ContentThis game has so much content in it just as you play it. By how fun the game is, and the fact that you unlock a new character for each time you beat it, you'll see yourself constantly beating the game over and over again, unlocking all the new characters, new swords, and all of the animal orbs. There is also the two DLC characters that most players might end up buying, or at least the Pink Knight because who doesn't want a character that murders their enemies with rainbows and love on the field?Simply a great game that has so many reasons to play again and again, whether by yourself or with a full party.

												I can't even express how much this game means to me. I love my younger brother, but we never really spent a lot of time together. Him and I are the only brothers in a large family of mostly girls, all of whom couldn't care less about me or him. I felt so bad that I just didn't have a lot of time to hang out with him, with work and school and my own personal selfishness. Then I bought Castle Crashers. It was ok, especially for an old title. One day I was playing it, and my 7 year old brother walks by, and he's like, ""that looks fun."" And I didn't say a word, I just plugged in the old F310 and handed it to him. I let him kiss all the princesses. 120 hours later, with almost every character unlock, I can 100% reccomend this game and 100% say that my relationship with my brother has improved so much because of this game, as well as Battleblock Theater, and now Pit People. Thanks for a masterpiece, Behemoth.11/10 would fix relationship with little bro			"

												Castle Crashers,one of the best indie games I have ever played.The gameplay is really fun with a controller,but playing with a keyboard won't ruin your playing experience.The co-op mode is a lot of fun,especially if you play with 3 other friends.They are many pets and weapons you can collect and the amount of fun can't be described.You can usually get the game for 3.74$ sales,but the game is worth it even for the full price,the DLC's are great,but they are not a ""must have"" to enjoy the game.So yeah,I would reccomend you to get this game if you think about buying it,but try to get atleast one friend to buy it with you,because once you play with a friend,you will never want to play alone again !

Castle Crashers is insaneGTA, Saints Row, Manhunt? Not even close. In terms of sheer gore, those games have Castle Crashers beat, but there are few action games out there without plenty of gore. No, the traumatizing, soul-crushing characteristics of Castle Crashers is not about gore or level of violence, it’s in between the lines of the actions of the “heroes” you play. On the surface, it might seem like your average ‘hero on a journey to defeat evil’ type story, but if you look more closely, you will quickly realize that the heroes you play are among the most monstrous, psychopathic killers you have ever had the opportunity of controlling.Let’s have a closer look at your actions throughout the game, which means in the case that you feel the story is of importance in a game like this, you should know that there will be SPOILERS ahead. The Corncob. This poor vegetable had the sad fate of being either: being born very differently from the other maize, or having had some spell cast on him to turn him into a monster. He’s probably been bullied by the other corncobs his whole life. Is it strange that this unfortunate soul is a little aggressive? And yet what is the logical conclusion that the “heroes” reach when they meet the corncob? They slaughter him, and then proceed to eat his remains. Follow me on this, they slaughter a lost, confused creature, whose only crime was being different, and then consume his dead body because it’s tasty. The motivation? The corncob was kind of in the way of a place they were looking for, and decided it was too much trouble simply going around him.Next up, genocide. On their journey, the player champions and the army that follows them encounter a primitive tribe of polar bears. The bears like to eat fish, sleep and dance in the rain, and are completely oblivious to the ongoing war. When an army invades their land, the bears will naturally try to defend it out of fear. Do the good guys try a diplomatic solution? No, they exterminate the entire population of polar bears without mercy.Wedding crashers. Our righteous heroes crash a wedding, destroy the cake, and murder the guests and the groom, whose only wish was to get married. The groom was quite the villain though; his evil weapon was a musical instrument. Be grateful they saved us from that guy. The champions are not quite finished, though. The groom was the Cyclops’ only friend, and upon seeing him dead, the Cyclops flies into a great sorrow and rage, escaping to his cave to grieve. You get one guess at what the heroes do to the Cyclops. Wrong, they do not simply murder him, but make sure to give him the horribly painful death of molten lava.‘But wait!’ A player familiar with the game might say. ‘They rescue animals!’ This is true; they rescue a selection of animals from both battlefields and black market vendors throughout their journey. Then they proceed to use them as weapons. Baby seals, kittens, birds. You name it; they probably threw it right into the bloody war, to fight for their lives for their own cruel and selfish gains.What about the hermit in the mountains? The heroes meet a crazy, old hermit living in the mountains, who only wanted to show them his sock puppet show. They kill him because he has a steering wheel that they want. Oh, and the aspiring painter, let’s not forget about him. He also only wants to show off his artistic prowess by displaying his paintings. They kill him because....no reason what so ever! F*ck art, apparently.If this is not convincing enough, then I don’t know what more to point out. Except that if you decide to play multiplayer, when you rescue princesses, you will casually be fighting your friends to the death if it means you’ll get some of the fair maidens' sweet lovin’. This is the heroic thing to do, of course. Doesn’t get more morally rotten than this. Final verdict: AwesomeSide note: after approx. 50 hours of playing, a bug caused my entire save to get erased, without chance of recovery. Not so awesome.			"

Castle CrashersDefend your kingdom! Beat up baddies! Crash their castles and fight for honor and love! Hack n' Slash your way to glorious victory with a few poop jokes along the way.Castle Crashers is an Action Co-op Beat 'em up Flash game!Developed by The Behemoth, originating from their popular website, http://www.newgrounds.com/. Knowing that, the game comes with hilarious, but crude sense of humor, which is all part of the game's special charm. The game is all hand-drawn in Flash, giving it a nice and colorful artstyle that adds a cartoonish appeal to the game. Additionally, most of the music in Castle Crashers are submitted by loyal Newgrounds fans!Hack! Slash! Smash! Abracadabra!The gameplay is what makes this game great. It's your usual beat 'em up formula, with light and heavy attacks, performing combos and such. But in addition to that, you have the ability to cast magic! Controls the elements as you spark fire, summon icicles, conduct electricity, fling poison and throw buzz saws? Castle Crashers also features RPG elements, as you gain EXP for every hit, and with enough EXP, you level up! Granting you points in which you could assign to either physical or magical power!The Evil Wizard has kidnapped the King's daughters!The story can't be much simpler than this. As your king's loyal knights, you venture off to save the 4 princesses that has been taken away by the evil clutches of the Final Boss! You journey through war fields, forests, deserts, snow lands and many more as you battle various bosses such as barbarians, trolls, robots, dragons and aliens! Whenever you save one of the princesses, the true battle begins, as you and your friends fight to the death to win the princess' kiss! During your free time, you're free to participate in other game modes such as Arena; as you duel your friends gladiator style, and Back Off Barbarian; where you and your friends escape in this tricky tile-based mini-game!Journey alone or adventure with your buddies with up to four players!Either local, online, or hell, even both! You can select from a variety of knights, each with their own unique magical element, with many more unlockable characters as you play through the game. You can also select from a variety of weapons and pets, or ""animal orbs"" as the game calls them along the way, as most of them are cleverly hidden all across the map. However, this becomes a problem for most unlockable characters involve beating the game as certain other characters, then beating them game with those newly unlocked characters. Most of the characters are pretty much the same anyway for they share similar magic, while certain ones break the game from how Overpowered they are. While the game is relatively short and fun, it could be bothersome to most who plans to unlock everything.Final Verdict!While the game is fun alone, it is strongly recommended playing with friends. The game is unfortunately dying, so there are not many people playing online that often, so it's best to just host private games with friends. While unlocking more characters, animal orbs and weapons can be fun, it's still dependent on the player if they're into that sort of thing, and if they're willing to play the game numerous times just to achieve them.Grab the game when you can! Get the 4-pack, even! The game went as low as 90% off on sale, so you have no reason not to get it! And when you do start playing, don't play as any of the DLC characters for your first playthrough, for they do not unlock any new characters if you beat the game as them. Despite all these flaws, I'm a fan of it myself, so if you need someone to play with, give me a holler and we'll crash some castles together!			"

												Probably one of the best 4 player co-op games you can get in the Steam Store! Apart from Left 4 Dead that is. Castle Crashers has a lot to offer to those special groups, composed of four friends, as you'll find your team gaining experience, learning new unique moves in combat and fighting to the death of every chapter, all with a touch of humour. This game reaks of Indie-goodness and it goes for a fact that I love that type of game producing and development; Independently made, tying in nicely together, to make a labour of love.I love the particular 'crude' and simplistic art style this game has. Coming from the beloved artist, Dan Paladin, his ingenius creativity is best said as beautiful and completely staggering. Every character has a ''comic-component'' to them, including their emotions being presented in that of a slap-stick type of fashion. Interaction with random NPC's and the wacky medieval environments are top-notch and goofy and the rest can be left as fun. What more could be said?The game's appeal and genre, being in the typical 2-D Adventure Beat 'em Up hybrid, relates to the classic and retro games like Golden Axe for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, the classic Arcade game, Final Fight and even dating way back to Double Dragon and Battletoads for the NES. All of which shrouds you in a distant yet cherished memory, while this game adapts to its own heartwarming and charmful stylish nature. If you have played all of these previous games or other games that shares this joyful genre, you will most likely adapt to this game's control with pure expert skill.The game's mechanics are very immersive and easy enough to figure out even for first timers. Most battle systems work in waves; with a certain number of enemies that increase in power as you progress and defeat all enemies in a specific wave, which lets you advance further within a level. Most levels end in with a big boss battle, where your techniques, might and agility is put to the test, as you'll take down numerous tyrants and beasts, again with all a touch of humour and creative cartoon-ish atmospheres. All of this, to uphold the traditional tale of medieval times, where a brave knight will rise up and save the princess, either from evil tyrants, corrupt kings or beasts and the much darker figure that is behind the game's plot overall.Though this game is impeccable and fun with friends, this little gem doesn't seperate itself from its own fair share of problems. First of all, I find the controllability with the keyboard a little finicky and hard to manoeuvre when you're on the field, smashing vikings and gladiators alike. Understandably, the game does warn you right from the very beginning that a controller is highly recommended, but it doesn't distinguish the fact that a keyboard is optional and here's where I think a little more work should've been put in. Another problem I keep running into is the multiplayer connectivity. Me, neither of my mates who I've played Castle Crashers with had no internet connection problems at all, while the game seems to freeze, not respond and generally lags while in-game. To me, this game is one of the biggest icons, to serve off as inspiration to even those small Independent game developers who will hopefully get their projects recognized around. As well as a big Indie-icon, a definite recommendation from me as you will soon find out that many people have this in their own game library. I will conclude this review by saying that this game is just that damn good.			"

												Like my pre-teen kid when she's hopped up on Mountain Dew and Skittles, Castle Crashers is completely frenetic and has a penchant for toilet humor. And that's why we love it! The cartoonish graphics are great and there's little else more satisfying that to run around bludgeoning things indiscriminately . It's cheap, you'll have hours of fun. Why aren't you playing already?			"

												I'm going to look at Castle Crashers from two points of view: casual and hardcore. Now I'm fully aware that ""casual"" is a dirty word when it comes to videogames. Honestly, I think a game being casual is a good thing. If I'm playing a lot of hardcore games, the kind with a lot of depth, high punishments for failure, and an extreme level of difficulty; I'm going to want something to fall back on. In this regard, Castle Crashers fits the bill.However, a lot of games - sometimes the best ones - can appeal to both the casual and hardcore gamers. These titles offer a perfect learning curve and are enjoyable at any skill-level. There are multiple methods for playing through them. The challenge can range from easy to improbable. It all depends on how the player approaches these games. Though it tries, Castle Crashers can't bridge this gap. It's a fine game for a friendly get-together, or a time-sink on a slow day. If you're looking for a quality brawler, the kind you can keep coming back to again and again, then look elsewhere.I hate to say it, but this review isn't over yet.Looking further, Castle Crashers works as a casual game due to the constant thread of ""niceties"". These are moments that make you say ""Oh. That's nice."" when they happen. Leveling up, the discovery of a new weapon or animal, a dead enemy dropping a valuable crystal instead of a mere coin; these are all examples of niceties. The game is further bolstered by simplistic but charming hack & slash action. Through the combination of both elements, as well as flavor touches like the set-piece battles and action sequences, this game works. It just plain works.Even with this casual approach, you're still bound to run into problems. The balance between strength, magic, and agility is crap. Magic and agility require huge investments to attain any noticeable effect. Strength is an absolute necessity, unless you want to juggle foes for several minutes at a time. The ranged options are only forced onto the player by the rare appearance of giant enemies. You know who these jerks are, because you can't get close to them, without being grabbed and thrown.Also, while the niceties are appreciated, I believe that Behemoth could have done a little better. Character-unlocking is just plain awful after a certain point. Having to replay the entire game with character F to unlock character M is maddening. It's especially bad when A) all characters behave the same outside of spells B) every character starts at level 1 and C) there aren't any methods for passing experience onto new characters. Dynasty Warriors is a franchise with gobs of playable heroes, and usually there's some method for strengthening unused characters, so everyone remains at a level playing field. In Castle Crashers, this -admittedly not all that important - element was overlooked, and it's pretty annoying.The insane mode is ironically where hardcore gamers are liable to get the door slammed in their faces. This is also where the game almost completely falls apart. A high difficulty mode is fine, but it needs to make sense. Insane difficulty features faster and more aggressive enemies, so it's good on that front. Unfortunately, their HP and especially their strength have recieved a massive multiplier, and that's really bad. A number of enemies and bosses go from non-threatening to entirely absurd. For most players, insane mode ends with the large troll of the Thieves' Forest.This is my third play-through of the game, and I still don't understand why insane mode exists. In the original Xbox 360 version, insane mode was somewhat mitigable, due to a prevalent experience glitch (involving the troll boss). This is one of those rare glitches that actually made the game worse when it was fixed. Depending on how you look at it, abusing an XP glitch to make a game easier probably isn't very hardcore. As far as I'm concerned, insane mode is where the game actively cheats. Everyone has too much HP and does too much damage, but apparently it's unfair for players to have something to fall back on. Personally, I would have suggested difficulty modifiers (ala Bastion) instead of a difficulty mode, but this a 20/20 hindsight suggestion. I certainly didn't have the idea, when Castle Crashers was released, back in 2008. All told, this game is still pretty enjoyable and even better with friends. Just don't invest too much of your energy, because the pay-off isn't worth the effort.			"

												Castle Crashers has a lot of unique things to offer. A fun 4 player co-op game where you and your team (or even by yourself) go through many battles and boss fights leveling up your character to learn unique skills, combat skills etc. The game does not have the best graphics, but it doesn't change the fact that it's still a fun and of course an addicting game for you and your friends to play together. The game has a lot of enjoyment to it, the type of game where I would spend my time on for a while showing lots of love for.Basically, a couple of enemies have come to your castle and stole the princesses. You and your friends go on adventure progressing through many battles and boss fight trying to save the princesses by being ""Castle Crashers"" if you know what I mean. It starts off from easy battles to becoming more difficult but you'll be able to level up your character so he/she could become stronger and acquire unique combat skills and magical abilities. Shops will also be available for you around the map so you can buy healing potions, weapons, and even cute little pets on your journey.The maximum level you can reach each character is 99 as I believe. Once you reached level 99 or completed the whole story, don't think you're finished yet. There are lots more things you could do. While you are on your adventure, note that you could've missed a lot of ""secret"" items hidden around certain parts of the map whether it's weapons or pets. Battle arenas are also around the maps where you can test out your characters combat skills fighting certain multiples of the same type of enemy (Yes, there are different types of enemies). Now, if you're sure you're 100% completed the game, try maxing out another character to level 99, or even better, do it with a couple of friends. It's usually fun when you're playing with friends even if you've completed the game.You'll have the ability to unlock many different characters in the game with diverse abilities. While progressing through the story, you'll be unlocking new playable characters. Many characters can be unlocked through completing battle arenas, or completing a certain area on INSANE mode like the royal king of your castle. Insane mode is a special mode after you complete the story. It's much harder but you'll gain a good amount of EXP. If you're into some fun humorous RPG games, I'm 100% sure you'll like Castle Crashers. I've spent most of my hours on this game alone but still have fun playing it. Great content, great story, great features. Overall, it's just addicting as hell. "

												Of all the games I've ever played this would be my favorite. There are four basic knights you can play as when you begin the game. You can unlock more knights as you beat certain levels, or beat the game as certain characters. There are twenty nine characters you can unlock, and two DLC characters. As you defeat enemies you wil level up. Leveling up unlocks new combos, and rewards you with skill points that you can spend in Strength, Magic, Defense and Agility. Reaching levels 1 - 20 grants you two skill points, and level 21 - 78 give you one skill point. once you beat the game with any character, you will unlock insane mode, and you can play through the game again with tougher enemies, harder bosses, and some of the stores will have different items. The objective of the game is to rescue the four princesses from the Evil Wizard.11/10			"

												The best part of Castle Crashers is exploring the world - there are tons of levels that look and play completely differently. Though it can be done, single-player assaults are more frustrating and less enjoyable than teaming up with other people. The biggest issue in trying to take on levels solo is that multiple enemies can assault you with ranged attacks, making it difficult to even stand up before being knocked down again. Animal orbs are probably my favorite thing in Castle Crashers because they're just so damn cute.PRESENTATION:The story is straightforward and the game is easy to pick up and play.GRAPHICS:Everything is beautifully drawn and animated.SOUND:The digital, techno tunes are upbeat and perfect background music for raising hell.GAMEPLAY:Classic side-scrolling brawler gameplay mixed up with fun boosts and magic makes for a great time with friends. Slightly busted multiplayer is a downer though.LASTING APPEAL:The campaign is short, but there are multiple characters to unlock, lots of weapons and animals to unlock and 99 levels to max out, making it a game you can spend some serious time with.Two other negatives:The game is not worth the high price. Buy it on sale instead.It can be rather repetetive.6/10			"

There's plenty of other characters to unlock after you finish the game. The animations are as pretty as they can get and sometimes the game is just plain hilarious.

												I got this game on sale and boy was it worth it, I was obsessed over it for a few weeks.Let's start the review. Graphics	The game has animated graphics and that's probably one of the reasons why I love it.The art-style just seems really fitting.There is really nothing to talk about an animated game's graphics. Gameplay	An arcade styled 4-player side-scrolling beat'em up.Combat feels great and you can combo to your heart's content.Depending on your timing of certain hits you can make infinite combos.Using magic to combine with your melee attacks can do alot of damage so I usually do that.There are Animal Orbs that are hidden through out the game with each one having it's own unique perk that you gain by having that certain Animal Orb by your side.The same goes for weapons, there are alot of weapons hidden across the game.You can unlock probably every single enemy in the game as a playable character which is nice. DLC	The DLC characters, the Blacksmith and the Pink Knight are awesome, Blacksmith is my highest level.The DLCs are both cheap (I bought them along time ago but I think they were 99 cents) and the money goes to charity. Bonus character	You get to a new pet and a character by owning the game ''Battleblock Theater'' which is made by the developers of Castle Crashers.The character Hatty Hattington and the pet Golden whale.It's a nice gift just for owning an equally awesome game. The Plot	The plot is pretty simple,4 princesses get kidnapped and a magical crystal gets stolen from the king and 4 knights head out to rescue the princesses (1 if you don't have any friends) and retrieve the magic crystal. Pros.	+Really fluid gameplay+Big roster+Alot of replay value+Really fun with friends and even without friends.+Difficulty is just right - provides you with challange later on and goes easy on you in the beginning.+Alot of unlockables. Cons.	-Combat gets slightly repetitive. Final Verdict	   9.6/10	 "

												This game is what I would call a classic of the modern gaming era. It's not exactly new, but it still manages to keep a certain freshness to it, which is actually quite impressive. When I say ""classic"", I mean a game that is a sort of important pillar to gaming in general. Now, I wouldn't say that it changed the whole industry per say, but I still consider this one to be a game that is part of my childhood to an extend. Many can possibly relate to that thought, I'd wager.Now, what exactly is Castle Crashers? Well, to resume the whole experience in a single sentence, it's basically a ""smash right through the enemies, save the princesses and defeat the evil king"". Sounds simple, doesn't it? That's no surprise; because this game is simple. The true experience truly comes to life when you bring a friend or two along the ride. As most multiplayer games, having someone to play with you really is a must to enjoy the full adventure. Honestly, playing through this game alone is kind of boring, and considering that the designs of the levels highly support multiplayer, trying to go through the game alone can prove to be a chore. Then again, I did play and finish it alone the first time, but when I replayed it with a few folks, my overall opinion changed drastically.This game is huge. Don't let the tiny sixteen bucks tell you otherwise; it's probably one of the biggest adventures I've seen for a Smash 'em up. The adventure itself isn't much to speak about, my friends and I started from the beginning and finished after around four sessions of one hour each. What makes this thing so huge is the unlockable content. There are a ton of them, such as characters, pets, weapons, levels, and even a secret difficulty. You'll be grinding and repeating the same levels many times to find rare items and weapons if completion matters to you. I'd like to speak about the difficulty, since I feel like difficulty is something that matters for many players and buyers. The game in itself isn't harshly hard. Most bosses have simple patterns, the level designs can be either fair or sometimes overwhelming, and the overall product will not make you frustrated to the point of screaming. Of course, I won't say that it is an easy game either; sometimes it feels like the game throws so much at you, I find it almost unfair. Without spoiling too much, the final boss in particular has a lot of annoying patterns that can drag for a while, especially if alone. Upon finishing the game, you will have the option of changing to an even harder difficulty. I will warn you : It is cheap. Enemies are insanely powerful, and quite frankly, it's not fun. If that sounds appealing to you, then go ahead and try it. I, for one, will stay away and advices you to do so as well.The game has two primary mechanics : Physical attacks and Magical moves. Physical attacks are, as the name says, attacks with weapons. The damage that you will do to enemies is generated by how much points to give to your Physical stats. Magical moves are attacks composed of magic. Giving points to this stat will not only grow your magical abilities and make them more powerful, it will also make the range and overall usefulness much more adaptable. The best idea would be to try to make a balanced knight, since enemies later on will either be extremely resistant to Physical attacks or highly resistant to Magic. You always need to have an alternative, or else it becomes truly bothersome. I believe that I mentioned every aspects worth mentioning. This game is great, and while not a masterpiece by any means, it should prove itself quite worthy of your purchase. Do not forget to try and ask a few friends if they wish to play along!			"

												This game is super fun! ^_^ There aren't a lot of modern day side scrollers that make you feel like you get more game than you paid for! Many of them can actually be played out in one session. However, this is a game you'll definitely find yourself probably picking up for 3 sessions with a buddy, with characters that unlock for some level of replayability! The plot is funny and there's always some feeling of monotony throughout a beat em up adventure but the quirks of this game (for example the giant corn boss that drops popcorn as you hit it) keep them to a minimum!

												tl;dr? Aajwdlijf ajw dhrugdh 11/10!!'Now considering I took a 4 year hiatus, I'm sure a relatively large sum of you guys reading this review are in the same position as me.....'I was first introduced into the wacky world of Castle Crashers back in 2008 via the mini flash-game Castle Crashing ""The Beard."" Back then, Kongregate was the king and it quickly became my favourite platformer. Despite the simplicity of the artwork and game mechanics, the game had character and it was obvious that the developers weren't afraid to show off their work against the smorgasbord of stereotypically depicted knights, castles and overworked medieval warfare.Well a few months later, it was announced that Castle Crashing ""The Beard"" would fully mature into a proper side-scrolling beat-em-up platformer with an actual story (like fighting a giant beard would be believable lel)! While I was quickly swept away by the hype, I wasn't an Xbox owner and the prospects of getting one just for Castle Crashers weren't high. And so after beating the flash version a few times, I slowly let go of the unattainable and moved onto other things.4 years later, things had certainly changed; games were easily attainable now that I had become a successful Steam trader and suddenly out of the blue, Castle Crashers appeared on the Store page! So much time had passed that embarrassingly, the switch inside my head didn't immediately click... I saw the 4 knights and noticed the mellow colours but couldn't put my hand on why they were so familiar.. After a quick google search of ""Crashing beard game"" my mind became frantic, the impossible was finally possible, I HAD to play this game!!Now considering I took a 4 year hiatus, I'm sure a relatively large sum of you guys reading this review are in the same position as me. While the flash-version was extremely addictive, Castle Crashers is a refreshing rendition.Here are a few reasons for which Castle Crashers is a must-buy for people in the same position as I was: The simplicity of the fighting mechanics and overall movement has been entirely conserved. Artwork and soundtrack stays true to the original version :). Extensive storyline that will take you through an epic journey where you will meet the most creatively designed foes. Local and Online Multiplayer! Ability to play as other characters other than the 4 knights including...Pink Knight :D:D:D  (Yes, Pink knight from Crashing Beard is in this game with his lollipop sword!!!!!) Now unfortunately there are a few downsides: Latency issues and lag when playing with others across the world (Yes it's an old game, luckily its smoother with peers who live closer to you). Few features and special attacks are missing from the flash-version including Orange Knight's special pheonix attack.  Grinding: there will be unavoidable moments where you will need to grind certain stages of the game in which you will need to repeat certain levels to kill enemies due to the simplicity of the game's levelling system. For each character, you will need to spend a few hours on the same level to be able to play insane mode.Fortunately a few of these issues will be addressed in the Remastered edition to be released later this year (2015) including performance improvements - especially in online multiplayer. If you don't enjoy the grinding, just play with a friend, the social interaction will definitely put the boring aspects of the game to ease ;)Overall, I definitely do recommend Castle Crashers, if you loved the game on Kongregate or Newgrounds and don't trust the ""overwhelmingly positive"" review rating, let me assure you that it is undeniably worth it's weight in gold. Also the game does drop to $1.49 and usually below $5 during the Steam sales so there is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't give it a try!			"

												Pros+Hillariously drawn character designs and animations.+Great music.+Tons of fun online with friends.+Fluid controls.+Amazing amount of weapon, pet, and character variety.+Lots of levels to play through with several unique bosses.+Tons of different enemy types.+You can kill your friends in order to get a Princess' kiss. Why wouldn't you want to?+Insanely challenging on the ""Insane"" difficulty that you unlock after beating the game with your character once.+Back Off Barbarian is a fun little time waster mini game.+Good beat em up combat with decent RPG mechanics.Cons-Some of the weapons and characters are so overpowered that they make everything a joke or so weak that it makes the game almost impossible to beat.Overall Castle Crashers is a very fun beat em up that I highly recommend to everybody who enjoys the genre.

												Do you like arcade games? Maybe you wanted to try some but you've never had a chance or you don't want to waste time with emulators? If YES is an answer to any of these you should totally check Castle Crashers! Humoristic, pretty and friendly arcade game here on steam. Perfect for playing with a group of friends or your siblings.What's so cool about Castle Crashers?• Nice cartoon graphics.• Even decent plot.• Lots of funny moments.• Tons of characters to unlock, each one with thier own ""magic"".• Lotsa swords and weapons.• Pet companions.• Interesting sceneries.• With a friend to join your game, the fun is doubled.There are few disadvantages tho;• 12€ is not so cheap as for indie arcade game. • Playing alone is not as fun as with friends.• You will need a controller if you want to play on one PC.Other than that Castle Crashers is one ♥♥♥♥ good arcade game worth your time if you like the genre.I honestly recommend it.                                - D.Punk "

 Castle Crashers is some “Old School Arcade Fun”.I was on the fence about this one because of the art style, and it looked like a kids game. I ended up picking it up on a Steam sale for my son, who wanted it. To my surprise this game is a blast. You pick one of four knights each with a special ability. Fire, Poison, Electricity, Ice, you get the idea. The powers give you a special attack that does significant damage, as well as decides the color of your knight. The game supports full controller, local co-op, online co-op, and local plus online co-op. This is the way it should be. Local co-op, and split screen belong on PC! The game features three modes, campaign, versus, and a jumping mini game (not my cup of tea, but some may like jumping). The campaign mode is where it's at. You, and up to three friends button mash your way to victory against the evil horde to save the princesses. The combat gives you some options aside from hack n slash, like your special power, bow, bomb, and a few simple combos. The music is great, they did a nice job on the tracks for this game. The monster design is comical, and slicing the heads off little minions is fun.  The game will run on almost any PC (Not your Commodore 64, but anything from 2010 and up should be fine). If you've been passing on this one, give it a try at the next sale. OLDER GAMER APPROVED  POTATO PC CERTIFIED  Visit our Currator Page "

												This is a highly fun side scrolling beat 'em up with great controls. To start with the story is that your princesses have been captured, you and up to 3 friends set out to save them. This of course means co-op mayhem fun with up to 4 players at once. The controls are simple.... quick attack, heavy attack, jump, item, magic, block and item swapping. The combat is simple, fun and the enemy AI makes it more than a button masher. They will flank you and or shoot arrows when they can. It makes for some quick thinking. The art style is amazing and charming. Everything looks fantastic. The humor is charming and surprising at times. There are light RPG elements in the game that level up your character and you can assign skill points to them. Oh and ontop of that there is a world map to quickly find previous level. All of this is combine with a great soundtrack of good video game music you'll enjoy. This is worth your money and I often don't say that about games.			"

												Imma tell a story. So my cousin, brother and I we're goofing around on the Xbox then my cousin said while browsing the xbox store said this game looks cool lets try it! We bought it downloaded it and launched it. I was the Blue Knight my brother was the orange, and my cousin was the red. we got to lava world then me and my brother had to go. My brother and I pleaded our father to buy it too. We ended up convincing him, so we all three of us played it til wedding crash then my bro had to go. and me and my father got to Full Moon, then I had to go to my mom's. the next weekend I went to my dad's I convinced my little sister (5 at the time) To play castle crashers. And since then me and her played it soooooo much. then came when my brother got back into it, me and him were fire and ice like before, but im lvl 58 and hes lvl 61 we  both played to the final boss, turned out we were overleveled and it was too easy so we went to insane mode to die to the barbarian boss multiple times. He gave up on it, so I continued to play it alot with my sister. she now has lvl 70 posion knight and rn on the xbox cc im 98 ice knight. 3 Years later I got steam, and played it alot. And when I figured out Castle Crashers was on steam I freaked out. I've played it alot ever since, and still play it. This is my favorite childhood game 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10 I need friends to play this with that have skype please. XD :3			"

Brought to you by The Behemoth crew, Castle Crashers is a four-player hack ‘n’ slash three-dimensional side-scrolling title that rivals and is reminiscent of Dungeons and Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara…well, if it held a different tone. Castle Crashers retains a resonance with the cast of the game, featuring the likes of Dan Paladin, Will Stamper, and several others, and mashes comedy into the classic ‘your princess is in another castle’ story arch. This title features four base knights-green, blue, red, and orange-with varying powers, and adds Hatty Hattington to the roster if you own BattleBlock Theater for Steam; there are also twenty other unlockable characters as well as two purchasable knights, but I will speak further on the said two in a later section. Here are a few things that I find interesting about Castle Crashers:Leveling System - Players have to put in some work to level up, as experience is granted based more-so on enemies routed and hits connected than overall damage done. What I love about this take on level-ups is that it blends well with the player-versus-player elements, and allows the more tenacious ‘crashers’ to gain levels more frequently than those attempting to preserve health; the player-versus-player aspect will be explained in further detail next. As an individual knight gains a level, he has the opportunity to allot a gen number of points into four different traits: Strength, to determine the power of the knight’s attacks; Magic, which improves the knight’s magic attack maneuvers, spell effectiveness, and how much energy a spell utilizes on cast based on the total amount of energy; Defense, which dictates the knight’s health point total; and Speed, which determines how much damage the Bow item deals with each strike and, obviously enough, the individual knight’s movement. Combined with varying statistic-altering weapons, items, and pets, this leveling system permits players to create their own form of strategy.Forced Player-Versus-Player - Castle Crashers is a cooperative experience, so what could it possibly mean to ‘force’ players to combat against each other? At the end of each stage resulting in the liberation of a princess, only one knight may earn the kiss of valiance from the fair maiden. To effectively decide who is chosen, the players duke it out with all of their acquired abilities and equipment. Unlike most things in this title, a princess’ kiss does not grant any boons, bonuses, or additional equipment; however, it is very satisfying viewing the ‘saltiness’ on friends’ faces when you have stolen the embrace from their colored princess.Minigames - With various landscapes and degrees of difficulty between the stages, the campaign offers an abundance of cooperative play. But minigames are available to sweeten the deal. I must admit that I have not played too many of them, but the few that I have experienced-like beach volleyball-were so much fun to play with friends and online, win or lose.Humor - Simply put, from its theme to its plot twists and cutscenes, Castle Crashers is a title that will provoke, at the very least, a snicker. I feel as though I should refrain from revealing too much from this engaging title’s comedy approach as it is very well written. It can also be humorous when played with friends even at points when it is not necessarily meant to be; this is enhanced through splitscreen play.TL:DR - Castle Crashers is highly enjoyable, especially for fanatics of hack ‘n’ slash and cooperative titles, character leveling and building, and of The Behemoth’s previous title, BattleBlock Theater; speaking of, I also recommend-if you do not already own both games-the purchase of the bundle featuring Castle Crashers and BattleBlock Theater. I would also recommend the purchase of the Pink Knight and the Blacksmith downloadable content since proceeds are given to various charities. Whether solo or in cooperative play, with BattleBlock Theater and the downloadable content or not, Castle Crashers is a laughably good time. I had wanted to mention other notable features in this title such as its outstanding level design and themes, gameplay, and specific items but I feel as though I would be continuing on for days if I started. On a side note, I would like to mention that I will gladly play with anyone that owns this title or others. Simply add me on Steam and post the reason why you plan to add me on my profile. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews? Please visit my Curator Page at  Spearpoint Reviews	. "

												Castle Crashers looks like a standard beat-em-up game on the surface, but it's definitely more fun the average game of its type. original cartoony beat 'em up with a just dose of self-aware toilet humor.In Castle Crashers you and your friends play as one of four knights who set off an epic journey to find the princesses that have been kidnapped. Why they were kidnapped beats me, so there are a couple of plot holes. Should you care? Not really, because this game doesn't really focus on the plot in the first place.Each of these four knights have their own special ability that can be executed on the battlefield. You take your weapon, your shield, and your power, and you hack and slash through swarms of enemies and the occasional boss fight. Yes it has the potential to get boring, but I haven't reached that point yet.Throughout the game, you can discover and pick up new weapons and little pets to follow you around, all to be saved in a little shed that you can go back to to change up your stats. So it's your decision whether you want to destroy enemies with an epic vorpal sword or a slab of meat, and whether you want a tiny floating ram following you around or a tiny floating cat.Each time you play through this game with a different knight, you unlock another character to rip through enemies with, which does add to the motivation of playing.This game is very quirky. There will be moments in the background that make you look at it and say ""Did that just happen?"" in the ridiculous sense. These moments will even happen in the up close foreground. There are many moments that made me chuckle which made this game all the more appealing.The soundtrack is pretty badassIf you're looking for a coop game, local or online, definitely consider Castle Crashers. It was an enjoyable experience, but it's certainly one that requires you to play with others to be fully satisfied.100/10 MASTERPIECE!			"

-Quick Review-Castle Crashers is a side scrolling Beat 'em up developed by The Behemoth (A developer I'm falling deeper in love with) and released in 2012. -Detailed breakdown review-Story: Castle Crashers takes place in a cartoon Middle Ages universe. The knights are sitting around a table eating a feast, but suddenly an evil wizard steals a large gem, and runs off with four princesses! Being a knight, it is your noble duty to save the princesses, the kingdom, and retrieve the stolen gem.Queue Adventure!

Gameplay: The Castle Crashers recommends you use a controller, when you first launch the game. Anyone who knows me; knows I'm stubborn and refuse to purchase a controller for my computer. So... regarding the controller suggestion: Yes, it would be much easier on your progressing-carpal-tunnel. But, the game is completely doable with just a keyboard. (It's worth noting that the game key prompts on the menu and in game are actually for a controller; but again, you just get used to it)

The controls are pretty basic you have three types of attacks: light attack, heavy attack, and throw item. (you can unlock and use different combos between jumping, quick attacks, and heavy attacks) You also have a block button that slows you down, but if you time it correctly, it can literally save your character's life.As you progress through the game your character will gain experience points, money, animal orbs, and new weapons that you can purchase or will randomly drop off enemies. Your unlockables are accessible at the Blacksmith, and there are plenty of things to collect to keep you busy.Achievements: There are 12 achievements in Castle Crashers, this is one of those games that is relatively easier to get 100%. However, four of these achievements require playing with at least one other player. One achievement requires being in a four player game.There are only two achievements worth warning/note: Arena Master (Win 40 Arena Online Matches) and Glork (Win 20 All you can Quaff Online Matches). I won't lie, to earn these achievements, I ran between two computers. My brother was nice enough to be a punching bag, when he was away at work or school.Alternative strategy: Hit the fourms and see if anyone wants to trade off, you could do something else while you get beat up... …..likeeee Battle block Theater! link at bottom. :PPrice: Castle Crashers is priced at $14.99, for the amount of time you'll spend playing this game on your own, and with friends, that's a fair price. However if you're the first of your friends to play this game (unlikely... but who knows, maybe it's possible?) you should grab the 4-pack so you can play with 3 other friends. (Trust me, the game is even more fun with a friend)Conclusion: Story: Pretty stereo typical story line, but it's delivered hilariously and without any voiced/text narrative (bonus points) and with plenty of humor. Gameplay: Suggested controller, but doable with a keyboard alone, I won't pay for carpal tunnel treatment. Shush! Achievements: Fairly obtainable 100% without too much of a time commitment, but you will need another friend or three. Price: Fair, better with a sale, or buying a bundle deal on sale.All in all, this game appeals to anyone who might have enjoyed playing an arcade styled game, indie platformers, 2D, indie graphics, 4 player games, or just wants to support The Behemoth.


Same level, Same Sword, Yeah we're cool. :P (old screenshot taken in 2014)

												Yes, just yes.PROS:- Play with up to four people!- Crisp graphics- Multiple hours of gameplayCONS:- Same plot- Get this game on sale..If new adventures were added to this game + harder places to beat, this game would improve and gain more people buying it. Overall, this game is really fun and worth $15.00. I would recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have an extra game to play and only plays about two or three games. This game has nice challanges and achievements that you can unlock and it's great for parties.I rate Castle Crashers: 4.7/5 "

No worries, plenty of them to choose- 10 hrs playthrough (for 1 character); good playtime design for an indie casual adventure RPG- Many characters you can choose to play- 4 players in co-op- Both local and online- Make fun of me 'til very end of the game (=w=)""Cons:- You cannot play alone to get some achievements- Collecting every single weapon and pet is quite tired, you need ton of coins to buy them- Cannot play different characters on the same playthrough			"

												Castle Crashers is a coop, 2D/side scrolling hack n' slash game. Lots of levels, cool weapons and ADORABLE AS ♥♥♥♥ PETS. 4 starter characters that you can level up and build their stats the way you like. There's plenty of other characters to unlock after you finish the game. The animations are as pretty as they can get and sometimes the game is just plain hilarious. The game puts up a good challenge even in coop, you'll find yourself having to grind a bit after encountering some of the game's bosses/difficult levels.i recommend using a gamepad.Plus, any DLC you buy for Castle Crashers (2 available at the time) helps charity, how many developers do that, right? :)			"

												I was gifted this game by my boyfriend and so far it's been pretty entertaining. I didn't like the medusa boss, she moved very awkwardly and it was just kind of an annoying one to beat. Also, the pillars in the Sand biome, when you're going through the castle get in your way during battle. That was the most annoying part considering my boyfriend had to revive me without seeing the meter and i couldn't see my enemies majority of the time.I really like the wide range of weapons/pets & am hoping for armour to be added later.If you wanna get money really quickly I suggest beating the barbarian boss over and over (you get a load of gems and coins) or if you want exp one hit kills are pretty sweet if you wanna do it quickly (like the scorpions and in the sand biome, the barbarians before the boss and the alien minions on the space craft).Overall the game is about an 8/10 just because of those couple of annoying features and the fact that I've had to grind like a lil ♥♥♥♥♥ for hours to get high enough levels to progress.I'm not yet done but am really enjoying it so far.

												Sigh. Where do I start?Castle crashers is a jule for me, same with a lot of people. It dose have a repetive game though. Yet, Theres something just about the beat 'em up games that I loved, and I feel like this game puts it out there the most. With the wide choice of characters, there is almost no limit. Anyone with a love for the cartonny, yet dark humor, would adore this game. Words can not express how much time i've put into this game on the X-Box 360, and the soundtrack is Beautiful. Pros:Great community.Wide range of characters.Co-op.Soundtrack.Cons:Repetiteve.Lots of grinding in the works.Insane mode is almost impossible.I really do suggest this game, its also cheap. And screw Ice King. Wow is he annoying.			"

												Pretty great side-scrolling beat em' up. With an intriguing art style by Dan Paladin, and tight controls, Castle Crashers is a great experience, multiplayer or single player. What really makes the game special though is the multiplayer. If you do choose to buy it for single player, there still is a buttload of content, but it is endlessly entertaining to work together with friends to steam roll enemies. If this is your first time looking into this genre, you won't be upset. If you are a fan of side scrollers, or beat em' ups, I would definitely pick up this game.			"

												ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! This is one of the best games I have played in my life! Very fun with its 4-player co-op, amazing replayability, all around great time! If you are reading this, pick this and BattleBlock Theater up ASAP, as these are amazing!GAMEPLAY-The combos feel very smooth and easy to master, and I feel I get them at a good pace. Spine-crushingly difficult, but also fun- I do have the complaint that there are a lack of mid-level checkpoints. Bosses are intuitive and fun to fight.PRESENTATION-The art style, in Behemoth fashion, is cute and funny, as are the actual in game events. Special credits to the Thieve's Forest Level in humor!VALUE- I got this for 80% off during the sale, but even for 15 dollars this is good- you will spend 10+ hours for your first playthrough and 100+ as you replay with other characters. HUGE VALUE!POSTGAME-After you beat the game once, insane mode becomes available to play- 100% completion is obtained by beating the game  in insane mode with all characters. 62 playthroughs. SO MUCH TO DO!!In summary this is a great game- So much playtime, all of which is fun and enjoyable!			"

Introduction:Castle Crashers is a 2D hack and slash adventure game set in a cartoonish medieval world of knights, princesses and dragons  pooping animals. Your only goal is to rescue the four distressed princesses from formidable foes and earn their kisses as a reward. This game is best played with two to three other friends, a controller, and a box of pizza to share.Pros:-Over 30 unique characters and dozens of weapons to unlock and choose from.-Cheap DLC characters with proceeds going to charity.-Can be played on keyboard or a controller.-Wonderful cartoonish graphics and easy-to-learn gameplay.-Constant action and a simple levelling system.-Crude humour with poop jokes.Cons:-Game can get boring and repetitive after completion with multiple characters.-Lacks a high number of achievements for achievement-loving gamers.Overall:Castle Crashers is a fun game to play with friends and is a must-buy when on sale. It is simple and provides constant action throughout the story. Beating the game with certain characters unlocks other unique characters that all have their own pros and cons. With so many weapons, pets and characters to choose from, Castle Clashers is surely an enjoyable classic. My rating would be an 8/10.			"

												This game asks the dangerous question on everyone's mind:  What if Golden Axe had been written around poop jokes?It's a solid cooperative game in the vein of old arcade beat 'em ups with a cartoon feel and more than enough crude humour to go around.  Pick it up with BattleBlock Theatre in the bundle sometime!(Make sure the person with the best connection hosts, though; connectivity pauses the game frequently in multiplayer if you have someone with a spotty signal, but it will nearly always recover in a couple seconds rather than drop the connection.)

												This is one of the best co-op games you will ever play. The RPG elements are subtle, but very nice and combined with the leveling progression system provides a nice sense of progression. The art style is something to appreciate with its cartoonie elements. The game is a good length for an indie game not too long, but not too short. The bosses are challenging yet fun. Their is a comedy that is wrapped into the game that makes ot even better as you go through the story. The co-op is a amazing it was built just for co-op. I highly recommend this game it is the best indie game I have ever played.			"

												I absolutly LOVE Castle Crashers, been playing it since it came out on the Xbox 360 a good few years ago, recently purchased on steam and still holds up as one of the most entertaining games EVER!!!!.A great thing about it is my 5 year old Daughter can easily pick up the controller and play it, and boy does she love playing it, you should hear her shouting with laughter,if you are looking at it and thinking is it worth it? HELL YES, this is a game I give my ever refered 10/10, anyone who knows my reviews knows that I never give 10/10, the comical stylings of newgrounds is phenomenal.Do not delay any longer, get this game now, you will not be disapointed.

One thing I don't prefer though, is (lag, of course) that you cant invite someone into your game if the match is already up and running. You have to gather everyone up while still in the lobby.			"

												The game itself is fantastic! The humor, game play and the low price make it worth every penny. Unfortunately, the developers were a bit lazy making the port - When playing on a keyboard you will have no idea what you are doing. The game doesn't tell you how to play and the tutorials show the Xbone(xbox) controls, not the keys.Overall though, the game is damn near perfect. If you don't own a controller but don't mind 30 minutes of fiddling and clicking, the game is perfect for you. If you own a controller and can connect it to your PC...BUY THIS GAME NOW.One of the best indie games ever made hands down. It has it all. Fun medieval sword fighting against evil knights, monsters and strange creatures. Good graphics and addicting levels. Castle Crashers is best enjoyed through multiplayer. The game lets you enable voice chat for a more fun experience. I seriously think it's a powerful and engaging fighting experience, even if it is  cartoony.Plenty of replay-ability in this title also, with arenas and arcade modes available. 10/10 for me.			"

												Castle Crashers. It's one of those games that is best enjoyed together with friends but also very do-able on solo. In my case i can't say how much fun i had with this game whilst playing together with a friend on his playstation. The story is pretty easy to understand, the castle you live in is under attack by barbarians and the king has something stolen from him so it is up to the player(s) to get it back for his majesty. It's an arcade style adventure game where you will fight enemies along the way and every once in a while you can expect to be treated to a bossfight so be sure to gear up. Castlecrashers also has an awesome ingame soundtrack made by various users over at Newgrounds which set a proper athmosphere and to be honest can be very catchy.When it comes to leveling and items the game also comes with a level system (1 > 99) and during your playthrough you will find different weapons and items that will fit your playstyle and will unlock different skins with each their unique attacks and magic. There are also pets you can find in the world to aid you along your travels.Castle crashers is definitly recommendable. It comes with a normal mode and a very challenging hardcore mode so ye be warned.All the best!(s.i.e)			"

												Castle Crashers is a game that you have to be willing to put a few hours into. A MMO for gamers and professionals alike, you can pick 4 starting characters; Red Knight, with the power of lightning, Green Knight, with the power of poison, Blue Knight, with the power of ice, and my favorite, last but not least, Orange Knight, with the power of fire. As you beat the game with different characters you unlock more characters to play as, including Gray Knight, King, the Necromancer, and many many more.			"

												Played this game thoroughly on Xbox a few years ago, and it's still just as good as  a PC port years later. Any character can fufill the warrior, mage, and rogue archetypes, or you can go as a Jack-of-All-Trades master of all four character skills: Strength, Magic, Defense, and Agility. Not to mention, there's a huge selection of 80+ weapons and 20+ ""animal orbs"" (pet followers) with special attribute bonuses that make archetypes even stronger.There are a few levels, such as Lava World and Full Moon (at least for me) that can come as a pretty big challenge if you're not prepared, meaning a bit of grinding might be in store if you don't have friends to back you up. However, even the grinding isn't as tedious as other games, as you can potentially revisit past areas and pick up weapons and animal orbs you might have missed.The game is even more fun with a friend or two, cos why beat up a horde of enemies on your own when you can juggle them back and forth with a pal? However, the game lacks the same ""more loot per additional player"" mechanic that Borderlands 2 has, meaning that weapon, animal orb, and boss chest loot is often unfairly divided. However, the loot is not a large problem, since as long as you have a good sword that matches the build you're going for and enough money to buy some potions, you should be able to survive and thrive.The game is good for quick, casual fun with friends, and can also satisfy more gameplay-hungry players with it's ""Insane Mode"", which rescales the entire world so characters that have beaten the game can replay from the start (retaining any levels, skill points, weapons, and animal orbs you collected so far) with enemies that remain challenging.Overall, I highly recommend this game. It's suitable for all types of players, whether you play for 1 hour or 100 hours. Everything in the game feels good, from leveling up and developing your character's skills, to watching your collection of weapons and animal orbs grow with every cleared area, to finally beating that one boss that looked so threatening at first. Buy it, it's well worth the money.((also, if you do buy the game, get the two DLCs too. it's cheap, has good content, and 100% of the proceeds goes to non-profit good-will organizations))			"

												Castle Crashers is one heck of a fun game. I kinda did hate the whole price up thing but this sale has been the best one yet (I bought sooo many games). Anyway back to the review. It's a great game especially with friends. You can have up to 4 players and 2 is the least that is for multiplayer. If your doing your own game then you're on your own. I would do it with friends just because by yourself its really hard especially halfway through. The All you can Quaff game i think its called is so much fun. The arena fights is fun except for the thieves one just because they just keep on firing arrows when you're on the ground. But still a fun, hilarious game. Their was also the combat style: HACK AND SLASH! Just like the Devil May Cry series. And also the DLC. What can i say about it. You have 2 other players and 10 new weapons (5 for each). One of my favourite weapons for Pink knight is the lollipop. The blacksmith has also got great weapons. I would buy it if I were you because very addictive 10/10 for me			"

												Castle Crashers is an overall amazing game! Both the characters and storyline are very well thought out and drawn. If you are looking to purchase this game I recommend waiting untill it goes on sale because it becomes much MUCH cheaper. This is also a great game to buy for your friends as well since there is a co-op option availiable! But if you don't have any friends do not worry because there is also the option to play with other people online. (Whom you can make friends with) There are many levels to unlock (As well as new characters and weapons) and complete with a variety of fun challenges you must overcome. If it is on your wishlist currently I also recommend downloading the demo which actually allows you to play the first 4 or so levels of the game!			"

												Honestly, i can say that this is a game that i returned to over and over again to play. I played the Xbox version of it a lot and I can say whole-heartedly that this is a game worth the time and money, with each time playing through with a new character feeling like a fresh new start.

												Long story short: This is the best Beat 'em up I've ever played. Yes, even better than the Ninja Turtles one for SNES.To start off, I hate Beat 'em ups, because of their simplicity and repetitivness. This game is neither of these things. It has great level design, Upgradable characters and an RPG-like leveling mechanic.The story is as simple as indie games get, where you go around saving princesess and fighting bosses.Oh, the boss fights. They're loads of fun and are very varied, and aren't too much of a challenge.The multiplayer is fun and unlike most multiplayer games(New Super Mario Bros Wii), it's better to cooperate than to screw each other over.Although controllers are reccomended, they're not neccesary at all, and the PC controls are (by default) comfortable and easy to get used to.The game doesn't get boring after a LONG while, with most of your efforts post-story going into Maxing out your character stats(and having fun doing it).The DLC is only $1 a piece, with them adding new characters, weapons and animal orbs.There's no reason to not own this game if you're a fan of beat 'em ups, and wth the new refund system, trying out this game has never been more worth it.

												It's good, but it gets boring after....I'd say you beat the game once or twice, if you don't have anyone to play with. If you don't have anyone to play with at all, you're going to have a...somewhat boring time. The story is good, and can be completed anywhere from 3-13 hours for skilled players. The art style is unique and special, and the story is somewhat short. I definetly expected a lot more in the game and such, but unlocking characters and trying to beat the game with friends will keep you occupied for hours and hours to come. The more players, the better. Single player isn't really anything too good. You should buy it asap if you have other friends who play it, if you don't have any, then I suggest you wait for some friends to get it or buy the 4 pack and give it to friends.			"

												Castle Crashers is a fantastic game. Nothing beats side scrolling hack-and-slash fun. There dozens of characters, tons of weapons find, and pets to collect. Fight many bosses and level up to a maximum of 99 while inceasing your 4 skills, strength, magic, defence, and agility. This game offers a great challenge with insane mode which is unlocked after beating the normal mode. I have put many hours of my life into this game due its 4-player capability and variety. This game has been one of those I could always come back to every once and awhile and that's why I've been playing it since it was first released on the Xbox 360.10/10			"

												Castle Crashers is a hard hitting story about an old man getting his potatoe stolen. The game really starts to grab you in by the cajones when you unlockl the Pink Knight in the DLC. Once you get the Pink Knight the plot thickens, enemies get tougher, and princesses get uglier. I like the part where you tell someone to go away from where you are digging, you dig up the giraffe, and then he takes it. The excuse was ""I didn't know a giraffe was going to pop out of the ground"" as he was told to get away. But the moral of the story is, no matter how far or how long you travel, never trust a purple haired, downfaced, orange dress wearing princess.2.5/10 would crash again.			"

												Excellent, excellent game. I think what makes the game as good is its simplicity and yet nice variety. It does not have the depth of proper RPG games, and yet it offers the basic functions and symbolics :  personalities of the different characters (color, element etc), weapons with different characterics, leveling, possibility to create a mini ""builds"" (based on strength or magic or agility etc). The game is super adjustable. Each session is different. I love the possibility to change color and magic from session to session, when I play solo or with friends. A big thumb up for the Pink Knight, it gave me and my friends hilarious moments.  Also, the levels are sometimes pretty short, sometimes not, which allows for different types of gaming sessions, when you just want to have a short break for 15 up to 30 minutes, or when you wish to explore the aventure mode. You can play solo easily at first, but as you progress, you'll need to be cautious and understand the mechanics if you wish to succeed (many many ennemies and long bosses). It is MOSTLY recommended as multiplayer, so much on the screen, so much to do, combos... It's a massive source of FUN. Because that's what this game is about, fun. In its gameplay, design, sense of humor.			"

												tl;dr : Fight for yo right to thirst.Thirst, a concept known among all living organisms. It is a thing that lives among us in the most blatant of displays, or it can harbor itself within our deepest mental crevices. When the thirst is in it's most realest of forms, it can take the tightest chains of comradery and render them weak and rusty only to be snapped and scattered amongst the ground. Trek through forests, mountains, volcanos, deserts with your friends, conquer your enemies and vanquish every obstacle as a team with your fellow knights.

												TL;DR: A wonderfully silly and fun game, that is also challenging and rewarding. It's great by yourself and much, much better with friends. Would definitely recommend.Castle Crashers is a comedic beat 'em up game that incorporates silly content and solid gameplay to create a fun, classic, and heavily group-centred game. You traverse the land, beating the ever-living crap out of every enemy in your way. All the while, you're able to take in the hilarious atmosphere around you and excercise your level of completionism by hoarding money from your friends and grabbing as many pets and swords as possible. There will seriously be moments where you'll be taken back for a second to laugh and say ""I can't believe that just happened!"" In addition to the button-mashing combat that is fun and challenging, you can enchance gameplay with unique magic powers that every character has. Playing single-player is great, but the real fun comes from multiplayer. You fight each other indirectly for items and money, while at the same time really being on the same team when it comes to battling enemies. The game even has segments where you actually do fight each other, in arenas and when jockeying for a princess's kiss, which keeps playful competitions between you and your friends. At the end of it all, you truly feel accomplished and satisfied by working as a team.I would certainly recommend this game to anyone looking to play a game with their friends, the whole experience is wonderfully fun. Any negative points are honestly mitigatable, such as there being sub-par support for keyboard users which can be circumvented by using a controller or simply not caring. All in all, this is truly a wonderful game. Play it, and play it with friends.			"

												I'm usually not a fan of 2D indie games, but ""Castle Crashers"" is a blast. Smashing your way to victory with up to four players is extremely satisfying and it will take years to level up everything, adding a value to the game that will allow you to play for hours and hours without completing the levels exactly the same. The weapons and potions will hav you playing for hours collecting money and buying new swords that will allow you to beat missions faster and helps you gain more xp. Even if you are not sure about this game, TRY IT. It is one of the best games on Steam.			"

What's not to love?Positive:- Old school 2D beat-'em-up- Smooth, responsive controls- Great quirky humour - Very fair (you will often realize that getting hit or dying is your fault)- Plenty of collectables and characters to play- So much replay valueNegative:- Kind of short story modeConclusion:If you love 2D beat-'em-ups you will love Castle Crashers. I remembered when a much shorter and simpler version was released as a flash game years ago and I already loved it back then. I'm glad to see they actually made a full game around the same concept. There are so many things to do in this game if you are a completionist and it still continues to be fun. This is always the game I go to when I have friends over who do not necessarily play games. It's simple and entertaining enough for them to play and I do not feel frustrated if they struggle.A definite must-buy "

												You beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of almost literally everything in your quest to save the four princesses and retrieve the crystal for the king from some evil wizard dude. That's all you really need to know because who needs story? The gameplay takes care of that.Defs a game to invest in if you're looking for a blend of RPG and fighting, but actually just want fighting with slight RPG elements.  Gameplay is solid and plays smoothly. Artstyle is also something to appreciate. While sometimes the soundtrack would confuse me a little, mostly due to the whole era theme to the game, but then I remembered this was an action fighting game, and it didn't really need much to explain that.Overall, I would rate this game 8/10, because its beefy 'n' stuff :B			"

												This game is really fun!There are four (4) main characters to play as, the red knight, green knight, orange knight, and blue knight. The red knight's powers and abilities are lightning, the green knight's are poison, the orange knight's are fire, and the blue knight's are ice.There are many levels to complete to save the four (4) princesses from the evil wizard, Necromancer, and their allies and minions.You can unlock more characters to play as and upgrade through Insane Mode, going through the levels with the bad guys being WAY tougher.The highest level any character can reach is 99 (unless they added a higher level cap that I'm not aware of).My friend and I play it together. My friend uses the purple (blacksmith) knight, playable by downloading the Blacksmith pack DLC. I use the orange knight. Our characters are both high levels, (mine is 93 and theirs is 84)  though we still haven't beaten Insane Mode, why? it's insanely hard! xD Best played with four (4) very experienced players with (preferably) level 99 characters in multiplayer.Great game though! Very fun and partially addicting. :)			"

												Ow , this game is awesome.... When i saw the summer sales and Castle Crashers was only 3 euros  , i was like "" I need this game "" I mean who doesn't like to smash things in games like this and try to unlock new things like weapons , characters , pets etc. The graphics aren't realistics but still...       There are only 2 dlcs but the dlcs are awesome , you have new weapons , 2 new characters ( pink and purple ) with great skills . Purple ( blacksmith ) for example , his first skill is to summon a toad that deals some pretty damage and knock up and then you have these cool hammers spinning in the air throwing them at the enemies , and he's overpowered too.       If u like hack'n'slash games you will fall in love with this game . There are like 32 characters ( I'm not sure ) and a lot of bosses , you have arenas and if you complete one you will get a new characters :D , this game is epic and the first time you see the game you don't thing it's so good , but when you play it with your friends this game is very very fun.       Oh , and a thing , every character comes with his unic skills and a weapon ( more weapons in blacksmith's and purple's case )			"

												Absolutely amazing game. It has great gameplay with some amount of crude humor causing a overall more casual atmosphere, perfect for a couch co-op session. Some have called the combat repetitive and stale, but in my opinion, with great co-op games becoming rarer and rarer to find, sometimes a simple hack n' slash with some friends is really all you need. The game can get tedious in a journey to grind to 99 and obtaining all collectables, but coming back to the game every once in a while allows the enjoyment of this magnificent title to be stretched out as long as possible. One of the best co-op games out there.sidenote. Friends not included.			"

												Around 2 months or so I have been enjoying this game a lot. I did a run as the green knight and currently working on insane mode. I simply love this game for it's creativity on what appears to be a cliche ""rescue the princess"" game. The artist for the game just made this game very enjoyable, especially when you first start playing it. The flaw I have with this game is that it gets a bit repetitive. The combat system is nice and simple, heavy attacks and light attacks. Not to mention each knight has it's own magic. You gain combos for mele attacks and new magic attacks as you level up. Another thing I would like to mention is the Animal orbs, a.k.a pets. Each pet has its own special thing, it could be a stats boost, it could have a progectile attack. Who knows!?. Overall this game is amazing in my opinion.                                                  9/10			"

												With the exception of that one vollyball level and that damn dsylexic's nightmare game, I think this is a pretty swell game. Especially if playing with friends over discord. But then again everything is better with friends. ~generic positive review 2017			"

												This is an amazing game no matter on what platform you play this in. Wether you tackle this solo or gather up a bunch of friends and conquer the land you will have tons of fun. My favorite part are the pets with their passive skills that assist you throughout the game. If you have not played this yet I recommend you give this a try, be it magic or melee, go onwards and have fun.			"

												A good 4-player beat em' up to play with friends locally or around the world, with a little lag of course.Multiple characters to beat the game with so tons of replay value.Level your character up to level 99!4 skill trees that you can eventually max out by leveling.Pets to help you along the way.Tons of weapons and other things that make the journey to the queen's rescue a bloody fun time!

												It is a game about a bunch of dudes beating the life out of other dudes with some cheering princesses watching in the background for some reason.  This game blends together a mediocre combat system with an overuse of poop jokes and leaves the player feeling like the game was written by a bunch of kids in Middle School.  However flawed the game my be, it allows for a group of friends to play it with nearly no understanding of whats going on other than dudes need to be hit with stuff so you can save the day or something.  This once unique blend of indie magic leaves the player feeling like the game could have been a lot better if some obvious changes had been made as to how character progression worked, and reminds us why the Xbox is a failure as a platform for indie games that get ported to PC.  All in all the game did not disappoint too greatly and thus it earned a hearty 3/Not Borderlands 2.			"

												Castle Crashers, what can be said about this game oh yeah it totally addicting to old and new gamers. The story actually has 2 parts. The 1st part is a wizard takes a giant crystal from the king and flies off with it. The 2nd part is actually more interesting since you wont really care a lot about the 1st problem, a group of barbarians kidnap the king;s '4' daughters. This game is a action, adventure and a hack and slash. You must fight waves and waves of enemies to progress through the level. If you are playing multiplayer, there will be more enemies, have more hp and when you beat the boss with a princess, you duel to see who gets a kiss from her.There are a vareity or sword you can pick up in this game and every sword change your stats or give you a chance to freeze/burn/critical/poison your enemies.There are also pets that give you a small bonus making it useful. There is a leveling up system in this game and every level you get, you can rank up your stats for either Strength,Magic,Defense and Agility. There is over 25 characters to unlock which can be a pain to do since most of them require to beat the game with a certain character and they all have diffrent magic so choose wisely.I give this game 9 out of 10 due to the communications when someone else wants something that you dont want.

												Cute, adorable, fun.Too difficult for singleplayer though. your best bet is to play with 4 players.However, with that being said, the difficulty stays the same, no matter the number of players.This makes it very hard for singleplayer, and too easy for 4 players.They should therefore adjust the difficulty.This game is mainly okay, but there are some small tweaks it needs.

												Castle Crashers is one of my favorite games for when you have guests over, it is up there with smash brothers. The perfect balance of ""my first rpg"" with "" beat em up"" makes for an addictive experience. I saw it was on steam and had to get it. I did have one concern going in to the steam version, how would the couch co-op be done on the PC version? Some of you are probably laughing that I had this concern( or at my awful spelling due to my dyslexic writing habits) but keep in mind that there was a dark time before steam when PC games blew chunks, look at any PC game from 2007 to 2011. Just like how steam fixed the PC gaming market, newer games on steam are easier to use. Castle crashers supports up to four players at any time like it's console counter parts. Just for the love of gawd don't use the key bored, that is the only negative I can say about this version is that if you like games to support mouse and key bored, stay away from this game. The amazing game play, awesome visuals and stellar co-op makes this game a must own, but i will say since the price of the game is the same as the PS3 version, that is the better port. The steam version does hold up well and is a good addition to anyone's steam library. 9/10			"

												A classic game that really does require a controller/pad. Get together with 3 friend or power through by yourself. This game is cute, challenging and 100% funny! An absolute must have if I do say so. If you have played previous games from the makers of this game (For example; Alien Homind) you will see that they do carry on their previous ideas and even add to the game with them. You start off with 4 knights, but you unlock many more as you carry on. Each have their own spells and each level seperately and go through the story seperately. Graphics are cartoony, but they suit the game perfectly. Even if this game is old, it's still one you will continue to play and I don't ever seeing this being one of those ""Games of the past"" because when you do think back to it you'll end up saying ""Let's just go on it for old time's sake!""Although I do recommend getting it on sale, I wouldn't have too much of an issue if I paid £9.99 for it. I got it for 90 pence during one sale and don't know how I got by without it! One thing that is worth mentioning, when you unlock new weapons and pets (There are pets with indivual buffs/talents), they unlock for all characters! So there is no real repetitive grind with this game. Truly a game you can always go back to.Should you get bored too, see if you can't button bash harder than your friends in the ""All You Can Quaff"" mode! Bash X and Y as fast as you can to eat as much as you can as quick as you can! Finish all the plates before your friend and gain your very own boasting rights! (Terms and conditions apply. Pain in the hand is a known side affect. All rights reserved. Don't see online for details.)This game really does speak for itself and one of my most highly reccomended games.			"

												**AT THE TIME OF THIS REVIEW, I COMPLETED ONE PLAYTHROUGH ON NORMAL, SO SOME POINTS COULD BE MISSED**Castle Crashers, developed by indie devs The Behemoth, became famous at the release of one of the top selling games on XBLA, Castle Crashers. It was highly praised by many and lots of my friends used to play and were obsessed with the game. I wasn't much of an Xbox guy at the time, and therefore did not buy it. After four years of castle crashing, it was finally released on PC. Then, over a year later, I decided to give this game a whirl and bought it. I must tell you, I was very impressed.I'll start with the visuals. I actually enjoy the graphics in the game, taking a rather simple style. It doesn't get all artsy like Braid and Bastion, nor does it get too realistic like Crysis. It sits in the middle, and I'm happy it doesn't have graphics like that. Not all indie games need to be artsy and heavily story based platfomers or whatever. For the most part, I do like the visuals this game offers.Now, I'll move to the gameplay. This is probably the first reason Castle Crashers is so awesome. It's a beat-em-up game, so let me make this clear: THE ENEMIES ARE TOUGHER THAN THEY SEEM. Be warned when buying this if you're looking for a simple, kill-this-guy-quick kind of game. You WILL be dissappointed. The gameplay is simple, yet challenging.  I didn't discover any horribly unbalanced weapons, which makes the game even better. Bosses are usually quite easy, but there are a few notorious bosses in the game to look out for, none of which are extremely hard. One other thing this game has is an arena where you can duel it out with friends or fight groups of enemies. I love the gameplay, but not the best part to this  game.Story time, kids! I have very little to say for the story. Repetitive and cliche, but adds some unique twists to the generic ""kill the wizard and save the princess"" kind of style.Audio is good mostly, but could be fine tuned so there are some more individual boss themes, like most of the bosses besides the final boss. I could be incorrect, but for some of the major bosses, it was a simple theme, while others didn't even have a theme at all!Now for the best part about this game: The replayability. After you beat a short campaign (which is actually necessary in this case) then you can beat it as another character. You can unlock the 28 Animal Orbs, the 30 characters, and then beat the game with all of them, then you can go to insane mode after completion. You can also find all of the weapons to this game, play All You Can Quaff, which is a food eating game or something like that, Arena, which is simply a battle arena, and maybe help a few newbie friends or anyone in the CC community that is new or even a veteran. On average, most of my friends who play with me have usually 200 hours, and they only have one or two level 99 characters. Quite a bit of content here, so there is about 500 hours, maybe tops, if you're extremely dedicated to doing everything this game has to offer. Kind of surprising for me, even for this kind of game.Just a few flaws I want to point out: The shield is pretty clunky and is pretty difficult and annoying to use. Also, because this is a PC port, it seemed a bit rushed and only showed the buttons for an Xbox 360 controller. One other issue I found is that the multiplayer can be quite laggy, and can ruin multiplayer experiences sometimes. However, that isn't too frequent for me.Overall, Castle Crashers is an amazing game that I cannot stop playing. I highly recommend this game, and I'm always willing to play with you guys. Add me if you want to play!

It is best enjoyed through online multiplayer with friends. A must that I suggest to anyone.			"

												So. This game was released on XBLA in 2008, PS3 in 2010, and only came to us computer-type gamers in 2012. I'd heard so many good things for those four years, whenever castle crashers came up. People gushed. You know what?They were right.It's still charming. It's still fun. And it's still one of the best games to play with your friends when you're bored. Boss battles are often repetitive. Poop jokes get old. But the ridiculousness and the artistry and the hitty-hitty-whomp-kapow are all super fricken great, from the get-go and still twenty hours later. If you liked beat-em-ups back in the day-- your double dragons, your streets of rage, your golden axe-- buy this. And if you don't have friends who already own it? Buy a fourpack. Make three friends.And in the immortal words of Tatsu: ""Go. Play.""			"

 Castle Crashers Review  PROS -  Very fun and unique Is also a good Co-op game Good for all ages Stunning and Unique Graphics Amazing music Some sort of humour is in it CONS -  Its just button mashing Keyboard controls ( However it does recommend a controller ) Sometimes it gets just to hard and isnt fun Some bosses are repetitive Overall Review Castle Crashes is very fun and is better with friends. Although the cons may seem incredibly bad, remember that this game is currently overall 'Overwhelmingly Positive' (2017) and is a port from the Xbox 360. I think game is great and definetly worth its price. Its unique and has nice touch to the hack 'n' slash genre.			"

												""Hack, slash, and smash your way to victory in this award winning 2D arcade adventure from The Behemoth!"" -Castle Crashers. If you're finding a really cute game, here's another one. c:Things go best in Co-op mode with friends, the weapons, upgrades, those things makes you play some more.This is just like Spiral Knights, but this one's not graphically demanding. Affordable in any computers, even ya had a super low-end.This is like, Assassin's Creed:Unity set in the Middle Ages: Third Crusade. xD Love this game. You better grab it, you're gonna like it. VerdictThe good:-Green Knight's cute-Red Knight's cute-Blue Knight's cute-Yellow Knight's cute-The default Knight's cute-Pretty cartoony graphics-Awesome powers-Awesome combat-Cooperative gameplay-All you can quaff-Cute and amazing soundtrack-You can mount the king's horse, and take it around like it's yours and make em' walk!The Bad:-Sometimes, I find the combat really hard when enemies are in large numbers. Well at least by now.-Checkpoints way too far sometimes.-Kissing of the 4 princesses. xD-The Ugly:-Faulty Internet connection-Every animal is pooping9.8/10 "

												It's a 4 Player medival Beat-em-up set in a comedic medival setting, let's get this out of the way, it's a port from XBLA, meaning it WILL tell you the XBOX controlls, and it WILL tell you to use a controller.The game is fun, but since there are only 2 attack buttons it gets redundant fast. Much like with borderlands 2, the story is just too repetitive and they have too many characters to play it as. I guarantee you 1 playthrough of this should be enough to quench your thirst.I'm not saying it's a bad game, the thing about it is just that the only replay value it has is with it's 3000 extra characters, but think about that, would you want to sit at your computer for hours a day as each character trying to get them to level 99? of course not.The game is good though, and it does have some minigames, but expect to lose at them.i give it a 6.5/10.

												This game is simply AMAZING.You pick a character of your liking, finish the game with him and unlock new characters + Insane mode for the character you finished the game with. You got bored repeating the story mode with your usual weapon and animal orbs? Simple, go on a quest to get them all! The Animal Orbs are helpful (and some have secret effects) which will make your playthroughs with new characters far more easier and fun!Considering weapons, there are alot to choose from. Some are hidden, some are picked up from monsters and some are just given after boss fights. There is a variety of weaponary to choose from. Also, you can get a bow and a boomerang (which is hidden and a special pet is required to get it) to boost up your combos and kill everyone with style.The story of the game is quite fun and interesting. Though I warn you the game is not that long, (about 2 hours max) but you have to keep in mind that you will be repeating it for a great amount of time if you want to unlock new characters. (Some are given when you beat arenas SOLO)My final opinion:This game is WORTH BUYING. On sale it's usually 50% or 75% off which makes it more worth the money. If you like fighting, unlocking new play methods and rewards, THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!			"

												Wow. This game is sheer awesomeness. After having played Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers I will vouch for any game that Newgrounds and The Behemoth launches, like BattleBlock Theater which I haven't yet played. For those of you who absolutely loved SNES beat'em up games you're in for a treat! Buy it, you won't regret it.			"

												This game is so stupidly fun it should be illegal. It's a pretty simple game, fun for 4 players, or fun for only 1. Its the sort of game you can play forever, because there are so many different play styles with all the characters different magic types, and all the different weapons you can get, and the story is just silly. The boss fights are all actually pretty enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this, it is SO worth the $15. I would also recommend the DLC Characters, Pink Knight and the Blacksmith. $0.99 each, really good play style, and 100% of the money goes to charity. How great is that?			"

												It's a great game to play with your friends. It's defiantly better with a controller. So if you don't have one you wouldn't be getting the full experience. It's also kinda fun by yourself but the downside is you'll be wanting to level up because with friends you can do harder levels with co-op so you should get your friends to play with you as many times as you can with this game. I have not used the keyboard controls so I cannot say they are good or bad. If you have a controller for your PC and almost never use it or need a game that you want to use your controller for get this game. I forgot about the story, it's funny more than serious so keep that in mind. It's pretty solid but if you are fighting your friends it's kinda weird when you are an inch above them and not hitting them. 9/10			"

The gameplay and controls are very appealing along with the graphics. It doesn't require a very good computer either. Mine personally is from 2007 and it runs like a dream.

												Swords, twigs, cute animals, magic, slicing & dicing; What isn't to love about this game?I absolutely love that its an arcade game, it's something I can play casually, and the modern side scrolling sort of feel kinda gives me the nostalgia of playing games on the old nintendo systems! It's not a true side scrolling game, but it still has the feel of it! I also love the comedy in it, I can't say how many times I've died, laughing at the hilarious things found in this game! I definitely give it a thumbs up and recommend it to everyone!			"

												I remember back then when i played this game around 2009 in Xbox 360, one of my first and best indie games i have ever played. Excellent fluid gameplay that stands up to multiple playthroughs. It's filled with humor added with some blood and gore to the mix with its Beat Em Up gameplay style, level up system which adds a bit more depth to the overall gameplay experience as you can increase your stats or learn new attacks. The game also provides a great multiplayer experience with up to 4 players who can engage to the main campaign which comes in two difficulty flavors or duke it out in a arena type PvP style mode. Play as different types of characters with their own magic style, it's pretty a lot of great humor added throughout the game and Nostalgic Beat Em Up Genre and finally.. Decent plotline. Overall! It's a great Indie game Beat Em Up that contains with RPG and Action, i recommend this game for people who are interested with Beat Em Up and Hack and RPG with Action.Rated: 9.3/10			"

												An old-school beat'em up, where you have to save princesses, by first freeing them and then getting a kiss from them. 10/10 for originality.Graphics - If you have watched any of the 90's - early 20's cartoons, you are going to fall inlove with the graphic style of this game. As a person who grew up watching cartoons, everything I see has a mixed combination of new and nostalgia.10/10Music - Boy does the music in this game have a wide variety of emotions, from the melodical and calm one that is playing while you are just moving on to the powering up it does the moment you enter a fight. Overall the place and time for every single song is perfect. 10/10Cinematics - It does have quite a few cinematics, most of them are to introduce a level or a boss, but still you won't see a one that copies the other, every single one is unique. I have to add most of them are quite funny, 10/10Story - A pretty basic story, go there, save that, get a kiss, easy as that. The but the comedical depth it adds is just tremendous. the story is mostly told through text bubbles, either way your going to see the funny side in the text or through their action. 10/10Content -  The game lacks nothing, enough enemy variations to keep yourself interested, a wide variety of weather types, random things that happen on the screen. No matter how much you play, you wont be able to predict what a person will say or do. 10/10Controls - You can play on either mouse+keyboard or controler (I recommend the controler). Both of them are fluid and responsive. 10/10Gameplay - A really fun experience, but best played with friends, even by playing alone you are punishing yourself, by what you are missing if you have 4 players and that it is really hard for 1 player. That is either the game really does get way too hard for 1 player or that I am a bad player (the second). 10/10Just the perfect game in my opinion, it gets every single thing it strives to get right, from the littlest detail to the biggest of ones. I strongly recommend playing with friends, either buy it for them (that won't happen),  make them buy it themselves (still won't happen) or buy it for your pet bear (most probable). I would like to add why the hell do you have a bear pet, but hey that is life.Overall score: 10/10			"

												Castle Crashers is exactly what you expect it to be. Its a really fun beatemup for both couch and online co-op and even single playthroughs. It is not a huge game but the replayability is great if you have your friends on board since there are enough achievements to keep you motivated and tons of weapons and characters to unllock. There's even a harder game mode if you are up for a challenge. Overall i think this game is a must buy for everyone looking for a fun beatemup with great controls and gameplay. 9/10			"

												An evil wizard steals a large, mystical gem from the king of an unnamed empire, as well as kidnapping its four princesses. The king sends the four brave knights that spearhead his guard into the vast land to rescue the princesses, recover the gem, and defeat the evil wizard. Unfortunately, the knights first have to contend with an army of barbarians storming the king's castle as the wizard makes his escape.Castle Crashers is a gem among the endless onslaught of casual games available on Steam. It has its flaws, of course, but when all the elements are considered, it makes for a fantastic, ""I'm bored, let's play"" sort of game that you could very well find yourself coming back to again and again.The game is a side-scrolling, linear beat-'em-up, with a silly plot, very apt character design, and great handling in terms of gameplay. When you begin, you take control of one of four knights, each with a unique elemental affiliation; the Green Knight wields deadly poison magic, the Orange Knight pyrokinetically commands fire magic, the Blue Knight freezes enemies with ice magic, and the Red Knight shocks his foes into submission with electric magic. As you progress, more characters are unlocked and thusly become playable, most of which are enemies you will face on your journey. However, replaying the game as a new character gets tiresome if done in excess. Regardless, the wide array of playable characters allows you to find one you like. I adore games that allow for this,The gameplay handles well, with a great capacity for combo attacks. Chaining melee attacks of varying strengths, ranged arrow attacks, and magic blasts aptly is the key to victory. Get surrounded, though, and constant attacks will quickly see you beaten down. Drink potions to restore health, or revive fallen comrades with first aid practices. Level up and enhance your knight in one of four fields: power, defense, agility, and magic. Find new weapons with varying properties that can either complement your knight's strengths or cover for his weaknesses. Animal orbs serve as companions and can provie passive benefits, so find as many as you can! The amount of additional goodies you can find is staggering, and it allows you to further set yourself apart amongst your group.The multiplayer mode makes this very enjoyable, and since the level-up mechanic is based on hits landed, a player playing through alone from the start would be on even grounds with a group of four playing through from the start for most of the game. Multiplayer also greatly increases your chances for survival, as potions are used automatically and players can revive fallen comrades. It's a lot more fun to play with a friend or two.The art style is adorable and hilarious, and it offers a lot of laughs. A forest filled with lovable critters that are inclined to soil themselves is not to be overlooked. There are a bunch of little things that make this game that much more charming, and that's partially why I love it so much.The game does have its flaws, though. Some of the bosses have frustrating attack methods that is countered by almost nothing. The Conehead Groom boss, for instance, can be either exploited into submission or result in you being swiftly beaten down without a chance to heal. This is also an Xbox 360 port, so the game even insists you use a controller. A keyboard is usable, but it's very awkward and sometimes more trouble than it's worth. The game can, for some, degenerate into ""run forward, mash buttons, run forward again."" In that case it simply may not cater to you.Those aside, I adore this game and it's always great to come back to, especially with friends.			"

												This is a great game with a fun yet easy concept. I was able to pick it up fairly easily though it's rather hard if you don't have a controller. Luckily my friend helped me a lot. Overall a great game to play with friends. A game that I would gladly play until midnight again. 11/10			"

												I don't have a lot of playtime on Steam but instead on my Xbox were I would say I have played at least 30+ hours with multiple playthroughs. All I can say is to make the game fun you will need the following: 1: A controller.2: One or more friends.3: Time.With these three ingredients you'll have loads of fun while being on an epic adventure throught the great lands of Castle Crashers. It is really fun, challenging and satisfying with a simple yet effective artstyle. It may get a bit repetitive when you start your second playthrough but the gameplay always feels great.			"

												Excuse the low hours, this is my third time buying this game. Castle Crashers is a classic. It's a fun enough game in singe player, with the variation in different spells across a very large roster of (mostly unlockable) characters, but the game mostly shines in multiplayer. If you want a good sidescrolling beat 'em up and have at least one (of the possible four) friend ready for co-op, Castle Crashers is a fantastic choice.			"

												Castle Crashers is a indie game developed by The Behemoth and is a 2D beat em up videogame that has got a minimal amount of RPG mechanics. There is minimal story and it is no reason to buy the game as it is basically just evil wizard kidnaps 4 princesses and a gem and the king sends you to save the princess's and bring the gem back. On the way you fight Barbarian's, Thieves, Trolls, A faction of knights, fire demons, pirate-ninja's and the evil wizard's minions beyond other things. The game features characters which you choose to play. You have 4 characters unlocked by default and along the way you can unlock more by completing certain stages, finishing solo arena's or finishing the game with certain characters. Many of the enemies you fight along the way can be unlocked to play as although this does not affect the enemies at all. Each character has the ability to use a melee weapon, a bow and magic. While many characters bows are just changed cosmetically and weaponry can be found and equipped instead of being character bound barring a certain character they all have magic that is unique to only a couple or even just one character. As a example the Orange knight's magic is a fire type while the Red Knight uses lightning and unlockable characters can have magic ranging from random weapons, to sawblades or nature magic. The game features a levelling in which each character is levelled seperately with a maximum level of 99. Upon levelling up each character can assign a stat point to one of the following:Strength: which increases damage dealt by the characters melee weapons.Agility: which affects the damage and speed of the bow along with the speed of the character themself.Defense: which affects the health of the character as well as his resistance to enemy attacks. Magic: which increases the damage dealt by the characters magic attacks as well as unlocking new magic moves to use.It is entirely possible to max a characters stats at around level 78 leaving 11 more levels. One thing to note is that you do NOT gain exp on kills but instead you gain exp each time you hit a enemy. You cannot juggle a dead enemy in the air for exp and neither does damage affect how much exp you get from a hit.Combat is simple in Castle Crushers with 2 melee attacks, one bow attack and up to about 3-4 different magic attacks. The game is also able to have more strategy ablied to it like the timing of juggling a enemy to keep them off the ground and unable to hit you. Standard enemies in Castle Crashers usually consist of enemies that have the same kind of moves as your knights which can include magic and bows depending on the enemy type. Most standard enemies can be juggled with enough practice which is a efficient way to deal with them. Along the way towards the evil wizard you will encounter buffed up or 'Beefy' versions of enemies who no longer consist of the move sets of you during your standard form. These enemies have got more hp than there standard versions and can be impossible to juggle sometimes. They have multiple attacks that include grabbing you and either throwing you at another player in co-op or just throwing you away during singleplayer. Then you encounter boss's which are usually signified by a HP Bar in the top center of the screen. These enemies are tough and mostly have unique attacks that are un usable by other enemies and yourself. They can also vary in there appearance with a cyclops or a giant barbarian.The items of Castle Crashers come in the forms of Bombs, Potions, Sandwichs and animal orbs. Potions are your standard fantasy potion which when used they refill your health fully. Bombs are placed on the spot you are and have a fuse. Upon detonating they will damage anything within their radius including you. Sandwichs are a special consumable which when eaten turns you into a 'Beefy' version of your character. During this state you have different attacks and can also remove obstacles that can only be removed by being in a 'beefy' form. Animal orbs are a kind of creature or animal that will follow you around and while equipped will grant you a buff ranging from stat increases, to finding food for you or even increasing the amount of exp that you earn. A animal orb stays with you until you take another animal orb with you. Upon doing that you will be able to find the animal orb in a building next to the blacksmith's frog. Animal orbs have to be unlocked by finding and equipping them.This game is mainly a co-op title with optional pvp in the arena and not so optional pvp whenever you save a princess. However the game is completely playable and finishable solo and i would still recommend it even if you have no friends that are interested or own the game. One notice of warning however is that during co-op if one person is lagging it can either cause the entire game to pause with a waiting for players notice or it can desync players which can cause players to be up to different parts of the mission and see each other doing different things. As an eample during one level me and 2 friends were fighting mobs when i started to get laggy. It seemed to pass but we got desycned which meant that while on my screen they were running around and hitting mid air while i was fighting mobs they were actually fighting the boss that was past the mobs and i was the one not contributing. A quick fix would be to just exit and re-enter the game and maybe restart the lobby.Castle Crashers has 3 gamemodes: Campaign which can be played Solo or Co-op, All you can quaff which is a gamemode where you and 3 other players/AI have to mash certain keys to quickly eat the food and whoever eats all their portion of the food first wins and finally the arena which has got multiple gamemodes in it which include standard pvp with up to 4 players and a mode where you vs each other in trying to amass the most amount of gold by digging up treasure, during this you cannot use melee, bows or magic alothough you can whack the other player by digging with the shovel underneath them. There are two other gamemodes in arena however i have not played as much arena and as such cannot remember them.This game has got a moderate amount of replayability when you first finish it if you want to unlock all the animal orbs and can have even more if you plan on unlocking all characters. However to get to level 99 is repetitive as you would have most likely finished all the area's multiple times and have gotten sick of it.Finally i would say that i definitely recommend this game if your a fan of 2d beat em up with a tiny bit of rpg meshed in and that although they recommend using a Xbox 360 controller to play i find it perfectly fine using a keyboard for it although the button prompts only being in Xbox 360 controller layout is a bit of a paint although it can be overcome.

												This is a nice, fluid, beat-em-up game that is surprisingly addictive. First of all, this game focuses on combat. It only makes sense that this is what the game exceeds at. It offers classic melee combos intertwined with magical onslaughts and slick bow-shooting. As a result, the combat is never boring and keeps you eager to bash skulls all around. The other aspects of the game are pretty decent. The gameplay never lags, the story is shallow yet fun, and the cartoon-like graphics provide scenery that isn't detailed enough to distract you from the gameplay.All in all, I'd recommend it to the casual gamer who wants a little reprieve from the more strategical high-end games available.

												This game is simply AMAZING.You pick a character of your liking, finish the game with him and unlock new characters + Insane mode for the character you finished the game with. You got bored repeating the story mode with your usual weapon and animal orbs? Simple, go on a quest to get them all! The Animal Orbs are helpful (and some have secret effects) which will make your playthroughs with new characters far more easier and fun!Considering weapons, there are alot to choose from. Some are hidden, some are picked up from monsters and some are just given after boss fights. There is a variety of weaponary to choose from. Also, you can get a bow and a boomerang (which is hidden and a special pet is required to get it) to boost up your combos and kill everyone with style.The story of the game is quite fun and interesting. Though I warn you the game is not that long, (about 2 hours max) but you have to keep in mind that you will be repeating it for a great amount of time if you want to unlock new characters. (Some are given when you beat arenas SOLO)My final opinion:This game is WORTH BUYING. On sale it's usually 50% or 75% off which makes it more worth the money. If you like fighting, unlocking new play methods and rewards, THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!			"

												The first thing you need to know about this game is that it's short. Max time to beat the main story is 15 hours. Now, this would make it kind of terribe, as the levels are repetitive but, ovbiously, it has great 100% comp. value. I made it a personal goal to unlock all weapon, charecters, and ect. I'd say with this accounted for, one could easily get about 45+ hours out of this. Castle Crasher doesn't have to be like this though, compleating the story alone is worth the money. Buy this game, and tell your buddies to do the same!			"

												Extremely funny game, specially with multiple players to share the laughter of... pretty much everything!Everything in this game is meant to cause some chuckles, from the animations, sounds, bosses and even the storyline.The gameplay is a bit retro, 2D mash-to-win (similar to Streets of Rage), but with plenty of weapons and adorable petsto collect (Gotta Catch'em All, anyone?). There are also some basic RPG elements, like stats and level-ups, andsometimes some grinding is advised before moving to certain areas, but nothing unreasonable.The game has a lot of levels and variety, but they're pretty short and once the game is finished, there's little to doexcept the aforementioned collecting. The online modes are pretty weak, just stick to 'coop' the main game.Recommended to those looking for simple gameplay and story, and want little depth but a lot of fun in their game!			"

Its the sort of game you can play forever, because there are so many different play styles with all the characters different magic types, and all the different weapons you can get, and the story is just silly. The boss fights are all actually pretty enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this, it is SO worth the $15. I would also recommend the DLC Characters, Pink Knight and the Blacksmith. $0.99 each, really good play style, and 100% of the money goes to charity. How great is that?			"

In 1080p it looks like glass, I will never buy a console again just having laptops in reach. Still great to this day, the music is unforgettable and the game is pretty long per character. 5 star			"

												Castle Crashers is funny, thrilling and challenging. It has a ton of unlockable charactes, weapons and cute animals florbs which makes you want to play it again and again. Whether you play it with friends or solo-style you can be sure that you'll have fun.			"

												An evil wizard steals a large, mystical gem from the king of an unnamed empire, as well as kidnapping its four princesses. The king sends the four brave knights that spearhead his guard into the vast land to rescue the princesses, recover the gem, and defeat the evil wizard. Unfortunately, the knights first have to contend with an army of barbarians storming the king's castle as the wizard makes his escape.Castle Crashers is a gem among the endless onslaught of casual games available on Steam. It has its flaws, of course, but when all the elements are considered, it makes for a fantastic, ""I'm bored, let's play"" sort of game that you could very well find yourself coming back to again and again.The game is a side-scrolling, linear beat-'em-up, with a silly plot, very apt character design, and great handling in terms of gameplay. When you begin, you take control of one of four knights, each with a unique elemental affiliation; the Green Knight wields deadly poison magic, the Orange Knight pyrokinetically commands fire magic, the Blue Knight freezes enemies with ice magic, and the Red Knight shocks his foes into submission with electric magic. As you progress, more characters are unlocked and thusly become playable, most of which are enemies you will face on your journey. However, replaying the game as a new character gets tiresome if done in excess. Regardless, the wide array of playable characters allows you to find one you like. I adore games that allow for this,The gameplay handles well, with a great capacity for combo attacks. Chaining melee attacks of varying strengths, ranged arrow attacks, and magic blasts aptly is the key to victory. Get surrounded, though, and constant attacks will quickly see you beaten down. Drink potions to restore health, or revive fallen comrades with first aid practices. Level up and enhance your knight in one of four fields: power, defense, agility, and magic. Find new weapons with varying properties that can either complement your knight's strengths or cover for his weaknesses. Animal orbs serve as companions and can provie passive benefits, so find as many as you can! The amount of additional goodies you can find is staggering, and it allows you to further set yourself apart amongst your group.The multiplayer mode makes this very enjoyable, and since the level-up mechanic is based on hits landed, a player playing through alone from the start would be on even grounds with a group of four playing through from the start for most of the game. Multiplayer also greatly increases your chances for survival, as potions are used automatically and players can revive fallen comrades. It's a lot more fun to play with a friend or two.The art style is adorable and hilarious, and it offers a lot of laughs. A forest filled with lovable critters that are inclined to soil themselves is not to be overlooked. There are a bunch of little things that make this game that much more charming, and that's partially why I love it so much.The game does have its flaws, though. Some of the bosses have frustrating attack methods that is countered by almost nothing. The Conehead Groom boss, for instance, can be either exploited into submission or result in you being swiftly beaten down without a chance to heal. This is also an Xbox 360 port, so the game even insists you use a controller. A keyboard is usable, but it's very awkward and sometimes more trouble than it's worth. The game can, for some, degenerate into ""run forward, mash buttons, run forward again."" In that case it simply may not cater to you.Those aside, I adore this game and it's always great to come back to, especially with friends.			"

												Castle Crashers is one of the best co-op games that i have played yet. This game is a button mashser so take note if you son't like that type of games. I really like the graphic style that looks like a cartoon. You start out with 4 different characters that look almost the same but are yet so different. They each have some type of magic that you can use. The blue one uses ice, the yelow one uses fire, the green one uses poision/poison gas and the red one (the one that i use) uses lightning. You can level each one of these characters up individually and everytime you level up you get some skill points that you can speend on stenght, magic power, health/defence and agility. The strenght upgrade let's you dish out more damage, the magic power will make your magic more powerfull and give you new magic tricks, the helth/defence one gives you more health and defence (duh..) and the agility one makes you faster and do more damage with your bow. The bow is one of the items that you can get others include a boomerang, a shovel, a health poition (up to 5), a super sandwich (up to five, a bomb (up to 5) and some quest items. On your quest to save the kingdom from an evil wizard you can have a flying pet following you. These pets will give you a variety of boosts like helping you level up faster, hit some of the enemies, helping you find new weapons and others. There are so many different weapons that can boost your stats or make some stats go down while the weapon is equipped like for example a weapon might give you +2 in strenght but -1 in magic. I won't spoil anything but when you beat the game the character you beat it with will unlock a new character so if you are more than on person the person who played played blue might get an alien and the person who played red might get a skeleton (i don't know what the different charaters get). I can't really mention the soundtrack and the soundeffects since i didn't have the sound on most of the time but what i heard was pretty good. When you have beaten the game and have a high level charater you will be pleased to find out that you unlocked INSANE MODE which i am curretly playing with my friend. INSANE MODE is the entire game again but much harder. Before you start insane mode you can buy some weapons and pets at a high cost but they help a lot. I forgot to mention the money. In stages you will collect money that enemies drop and these money can be spent on potions, pets, swords and other good stuff. One of the good aspects of this money system is that you don't EVER have to spend any of it. You can collect pets and swords everywhere so you don't have to buy anything. Shops are located al around the map and there is almost always a boss battle close to them. These boss battles are so good. They are really creative and can prove to be quite a challenge sometimes but not to hard. I mean like you had to fight a corncob that when you hit it turn into popcorn that give you health. There is a lot to do in this game and it is really gret but now to the parts that i didn't like so much. The game starts by saying the it is best to play with a controller and sure thats is fine but the game does not show any pc controls ANYWHERE! The controls for pc kind of suck too. Sometimes the achivemets can be such a pain to get and you need a friend to help you get them. On the topics of needing people to play with this game is nowhere nears as fun playing alone as it is playing with someone else. I tried alone for a while and it was not very fun at all so if you don't have anyone to play with then DON'T buy this game, but if you have someone to play with i defintly think that you should buy this game. To be honest this is an amazing game when playing with you friends. The game is so creative and fun and there are so many sword and pets and charaters because you can get more charaters from arenas and  beating the game with new charaters gives you more characters. The graphics are really cool and the gameplay is also really fun. The controls can be a bit stupid at times but it can be overlooked if you have gotten used to them. If you can play with someone else this game is a 9/10 because it is so fun and creative and all the stuff you can do even after beating the game it has high replay value. If you have someone to play with BUY THIS GAME! However if you don't have anyoe to play with the game becomes so much less fun. Alone it is one long grind (if you want to complete it) or just a game you will only beat once and then thats it. Alone i would give it a 6/10 because it is still a great game in my opinion but i would say DON'T BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE ALONE! I hope this review was useful. It was my first so i would love critisism. Thank you:-)			"

												An old-school beat'em up, where you have to save princesses, by first freeing them and then getting a kiss from them. 10/10 for originality.Graphics - If you have watched any of the 90's - early 20's cartoons, you are going to fall inlove with the graphic style of this game. As a person who grew up watching cartoons, everything I see has a mixed combination of new and nostalgia.10/10Music - Boy does the music in this game have a wide variety of emotions, from the melodical and calm one that is playing while you are just moving on to the powering up it does the moment you enter a fight. Overall the place and time for every single song is perfect. 10/10Cinematics - It does have quite a few cinematics, most of them are to introduce a level or a boss, but still you won't see a one that copies the other, every single one is unique. I have to add most of them are quite funny, 10/10Story - A pretty basic story, go there, save that, get a kiss, easy as that. The but the comedical depth it adds is just tremendous. the story is mostly told through text bubbles, either way your going to see the funny side in the text or through their action. 10/10Content -  The game lacks nothing, enough enemy variations to keep yourself interested, a wide variety of weather types, random things that happen on the screen. No matter how much you play, you wont be able to predict what a person will say or do. 10/10Controls - You can play on either mouse+keyboard or controler (I recommend the controler). Both of them are fluid and responsive. 10/10Gameplay - A really fun experience, but best played with friends, even by playing alone you are punishing yourself, by what you are missing if you have 4 players and that it is really hard for 1 player. That is either the game really does get way too hard for 1 player or that I am a bad player (the second). 10/10Just the perfect game in my opinion, it gets every single thing it strives to get right, from the littlest detail to the biggest of ones. I strongly recommend playing with friends, either buy it for them (that won't happen),  make them buy it themselves (still won't happen) or buy it for your pet bear (most probable). I would like to add why the hell do you have a bear pet, but hey that is life.Overall score: 10/10			"

												This game is an outstanding game, I recommend everyone to purchase the game. It is worth the $15, I'd even say it's worth $30! This game is fun to play over and over, and I find it to get old sometimes. But I still find it fun when I get back to the game. Try it! I know you'll like it if you try it out. This game is a very good game and fun to experience over and over, especially with friends. If you have some friends to play with, it'll be a very very fun game. I purchased this game for my cousin and I to play together, and I found us playing it a lot together. We are even going to complete the game on Insane mode (A harder difficulty unlocked after completing the entire game). Well I recommend you people who are reading this review to pick up the game yourself. You'll enjoy it if you want a cool adventure, although the graphics can be bad... I think that it is still outstanding in performance! :P The game can be glitchy at times, like my cousin is playing one level at the same time I played another. So we were basically in the same game, but in different levels? I don't understand how this glitch can occur, but it can be resolved if both players exit the game, wait a few minutes, then start up the game and get back together. This game is worth all the money, and I believe whoever reads this review will have the urge to purchase the game themself. The game is a very good game, I own it on Steam and on the PS3. And if you saw my playtime on the PS3 version, I believe it would say 600 hours. I did get all my characters to level 99... This game is a blast! Try it out right now! You definately will enjoy all of the fantastic levels that the game has to offer!			"

												Castle Crashers is one of the simplest games but it's so much fun.You attack by constantly mashing buttons which is encouraged rather than looked down upon. There are also combos you level up to learn that you can master and even though they do help greatly, even the best of players usually resort to mashing. Vertical alignment can usually be pretty annoying given the perspective, but a quick magic jump or bomb and you're good.Mashing is usually the worst possible tactic in Back Off Barbarian though.Straight outta Tom Fulp, Castle Crashers has all the Newgrounds humor you could ever want and more. This game shines in multiplayer, where you gang up on literally everything and go to town with your buds (or just play volleyball with some sand dudes.)			"

												It's a fun game to play with. Either by yourself or with friends. But the downside is that when you do play with friends, the connection is bad and is hard to complete a stage. It happens to me when I play with my friends (who live in different countries), but it's fun when you're playing with people who are nearest to you.			"

												This is one of the most awesome games I've ever played. The graphics are amazing with a unigue design and a great style. This game is really fun to play alone or with friends, and is filled with challenging bosses and enemies. It has loads of playable characters from the derpy villager to the Harcore necromancer, as well as tons of weapons with different buffs and debuffs. It's filled with content, and you can play the game over and over again without getting bored, or jump into insane mode. The level design is on point, and the soundtrack is done very well. There's even a pvp or boardgame option if you're that kind of person.The only things I don't like are the frankly immachure humor, and the part in some levels where you kiss the princess. Other than that, this is an amazing game that is definitely worth the $15. I'd rate 9.5/10. "

												Castle Crashers is a very fun single player or co-op experience similar to the good 'ol days Double Dragon and Streets of Rage beatem up style games but with its own unique story line and humor as well as a robust leveling system, weapon upgrades (tiered by lv) and pet boosts.  There is also tons of replayability here and there are secrets all over the map once you have unlocked certain things in the story so the fun is not even close to being done once you beat the story mode.  You can also unlock 20+ characters to play and level up as which also keeps it fun and fresh!The game has been around for quite a while and has had quite the support as well as new stuff added to it over the years.  I originally purchased this on my Xbox 360 when it came out and played it quite a bit.  I re-purchased it on Steam to complete my collection and have had just as much fun if not more fun as I did when it was brand new.If you like beatum up style games with a bit of leveling and weapon progression as well as a funny story, this game is for you.  I recommend it for sure!  Its even more fun with a group of three of your friends as you fight over sharing money while arguing over who should unlock the weapon or pet first and in which order everyone will get it!  Fun times indeed!			"

												A great hack-and-slash coop! You can join up with 3 friends in local and online coop and rain hell on your enemies with 4 powers, strength, magic, defense, and agility! There's a load of unlockable characters that keep you playing, the game is tons of fun alone or with friends, and its got plenty of replay value to it. Simple, casual gameplay that is rarely frustrating, and a great port for a console. The only downside is the controls without a console controller, but you can always remap them as you'd want in the settings. The younger me will never forget hours of this on Xbox Live.			"

												The art style is quirky and fun and in a way, beautiful. I like it. The humor of The Behemoth is also something to enjoy, like the pooping owl and the small boss that gets replaced by a bigger boss--not to mention the hilarious unveiling of a certain princess. It took 13 hours for me to complete the game, which is on the longer side. It usually only takes 5 hours (according to what I've seen posted) to complete the game. CC has tons of replayability with so many characters and insane mode, but I'm just not one for doing the same levels over again. All in all, I'd give it 8/10, and say it's worth playing at least once.			"

My only complaints are 1, the stock controls are a nightmare on keyboard for me, I had to go through and change everything, but after doing that it runs fine and two, the second world, the forest, has waaaaay to much crap for me, but that is personal taste.

												A very nice throw back to the side scrolling beat em up's of the late 80's and 90's.Decent graphics, great humor and a fair amount of replayability value if you like collecting achievements and characters.Doesn't take overly long to complete one playthrough and its way more fun with friends.I definitely recommend this title.

												This Game has an Awesome sound track and mixes it with insane gameplay. This side scroller combines a beautiful art style with humor and great gameplay mechanics. This game is beautiful to play alone and has alot of replay ability. It is great with friends and can be played with up to 4 players. There are alot of things to unlock in this game such as pets, weapons and characters. Really worth a buy and is really cheap in the steam sale.			"

												I've only played this a few hours so far, but I must recommend this to any fans of old school beat 'em up / hack and slash games.  While I haven't seen it bring anything particulary new to the table in my play thus far.  It does deliver a very solid performance for the genre.  Already in my play I have seen little nods to classics like Golden Axe and Battletoads that made me smile.  The art work is colorful and crisp and really pops.  The enemies vary as you go along to mix things up a little bit.  It is also rife with cheezy little humourous moments that will make you chuckle.One other neat thing is that you can find different weapons and pets throughout your play.  So you are not just stuck with the same stuff the whole time.  Also, as you play you level up your character and gain new combos along the way.  So there is some progression to the game play.I really can't find anything negative to say about it thus far, except for maybe the fact that if you want to change pets/weapon you have to go back to your home castle and it can take a moment to navigate the map back to where you were, but it is a minor inconvieniance at most.I picked this game up for DIRT CHEAP during the Summer Sale and it is absolutely worth every penny.  Best beat 'em up I've played on PC since Little Fighter.			"

												Even though I have only 14 hours on this game, I really do recommend it. It allows players to go adventure in a 2d type of gameplay. You can also play with your friends and other players too if you want. If you really want to, you can also play solo. There are many weapons and items you can buy from stores too. This gives a whole new taste to the genre of Adventure and actions games.			"

												It's a good game. Lol, at first I thought it was just a cartoony game, as I got it for a gift and me and my Friends started playing it together. After a while you'll get used to some of the controls if you're on keyboard. But It's better on controllers so... Go getcha one! Anyway, there's sometimes a fight at the end where you can versus your friends for a princess' kiss or something. And there's bosses... I can't even type anymore-- It's a good game and let's leave it at that okay? Okay.			"

Its fun, easy to understand and diversive, there are so many ways that you can play your character. Controller does make a big difference while playing, personally I recommend using one, if you do not have one definetly change the keyboard controls for a better experience. Have fun and choose your color.			"

												I highly reccomend this game you have red knight whwo has lightning attacks blue knight who has ice attacks green knight who can poison enemies and red knight who can burn people. you can get 27 other unlockable characters uncluding hatty from battleblock theater, a bear, and a skeleton.u can put skill points into agility which increases speed and arrow damage stregnth which increases baasic attack damage defense which decreases the damage you take and magic which allowws u to regenerate mana faster use more mana gain more magic damage and even gain up to 4 neww magic attacks for a total of 5. you can get pets like the cardinal which lets u find hidden items rammy u knocks down enemies and bitey who chomps on enemies heads. one pet u can get is the golden whale who comes whith unlockable character Hatty, the golden wwhaale drops golden blocks worth one dollar. there are many fun bosses like a mechanichal ram, a very fat bat, and even a cat who spits furballs at you. this game has 4 player co-op which is very fun and 3 playable modes. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND this games even though i have played only 17 hours i am level 21 as of now and the game is $3.74 on sale and $15 when its not worth the buy either way.			"

												This is one of the best games I've ever played.Pros:+ Local game capability and online coop, up to 4 people.+ A lot of unlockable stuff.+ Diversity between knights.+ Humor across the game.+ Cheap to buy.+ Bosses are puzzly, some of them are very easy to defeat if you find their weak spot.+ A lot of unlockables. Some are really hard to find.Cons:- Becomes repetitive after some time, there are over 30 playable characters that you unlock and the only difference between them is the magic spells. Once you beat the game once you can beat it any time.- Not the type of game you play online, but rather the one you play alone or with friends. Doesn't stop you from playing with strangers though.- Has a lot of grinding involved, the experience system is really bad overall.- Some playable content is pay-to-use DLC, but the items they provide are only worth using for the first 15 levels at most.In short, it's definitely a very good game you should try with friends. You will have a good time but don't expect to spend 2000 hours on it.			"

												Castle Crashers is awesome!!!! You can get many weps, animal orbs (produces help of some sort) and charcters to choose from you can battle people online, all you can eat game, and play the main game! Tons of fun, kill tons and tons of enemies. Beat mini bosses and real ones. Want a wep or a animal orb that u had before go to the black smith go in the creature for weps and hut for animal orbs. Anyway this game is really fun and u should get it! I think its 13/10 becuase it's great!			"

												A great hack-and-slash coop! You can join up with 3 friends in local and online coop and rain hell on your enemies with 4 powers, strength, magic, defense, and agility! There's a load of unlockable characters that keep you playing, the game is tons of fun alone or with friends, and its got plenty of replay value to it. Simple, casual gameplay that is rarely frustrating, and a great port for a console. The only downside is the controls without a console controller, but you can always remap them as you'd want in the settings. The younger me will never forget hours of this on Xbox Live.			"

												This is one of the best games I've ever played.Pros:+ Local game capability and online coop, up to 4 people.+ A lot of unlockable stuff.+ Diversity between knights.+ Humor across the game.+ Cheap to buy.+ Bosses are puzzly, some of them are very easy to defeat if you find their weak spot.+ A lot of unlockables. Some are really hard to find.Cons:- Becomes repetitive after some time, there are over 30 playable characters that you unlock and the only difference between them is the magic spells. Once you beat the game once you can beat it any time.- Not the type of game you play online, but rather the one you play alone or with friends. Doesn't stop you from playing with strangers though.- Has a lot of grinding involved, the experience system is really bad overall.- Some playable content is pay-to-use DLC, but the items they provide are only worth using for the first 15 levels at most.In short, it's definitely a very good game you should try with friends. You will have a good time but don't expect to spend 2000 hours on it.			"

												So far, one of the best hack'n'slash RPG's I have played. It is fun both single player, and multiplayer. If you can, I would play multiplayer with friends, or even just randoms. If not, then single player is just as good. However, It is lacking that bit of competitive spirit in between you and your teammates. The fighting system is solid, and fair (No PVP stunlocks here folks!) and it can be great fun playing the multiple game modes with others. Also, if you can't play online for whatever reason (Like me 99 percent of the time) but you have friends around that want to play, you can do local multiplayer for all game modes. Even all you can quaff. Ohhhhhhhhhh my thumbs...Overall, I would say to buy this game. It runs on fairly low end computers, and you will probably enjoy your time with this game. Pink knight is the best.			"

												Please play this game with a controller please.Castle Crashers is an honestly silly game involving you, maybe three other friends, and sharp objects with which to stab other things with. Each colored knight has this ability which corralates to its color; in a sort of elemental attack or so.Its a fun and zany stab-em-up game with a penchant for mob-based mechanics which in my opinion, is the best and most fun way to do it. The best feeling is when you throw a dude into a bunch of other dudes.The art style is cute, but its unknown to me if its trying to be funny. I laughed anyway.My only real complaint is its rather easy to ram bosses into a corner and keep right on hitting them, and they can't do a darn thing as they're much too busy recoiling from my hits. Bosses are easy to cheese, is what I'm saying.Play it with friends if you can. I got four USB hookups. Let's do this. The green one is my favorite because poison.9/10			"

												Fun gameplay inspired by classic side scrolling beat em ups. There are a variety of characters to choose from, various weapons with different stats, leveling up and choosing what to focus on, magic, items. It's really fun, especially with a friend. It's got a sense of humor and good game play. Interesting boss battles, and a wide variety of levels. My one and only complaint is a complaint I tend to have with all 2D side scrolling beat em ups, is that it can be hard to tell where to hit. If you're standing slightly in front of the enemy, or behind, you miss, and it can be tough to judge. Maybe I just suck though?			"

												It's Castle Crashers... seriously? Where have you been living the past 5 years if you aren't even remotely aware of this title by now?This game basically has a perfect mix of brawler and RPG elements with optional 4 player co-op. Plenty of secrets to find and gear to collect. Juvenile humor is abound and plentiful. Great soundtrack as well. Brought to you from the artists over at Newgrounds.com.My only  real complaint about the game is that there are way too many characters to unlock and the amount of content is limited... too many clones of characters, not enough diversity, makes the game a bit stale over time. By the third playthrough it gets pretty obnoxious having to repeat the entire game over again instead of just allowing you to select your favorite stages.I wish they would of added more levels or an extra mode that allows you to unlock / level your characters without having to replay the entire story line over again. I mean once or twice is enough... you can't really skip cut scenes either which adds to the annoyance factor. Other than that, it's a great game to play with some friends.			"

												Played it for many hours at first on Xbox 360 and some time after, at some sale, started to play it again on PC. I can say for sure that Castle Crashers is one of most interesting beat 'em up games I have ever played. Graphics might look like some kind of game for kind but don't be mistaken - kids, teenagers, adults, everyone will have great time playing this game. With so many characters (few at start, many to unlock) to play, so many levels to make, many weapons and secrets to find, you won't be bored after beating once, or twice, or until you will reach max level with every character. You can enjoy it alone, or with friends on 1 PC or over internet. Castle Crashers isn't not only filled with action, but also with humour, and what's better, the one that will for sure make you laught, unless you take everything too serious. Sure, some people will say it get's boring quickly or it's repetitive but if you ask me, I didn't get bored even once in those 50 (at the moment I'm making this review) hours. And I'm sure I will play it at some point again, and again, and again... and again. It's really easy to get addicted to this game.In my opinion, it's worth full price but sure, there are people who might not know what Castle Crashers is, or what kind of people made this game. If you are fan of beat 'em up games, then you must grab it at sale. Look at the number of reviews this game have received, and look at what number of those are positives ones - there is high chance that another positive review will be coming from you.			"

THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT CONTENT FROM BEFORE THE REMASTERED PATCH!Do I reccomend Castle Crashers? Yes.Do I reccomend you buy the title on Steam? No.Castle Crashers is an Arcade-Style Side-Scrolling Beat 'Em Up with a level-up system, unique playable characters and loads of weapons!Where this game succeeds is in its focus around cooperative play, but can still be played to its completion alone. Behemoth's ""Game 2"" has brought fun times to players for almost 7 years now.So what are the good qualities of this game?1-4 player cooperative story mode sure to pack laughter and anger in one box2-4 player pvp arena modeAmazing soundtrack that will make you want to play levels over just to hear themBehemoth's signature cartoony yet brutal gameplayACTION! COMEDY! ROMANCE!Over 80 weapons to tweak your stats outside of the level-up systemNow, this game is great and a must have, just not on Steam.If you don't have one or more friend(s) who are willing to play this whenever you are, this game will get really old really fastTerrible, and I mean TERRIBLE online multiplayer. Whether you're playing with somebody across the country or across the room, 95 times out of 100 there will be unbearable periods of lag on one or more players' ends, causing all players to see different screens. Some examples may be that a player is standing still, using their W key attack, while another player is seeing them using their W key reviving another player. On one screen you may see your teammate dead on the ground, while they are actually fighting something you may not even see!Button prompts are displayed as X-Box buttons. Leaving players who didn't read and memorize the chart on the main menu often clueless on what to pressIf you're not playing together on the same machine, don't play together at allSo all in all, I do reccomend Castle Crashers to players. I myself picked this up for 70 cents on the last Steam Summer Sale, having no idea of the lagfest I was getting myself into. Only buy this on Steam if you plan to play by yourself a lot.I suggest you pick up this title up on another platform. Either the X-Box Live Arcade or the PlayStation Store.			"

												The game is fun - especially with friends! So don't think I don't like this game. It's got a hefty amount of clever jokes that aren't too far shoved in your face (like I noticed Ceiling Cat watching me from above in the pet store). But the controls for this game are... to put it gently... relatively poor.It recommends an Xbox controller, but it's a PC game so it should assume the majority of people will play it using a mouse and keyboard. It translates it's controls as though you're using an Xbox controller first off - something that was a really bad sign to me at first - but the real thing that crimps the controls is the fact you have to hold some buttons and tap others to activate this or that action. Your starting spell for instance is simply ""Hold Shift, press Strong-Attack"" while the bolt version of it would be ""Hold Shift, Press Use-Item"". Even then to cast spells in the air you have to use different buttons (Strong-Attack or Use-Item) to decide if you shoot horizontally or downwards which is just feels off (why not just let the movement keys press the direction you want to aim?). The fact that you can't even seperate the Item, magic, and the melee commands makes it bug♥♥♥♥ disorienting. It's a keyboard: It has enough buttons to cover the actions without having to resort to playing Twister with your fingers.That said I can't say I've played it and not had a blast yet. Granted I've only been playing it a couple of days so far. It's by no means an easy game, but it's a fun one.			"

												Played it for many hours at first on Xbox 360 and some time after, at some sale, started to play it again on PC. I can say for sure that Castle Crashers is one of most interesting beat 'em up games I have ever played. Graphics might look like some kind of game for kind but don't be mistaken - kids, teenagers, adults, everyone will have great time playing this game. With so many characters (few at start, many to unlock) to play, so many levels to make, many weapons and secrets to find, you won't be bored after beating once, or twice, or until you will reach max level with every character. You can enjoy it alone, or with friends on 1 PC or over internet. Castle Crashers isn't not only filled with action, but also with humour, and what's better, the one that will for sure make you laught, unless you take everything too serious. Sure, some people will say it get's boring quickly or it's repetitive but if you ask me, I didn't get bored even once in those 50 (at the moment I'm making this review) hours. And I'm sure I will play it at some point again, and again, and again... and again. It's really easy to get addicted to this game.In my opinion, it's worth full price but sure, there are people who might not know what Castle Crashers is, or what kind of people made this game. If you are fan of beat 'em up games, then you must grab it at sale. Look at the number of reviews this game have received, and look at what number of those are positives ones - there is high chance that another positive review will be coming from you.			"

												It's Castle Crashers... seriously? Where have you been living the past 5 years if you aren't even remotely aware of this title by now?This game basically has a perfect mix of brawler and RPG elements with optional 4 player co-op. Plenty of secrets to find and gear to collect. Juvenile humor is abound and plentiful. Great soundtrack as well. Brought to you from the artists over at Newgrounds.com.My only  real complaint about the game is that there are way too many characters to unlock and the amount of content is limited... too many clones of characters, not enough diversity, makes the game a bit stale over time. By the third playthrough it gets pretty obnoxious having to repeat the entire game over again instead of just allowing you to select your favorite stages.I wish they would of added more levels or an extra mode that allows you to unlock / level your characters without having to replay the entire story line over again. I mean once or twice is enough... you can't really skip cut scenes either which adds to the annoyance factor. Other than that, it's a great game to play with some friends.			"

												I am so glad that this game was on sale. Because if it weren't for the sale I wouldn't be able to come across with such an enjoyable game. It has both humor and action in it. Not to mention the awesome combat style. What I observed in this game, however, it tries to put you to a class like ''take this stick, increase your intelligence and be a mage!'' but being a mage is not really powerful in the game. You end up using your ''stick'' in melee combat and go with it. There could be more options if only the game allowed it, such as being an archer if there were more types of bows. But then again these do not change the enjoyment of the game. I do not yet had the time to play it with my friends but I'm sure that it'd be even more fun like it is possible. And you can have cute pets with nice perks!All in all I just cannot stop playing this game. Both for the funny storyline and the great combat style.			"

												Great fun game for the whole family, or just good 4 player sidecroller to mash enemies with your friends. TONS of unlockable characters, and a relatively easy achievement list to 100% if you are an achievement hunter. The DLC packs are cheap and totally great adding two extra Characters, The Blacksmith and The Pink Knight.Insanity mode after game completion offers a new difficulty to play through increasing the amount of playability and extending the level grinding to a more enjoyable and challenging setting. The artwork is great as well. It is very colorful and family friendly. The Game is playable by all ages (with a few poop and fart jokes in the mix).I also like that with my Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows I am able to hook up more than one controller and allow more than 1 player/controller to be supported by a single USB port and play/level multiple characters at once as my friends can choose my other characters and level along with me.Also available on the Playstation Network and Xbox Market. I would certainly recommend this game to anyone and everyone. Loads of enjoyment, replayability, and good laughs.10/10			"

Lets say you've unlocked all characters and beat the game, probably gets boring but then they have insane mode! Insane mode is great, it's super difficult and if you tihnk you're up for the challenge, then go for it!Overall great game and I reccomend you buy this game, even right now since there is a Summer Sale! $3.00 is all it is for hours on end fun!

												Rating 8.5/10Status: Very fun in short sessionsWhat is it?Beat 'Em up with lite Rpg elementsThe Good+ Great artstyle and animation really stand out+ Great enemy design and boss  battles. + Variety of level environments  and gameplay to keep things as fresh as possible + Lots of playable characters each with their own unique magic spells + NIce Music+ 4 stats: strength, agility, defense and magic to customize your character the way you want+ Doesn't overstay its welcomeThe Bad- Multiplayer community is dead making it hard to play with others and get achievements Conclusion:If your looking for a solid Beat em up game this game is very good.

												An extremely fun side scrolling, beat'em up, co-op rpg.  While it is nothing that  we haven't all seen before,  Castle Crashers executes all aspects of this  type of game perfectly.   Each character, do to color coordination, is easily identifiable.  Unique special abilities help each player  stand apart, as well as weapon choices, secondary items and companions that add passive abilities and stats.There is an rpg aspect that allows each player to upgrade his or her character's stats separately from the rest.  The enemies are well balanced as well as each type possessing its own attacks and abilities.  Almost every level has a boss at the end.Similar to Diablo, you can play back through after completion for a greater challenge.  I recommend having 4 players when you do this; otherwise, the game might begin to feel off balance.The game as a whole offers solid game play, good re-playability, fun co-op and many laughs.  A good buy if you plan on playing with a group of friends.Note: there  is a bit of lag when using the keyboard; the game is built around the game pad.

												I can't say I finished entirely, I even got carried from the beginning by a high level !I could anyway analyse the biggest points of this game :It's very very fun, to be honest we have a good time, we rekt mobs, we die (not that much though). By the way it's also a downside. It's way too easy, we complete the game in one or two days if we play seriously. Moreover, you can complete it only by smashing the attack button, the combos are here but not too useful.To conclude we can say that it's a game to relax, to kick some asses, but you won't find a game with a complex background for example.

												As far as mindless, comical, side-scrolling couch co-op games go, this just might be the king. Sit back with up to 3 of your friends, grab some X-input controllers, and get ready for sore thumbs. That pretty much sums this little nugget up. Also comes with a neat little character progression system and some very satisfying attack combos.			"

Unlike some other games, this one had no difficulties at letting you create your private server (click and play, simple as that). Cons: Soundtrack is great but really repetitive, it gets to the point of being overly annoying. i mean, its a game with a great replayability, i have almost 50 hours of gameplay, so even with the music is good, you have to listen to the same tracks for 50 hours, so... yeah.Gameplay: great.Soundtrack: fun, but repetitiveGraphics: good, simple and hilariously ridiculous.Multiplayer support: wonderful.Fun: guaranteedConclusion: Wonderful game.

												If you're looking for a multiplayer game to play with your friends, this is the one. When it comes to cooperative gaming, nothing can beat Castle Crashers. There isn't a better 4 person multiplayer game out there, and when it comes to side scrolling action games, this one tops them all. Castle Crashers is a game with more replayability than I've ever seen, and I would highly recommend you pick it up if you're looking for somethingto do with your friends besides the usual shooters. Pick this game up, it's amazing.			"

Cute graphics style that makes you go Aww at times but still gruesome at others, intuitive controls and enjoyable gameplay with lots of optional things to do on the side. Even more fun multiplayer, wether you play locally, on one machine, or online.. Okay, the latter maybe not that much heh. Make sure you have a gamepad that this picky game will accept though, or else you are in for a world of ouchies.

Cons: Soundtrack is great but really repetitive, it gets to the point of being overly annoying. i mean, its a game with a great replayability, i have almost 50 hours of gameplay, so even with the music is good, you have to listen to the same tracks for 50 hours, so... yeah.Gameplay: great.Soundtrack: fun, but repetitiveGraphics: good, simple and hilariously ridiculous.Multiplayer support: wonderful.Fun: guaranteedConclusion: Wonderful game. SImply wonderful. "

												As far as mindless, comical, side-scrolling couch co-op games go, this just might be the king. Sit back with up to 3 of your friends, grab some X-input controllers, and get ready for sore thumbs. That pretty much sums this little nugget up. Also comes with a neat little character progression system and some very satisfying attack combos.			"

												Castle Crashers is so good, that I bought it twice. once on the xbox and once on steam. It's a great 2D  sidescrolling action and has a lot of replay value. It's fun alone, but is' amazing with friends. Hard to believe that the game came out more than 4 years ago, it still plays well. It's a really enjoyable experience and everyone should play it.			"

I then fought a polar bear riding a shark-cat-thing while again riding a shark through a river.Oh and while doing all of this I had a Golden Whale following me that pooped gold.100/10 would buy again.

												Beautiful and timeless art style with an amazing sound track to boot. Story is simple and self explanatory without the use of dialog which makes it feel very reminiscent of Double Dragon as it too is a side scrolling beat-‘em-up. Lots of little Easter eggs and fun things happening on screen at all times which will require multiple run throughs to fully observe everything that is going on.By far Behemoths greatest work.			"

It has 4 player co-op with any combination of online and local players and it is overall one of my favorite to play with a tight group of friends. It's also has some humor in the package, which is something I learned to value a whole lot in the last years.			"

												The game with the weirdest animations I've ever played.  Diarrhea deers, what?  And that ending.  It's a great game to play with friends and easy to get too.  The game goes on sale often enough for $4 or sometimes even $2 and there's a 4 pack bundle.  I think the only downside is that there's not much left to do after beating the final stage.  At that point, you've seen everything there is to see in the game.  If people are still wanting to play, they end up grinding to raise their levels.			"

												I wil surely recommend this for person who's looking for a game with sick♥♥♥♥♥humor, good Co-Op and standard arcade.I will say as a big Behemoth fan that this is as all of their other games, completely funny humoristic and crazy. This is the arcade game that every guy searching for some new things should try.I want to say gameplay basics are nearly complete, you can find some small bugs but nothing big, it's smooth and you can surely tell, that the designers have spent hours on this.Gameplay through can maybe sometimes be a little too simple as you can just smash your keyboard to the table and kill enemys, but at least they have made it nearly impossible just too boost each other because of you need to kill the enemys, and as longer into you go the monsters getting much harder to kill, so you cant just let a lvl 1 guy into a high level area.I do also really like their way of humour through characters you can play as since you can get some really funny and quite suspicious crazy homour like a knight that casts rainbows, and shoots penguins as spells i find the characters really fullfilled, through the lvling process could be a little more creative since it gets a little long in the end.Storyline is complety sick♥♥♥♥♥fun homour, as always as in a standard adventure game you need to rescue the princess, but in difference for many other games they have found a way to make it more funny, like the bosses are not just simple but also a funny sarcastic, like a cat-shark it's quite funny since cats dont like water.

												It's a great game ! it  funny , it has good gameplay ect . Sadly it is hard to play on a laptop but all in all a great game.to be precise this game has : fun boss fights , tons of secret items and animals : 5 fun arenas to fight in , a funny ( but weird ) story line , the golden door , a variety of characters to unlock ectI would rate it 9/10 because it's a great game , good story line but  a bit short , good replay value but bad laptop controls.

Even my six year old nephew was able to get through a good portion of the game before I needed to help him. Despite the cartoony graphics, it has some good humor to it. I actually had to use a controller to play the game, since it was easier than using a mouse and keyboard.			"

												Castle Crashers is one of thoose quirky indie games, but don't get me wrong this is one of my favorite games.  Its a great game alone (singleplayer) but they add multiplayer so you can save princesses with your friends.  There are also unlockable characters, a buttload of weapons, a ton of helpful companions, and a few minigames, like a arena to fight to the death, also a gamemode where you eat as much food as you can.  ITS A GREAT GMAE VERYONE SHOULD HAVE IT!!!Overall Gameplay:8Graphics:7 (cartoony)Sound:7Game:9			"

												A classic from The Behemoth that is just so good, people defecate before you character can even swing his/her weapon. Another non biased review despite my enjoyment of The Behemoth game. I re-bought this game after I completed it on my Ps3 and it was just as good... with the exception of volleyball replacing that horrid button-masher ""All You Can Queef(af)"" not included on the Steam version. The gameplay is sort of rough around the edges but is still a pretty good contribution to the beat-em-up genre. The game is also 4-player co-op fun that could be played on one computer/system or online (something that is lacking in the game community now a days pertaining to local co-op). It's a pretty fun game and it's only flaws are the occasional bugs and some online issues. It's an indie game on top of the second game this company has pushed out so don't get all in your feelings if you lag out of a game. It's really good quality for a game that came out in 2008 and sort-of remastered in 2010. CC is also very addicting because if your like me and want to unlock all the characters then your going to have to playthrough like no other game. You may be sick of repeating the game on top of playing the newly unlock insane mode for even more characters but it will be worth it in the end (maybe not). CC is an all around fun game brought to you by Newgrounds and I'd just wish the son from Dad n' Me and the troll were characters.  An all around good time with your friends and an awesome indie expirience. This game is 9.99/10 (Those bugs can get annoying). *On a side note you should also check out BattleBlock Theater (Steam Version of course) and Alien Hominid (On Console Only)*			"

												This game is so much fun. I highly recomend anyone who likes games where you get to wail on anything in sight. it's amazingly fun, the levels are cool and the bosses are too. sometimes things can get tedious, but that's when you get your friends in your game to help you out through those parts! after the game there are so many things to do, you can go around and do a bunch of stuff like try to unlock all the weapons in the game, and go and try to unlock all the characters, and there's even a special ""Insane Mode"" which i haven't tried yet but I would have to guess it's a RIDICULOUSLY harder version of the game, and if so would recomend getting a band of friends to get together and play it. In conclusion this is an amazing game and everyone needs it in their Steam Library			"

												From my experience playing as Green -> Gray, I can tell this game is all the types of awesome combined into one legendary package with sandwiches and knights.So we have our basic Knights, Red Knight aka Darth Sidious. We have Blue Knight aka Phantom Blood Dio, Green Knight or Diarrhea Knight and Orange Knight.You can choose these 4 knights at the start of the game and by completing the game with a certain knight, Beating a certain level to get Gray Knight or the Alien Hominid, or by spending a few minutes in the Arena.I won't get too into the story but the knights party in the barracks behind/underneath the Throne Room, A gray knight gets dead and gets thrown into the party, Everyone stops and gets triggered, Kills some Barbarians and then the princesses get captured...All 4 of them...If you're playing with friends, When you get to saving the Orange Princess and it starts to be a duel for her hand, Let him win. Just...Let him win. Trust me, You'll thank me soon.The Game features 3 Modes. Story Mode (Castle Crashers) and 2 Minigames, Arena and Back-Off Barbarian, Which can be a bit confusing for new players but with a bit of practice, It's easy.Obviously, You can play the modes alone like the lil' basement-dwelling troll you are OR with the friends you have, Mr. Popular.The Animal Orbs are like unlockable passive perks that you can only have one of them. You can buy them or find them.The Weapons you can get can change the stats you have. For Example, The starting weapon Stoveface the Black Knight you can unlock by beating the game with Gray starts with a Gladiator Sword which gives some Attack and Defence but reduces Magic Attacks and has a chance to do a Critical Hit (In my experience of TF2, Is a bad thing for them and a good thing for you.)The Bosses are well done and challening as with the enemies...Except for the Fire Demon, It's evil.Everytime you Level Up, You get 2 skillpoints until 30+ or so where you get only 1. Which is pretty amazing since a 2D-Hack and Slash Beat 'em Up has RPG elements in it too.You can replay it many times you want, There will always be a new playstyle and character waiting for you until you unlock all the elementals.The DLCs (Both Blacksmith and Pink Knight.) Adds 2 more elemental magic and 10 more weapons, So if you're bored, You can always spend a couple of bucks or two.Thats it for the Pros, Let me get to the Cons.It takes too much time to unlock every single thing but none of use here are Completionists anyway, Right?And some bosses require grinding to level up so Speedrunning will be tough.PS : Stoveface-senpai is bae.

There are pets and weapons you can find and keep. The game has nice music, especially the beginning. You can also play with several other people so you can have a great time with your friends and family.Overall, I would give it a 9.5/10.			"

												Originally played this game on 360 years ago and was surprised when it showed up on steam. I played the absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥out of CC, getting several level 99 characters and I must've completed the game 20+ times with my friends. Multiplayer is phenomenal fun and would be one of the main reasons to get this. That's not to say that single player isn't also amazingly fun; a TONN of collectables throughout the game but none that convolutedly hard to come across, weapons, pets, characters and a few others make this game have a ton of replayablity. Most of the time you'll find yourself using melee but the magic is pretty dang powerful as well and works very well in combination of melee attacks, the archery on the other hand isn't that fantastic but it does prove it's worth in the game (sometimes).The story, though it is fairly simple (just saving princesses and defeating bosses/enemies), you'll be laughing the entire way through, the art style works incredibly well for this level of humor and makes everything more enjoyable to look at. On sale or full price, this game is worth every penny.			"

You do not have to be an expert to complete this game just have patience. I would personally recremend a control to play as i have used both controller and keyboard and the controler is much easier to use, plus all of the game controls are in xbox controler language. This game is even more fun if you manage to gather 4 people and it doesn't recuire a gaming pc and has a short download time.

 Pure Fun! Castle Crashers is the best in its genre: a 4-player fun-fest adventure that leaves many memorable times together. The gameplay is light hearted, the controls are very fluid and character progression (attribute increases) are up to each players' discretion and directly correlate to each players' gameplay.The only negative issue that I felt throughout the game was that there are occasions where the background environment/camera makes it very difficult to see clearly.Overall, a must-have for any gaming group out there. It's well worth every cent.			"

												Pros Castle Crashers is a 4 player, local beat em up brawler and is the game most people think of when they play brawlers. i have played Castle Crashers on both PC and Xbox. I rate the game very highly and it is the best of its genre of 4 player brawlers. this game is a great game to play by yourself but it is much more fun with friends and you can meet good people on servers of this game. the game has 2 difficulty modes normal and insane mode, and insane mode is very challenging. If you think hard isn't hard enough you can play the game without spending any level up points making it more challenging and this game is very fun when you set your own goals. the game is full of content with tons of weapons, characters, pets, and other unlock-ables to make the game worth replaying multiple times. the graphics on this game are great, it looks like a beautiful flash game and this version has great options for its sound, display, controls, rebind-able keys, and it has excellent controller support. if you on other games owned by the same company you unlock a playable character in that game example if you own battle block theater you can unlock hatty hattington. Cons The game is kinda short but its not a big problem because its replayable but still, you will get sick of playing the same levels so many times new levels would have fixed this problem  Leveling up to 99 takes too long, previously there were tricks to level up like the boomerang glitch, the 256 glitch, and other tricks but they have been patched and that HUGELY take away from the game, when i had played castle crashers on the xbox 360 the boomerang glitch was partly patched where the exp rewarding glitch would only work in the industrial castle and that made it easier to level up you could really level up fast if you did the trick with insane mode on but sadly that has been patched. in my opinion patching games are really good, game breaking bugs need to be fixed obviously, i had no problem with the 256 glitch being removed, making the boomerang glitch work on only one boss was alright, but i think that taking out makes leveling up stupidly long without out of game cheats. A few of characters use the same ability's example the grey knight and the cone head knight have the exact same magic ability's, and you need to beat the glitch specific characters to unlock other ones. ConclusionOverall its worth it and really enjoyable to play but the level up system needs at least a few more easy ways to level up it takes quite a long time to level up making the game very hard to fully complete. i would recommend a console version over the PC version because the level up system is simply better. i also recommend all the DLC it is worthwhile to pay for the new content, the pink knight DLC is worthwhile and the purple knight DLC is not as interesting as the pink knight DLC mainly because of one weapon (put simply because the broccoli sword is the best starting weapon), but still worth it. Castle Crashers is a must have in my opinion, worth every cent and is the definitive game of its genre.			"

												This game is awesome! It has a great sense of humor, though things are still epic and serious. There are many characters to unlock which is always a good thing, and the pets are adorable (well, some of them, anyway o.o). The only cons is that it can, in fact, get boring after a while, but the fun can last forever if you're playing with a good friend. Talking about friends, the Online Multiplayer in this is pretty bad, not gonna lie. But I'll admit that that's because of some people's internet (not everyone's internet can be as fast as mine~).Overall, this game has many pros and very little cons, so I really recommend it. And to make it better, its 4 players! To me, that's perfect (not too less, not too many; though I do think they could of squeezed a fifth player in there.).			"

												Okay, Pros: Co-op, arcade style, fun with friends, fairly good animation, several different types of enemies, think outside the box art style, epic music, uniqe and old school style boss fights, and beleive it or not REALLY good story. Two more additional things, Behemoth, and I think Battle Block Theater should be on steam.Cons: CONTROLLER OR DIE, playing without friends is boring, difficult playing alone.Overall: Buy the game when its full price. If you have a friend (or a few) that want to play too, buy a copy for each of them too. Endless hilarity insues amongst your friends, the game itself, and soon you will be cackling over the micrphone about the endless laughs and enjoyment this game will bring to your life. End note: I wasn't kidding about ""CONTROLLER OR DIE"" if you want to NOT be confused by the game's UI, get a WIRED Xbox 360 controller. Trust me, it'll boost your gameplay experience by about hmmmm: 25%-60-ish%.			"

												8.5/10A very fun hack and slash from Tom Fulp, creator of Newgrounds. One of the best hack and slash games around with a wonderful art style, a great sound track, and tons of unlockables. The replay value is through the roof as you'll constantly be telling yourself ""ok, just one more game"". There are 2 pieces of DLC for $.99 each that are unnecessary to the game play unless you are a completeist and want everything just for the sake of having it. The money from the DLC does go 100% to charity so there is that but, I wouldn't bother unless playing a pink character or having horns is incredibly important to you.The game is cheap as it is, especially considering the many hours of play time you'll potentially get out of it but, as with anything that's been on Steam for any significant length of time, I would add it to my wishlist and wait for a decent sale. And like I said, don't feel pressured into buying the DLC as it doesn't add anything of great value to the game (i.e., levels, more story etc.). It's mostly cosmetic with a few weapons that won't make the game any more or less easy for you as you won't be able to use them until you hit the appropriate levels anyways.			"

You and three friends travel throughout the kingdom ruining lives and crashing castles on your stubborn quest to save the princesses. There are tons of landscapes to traverse, weapons and characters to unlock, and princesses to kiss. You can even gain experience and level up your chosen knight.

												Absolutely designed to be played with a controller.  Before purchasing, make sure you have some sort of controller support.  Also I will say that this game is best played with friends or online.  Although I have played it a ton without anyone else, so it is possible.Beyond that, it is a great game.  First played this game on the Xbox 360 and remembered how much fun I had so when I saw it again on Steam, I knew I had to buy it.  Every area in the game is repetitive, but they make up for this by adding in tons of different weapons and animal orbs to collect.  This adds some desire to replay the game multiple times in order to either experience everything or simply do a bit of collecting (took me until my second playthrough to find the dang boomerang).  You start out being able to choose from four different characters, but just like the weapons and animal orbs, there are many other characters to unlock as you play through the game.  Some require you to beat the game with certain characters, and some simply require you to do certain things or progress to certain parts of the game.All of this combined adds replayablility to the game and definately makes this purchase worth every penny.

The game sets it up so that is's fun to play a level again and again. The bosses are memorable and exiting. You can play local or over wi-fi. You can use a Xbox controller, witch really makes the game more exiting. There is a lot of playable characters to unlock, there is also a lot of collectibles, such as weapons and sidekicks. You can only complete the game by replaying it more times and it is totally woth it. You will spend a lot of fun hours playing this game. I would recomed this game for gamers or casuals who like classic NES games or if you liked battel block theater (but they are totaly different). I wuld give it 4 of 5 stars.			"

												Let's start this review with a simple pro's and con's list,PROS:-Art style is colourful.-Gameplay is not hard to understand and is fun.-Controller support!CONS: -If you're using a keyboard, the prompts are for controllers mostly so you'll have to learn the controls via menus.-Not a great story, but the gameplay does slightly make up for it,Overall, I think that Castle Crashers is a great overall game, good gameplay and a good (enough) story to enjoy for multiple hours. Full controller support is definately a plus and will help you play the game to it's fullest. If you enjoy side-scrolling adventure games with a great art style you'll really enjoy Castle Crashers.

I highly recomend anyone who likes games where you get to wail on anything in sight. it's amazingly fun, the levels are cool and the bosses are too. sometimes things can get tedious, but that's when you get your friends in your game to help you out through those parts! after the game there are so many things to do, you can go around and do a bunch of stuff like try to unlock all the weapons in the game, and go and try to unlock all the characters, and there's even a special ""Insane Mode"" which i haven't tried yet but I would have to guess it's a RIDICULOUSLY harder version of the game, and if so would recomend getting a band of friends to get together and play it.

												This is a great game and it is hours and hours of fun. Blood is rarely seen, everything is very cool and sometimes humorous (pooping forest) and that it's a good 4-player game, meaning that 4 people can have fun together. Many games can only have 1 player on each PC but this one can have 2-4 (if you have enough keyboard space). It is a good game for all ages. If you like this game, you should try 'Battleblock Theater' also by this amazing company called 'The Behemoth'.			"

												The game with the weirdest animations I've ever played.  Diarrhea deers, what?  And that ending.  It's a great game to play with friends and easy to get too.  The game goes on sale often enough for $4 or sometimes even $2 and there's a 4 pack bundle.  I think the only downside is that there's not much left to do after beating the final stage.  At that point, you've seen everything there is to see in the game.  If people are still wanting to play, they end up grinding to raise their levels.			"

												I think this game is fun and is exactly what you expect it too be. Personally i could not sit and play it for a long time as yes it is repetetive but it is simple. You do not have to be an expert to complete this game just have patience. I would personally recremend a control to play as i have used both controller and keyboard and the controler is much easier to use, plus all of the game controls are in xbox controler language. This game is even more fun if you manage to gather 4 people and it doesn't recuire a gaming pc and has a short download time. I can say i completely enjoyed my time playing this game and have no clue how people got to lvl 100(like how keen do you have to be?)			"

												Great game! Only problem I have with it is that it is very, very, boring if you don't have a friend to play co-op with you. And I hate it when people say ""this online community is dead"" yet when I open up a public lobby it becomes full in a matter of seconds, and yes you can button mash through the game, but that doesn't take away from the fun! I mean.. comeon who doesn't like the usual fairy tail; save the princess{s} and defeat the evil wizard plot/scenario. (there isn't a ""story"" but you can follow along the actions of the characters, for example the princesses are being dragged away, stuff like that) I also have one more complaint: Sometimes in a lobby with my friends, and in game the game will just freeze up and that is a problem for me seeing as my computer has an i7 4th gen processor and a 690 in it.  I'm positive it isn't my internet because it doesn't happen on other games! It always fixes though, it isn't gamebreaking at all. Another thing, some reviews might say you NEED a controller for the game but that isn't true at all! None of my friends, including myself, don't use our XBOX360 controllers in the game. Yes, the game is a completely unchanged port from the XBOX360, but I mean comeon why does it matter if it says ""press x or y to attack"" etc., you can litterally press ESC and go into the controls, click keyboard and mouse, and change (or leave) the controls to your liking. What is keeping me into the game is the characters, pets, and weapons. You can unlock 31 characters, 79 unlockable weapons, and 27 pets that you can unlock. Each new character has a new design, a new magic, and sometimes a new weapon. Weapons are abundant throughout the game, whether you buy them, dig them up, have pets find them, or kill enemies. They also have buffs and debuffs depending on the weapon; for example it might raise your strength and magic but minus your defense. They also have ""special abilities"" which can do a multitude of things; shock your enemies, set fire to your enemies, increase critical hits on your enemies, etc. Now onto pets; Pets are REALLY cool, just like weapons they can buff you, or debuff you. They also have special abilities, such as; finding buried treasure, defeating enemies at low health, bringing you food, etc. etc. That's about all I have to say about this AMAZING game. I totally recommend that you buy Castle Crashers! I now leave you with the best sidescrolling beatem up to date! BYEEEEE			"

I liked that you had unlockable abilities that you could get from leveling up. I also liked that the plot was relatively straight forward but if you looked closely at the levels, there was a lot of humor hidden. I also enjoy the challenge of getting some of the achievements. The only thing I don't like about this game was that it was very difficult to figure out where you were (depth perception).			"

I've played through the entire game at least 5 times to date on the Xbox 360 so when I saw it on sale on STEAM I had to get it. The controls are so easy to learn that my 6 year old brother has played through and beat it with me once. As for the story, it is a satisfying length and funny as all get out. I highly recommend this game for the playability, story and the fact that it offers local co op as well makes it well worth the price.			"

Lots of little Easter eggs and fun things happening on screen at all times which will require multiple run throughs to fully observe everything that is going on.By far Behemoths greatest work.			"

Cute graphics style that makes you go Aww at times but still gruesome at others, intuitive controls and enjoyable gameplay with lots of optional things to do on the side. Even more fun multiplayer, wether you play locally, on one machine, or online.. Okay, the latter maybe not that much heh. Make sure you have a gamepad that this picky game will accept though, or else you are in for a world of ouchies. Zounds of unlockable characters, collectable weapons, items, li'l pets.. list goes on.			"

												If I can describe this with one phrase it would be, ""Love at first sight."" I recently bought this game because of the Christmas sale! And if I don't say myself, I haven't regretted it one mega bit!Very fun for a small group of friends.Skill wise, this is a fairly easy game, and is and can be done by a casual gamer.As for length, if you just want to beat the game, it'd take at least 1-3 hours.But if you'd like to unlock all the characters etc. well, that extends the enjoyment of the game, which is all the more reason to buy it!

												Castle Crashers. i first started playing it on the xbox 360 with my friends. when i saw that it was on steam i had to buy it.  what different for the 360 to pc is that there are more charactors to plan, and less DLC to buy. it all its a great game to play by your self or with other players.

Though you will only play it for 10 hours and those then hours will be great but after that the game doesn't really have much to offer so I would recommend you buy it on sale. Still a great game would recommend it 100%.			"

												Let me tell you a story.Playing this game with 4 friends on Xbox. We were semi good people so we were trying to give one friend the ""Kiss all the princesses in a multiplayer game"" achievement.  I was the Blue Knight, and had a fairly balanced build between Magic and Damage, with a little bit of health and dex thrown in, and I was using the Bi-Polar Bear animal orb.  The friend getting the achievement was the Orange Knight, and he put every point he earned into magic untill he maxed it out.  No hp or damage or anything.  We had another friend, playing the Fire Demon character and using the Rammy Animal Orb.  Incase you didnt know, rammy will randomly knock people down (I dont remember if it does damage or not).The final boss has just been defeated and now we must fight for the last princess. We planned on letting Orange knight win, but rammy had other plans. The second the fight started Rammy knocked down our Orange knight. I hit him once and because of his build it did more damage than expected and pretty much half healthed him.  I was backing off now, to let him win, but Bi Polar Bear went over and executed Orange knight. He was mad, and I got 15 minuets of straight laughter. 10/10			"

												Castle Crashers is a completionist's dream: you unlock characters as you play through the game with the ones you start with, and playing through with these unlocked characters grants you even MORE characters, and so forth and so on.  There are even crossovers into Behemoth's other games, most notably Battleblock Theater.  There are also weapons and pets to locate throughout each of the maps, and getting a few of them can be quite a challenge.  The soundtrack is also quite catchy; I find myself humming tunes from it throughout the day.Playing with friends is ideal, but it is possible to play the game solo.

												This game is a great beat-em-up with or without friends. The game tells a hilarious silent story and any of the characters can be built to have a different playstyles.I suggest playing with a controller as the pc controls are a bit iffy. Also I don't know if it is just me but at times I have trouble hitting enemies due to depth perceptionThe DLC is not worth it in my opinion unless you like the look of the new characters, these characters are average mechanically speaking compared to the others in game.

												Okay, Pros: Co-op, arcade style, fun with friends, fairly good animation, several different types of enemies, think outside the box art style, epic music, uniqe and old school style boss fights, and beleive it or not REALLY good story. Two more additional things, Behemoth, and I think Battle Block Theater should be on steam.Cons: CONTROLLER OR DIE, playing without friends is boring, difficult playing alone.Overall: Buy the game when its full price. If you have a friend (or a few) that want to play too, buy a copy for each of them too. Endless hilarity insues amongst your friends, the game itself, and soon you will be cackling over the micrphone about the endless laughs and enjoyment this game will bring to your life. End note: I wasn't kidding about ""CONTROLLER OR DIE"" if you want to NOT be confused by the game's UI, get a WIRED Xbox 360 controller. Trust me, it'll boost your gameplay experience by about hmmmm: 25%-60-ish%.			"

												The game has a really nice art style that totally fits it's theme. STORY : The story is pretty simple, a bunch of princesses and a crystal get kidnapped and stolen.It's up to the 4 knights (or 1 if you don't have any friends) to rescue all of the princesses and return the crystal.While doing it you will make out with all of the princesses ofcourse. Gameplay : The game is a beat-em-up that can be played both, singleplayer and multiplayer.You can perform different combos and shoot with a bow.There is a level system and a stat system in the game. There are 4 types of stats, Strength,Magic,Defense and Agility.It's pretty obvious what those stat's give you but the Agility stat not only makes you move faster but you can also shoot faster with your bow. You can unlock different combos by leveling up and different types of magic by leveling up your magic stat.The game has a pretty high replay value and it has an Insane mode after the normal mode. There are 30+ characters to unlock in various ways.There are also pets ( Animal Orbs ) and 70+ Weapons to find and buy.Cons : The combat can get repetitive and some levels are pretty frustrating if you play with a character that dies easiliy ( Archer/Thief).The DLC characters are totally worth their money and also the money from those DLC' go to charity.The only thing I didn't like are the controls, because it shows the XBOX360 controller buttons and not keyboard buttons.The soundtrack is great too.I give this game a9/10.It's a great game ^.^			"

												Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, let me be brief here.  Castle crashers is simple, pure ridiculous fun. It’s  side-scrolling beat-em up formula may not be that different from games of yore like Streets of Rage, but that doesn’t stop it from being one of the most hilariously fun multiplayer games I’ve had the pleasure to experience in a long time.  Cute graphics, cheesy soundtrack, combos galore and just enough depth (weapons, animal helpers, magic) to keep you interested makes one merry pie of a game.  Go buy the four pack, give copies to your friends, and have a blast on this.			"

Otherwise, if you just wanna have some fun with friends, buy this during the steam sale. Overall its a great game!			"

 Pure Fun! Castle Crashers is the best in its genre: a 4-player fun-fest adventure that leaves many memorable times together. The gameplay is light hearted, the controls are very fluid and character progression (attribute increases) are up to each players' discretion and directly correlate to each players' gameplay.The only negative issue that I felt throughout the game was that there are occasions where the background environment/camera makes it very difficult to see clearly.Overall, a must-have for any gaming group out there. It's well worth every cent.			"

Played it for about 20 hours and almost completed it, but I kept starting the game on a new character to level as the game is that good. It has amazingly fun aspects - 4 player co-op in story mode (also All You Can Quaff, so good) and Arena. It's gameplay is never repetative, and the story mode just seems to go on for ever, with challenging bosses and tougher enemies. I honestly cannot think of any negatives for this fantastic indie game, it has many weapons, characters, bosses, lots of humor and tons of fun to be had. A must buy.			"

												Castle crashers is a game best played with 4 players with all of them using xbox 360 remotes. It's hard [and sad] to play this game by yourself. Worst part is i have to use the keyboard. YES GAME I KNOW YOU WANT ME TO USE A 360 REMOTE BUT I DON'T HAVE THE ADAPTER. Fun game, great beat-em-up, but without friends and stuck to using the keyboard is just awful. I recommend this game to people with friends and an xbox 360 controller adapter.			"

												Brilliant Game!Dozens of different characters, most characters have their own attacks and animations.You level-up and choose the atributes of your character.It's a joy to play this game with friends, just like BattleBlock Theather, maybe even funnier.You can collect weapons, and cute mini-pets, all of them having different abilities.The story is really fun and simple, tho short. But it's worth replaying it with different characters.At 12€ it's a bit expensive but worth it, if it's below that price, don't even think twice.			"

												In short Castle Crashers is a great game with a nice graphics, funny jokes, great soundtrack, variety of enemies and lots more. The game is even better when u play with your friends. Though you will only play it for 10 hours and those then hours will be great but after that the game doesn't really have much to offer so I would recommend you buy it on sale. Still a great game would recommend it 100%.			"

												The campaign is great. I played all the way through with a couple of friends, and it was amazing. We found the best weapons, and unlocked all of our skills just by playing the story. Then we beat the game. We stopped playing after that. It has a fun campaign, but is pointless after that. You can replay levels, and thats about it. 7/10 overall			"

												Pros Castle Crashers is a 4 player, local beat em up brawler and is the game most people think of when they play brawlers. i have played Castle Crashers on both PC and Xbox. I rate the game very highly and it is the best of its genre of 4 player brawlers. this game is a great game to play by yourself but it is much more fun with friends and you can meet good people on servers of this game. the game has 2 difficulty modes normal and insane mode, and insane mode is very challenging. If you think hard isn't hard enough you can play the game without spending any level up points making it more challenging and this game is very fun when you set your own goals. the game is full of content with tons of weapons, characters, pets, and other unlock-ables to make the game worth replaying multiple times. the graphics on this game are great, it looks like a beautiful flash game and this version has great options for its sound, display, controls, rebind-able keys, and it has excellent controller support. if you on other games owned by the same company you unlock a playable character in that game example if you own battle block theater you can unlock hatty hattington. Cons The game is kinda short but its not a big problem because its replayable but still, you will get sick of playing the same levels so many times new levels would have fixed this problem  Leveling up to 99 takes too long, previously there were tricks to level up like the boomerang glitch, the 256 glitch, and other tricks but they have been patched and that HUGELY take away from the game, when i had played castle crashers on the xbox 360 the boomerang glitch was partly patched where the exp rewarding glitch would only work in the industrial castle and that made it easier to level up you could really level up fast if you did the trick with insane mode on but sadly that has been patched. in my opinion patching games are really good, game breaking bugs need to be fixed obviously, i had no problem with the 256 glitch being removed, making the boomerang glitch work on only one boss was alright, but i think that taking out makes leveling up stupidly long without out of game cheats. A few of characters use the same ability's example the grey knight and the cone head knight have the exact same magic ability's, and you need to beat the glitch specific characters to unlock other ones. ConclusionOverall its worth it and really enjoyable to play but the level up system needs at least a few more easy ways to level up it takes quite a long time to level up making the game very hard to fully complete. i would recommend a console version over the PC version because the level up system is simply better. i also recommend all the DLC it is worthwhile to pay for the new content, the pink knight DLC is worthwhile and the purple knight DLC is not as interesting as the pink knight DLC mainly because of one weapon (put simply because the broccoli sword is the best starting weapon), but still worth it. Castle Crashers is a must have in my opinion, worth every cent and is the definitive game of its genre.			"

												Probably the greatest game ever created to play with four friends on a couch in front of a TV. If you have a few controllers lying about and three friends to play with you I highly recommend you check out this super fun medieval beat'em up. Also features Online mode if you lack couches and/or friends.I should also mention this is another one of those PC/Console bad control ports so keep in mind that this game is really difficult to play with a keyboard.

												OMG THIS GAME IS GREAT! Play as one of the few starter characters work your way up and unlock new characters spells and even more. Battle your way through each level with tons of bosses for pretty much all the levels. Fight your way in pvp arenas in multiplayer and smash buttons till you break all of them. It's like flappy bird where flappy bird is annoying because you keep loosing but it's so addicting, Except this game isn't annoying, but you might get a little bit annoyed if you keep losing at pvp.

												Castle Crashers is a game that brings back the fun and excitement of all the flash games that we used to play online. Its hack n' slash gameplay is very well made and gets addictive rapidly. The art style is cartoony and really adds in a sense of humor that just makes the game that much more fun. Along with the vast assortment of weapons and adorable animal companions that can be found throughout the game, there is also an online matchmaking mode that adds a significant amount of replay value. If desired, strangers and friends can fight alongside you and help you complete the main story. Overall, I really enjoyed playing this game. If you want to be generous, consider buying the 4 pack so you and your friends can complete the main story together. This is definitely worth playing.			"

												Castle Crashers is a completionist's dream: you unlock characters as you play through the game with the ones you start with, and playing through with these unlocked characters grants you even MORE characters, and so forth and so on.  There are even crossovers into Behemoth's other games, most notably Battleblock Theater.  There are also weapons and pets to locate throughout each of the maps, and getting a few of them can be quite a challenge.  The soundtrack is also quite catchy; I find myself humming tunes from it throughout the day.Playing with friends is ideal, but it is possible to play the game solo.

I highly recomend anyone who likes games where you get to wail on anything in sight. it's amazingly fun, the levels are cool and the bosses are too. sometimes things can get tedious, but that's when you get your friends in your game to help you out through those parts! after the game there are so many things to do, you can go around and do a bunch of stuff like try to unlock all the weapons in the game, and go and try to unlock all the characters, and there's even a special ""Insane Mode"" which i haven't tried yet but I would have to guess it's a RIDICULOUSLY harder version of the game, and if so would recomend getting a band of friends to get together and play it.

												You play volleyball with bandits, you ride on deer that are propelling themselves with their own feces, and you fight a giant catfish.. 10/10. I made a video with a friend of mine showing the epic gameplay :D

												Castle Crashers is a fun game. The gameplay is simple, yet entertaining. Combos become available as you progress your character and each new move fits in nicely with the other mechanics. You level up each character separately which is both tedious and a reason to play even more. There's a decent leveling system and some interesting weapon stats. Each character plays through the story mode separately.The story is really nothing of note. It's the classic ""Damsel in Distress"" plot and none of your characters really differ from each other besides the element their magic takes the shape of. Most of the humor is juvenile at best and, from my experience, tends to annoy rather than entertain. All the cutscenes are unskippable, which means the game forces you to watch animals take a dump every time you load up that level. It's a good time-waster, but it's unlikely that you'll be able to invest any emotion into the characters or events. I sugest getting it to play with friends. 7/10			"

												******* SPOILER ALERT *******         This game was so good when i played it the first played it i was confused with the controls at first and how to pause it but i got through that. the player i recomend you use is the red knight he stuns the enimies with tons of damage if your magic is at the halfway mark. Now lets talk about unlockable characters those are like godsends so you dont get bored with the game with only 4 characters. You got the king the necromancer and that other person forgot his name no judge plz. The king if you want a healer you want the king  his magic is not great but if you are at low health and low defence he heals pretty good. Stats attack how much damage you do with weapons like your swords, defence how much health you can have and raises the damge you recieve,  magic self explanitory, agility how fast you run and how fast you can run if you want to unlock other characters you wanna beat the arenas and the final boss. some people you are gonna have to buy with real money but thats not worth it unless you wanna complete the whole game im not judging that. You can also play with other peple wich can sound nice but if you want to do that be prepared they are not gonna go easy on you. I also have a freind who wants this game so bad but does not have the money for it i introduced him to this game he wants it but i dont have any more money for him to get the game so if you want to donate money to him for this game go to  thekakapoopoohead twitch broadcasting channel i will have the link ready for the people who want to give him the stuff he needs to get the best game i ave ever played in my years anyway so goodluck there is alot more to tell you guys but you have heard enough goodluck.                                                                                   Go to the bottom of his stream and there is a little donate button and scroll down the steam thing you will see the donate and the game goodluck :)http://www.twitch.tv/thekakapoopoohead "

												This is one of the most terrifying games of our generation, with phyche-destroying elements such as bees, skeletons, popcorn monsters, aliens, sock puppets, the outdoors (including direct exposure to sunlight), giant insects, clowns, and interaction with the human female. This game will leave you a shell of your former self, and cause you to soil yourself more than any trip to taco bell.I give a warning to all those who buy this game.Rating:2spooky4me/10			"

												Castle Crashers is a decently priced side-scrolling multiplayer game and is excellent for both single player and multiplayer, (though I recommend multiplayer). The many different unlockables make the playback value very high. All-in-all, this game is an excellent contribution to the hack-n'-slash genre of games.			"

												This game is pretty good..... If you have a controller. The games that this company makes (The Behemoth) were clearly made for console gaming. But anyways the game is almost a button mashing game. Almost, but on a controller it's smoother and makes sense.Now onto the actual gameplay. The graphics are really nice, and the sound with it makes it better. The game is a little cheesy such as almost every animal poops, whether it makes it move or just a bird poop shower. The boss fights are fun and really do make the game challenging. I recommend playing this game with a friend, or just some random person in quick match.Overall I give it a 8.5/10.			"

												I wil surely recommend this for person who's looking for a game with sick♥♥♥♥♥humor, good Co-Op and standard arcade.I will say as a big Behemoth fan that this is as all of their other games, completely funny humoristic and crazy. This is the arcade game that every guy searching for some new things should try.I want to say gameplay basics are nearly complete, you can find some small bugs but nothing big, it's smooth and you can surely tell, that the designers have spent hours on this.Gameplay through can maybe sometimes be a little too simple as you can just smash your keyboard to the table and kill enemys, but at least they have made it nearly impossible just too boost each other because of you need to kill the enemys, and as longer into you go the monsters getting much harder to kill, so you cant just let a lvl 1 guy into a high level area.I do also really like their way of humour through characters you can play as since you can get some really funny and quite suspicious crazy homour like a knight that casts rainbows, and shoots penguins as spells i find the characters really fullfilled, through the lvling process could be a little more creative since it gets a little long in the end.Storyline is complety sick♥♥♥♥♥fun homour, as always as in a standard adventure game you need to rescue the princess, but in difference for many other games they have found a way to make it more funny, like the bosses are not just simple but also a funny sarcastic, like a cat-shark it's quite funny since cats dont like water.

You just button mash and beat the living hell out of enemies. The graphics are great and the game runs real smooth on my computer. The only I don't like about this game is the multiplayer. I can't find a single match to play online or it doesn't work correctly. For example if I want to play an Arena match with my friends it won't work correctly, it will put the person who made the match into the Arena but everyone else will be put into the beginning of the campaign. Other than the multiplayer this game is a ton of fun and I highly recommend it.			"

There are also unlockable characters, a buttload of weapons, a ton of helpful companions, and a few minigames, like a arena to fight to the death, also a gamemode where you eat as much food as you can.

												This game is honestly one of my favorite gaming experiences from the last decade.  I grew up playing 2D side-scrolling beat 'em ups in arcades (yes, those still existed in my day), but it has been quite a long time since I've played anything new in that genre.  Enter Castle Crashers.  This game had a ton of hype after its success on consoles, and luckily it lived up to that hype.  Castle Crashers is a beat 'em up with a couple of twists.  It adds combos to the combat system, which mixes things up and adds variety.  In addition the characters level up and have stats that you can put experience points into, as well as you're able to equip different weapons with different stats.  These RPG-like additions mean that you can play the game in different ways (rely on speed, heavy damage, magic, etc.).  This really adds to the game, and ensures that you have a unique experience.  While the story is a bit weak, the overall length of the game and the variation in game levels is phenomenal.  The game even offers a new game+ mode after you beat it.  This game screams multiplayer, but I played it predominantly as a single player due to a lack of friends interested in playing.  While I ran into no problems playing the regular mode as a single player, about halfway through the new game+ mode I found it too difficult to progress.  I suppose I could have grinded my character's level at that point, but instead I chose to start a brand new character and play the game in a different manner this time (I would rely on magic).  Overall this game is a joy, and builds upon and improves on the formula set out by such classics as Double Dragon and Final Fight.  This game is so good that it makes me wonder why it took so long for someone to rejuvenate the beat 'em up genre.  This game is fantastic and I would rate it a 9.5/10.			"

												Castle Crashers is a hysterical wicked excellent addictive beat them all mini game where playing accurately pays a lot. with a high replay value if you really get swallowed into the principle of unlocking everything for the pleasure of gaming. It takes more than a quick try to appreciate it in my opinion. Gameplay is simple but the game is really cool after all and I wrongfully judged it before to know it well. Definitly a lot of fun with good players. You must beat it properly once at least to access and understand what this game is about in hidden new game plus insane mode.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												Castle Crashers is a good ol' fashion beat 'em up with small twerks like magic and other things.A good idea is to not play alone, even another person with you will make the game more fun and easier. Another nice feature is having pets, pets give you a boost in something whether it be agility and damage, defense, increased xp gain, etc. Everytime you level up you gain 2-1 skill points but sadly its not a skill tree function. Instead you upgrade 4 stats, Strength, Magic, Defense, and Agility.I'd like to also point out the interesting art style that makes all the colors easier to see and more vibrant even though it is such a simple one.I have gotten into a bit of the game myself but I haven't beaten it yet but I shall reveal a small bit of the story.The story follows you/the knight you chose, and while you are rocking out in a castle a large scale invasion has happened by an orcish like creature and the 4 princess are captured. It's up to you and 1-3 other friends to rescue the princesses. Pets, level ups, new weapons, and gold will help you along your way.If you do decied to buy this game (It's 14.99 on steam store) I hope this review helped your choice!I rate this game 9.5/10			"

												This game has a nostalgic vibe of a classic beat 'em up arcade game. Its cute and memorable characters made the game amazing with each stage shows us a comidic foreshadow of an upcoming scene. It has a near perfect multiplayer mode as it enables us to play with friends both local and online. Although we aren't able to play online with oter people, it gives us an arena map where we play and elimate our friends and be the last man standing. Overall, the game is brilliant to play even in singleplayer mode, but more like to play multiplayer with friends.			"

												Not your typical bore fest side scroller. This game is fun, fast paced, and hilarious. You'll find yourself laughing at the slightest hints of humor. The graphics are fun and colorful and full of style, the sounds and music are entertaining and the storyline is typical, yet fresh with the cute additions of many characters and levels. I would highly recommend this game, especially the multiplayer feature, it makes playing this game so much better. 10/10			"

You just button mash and beat the living hell out of enemies. The graphics are great and the game runs real smooth on my computer. The only I don't like about this game is the multiplayer. I can't find a single match to play online or it doesn't work correctly. For example if I want to play an Arena match with my friends it won't work correctly, it will put the person who made the match into the Arena but everyone else will be put into the beginning of the campaign. Other than the multiplayer this game is a ton of fun and I highly recommend it.			"

												Castle Crashers is a fun game. The gameplay is simple, yet entertaining. Combos become available as you progress your character and each new move fits in nicely with the other mechanics. You level up each character separately which is both tedious and a reason to play even more. There's a decent leveling system and some interesting weapon stats. Each character plays through the story mode separately.The story is really nothing of note. It's the classic ""Damsel in Distress"" plot and none of your characters really differ from each other besides the element their magic takes the shape of. Most of the humor is juvenile at best and, from my experience, tends to annoy rather than entertain. All the cutscenes are unskippable, which means the game forces you to watch animals take a dump every time you load up that level. It's a good time-waster, but it's unlikely that you'll be able to invest any emotion into the characters or events. I sugest getting it to play with friends. 7/10			"

												This game is awesome! I'm a big fan of the cartoony style of the game, and if you like platforming games and RPG games you should like this. There is a lot of replayabilty, since all the beginning characters unlock new playable characters once you beat the main storyline. Most characters have different skills to use so the variety is there. I would not recommend playing solo, however. There is an online matchmaking system that connects you with other players, and it is much more fun to play with other people.Overall, buy it if you can! Especially if you can get it on sale.			"

												I have literally waited for years to see a PC port of this one, and wow, was it worth the wait! Cute graphics style that makes you go Aww at times but still gruesome at others, intuitive controls and enjoyable gameplay with lots of optional things to do on the side. Even more fun multiplayer, wether you play locally, on one machine, or online.. Okay, the latter maybe not that much heh. Make sure you have a gamepad that this picky game will accept though, or else you are in for a world of ouchies. Zounds of unlockable characters, collectable weapons, items, li'l pets.. list goes on.			"

												Very fun beat 'em up game with plenty of unlockable characters and some fun humour. Variety of weapons, magic, items, and enemies makes it even more enjoyable to play through. And if you aren't a fan of blood or gore, you can turn it off, too. Well worth checking out if you're into this style of game.			"

The game tells you the A,B,X,Y,LB.LT,RB,RT,START,SELECT,Etc. So yes use a controler is you have one.-Can get repetitive at times.All together this game is fun as hell. Pick this game up for 3.74 USD while you can it's well worth it. Also play this with some friends it's more enjoyable. Verdict 9/10			"

												Before I reveiw this game i'd like to give some backround as how I came across this gem I first heard of this game when a well known youtube channel called ""Game Grumps"" started playing it on there show steam train and I fell in love with this game and I knew I had to get it so I decided to get this game along with a few extra copies for a few of my friends and this game is an absolute blast Castle Crashers was originally realesed in 2008 later getting a steam port in 2012 Castle crashers is a 2-D beat-em up with some Rpg elements thrown in such as leveling up stats yet what sets this game apart from the standered beat-em up is 3 things the art style the music and its amazing humor the art style is very simplistic and colorful and it fits perfectly with the games over the top humor the music is truly something to behold an interesting thing is that the games music was made by people submitting there music creations on the flash site Newgrounds and lets just say it did not dissapoint the music seems to fit in so well with every situation in the game my personal favorite peice being Simple Sight by ""Real Fraction"" or the music when you fight the necromancer it really gets you pumped for a fight the games online is nearly flawless yet I wish the game would make it so it would make so the other players that join you would be the same or close to the same level as you  but thats just a minor nitpick i'd say that castle crashers has become one of my biggest gaming guilty pleasures and is well worth a second playthrough the game has great replay value and playing through the entire game from start to finish with one of my best friends is an expeirence I shall not forget I think that Castle crashers is a instant classic and deserves to be as popular as it is I highly recommend it			"

Castle Crashers was really fun. Really, really fun. For a simple hack-and-slash game, it's actually very impresive that Castle Crashers did not get stale, repetitive, or boring during the entire time I played it. Maybe it's because of the game's many, many unlockables. Maybe it's because of the gameplay's excellent execution. Maybe it's because of the kooky sense of style that permeates the entire experience.Developed by the Behemoth, Castle Crashers opens with your character (or characters, if you're playing co-op) dancing to the worst tavern music ever concieved, only for the party to be cut off by a lone knight, who tumbles through the door riddled with arrows and proceeds to die immediately. You go out to see what's up, only to discover that your castle is under seige and the four princesses have been captured!Thus begins one wild ride, with increasingly impressive boss fights and set pieces, all with a sly sense of humor. You'll fight your way through the land, searching for each princess, slaying fearsome beasts, and accomplishing great acts of derring-do.One of the most memorable and entertaining sequences has you crashing a wedding to save the Green Princess, only for her to be kidnapped again (by a mechanical cyclops, no less) and taken away. Not if you can help it! Your characters jump out of a window to land on top of the horse-drawn carriage carting the princess off. There, you engage in thrilling combat with several of the cyclops' cronies. But wait! During the battle, a humongous troll with laser vision begins chasing the carriage, gunning for you!I won't tell you how that ends, but rest assured, the entire game is epic and hilarious. There's a large variety of enemies, some easier to fight than others, and your strengths and weaknesses will be determined by how you choose to level up your character. The bosses are all carried out on the grandest of scales, and each one brings a different challenge to the table. The world is expansive and filled with interesting locales. There are tons of weapons hidden throughout the game, and players going back through some of the levels to explore will be well rewarded.Castle Crashers is an excellent entry in the Behemoth's game catalogue, and it delights from start to finish.9 out of 10.

												This game mixes crude humor, hack n' slash, and co-op into and great game that has a very fun and compelling storyline. Although the story is short, it makes you beg for more. Leveling in the game is not difficult at all, making the gameplay very enjoyable and not stale. No matter single or co-op it's scaled to be challenging but not impossible to beat. Something that bugs me alot personally is that collecting all the animal orb, weapons and heroes can get tedious at time. Definately recommend getting the game if you're planning on having multiple friends buy the game. One of the best co-op games out there today.			"

												This game is awesome! It has a great sense of humor, though things are still epic and serious. There are many characters to unlock which is always a good thing, and the pets are adorable (well, some of them, anyway o.o). The only cons is that it can, in fact, get boring after a while, but the fun can last forever if you're playing with a good friend. Talking about friends, the Online Multiplayer in this is pretty bad, not gonna lie. But I'll admit that that's because of some people's internet (not everyone's internet can be as fast as mine~).Overall, this game has many pros and very little cons, so I really recommend it. And to make it better, its 4 players! To me, that's perfect (not too less, not too many; though I do think they could of squeezed a fifth player in there.).			"

I don't think I could handle the comedy! Overall, this game is great and very unique, but it would be pretty cool to have more characters and maps in it, for it just straight up feels too short to be worth 15 dollars.			"

												I love this game! It's a fast paced, cartoony beat-em-up. There is absoloutely nothing wrong with that combination. WARNING If your gonna play the game on a keyboard, make WASD Your move keys, your mouse the attack buttons, and Q & E to block and shoot your bow. It makes the game work with a keyboard.

Overal some simple RPG elements that work well with the comic style. Enemies are widely varied and fun to fight. Bosses are INCREDIBLELove the catfish.

												Castle crashers is fun side-scrolling beat-em-up game with some crude humor. There are about 30 characters and around 80 weapons to use, each with their own magical abilities and different stats. At first, you only have 4 characters to choose from, but as you progress, you can unlock more and characters by winning arena matches or defeating certain levels. The story is very simple, but the gameplay is so much fun, that you don't even mind. As you start, you don't have many attacks, but as you level up and raise your stats, more combos and magic abilities will be unlocked. For me, grinding for levels was never really an issue, becuase your fighting most of the time anyways. As you progress in the game, you can find tiny animals that float around called ""Animal Orbs"". Animals orbs can give you different abilities that help you in battle such as raising you stats or being able to level up faster. There are also shops where you can buy more weapons, animal orbs, bombs and health potions. The online multi-player mode is very fun, but sometimes lagged for me. Although that might be just my computer. Just like other beat-em-up games, their are bosses and different enemy  types as well. Unfourtunaly, there are some glitches, but it is'nt a huge issue. Before you consider buying this game, make sure you have a controller compadable with steam, because playing this game with a key board is just imposible. In my opinion, this game is awesome. I've aready finished the game twice, so if you like beat-em-ups, I recomend you atleast play it once.			"

												Castle Crashers is a competitive co-op beat-em-up by the minds behind Alien Hominid. You and three friends travel throughout the kingdom ruining lives and crashing castles on your stubborn quest to save the princesses. There are tons of landscapes to traverse, weapons and characters to unlock, and princesses to kiss. You can even gain experience and level up your chosen knight. This has to be the best beat-em-up I've played in a long time, even coming close to beating Scott Pilgrim as my favorite. A great time alone, and even better with friends, Castle Crashers isn't getting outta here without a recommendation.			"

												Possibly the best multiplayer game I've ever played.The gameplay is incredibly fun and fast-paced, the combos are satisfying, there are multiple different character builds you can make using the level-up system, and there are  tons  of unlockables, such as new characters with different move sets, new weapons with different stats and special effects, and animal orbs (essentially pets) granting you lots of different bonuses, from increasing your character's strength, through ramming down enemies, to pecking away at knocked down enemies.The remastered edition (the edition available on steam) re-balanced lots of weapon and animal orb stats, and added a new mode called ""Back Off Barbarian"", in which you escape from constantly spawning enemies and get a rating based on the time you managed to survive.Although the game is intended to be played in co-op, it's perfectly playable and enjoyable in singleplayer.The game's controls work very well with a gamepad, but with some rebinding, can also be quite good on a keyboard.The only larger flaw the game has, in my opinion, is the lack of randomly generated levels and enemies, which would add a lot to the replay value. However, the game is still very replayable thanks to tons of hidden content, such as weapons or animal orbs, making you discover something new every run.The game's soundtrack is fantastic as well, with each area having a very fitting and enjoyable track.The game's art style might seem basic to some, but actually works very well with the game's gameplay and feel.Overall, the steam edition of Castle Crashers is a solid 8.5/10 for me. Would recommend to nearly everyone, even if multiplayer isn't necessarily your thing.tl;dr: The game is very, very good. Buy it. Worth it even at full price.			"

												It could just be that I picked up this game early on so my childhood memories are clouding my judgement, but I greatly suggest you get this game. Its cartoony graphic style is clean and sustained throughout. As a game, it doesn't take itself too seriously and is more a comedic game than anything. Controls are simple and responsive. Tons of characters and an online mode (even though nobody uses it). This game is just great! Don't have cash? Not to worry as its most likely going to be on sale in a couple days! And I mean a couple days from the time you read this, not the time of this being posted. It goes on sale like every other sale rotation.			"

												A really fun, and goofy game that can be enjoyable to anyone!  Also, if you want a true challenge, first beat the game on normal (Easy peasy lemon squeezy for me ;) ), then try it on insane mode where your combos, memorization of enemy movements, etc. come into play :D			"

												Castle Crashers is a fun, qwerky rpg with a unique artstyle. The gameplay will require you to work with your team and at times, allow you to become competitive. The game allows you to play with friends easily, and allows you to level up each individual character you unlock separately. A fun game, but can lag. It's as unique as it is challenging.			"

												A port of the XBLA original, Castle Crashers will take you across a hand-drawn journey with four other players on your side. Beat up hoards of baddies and fight for the princess's kiss. The music was created by the Newgrounds community and gives the game a distinct touch. A crazy amount of unlockable characters are ready to be found, leading to countless hours of content to help grind up your knight.			"

												I've wanted this game for a while, but didn't own an Xbox even though I've played it and thoroughly enjoyed it before.  Looking around on forums people are complaining about the price being the same as it was four years ago with no DLCs included, and being a lazy portover but I don't mind too much since I already use a 360 controller with other games.  It just depends if you want to play it on PC is all.  Hours and hours of fun, totally worth it IMO, won't need to wait for the sales really...One thing of note is that multiplayer is peer-to-peer, unlike other Behemoth games like Battleblock Theater which seem to use servers. If your or your friends' connections are weak (like mine), expect a lot of sync lag to add to your play time.			"

												Pros+ Solid side-scroller beat em up, just like the classics we seen from the SNES and SEGA Era such as Golden Axe.+ Some interesting power ups and unique magic spells for each of the 4 characters.+ Co-Op support.+ Not too-short and not stretched for too long. It has just the right decent amount of stages IMO.Cons- May feel reptitve. Even with the variations in weapons, you still walk to the right side of screen and mash buttons to kill enemies. I did not feel I wanted to redo any stage again.- I don't think you will enjoy this game without a co-op partner so keep this in mind.- Animation is choppy-ish as if you were playing an old Flash game.- Not much of a story or character depth. While I like it for being simple, but being too simple will make the player feel unmotivated to progress.Recommendation: If you like side-scrolling beat em up with co-op support, it worth to give it a try.

												Castle Crashers is a completionist's dream: you unlock characters as you play through the game with the ones you start with, and playing through with these unlocked characters grants you even MORE characters, and so forth and so on.  There are even crossovers into Behemoth's other games, most notably Battleblock Theater.  There are also weapons and pets to locate throughout each of the maps, and getting a few of them can be quite a challenge.  The soundtrack is also quite catchy; I find myself humming tunes from it throughout the day.Playing with friends is ideal, but it is possible to play the game solo.  Consider getting a pack that offers multiple copies			"

												This game is honestly one of my favorite gaming experiences from the last decade.  I grew up playing 2D side-scrolling beat 'em ups in arcades (yes, those still existed in my day), but it has been quite a long time since I've played anything new in that genre.  Enter Castle Crashers.  This game had a ton of hype after its success on consoles, and luckily it lived up to that hype.  Castle Crashers is a beat 'em up with a couple of twists.  It adds combos to the combat system, which mixes things up and adds variety.  In addition the characters level up and have stats that you can put experience points into, as well as you're able to equip different weapons with different stats.  These RPG-like additions mean that you can play the game in different ways (rely on speed, heavy damage, magic, etc.).  This really adds to the game, and ensures that you have a unique experience.  While the story is a bit weak, the overall length of the game and the variation in game levels is phenomenal.  The game even offers a new game+ mode after you beat it.  This game screams multiplayer, but I played it predominantly as a single player due to a lack of friends interested in playing.  While I ran into no problems playing the regular mode as a single player, about halfway through the new game+ mode I found it too difficult to progress.  I suppose I could have grinded my character's level at that point, but instead I chose to start a brand new character and play the game in a different manner this time (I would rely on magic).  Overall this game is a joy, and builds upon and improves on the formula set out by such classics as Double Dragon and Final Fight.  This game is so good that it makes me wonder why it took so long for someone to rejuvenate the beat 'em up genre.  This game is fantastic and I would rate it a 9.5/10.			"

												Really fun game for either gaming alone or gaming with others. Great in game visuals. This game is worth the price when it is on sale (Imo). This game comes with 3 game modes: Storymode, Areana mode, and Back-Off Barbarian mode. This game becomes competitive when you play with others throughout the game. You compete for experience (leveling up the fasted), most enemy kills, who gets the princess, money, and the number of areana wins. This game is fun when played with others or if you want to play it solo. If your into DLC then you may like the DLC is this game. The DLC is this game is cheap ($0.99 for 1 new playable character and 5 new weapons). This game has online multiplayer so if you have friends in Steam and you want to play together you can. Would recommend someone this game.			"

												A port of the XBLA original, Castle Crashers will take you across a hand-drawn journey with four other players on your side. Beat up hoards of baddies and fight for the princess's kiss. The music was created by the Newgrounds community and gives the game a distinct touch. A crazy amount of unlockable characters are ready to be found, leading to countless hours of content to help grind up your knight.			"

												This game has been a favorite of mine for quite some time. I've had it on the PS3 for a long time, however, I wanted to try it out on the PC. The text, imo, is so much nicer and it overall is a better, more fun experience. If you aren't sure whether your computer can handle the game, there is always the demo, which most games seem to not have. Recommended buy!			"

												Really fun game for either gaming alone or gaming with others. Great in game visuals. This game is worth the price when it is on sale (Imo). This game comes with 3 game modes: Storymode, Areana mode, and Back-Off Barbarian mode. This game becomes competitive when you play with others throughout the game. You compete for experience (leveling up the fasted), most enemy kills, who gets the princess, money, and the number of areana wins. This game is fun when played with others or if you want to play it solo. If your into DLC then you may like the DLC is this game. The DLC is this game is cheap ($0.99 for 1 new playable character and 5 new weapons). This game has online multiplayer so if you have friends in Steam and you want to play together you can. Would recommend someone this game.			"

												I love this game, if you haven't played it, it's best to try and play it with others who also haven't tried it yet. Going through it your first time as a group is extremely fun. It's fairly simple and short, but highly replayable, and the little cinematics remain enjoyable, and you may notice something you didn't before while doing another playthrough. It is a pretty button mashy beat-em-up, so if you want gameplay with a lot of variety, this may not be the best choice, Otherwise, hitting x a bunch of times and juggling enemies in the air from one side of the screen to the other remains fun. My only issue is the experience system. You get experience for hitting enemies (except when they've died and you're not letting their corpses rest peacefully), regardless of damage. If you are stronger than the other players, you will level up slower. This sort of inhibits magic users from leveling decently, since you deal high damage in few hits.If you look at the negative reviews, most of them are people complaining that the game is unplayable on keyboard. I first played the game on Xbox, loved it, eventually got it on PC and still loved it. Recently the A button on my controller got jammed after hours of a little game called Ys Origin...so now I use the keyboard. Guess what? I'm completely fine, the game is still entirely playable, fun, and not really any harder. The people complaining probably just suck...ignore them. The instructions do only show Xbox controls, making you have to test to figure out the controls, but you can map the keys you want to use anyway.			"

Many games can only have 1 player on each PC but this one can have 2-4 (if you have enough keyboard space). It is a good game for all ages.

 Pure Fun! Castle Crashers is the best in its genre: a 4-player fun-fest adventure that leaves many memorable times together. The gameplay is light hearted, the controls are very fluid and character progression (attribute increases) are up to each players' discretion and directly correlate to each players' gameplay.The only negative issue that I felt throughout the game was that there are occasions where the background environment/camera makes it very difficult to see clearly.Overall, a must-have for any gaming group out there. It's well worth every cent.			"

												The game has all of the original version and multiplayer feature allows you to play with friends all around the world. The game sets it up so that is's fun to play a level again and again. The bosses are memorable and exiting. You can play local or over wi-fi. You can use a Xbox controller, witch really makes the game more exiting. There is a lot of playable characters to unlock, there is also a lot of collectibles, such as weapons and sidekicks. You can only complete the game by replaying it more times and it is totally woth it. You will spend a lot of fun hours playing this game. I would recomed this game for gamers or casuals who like classic NES games or if you liked battel block theater (but they are totaly different). I wuld give it 4 of 5 stars.			"

												It is an old game but since i primarily game on a laptop I'm always looking for good games that can run on my system.Castle Crashers looks really good, play really well. The controls are easy to use both on the keyboard and xbox controller (although i keep accidently using my items from the tiny inventory) so this is great to play with friends with little or no gaming experience. Theres tons of weapons and all the upgradable character abilities are equally important which makes it a challenge to prioritize your skill points. The game is a good balance of difficulty, not too hard or too easy and theres a wide variety of enemies and bosses in an art style i really dig. After completing the game the first time round, Castle Crashers still has more to give. The addition of insane mode and secrets all over the map like weapons to dig up and animal orbs in the store makes sure you never get tired of this game. Very worth my money. Get it if you're bored, get it if you have friends coming over, get it if you haven't.			"

So Yes I Do Reccomend This Game BUT! Wait For A sale This Game Is A Bit Pricey! But Other Then That Perfect! 5 Stars! :)			"

												Jogo muito bem feito, que roda em qualquer torradeira sem placa de vídeo (tipo a minha) a pelo menos 30 fps, não exige internet potente pra jogar online e bem...sobre, o jogo mesmo...10/10- Uma ♥♥♥♥♥da de cavaleiros diferentes- É difícil zerar sozinho na primeira vez, o que pode incentivar um co-op dos brother- Humor de bosta (literalmente)- DLC's tem um preço aceitável, mas que não afetam em absolutamente nada a gameplay (como uma verdadeira DLC deve ser)- Diversos combos que você pode fazer com personagens e armas diferentes (fora os pets que sempre buffam alguma coisa dos seus atributos)- Acho que o único ponto negativo é a falta de comunicação com pessoas online, caso decida achar alguém aleatório pra jogar online. Fora isso, continua 10/10Recomendado pra qualquer um que tenha dinheiro sobrando na carteira ou esteja procurando por um jogo divertido em promoções.			"

												A port of the XBLA original, Castle Crashers will take you across a hand-drawn journey with four other players on your side. Beat up hoards of baddies and fight for the princess's kiss. The music was created by the Newgrounds community and gives the game a distinct touch. A crazy amount of unlockable characters are ready to be found, leading to countless hours of content to help grind up your knight.			"

												I've wanted this game for a while, but didn't own an Xbox even though I've played it and thoroughly enjoyed it before.  Looking around on forums people are complaining about the price being the same as it was four years ago with no DLCs included, and being a lazy portover but I don't mind too much since I already use a 360 controller with other games.  It just depends if you want to play it on PC is all.  Hours and hours of fun, totally worth it IMO, won't need to wait for the sales really...One thing of note is that multiplayer is peer-to-peer, unlike other Behemoth games like Battleblock Theater which seem to use servers. If your or your friends' connections are weak (like mine), expect a lot of sync lag to add to your play time.			"
