												I love vampire games and I will forgive them many things.However  no matter how I try and justify this game to myself the truth is I wasted the money I spent on it and the time I spent playing it.The voice acting is terrible, the combat is boring, pretty much none of the cool vampire abilities you would expect are in this.The story is just painful, seriously painful.But ofcourse this isn't the worst part of it.It is fair to say that pretty much none of the monsters will kill you, if nothing else the AI is too dumb for that.What will kill you and kill you alot is the most brain dead camera perspective.Expect to be killed by off screen boses, have all the directions mid platformer jump, run off a cliff due to sudden perspective change.Seriously if you want a Vampire game that is platforming and is an action rpg just go and find an old version of legacy of kain.Learn from my mistakes and dont waste your time or money on this painful experience.

												Well really did think this was going to be my sort of game and oh boy was i wrong.I have actually finished this game and overall found it to be a very frustrating experience,for starters the graphics are ok,the sounds ok,the voice actings ok and thats where it stops being ok.Most of the time when you get in fights including the BOSS battles (so called boss battles) you just mash buttons and hope for the best and its this way with most other things to,jump from one platform to another and it can sometimes be pot luck if you land on the platform of fall to your death.This game could have had real potential to be something other than what it is MEDIOCRE and thats really all one can say about the whole of my time with this game,and thats a sad thing-it will appeal to someone (all games do) and we dont all like the same sort of games,but i dont think that this game will really have a wide fan base and as the ending drew near i was like thank god its over and then ""HURRAY"" the typical ending for the sequel that hopefully will never see the light of day.

												I really enjoyed this game. It is right up my alley. If you're looking for a Game of the Year contender, this isn't it. But this is a simple, entertaining, fun little adventure that I would recommend to anyone looking for a little mindless fun.Quick summary:Fun, mindless hack 'n' slash. In terms of gameplay, it is similar to The Bard's Tale, which I also enjoyed.Takes about three hours for a single playthrough, and fun enough to go back to play to unlock different endings.Decent story for a video game, with branching story options, though generally quite linear.Some minor character upgrades.Simple loot system, where new items found are better than existing items, and it really only makes sense to save your money to buy the best weapons in the game towards the end. Gamepad controls reasonably intuitive.Graphics and voice acting are good enough.Very stable. Not a single crash.All in all, I would give it a 7/10. There is nothing in this game that is bad -- it's just not going to be on anyone's top 10 list ... except maybe mine.If this were a film, it would not be an Oscar contender, but it would be one of those movies that you'll just sit there and watch and enjoy whenever you see it playing on the TV years later.

												At first, you see the vampire chick with the classic ""high level armor"" and you're like ""Hey, let's give this a shot"".  Stay strong, don't do it.  There's better eye candy for less money on the Internet.  The game feels like it was made in a weekend.  It feels very guided, even for a hack and slash, Devil May Cry wanna-be.  While I appreciate the time it must have taken to make the game, it needs about another year of developing and overall reduction in the amount of things that say ""This is the first real game I created"".  If we were in 2003, the gameplay mechanics would have been right up there with the best of them, but the very few things that make the game stand out are very gimmicky and not maturely integrated into the game.  In almost a Frankenstein sense, they took three ideas that CAN work well together and mashed them all together into a game that is just passable.  The depth of the game reminds me of the first couple LEGO Star Wars games - very superficial.  The attacks don't feel powerful, either, which is a big pet peeve of mine.  Games like Devil May Cry 4 and DmC, when you hit an enemy, they appear to be jarred by your attack.  In this game I just didn't get that feeling of power in my attacks.As with any indie game, I really root for the developers and can overlook small issues, but I didn't really have anything solid to grab onto with this game.  I didn't really feel like I was doing anything for a purpose, it feels like the game starts about 30 minutes into the actual story and nothing really feels like it has a clear goal.  The character acting is not great, and while the game looks good, just like the pretty girls in high school, there's very little going on under the hood of this game.			"

												It's more action than RPG, with only a handful of side quests to distract you from the main plot, despite having mechanics similar to Diablo or Torchlight. There's loot, but it seems largely inconsequential compared to the ability upgrades that you'll receive. There's no way to max them out, though, as once your finish an area, enemies do not respawn and you cannot revisit them for more loot or missed blood coins.Which leaves us with a fairly short (5-7 hours) main story. It's by no means terrible, but its' the sort of thing that you'll see as a somewhat unintelligible direct-to-TV b-movie. The voice acting is generally well done, although some of the scripting strains credibility and intelligence. If you're not laughing out of embarrassment by the third time the priest says ""but first I will use my healing powers"" in the introductory battle, you're likely to cringe through the remaining dialogue. The limited dialogue choices do have an effect on the outcome of the game, and there is apparently an entirely different ending you can achieve, but don't mistake this for a particularly deep RPG.There are some platforming mechanics incorporated into the game and, while they do offer an interesting change of pace, their implementation are less than good. If you're using a keyboard and mouse, it will be an exercise in frustration as you leap to your death multiple times as often the next platform will be at an angle not recognized by your keyboard buttons.Graphics and animation, however, are fairly well done. It's at the very least a nice looking diversion for a few hours. I can't recommend paying more than $10 for it though.			"

												Very short game. I would call this a budget diablo game mixed with platforming elements. If i didn't play around so much, its possible to complete the game in 5 hours. By the time you get to the final boss you'll be op and clean the floor with him. The game isnt as bad as the community makes it seem. i completed the game with a controller, so maybe that helped a bit. Blood knights combat is pretty basic, lack of skills to obtain. youll basically be using the same 2 or 3 skills over and over, may get reptitive for most.I don't know if i can recommend this game to anyone, but for people who are like me who like a linier experience with a slight repetitious combat system then go right ahead and enjoy the get/play the game.

												Blood Knights pretty good game...Gameplay: The gameplay is unusual, namely, during battle, you can switch characters. Only two of the hero, one of them have the skills to melee and one ranged and is very comfortable. Good pumping capacity, as well as the selection of equipment, which can be found or purchased.BUT! Problems with the camera, the camera view is sometimes not comfortable for the game - it's one of game problems.Price: Game cost 14,99€, maybe would be price 9,99€. Better buy this game on sale.Story: Not bad story. Two people become vampires...Graphic: I don't know what to said about graphic. I think it's not bad for this game with her price.LoL, I got to know about co-op in this game when finished. So #facepalmP.S. Sorry for my English :3			"

												Blood Knights is possibly the worst game I’ve played this year. From top to bottom, nearly every aspect of this vampiric hack-and-slash is unapologetically bad, yet I find myself in an odd situation. As terrible as it is, and it really is, I enjoyed playing it.The game’s plot, which is often told through hilariously stagy dialog, revolves around a vampire-hating Templar knight who, for reasons never fully explained, gets eternally bound to a vampiress archer. Then the knight becomes a vampire himself, which really makes it a game about two vampires bound together. The obliviously shallow story continues all the way up to the game’s not-shocking-at-all ending.The combat consists of a regular “light” attack and two “power” attacks that are on cooldown timers. Characters also harness their vampiric magic to push or pull enemies and key environmental elements which sometimes became part of the game’s simplistic platforming segments. Feeding on the blood of enemies serves to replenish health and was probably the most satisfying aspect of the combat, however for reasons that are never explained away, strong enemies and bosses are immune to these powers.Hacking away with a sword and then seamlessly switching to Alysa in order to fire off a stream of arrows works well, but the action fails to evolve in an interesting way throughout the game. Boss fights suffer a yawning lack of imagination, with many encounters amounting to little more than working a strong enemy’s health down only to have them heal and send in a wave of lesser enemies while you rinse, wash, and repeat the process a given number of times.Worse yet, when bosses reach a “defeated state” the game cuts to a cinematic scene.The lack of transition and the speed at which these scenes engage is disorienting. Worse, when it happened in the middle of an attack chain ending the final boss fight it caused me to inadvertently skip the majority of the game’s concluding scene.While it’s okay to like a bad game, it’s not an excuse to call a bad game good.With so many true classics now available on download services, there is really no reason to pick up Blood Knights.Overall 4/10.

												There are janky games and then there is Blood Knights.3rd person hack and slash action RPG with a camera that zooms around as much as flies around a turd.Over-the-top voice acting of lines that'll make a 6th grade school play sound like the Royal Shakespeare Company.Digital cleavage in mini chainmail bikinis and a story about the moon crashing into the Earth...

												I recommand this game only if the following criterias are filled:[ ] This must be one sale (bought it 0.74€, won't be worth more than 5€)[ ] You shouldn't have any expectation. If you're expecting something like Fable, Castlevania or whatnot, well... This is not the game you're looking for.If you match both the critearias listed above, you're good to go.Pros:***Customization system (equipement and skill trees). Weapons and armors have a cosmetic effect on the characters which is a plus.***Ability to switch between characters at will (with a small cooldown). The two characters have different gameplay and can do have separate skill trees, skill points and inventory. ***The graphics aren't fantastic but they are FAR from ugly.***Fixed camera doesn't impair the gameplay (exception : see below, in ""Cons"" section)***Supports local coop multiplayer***Fun to playCons:***I needed 5 hours to complete the game, howlongtobeat.com says 4 hours. That is short.***Not a surprising game.Classic storyline, classic skills/upgrades etc... Nothing really original.***No ""New Game  +"" or replay value (except choosing different skilsl in the skill trees or collecting all blood coins)***Cheesy dialogues and sometimes odd voice acting***Doesn't support online multiplayer***[KEYBOARD ONLY] Fixed Camera + Platforming sequences = FrustrationI rate this game 65/100			"

												Not such a bad game. Focuses more on the action rather then the roleplaying and while the story isn't bad it's nothing you haven't seen before either. Just don't go into it expecting a deep vampire rpg rich with lore because it's 'not' that game.Gameplay is your typical story driven arpg, quite linear. Get shuffled down the corridor killing guys, hitting checkpoints and eventually coming to a cutscene. Sometimes this scene will give you different dialog choices but nothing changes the outcome of the game. Just elaborates on the current situation. The 'twist' here is you have 2 characters which you can swap between on the fly. Which does add something to the otherwise stale attacks. (standard, standard, special).Skill trees are basic. You get access to almost all abilities from the get go and can just select what you wish to put the points into as you level up. Collecting 'red coins' along the way will also allow you to bump up the characters basic attributes. Item randomness doesnt really exist. Had a couple of playthroughs and each time I received indentical loot from each chest (no loot grinding here). Voice acting will probably make you cringe a little at times with its stiffness but overall it's acceptable. Soundtrack is slightly higher quality but does get a bit repetitive.If you enjoyed Dungeon Siege 3 for what it was (not the dungeon siege we remember) and don't mind your vampires. Pick this one up when its on sale. Otherwise probably avoid as there is better options out there. Would definitely be recommending a 360pad for this game as well.			"

												Before we start let me use my healing powers..This game is overall something I have been wanting for a while but stopped for a few reasonspros: easy to learn         A decent story         A dynamic dialouge between your main character and your companion         Some really fun momentsCon: YOU DIE... YOU DIE BY FALLING OFF AN EDGE AND LANDING 1 METER....That of course happened right before a save spot, the issue with this game is that you're not allowed to save unless you find one of those save slots.. :( that's just a big no no from me... If just they had a fixed save like F3 for quicksave...due to that reason I am no longer playing it :( I will reccomend it, but not if you're bothered about the savings. so it's a neutral thumb for me.6/10			"

												Fun little hack 'n slash.  + Decent graphics, fun locations, okay story, short playtime. Game ran smoothly and without a single bug or crash. Some fun platforming puzzles. Music and ambiance is good, though nothing special. There are some branching narrative choices that seem to affect reactions and outcomes. - Linear progression. Annoying camera control  - as in, there isn't any. All movement is done via WASD on the keyboard, and the camera auto-rotates. I got used to it, but it felt unnecessarily restrictive. Other users have complained about the voice-acting, and yes, it is pretty terrible. Lack of tutorials - had to look up a walkthrough several times to learn a key combo so I could progress (when in doubt, try Shift + LMB).Not a must-buy, but if Blood Knights tempts you, get it when it is on sale for around $1-2. Otherwise you'll feel ripped off. There simply isn't enough content or replayability to justify the $15 retail price.			"

												For starters, I did not know what does it mean that when Kalypso is one of game makers it surely will be a mediocre title. Soon enough I was given an opportunity to experience that. Blood Knights is one of those vamphyric games that I like. Running along and killing bad guys, monsters, warewolves sure is fun. And it is in this game. What is more, graphics are really juicy, and beautiful. But when it comes to the story itself it is as shallow as a hole dug by a child in a sand with a little spatula. Come on guys, you could have done better! It takes about 4 hours to finish this game on medium level of difficulty. At this rate heroes have best equipement and burst through waves of enemies without sweat. Dear player, a fan of vampyric games,  if you are reading this, please mind that it would be better if you spend your money firstly on LEGACY OF KAIN series and then come back for BLOOD KNIGHTS.

												Wow. I'm really baffled reading all of the negative reviews this game got. Maybe I'm just easier to please than most people but I absolutely loved this game! It was a real gem. I was fortunate enough to get this on the steam summer sale for three dollars, but after playing it, I think it's worth the full price tag. From what I can gather reading the negative reviews, the majority of complaints seem to be that it's linear, a poor pc port of a console game, doesn't have AAA graphics, and poor voice acting. Other complaints are repetitive combat, boring musical score and poor story. These last three I strongly disagree with, and I thought the graphics were pretty good for a $15.00 title. First of all, I loved the story which revolved around a world where humans and vampires are at war for dominance of the planet. Some spell forges the souls of two enemies: your character, (a male human) and a female vampire, (admittedly this is never explained but it's supposed to help the humans turn the tide of the war somehow). They are stuck with each other and have to keep each other alive because if one dies, the other does too. Well, your character gets turned in the first chapter of the game, so now you are a vampire also, as well as your companion. I very much liked the dialogue and chemistry between the two main characters, which I thought was pretty entertaining. The combat was very fun. If you are anything like me, you will probably use the male, (former human) 70's percent of the time because he uses melee attacks which I find to be a lot more fun. However, you will find yourself relying on the female (vampire's) ranged attacks  more as the game progresses and the enemies get stronger. I found the combat to be very fun and fluid, and didn't get boring to me at all. I liked the two main characters and the story, which unfolded more and more as the game progressed, with an interesting turn at the end. The final villain, (who is not introduced until fairly late in the game) was very VERY cool, not just as a final boss, but as a character as well, and is accompanied by an awesome musical score during the final battle. It is my favorite musical score in the game! Sadly, my copy of the game did not come with the soundtrack. I would have liked to have put it on my i-Pod.  The aesthetics of the game were very visual rich, (if you read any of my other reviews, you will see that aesthetics are VERY important to me). I especially liked Noah's pass and the second to last level, which has the ruins of Noah's ark mounted in the sky on top of a mountain peak.  The controls were very easy to pick up on. I normally hate playing rpgs with controllers, perfecting a mouse and keyboard, but this game was incredibly easy to play with a controller. This is probably because it's not really an rpg. It is primarily an action, hack-n-slash, with only the bare minimum elements of an rpg included, (basically leveling up and earning gold for better equipment). There is also skills to be learned as your character gets stronger, but they are very basic skills. This game is fantastic for what it is: a very linear action hack-n-slash with a cool story and mediocre voice acting. The length of the game is roughly 7 to 8 hours on normal difficulty. This was just perfect. It told a neat sci-fi/fantasy story without being dragged out. If this has been longer, it might have started to drag out a bit. Here is some advice for anyone playing for the first time. Don't buy anything from the trader. All equipment you need can be found during the quest. Save all gold you collect until about 3/4 the way through and then buy the bada$$ sword called ""SATAN'S JUSTICE!!"" ...best name for a sword ever! LOL! I really get a kick out of that. I guess I never really thought of Satan as caring too much about justice. The only two flaws I can really think to say about this game is that you can't control the camera angle. But don't worry, it's not bad and the camera keeps focused on the action.......most of the time. (There was I think two times where the camera angle obstructed my character's path that I can remember). But don't worry, it's not as bad as other games like Garshasp, where the lack of control of the camera angle took some serious getting used to. Also, the platforming can be a bit annoying, but fortunately there isn't that much of it. Overall, I really liked this game a lot. It does not deserve the negativity that some people give it. I think people buy a game like this expecting the quality of a sixty dollar, AAA title and get disappointed, (I'm only speculating. I honestly don't know why it's gotten so much negativity.)  I hope a sequel is made.			"

												As of right now, I cannot recommend this game, at least at full price. I haven't tried the controller yet, but the keyboard and mouse controls are pretty bad, especially as the female/shooter vampire. I find her aiming system pretty hard to get used to, but I've had similar problems with similar controls. The voice acting is a bit shoddy, sometimes the animation is off, and some of the characters sound.. hollow, as if there's an echo behind them.That being said, once I get past the intro and become the actual vampire, it becomes a bit better. I haven't gotten very far into the game yet, but I WILL be trying it again, and giving it another shot with an actual controller, hoping that it's a bit easier to handle (it reminded me toward the end of my play session of the old Gamecube Baldur's Gate games, which means that I owe it to myself and the developers to give it another try).It DOES get a bit better as you continue to play, as you get used to the controls, so I'm going to give it another go and then edit this review after. As of right now, however, at full price I cannot recommend this. I picked it up for pretty cheap on the Humble Store during the Spring Sale (I would say around or less than $5, but I'm not entirely sure) and in my opinion if you get an hour of playtime per $10 price, you're at least getting as much time out of the game as you spent to buy it. So, if you want to try to grit your teeth and get past the difficult/clunky controls and just play a hack'n'slash, and you have the chance to pick it up cheap, you may enjoy it. You may not.  "

												A halfway decent game, I'd recommend it more strongly except for a single really bad design choice, but I'll get to that in a moment.Story was standard but enjoyable. Voice acting was fairly poor, but worked alright with the writing style I think so I didn't actually mind it that much. Environments were beautiful and varied considering the size of the development team. Gameplay was pretty good and the combat was responsive and seemed to be balanced really well. I played on normal and still died a fair few times, but always because I was stupid in combat rather than because of anything out of my control. Navigation was a bit of a pain at first, but I got used to it slowly. I did enjoy the different characters you could play and swapping between them during combat turned out to be useful. I thought it was just going to be a gimmick at first. It had some RPG elements, but nothing too great. Just inventoray management, limited skill and attribute leveling and a couple of story decisions that really didn't make a difference in the long run.What I didn't get used to was the directed camera. I HATE directed cameras and it served no purpose in this game except to make some areas more hidden than they would otherwise be and to make combat more difficult. When an enemy is in front of me, I want to be able to see them, not have them hidden off my screen by a camera that randomly decided to zoom in on my character cause I entered a particular section of the map. I think directed camera's are one of the worst design decisions a developer can make, and it annoyed me throughout the game.If you want a quick, fun dungeon crawler and don't mind a directed camera, then I would recommend this game. Otherwise, you may find it too frustrating with not enough good elements to make up for it.			"

												LOVED IT !!!Love this game, had NO expectation & glad i didn't cause it has made my day & i want more of this.This game is fun, has some simple to understand features that ANY1 can understand N move forward.I know the voice acting can be cheap sounding some times but it can also be funny.The game isn't difficult at least not on normal & the combat isn't the greatest but i had a blast once i figured out how to switch between both characters to get the most out of the game play.I will definitely play this through on the harder level & try out the coop.It doesn't have a long Play through, i like to take my time, but as others have said this game prolly takes 7-8hrs if ur good @ it.Graphics are decent, they're not killer but this isn't a killer AAA title either.This isn't ur typical rpg, it's an action rpg with little dialogue & some may say not enough action but i found it was a good mix for me, some times i'am NOT in the mood for reading much & just want to kill ShhhhiiiTTT & this had what i like.This could be compared to van helsing in a way, it's far less complicated & not as graphic hungry.Overall i'd say this was worth the $ i paid & if it was as long & detailed as van helsing i'd pay full price no problem.I really enjoyed it & WANT to see a sequel to it.Overall i'd score it 7/10 & recommend it to friends.

												I wouldn't recommend this game for single player. The story is really cheesy, but your choices seem to not influence the story. Dialogues are written badly and synchronisation is out of character most of the time.On the good side you will have some fun in local Coop, besides the bugs and aweful camera . I think it doesn't scale with player number which make it too easy.If you can get it for a low price and want some fun nights with a friend in you basement it's adecent choice.7/10 (Local Coop) "

Review in English/Spanish Análisis en Inglés y Español: English:  There isn’t much I can tell you about Blood Knights; it looks like it could be good for some couch co-op action but unfortunately the game refuses to run or runs very poorly with constant hiccups and horrible slowdowns. This can be solved by updating your OS or so the devs claim but that didn’t help my issue at all. Buy at your own risk. Español:  No puedo hablar mucho del juego ya que no puedo hacer que corra correctamente en mi máquina. Parece ser un juego entretenido en cooperativo pero se rehúsa completamente a funcionar de forma adecuada, se congela, va lento, en fin, es todo un dolor de cabeza. Estos problemas se solucionan actualizando el sistema operativo pero en mi caso no es algo que me pueda permitir. Cómpralo bajo tu propio riesgo.			"

												I only write this because I thing the game it is rated here to low. Bought it for %50 it took something like 6 hours to play through. I think that it is a short but good game.Played only single player with keyboard and mouse.Changeable controls would be better but it was still quite playable with the fixed key setup.It didn’t crash a single time. Sure there is a lot of potential to improve it, but this is always the case. In the time you play the campaign it will rarely happen that you think, well that should have been made different / better. For example the “fixed” camera can sometimes be a small handicap. Or you get new armors and weapons really fast in the beginning and to the end you get far less. (There are only three kinds of armor designs per character so you will get old designs with better stats later...) "

												You're a knight of rome who gets bonded to a vampire, while fighting something goes wrong and you get turned into a vampire too, now you're stuck to your vampire partner till the bond is broken. This is where blood knights begins.Blood knights doesnt look particularly pretty, or plays very well, the platforming is downright horrible and you can tell its a low budget game. It also feels very sluggish like the game itself is slowed down, but thats not the case, its just how the game is. It takes a while to get used too. I wouldnt recommend this if you want AAA+ titles, this is done by a team that probably had a very low budget. But its story and combat is quite fun, overall, I had fun playing it from beginning to end and thats all that matters to me. Certainly worth my money, and I hope to see a sequel that has a bigger budget.			"

												First, I'm going to preface this review with a couple notes.  If I could I would give this game neither a thumbs up or down.  So the best I can do is give it a thumbs up but I'll also give it a 4 out of 10.To sum up what this game is, a poor man's Castlevania.  It feels like there is a rich world to explore but ultimately falls flat in showcasing it.Character progression is done through leveling and assigning points to various passives and finding predetermined gear scattered throughout the linear levels.  Ultimately you will be using the same attacks and strategies the entire game.  Though I suppose the progession doesn't have to be too deep considering how short and easy the game is.The voice acting is atrocious.  You will either become very annoyed any time someone opens their mouth or you will get a good laugh in between combat sequences.There are worse games out there but Blood Knights isn't a whole lot better.  If you love vampires this game will quench your thirst (pun intended) for a few days.  15$ is way to much for this title though.  I picked it up in a bundle that is still available here: https://www.bundlestars.com/en/bundle/rpg-heroes-2-bundle "

												Blood Knights is a game based on that you actually play it co-op with a friend.I did indeed play it with a friend and well, we enjoyed it while it lasted. Full 3 hours. Yes thats the whole game.Anyways, the gameplay is quite okay, just mash buttons over and over. But there is a cool feature where you can grab people and push them around in the air and or away. Thats possible too with your friend so you had to do , lets call them little riddles, where you had just to push your friend up, then he you and that over and over until your upstairs. A little bit funny to push your friend instead down a cliff and get him killed. Very funny indeed. Anyways, there is an upgrade system that is completely useless. Like 3 % Crit chance etc. You can buy and sell loot , but mostly you didnt had to. Game is pretty easy . The story is okay, i liked it, but nothing really impressive. The story behind the vampire and templar that have to work together should have made a cool story, but well the dialogue sucks, pretty uninterestening and boring. I had my fun with it, but only because it was so short and stopped when it got boring. If you are looking for a quick co-op game for the evening, go ahead and buy it at a sale. Otherwise no i cant recommend it.4/10			"

												As much as I would like to be able to recommend this game, there just isn't any good reason I can think of. So much potential seems wasted on this title I feel. It was a wonderful idea that somehow got mutilated into a horrible shell of a game. Lag is ridiculous due to optimization issues I assume, (no matter how nice your rig). Control reaction is absolutely horrid, it's as if your character has a 1 second lag on reaction time which makes for near impossible gameplay. The storyline leaves much to wish for and seems very choppy and forced. Voice acting and animation is terrible, no sync at all. I really wanted to like this game...I really did. I can't honestly say I recommend it for any reason though. As I said, it just feels like a hollow shell of what was a wonderful idea for a game. Final verdict, 3/10			"

												A very fun, polished little Action-RPG that is short, sweet, and to the point. Don't expect a decent story, or voice acting. What you can expect is solid, fun, polished gameplay, and a moderate challenge depending on what difficulty you play on. A healty amount of weapons, abilities, and a reasonable amount of content for the price. I completed it in a couple of sittings, took me around five or six hours to complete, yet for the time I spent with it, it was rather enjoyable for what it was.			"

												Blood Knights tries to be a fancy, humorous ARPG, but fails to live up to what could potentially be a good game. Cringe-worthy dialogue, wooden main characters, oftentimes uncooperative controls, and boss battles that only challenge your kiting abilities is what to expect if you play this game. I had hoped, by the positive reviews, that the game would be able to entertain me. It was hard to take the story and script seriously, especially with the development of the two main characters and how it basically flipped like a switch from ""sworn enemies"" to ""fast allies"". I also use the term ""main characters"" loosely, because Jeremy (male protagonist) has much more dialogue and screen time than does his counterpart, Alysa - the vampire with whom he is bonded.I wanted to like the game, and came in with high hopes. I cannot recommend it, however.			"

												This game was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed the fluid combat, the vampiric powers, and some of the character designs. There's a very basic save the world plot which drives you forward, but it's not all that interesting. It does what it needs to do (serve as a reason to go from area to area) and no more.There's a nice array of enemies which require different tactics to defeat, and some fun bosses.In all honesty, the only thing I didn't enjoy were the short platforming sections - simply because it was so easy to miss and fall to your death. Luckily, checkpoints can be found frequently, and you can revist them to update your save; as well as visit the trader.I played this with an Xbox 360 controller and it worked fine. No idea what it's like with a mouse and keyboard. Don't want to think about it.One strange thing which kept happening to me, was things looked like they were stuttering or lagging, but weren't. It's really weird and difficult to explain. It didn't affect gameplay in any way, it just looked like character animations were a bit stuttery - it could mainly be seen during cutscenes. However, like I said, it never influenced gameplay in the slightest; button input and commands were fluid and everything was responsive. A shame the game wasn't more fleshed out.I recommend it to people who enjoy loot driven rpgs, similar to Diablo, but who want to play as a blood drinking vampire.			"

												I'm actually enjoying this game more than what the reviews on Steam give it credit for. However, I can understand why people would suggest that it is a poor game. However, having only bought this from the Indie Gala Blood Knights Bundle because it was a part of the Steam Trading Cards program I have to suggest that it's been worth my while. I'm not certain that I'll finish this but  for now I'm satisfied.It's your typical A-RPG style game. The camera is a negative - I wish it were controllable but it apparently isn't. If there are ""secret"" areas that can be found the camera is a hindrance in that department. The first boss battle was more pot luck mashing buttons than knowing what to do. The game tells you to destroy the alter but doesn't give you anything else to explain how to do so.If you don't expect an epic game, it isn't, you wont be disappointed. I can think of many other games that are worth less time than this one.			"

												I don't get a lot of the hate for this game, although I'd buy it on sale under $10. I liked: Decent story, switching between the two characters is cool,  solid hack n slash,  upgrade/level up system and special moves,  good orchestral music, short but sweet campaign (5 hrs)  that doesn't overstay it's welcome.  Controls are good too although you can't rebind keys on the 360 controller. The minor thing I dislike is the bad voice acting from the main character Jeremy and and most of the other characters...other than that no big deal. Also If you're having framerate problems like I did just download any and all windows updates then restart your system. Then it'll play a solid 60fps. "

Bad points: the control is terrible (given that it's a console port, why is there no controller support?), the unlockable/level-up abilities are really bland, and you get the idea after a while that half the point of the game is just to have the female characters run around in tight outfits.Not a terrible game, but not a great one either.

												I like this game.  Which is not to say that it is a good game.  The voice acting is terrible, the maps feel cramped, and the one time I made the mistake of playing it in front of another person I felt like they were watching me doing something embarrassingly private.  But when I'm by myself and I've got my controller handy, I am 100% down for a fast-paced, strategy-fueled session of pure, unadulterated violence.			"

												This is a great game, love the story and feel of the game, only complaint would be camera control, reminds me of Resident Evil in that regard. Would love to see more story as possible dlc? Differently has replay value as you can choose different responce that will slightly change the course of the game.			"

												This game?  This game is OK.  The animation is shoddy (your main dude stomp-runs comically), the voice acting is horrendous, the action is rudimentary, and the characterization is almost non-existant.  What it reminds me of most is an early PS2 game, and that's what I enjoy about it.  It's simple, which is to say not overly complicated, and fast paced.  You're spending most of your time here hitting vampires without having to concentrate on anything else, and sometimes that's all a game needs.			"

												My biggest complaint with this game is the game is shorter than I'd like it to be.  I actually love short game, and got this game because I thought its short.  But just when my characters got good enough gears, and I started to like the characters, the game ended. I just feel like I wanted more.AI bug, that's one phrase that I have forgotten for years until I played this game. Sometimes, when you go out of range of enemy, they retreat to their original position. But as they are retreating, you attack them(with range weapon), they will come back and attack you.   And you just adjust the distance between the enemies and you.  Once you get to the right distance(sweet spot), the AI don't know if they should retreat or attack, so they will keep turning back and forward, and now you can keep attacking them without worrying them attacking you.One thing that I really didn't like about this game is the camera angles, it gets annoying when you accidentally jump off ledges because of bad camera angle.  As for other aspects of the game, like soundtrack, voice acting, and graphics, I have no complains, pretty mediocre stuff, but good enough for me.One of the best thing in this game is the ability to switch between characters; being able to switch between range and melee characters make the gameplay much more fun and interesting.  But what I love most about this game is the characters and their interaction; more specifically, their cheesy dialogue, really funny.  It's just what I expect from game like this.  I mean, who doesn't like a game with vampire story lines, even if it is a cheesy one.I know, it seems like I wrote bunch of bad things about this game but at the end recommend it(I should really stop doing that, maybe that's why my reviews get lots of not helpful votes, lol).  Well, when I think about it, I really want a sequel of this game(as long as it's not worse than this).  I want the same characters with cheesy dialogue and the mindless hack and slash(with exploitable AI bug). It was a fun game nonetheless despite all the flaws.			"

												This is kind of a difficuly game to review. There is a lot wrong with it but at the same time it was at least mildly entertaining enough to keep me interested enough to finish it maybe it's because it's the kind of game I like.This game is an action third person perspective game, that has some platforming, and RPG-ish qualities. The camera is fixed and cannot be changed by the player so in a sense it is similar to Ninja Gaiden/God of War/Devil May Cry, but is no where close to those games in quality. There is thankfully no backtracking in this game, but it is very much on rails, though there are hidden areas in levels where you will find some loot and blood coins used for upgrading your stats. Loot from the chests in the game are not randomized but fixed so you will get the same loot every time from the chests even if you die and reload from an earlier autosave spot. Also the best weapons are sold at the merchant not found as you play. Saves happen at fixed spots and you cannot save whenever you want. There are 2 playable characters both fight differently. The Male one is a melee fighter and has some rather limited set of moves and can dodge. This makes the game play similar to Ninja Gaiden, but unfortunately the controls and combos are severly lacking. You upgrade your weapons as you find them but the animations are the same always and no effects happen from them even if it looks as if you have a flaming sword. There aren't any good fighting counters or timing of strikes, like you find in the better action games like Devil May Cry/Ninja Gaiden/God of War, so it's basically a button masher. The female is a ranged fighter and has no dodge, but the playstyle then changes from a Action fighting style to basically a twin stick shooter type game. Overall it is a less interesting way to play, but at the same time makes the game much easier. The problem with either playstyles is the AI is dumb as rocks. You get into range they swarm you, you back off to a certain point they retreat back to their starting positions. This makes the ranged fighter extremely easy to play, and the melee fighter lets you get out of danger temporarily. This decreases the tension and the preceived danger of encounters. The platforming parts can be a bit of a troublesome thing because of the fixed camera. There were a couple of times where I died for no other reason than misjudging the distances due to the camera angle. Some spots looked as if it were possible to make it but you can't unless you hit a switch. So in general you see a switch press it and see if a platform appears.The story is okay. It's a vampire vs humans genre, and isn't that bad overall. The game's budget really shows here though as the voice acting is at best passable to bad throughout the game. I might have enjoyed the story more if it had no voices at all because sometimes you just cringed at some of the dialog being delivered. There seems to be some choices to be made as you go that contribute to alternate endings than the one I saw but I only went through the game once. With that said this is probably the only limited amount of replay I see in the game as the fighting and loot system don't seem to be something I would want to replay it for.Pros:Decent storymultiple endingscontroller supporteddecent graphicsbargain priceno backtracking or much filler ""quests""Cons:Bad voice actingFixed camerapoor AIpoor fight systemnon randomized loot in chestsbest weapons bought not foundplatforming can be problematic with the fixed cameraShort game length (approx 5 hours) with limited replay valueSo overall I have to say I can't recommend the game, the cons outweigh the pros, but it at least held my attention enough to finish the game which is why I said it's kind of hard to review the game. The short length could be both a pro and a con in this regard. A pro because it keeps you on target to the end and doesn't unnecessarily bore you with filler side quests to artifically increase the game game length, and a con because it makes the game feel kind of short.

												So, yeah, this game is really repetitive, has terrible voice acting, has graphics that are long out of date, has a main character that is a total♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ has a plot line that you would have seen so many times before....I freakin' loved this. I love vampires, especially the stereotypical sexy ones who are always scantily clad women. I didn't have to engage any brain cells rearding gearing or skilling up my characters because it was so basic, so left my mind free to ponder important things such as what I was going to cook for dinner that night. And then there's Jeremy... my God this character is a work of art. I have never come across a main character who is so unlikeable and yet amazing all at the same time. It's impressive really. He's such an idiot, constantly contradicting himself, and the way he speaks to women just smells of dirty old man. All in all, I'd recommend this if you're looking for a bit of brain dead fun, if you can't decide what game to play next, or if you're looking for a laugh (the addition of alcohol may make this an even better experience). Yay, Blood Knights! :D			"

												My God this game is bad... I love vampires and the idea seemed nice enough. The game, however, does everything (and I mean everything) wrong.Let me elaborate: - AMBIENCE: While graphics don't really matter to determine weather a game is good or not, game design does. Repetitive scenes and missions make you feel like you're doing the exact same thing over and over again. If that was not enough, the music is not engaging at all, more like a 1 minute sample playing over and over again.- CONTROLS: How cool is this ""change character"" thing? Well, if only it worked. You will find yourself in a mess of control scheme that, while unresponsive, manages to be confusing and repetitive.- RPG ELEMENTS: Heh? No... there are none. - THE CHARACTERS: A regular warrior and a regular archer - not vampire, archer.Do yourself a favor and skip this. I've never written any negative review before but I've gotta say this one's done it.			"

												Blood Knights is a very fun hack, slash and shoot 3rd person action RPG that plays great with a controller.  It sells for a ""budget"" price but it is really a well-made game.  The gameplay hook is that you switch between two characters on the fly, a ranged character and a sword fighting character.  They both play well and add variety in the single player campaign.  Graphically the game is pretty, the gameplay itself is smooth and you travel to the typical medieval locales and they all look good.  The character models are solid and all of the equipment and weapons you find reflect visually on your characters.  The cut scenes look nice, a little plain but they work, the ladies look like a teenage boys idea of fantasy women but it worked for me.  The voice acting is a bit wooden at times however the action sounds really add to the immersion, the music never gets repetitive.  Story wise its vampires vs the church, you do have some dialog decisions but nothing that really changes the outcome of the game, but it still gives you a chance to leave your mark on the adventure.  The game is a bit short at only 6 hours but for the price it’s fair.  My only complaint is the camera is fixed, this never hampered gameplay for me, but in 2014 not having a camera to move around is really strange, I’m guising this is where the “low budget"" came into play.  Overall Blood Knights was a fun if short adventure, and I enjoyed my time battling the vampires and undead of ancient Rome.  As they say, when in Rome turn into a vampire and hunt other vampires, the undead and pompous romans, or something like that.			"

Reccomend you pick it up on sale though as the current retail is a bit high for a 3 year old game.			"

												Surprisingly enjoyable Hack 'n Slash with a decent story. One of the good games from Kalypso and there are not many of them! You are a knight fighting for the Church, which worst enemies are vampires. Unfortunately one day you become one of them. You need to decide if anything human is left of you.Audio6/10Graphics6.5/10Gameplay6/10Story6/10Time to beat4.5hrsSummary6/10PROS Boobs Vampire boobs Vampire butts Graphics may not be the best, even for 2013, but they are definitely not bad  Equipment management Findings Maaany weapons and each of them looks different and pretty cool in its own way Diverse enemies Pleasant combat system with different skills and attacks There are 2 characters and you can play both of them You can play in coop on a single PC. Quite challenging. Not too easy, not too hard as well. I haven't experienced any bugs or glitches. (Maybe just one) So the game itself is probably pretty well made.NEUTRAL I am glad there is voice acting, but this is rather low-budget game. You can hear that voice actors are not top-notch. Overall game is well optimized, but it can get laggy for a moment (happened to me maybe twice?) Decent story, but probably you will forget it in a week. There are couple of story gaps as well. The main characters are trying to be funny to often. The jokes are not pathetic, but I cannot say I laughed a single time.CONS The camera work is frustrating. You cannot control it in any way. Sometimes you just fail, because you fell into a trap or a abyss, cause the camera was badly positioned. Boss fights. I was expecting something more challenging. In most cases it is enough to run, shoot arrows and throw bombs at the boss. Make it last 5 minutes and every boss is defeated. There are parts of the game where you do not excatly know what to do. And you are just wandering and jumping around till you finally find the solution.

												One of the worst games I've played in a long time. It is horribly generic. I bought a $3 bundle with this game in it because it looked good in the videos on the store page. It is a flawless example of good looking video then you actually play it and it's sh-ttingly bad. Its regular price of $15 is laugh out loud funny. The combat is extremely clunky and generic like something you would find at the bottom of a flea market bin like a unknown action game from 2001, and a bad one at that. If I had to pick a game to describe what ""cheap feeling"" is, this game is it. The voice acting is some of the worst ever and the sound and music are instantly forgettable. The graphics are dirt poor and the character mouth and body movement in cut scenes looks like sock puppets. All you do is hammer X to attack and press a few other buttons for skills. I'm not saying that that is what makes it bad though. There are a lot of great games that are button mashers. But when a game is this terrible, the fact that you mash buttons the whole time gets easily amplified into a hugely negative aspect because combat is so incredibly clunky and generic.If you like sock puppets and soul crushingly generic gameplay, stop wasting time reading this review and buy this game right now. If you want a similar type of action button masher that actually does things right and has a good high quality feel to it, buy RAW Realms of Ancient War. That is just a good one off the top of my head. There are plenty more if you look. Don't look here though. It's like paying $15 at the carnival to go looking into the freak show to see something cool and all there is on stage are two guys fisting and blowing each other.3/10			"

												There are those games who do have potential and are somewhat fun, but fails in the end. Blood Knights is actually such a game. The biggest problem in Blood Knights is the camera, which is clunky at it's best and not accurate at all. In the beginning i had this problem of instead jumping on a platform above you that my char falls into the big black hole. And that happened a couple of times in an other level too. The dialogue gets on your nerves sometimes. The fighting is ok i guess. The AI however is as dumb as an ox.No, Deck13 didn't do a good job this time. Now Venetica was also not everything, but that one was better.Nevertheless it's a little fun game to play, if you look past the errors. Characters itself look quite good and the landscapes are interesting. Story is ok, not very interesting. But that camera, that nails it. And that dimwitted dialogue. If you're a fan of vampiregames and look for a game to play with a vampire, then there are better options. Vampire the masquerade: bloodlines for rpg and the first 2 BloodRayne games (available at gog) if you want an action game.  If you just look for a little fun game, it might be worth a try.I would suggest then to wait till it drops in price or there's a sale. If i recommend this one? Not really, but it just depends what you expect.			"

												As far as RPG hack 'n slash games go, this is OK. It's a rather short game at 4 hours but there are three total endings so I guess it could be 12 hours to see everything. I never played coop so that might add some fun to the game.Pros:- Fairly responsive controls when not getting knocked down over and over- Complex levels with platforming and puzzles- Quick swap between characters allows varied play stylesCons:- Enemies are boring and easy- Every boss fight can be won by straffing around as Alysa and shooting her crossbows. I beat the last boss without taking a single hit.- Glitching through ground often which instant kills you- Voice acting is TERRIBLE. Some of the worst I've ever heard.It's ok if you can pick it up really cheap and maybe even more fun (because of how bad it is) to play with a friend.			"

												Blood Knights is an Action-RPG so cheesy that if it were a movie, it would be something that airs at 3 AM on the SyFy Network. Enjoying  Blood Knights requires a fondness for ""So Bad It's Good"" games. Those looking for a quality RPG should keep looking, but for people who like to laugh at - and with - their games, Blood Knights is silly, dumb fun. Blood Knights' story is basic: two characters, one a balloon-boobed lady vampire and the other a former knight turned into a vampire, are on a mission to destroy or save a relic that will bring on a vampire holocaust or something like that. You won't pay much attention to the plot, although the bad script and worse voice-acting provide ample laughs. Action is the primary focus of Blood Knights, either in single-player or local two player co-op (there's no online or LAN play). Kill monsters to gain experience and upgrade skills, loot treasure chests for better weapons and armor, and search for hidden items. Standard stuff. The combat in Blood Knights is simple, intuitive, and fast-paced, albeit very easy once you level up a few times; you won't die very much over the course of the five or six hours it takes to complete the game.Blood Knights is silly, cheap, and charming. It's not a very good game, but it's hard to resist. Buy it during a sale and have a friend over for a laugh or two.			"

 Do Not Buy! This game... oh god it's bad. There is just too many things with this game that do not make it fun. I've gave this game a shot, but I just could not do it. Here is just some of the problems that make it so.- It's a X-Box 360 Arcade game, that should say alot in what to expect.- Not interesting. The story, characters, dialogue, NONE if it is interesting at all. The game did not give me any reason to be invested in anything. Things happen and all I said was ""Huh?"" The farther I got into the game, the more and more I just didn't care, and just wanted to skip everything... or quit playing. Nothing is ever really explained, nor do they expand on anything that I would guess that the game you should know already.- Graphics are not as good as the screenshots make it appear. I have played around with the 1 graphical slider this game has, yes ONE slider, and I have not seen a single difference in anything. I could not get the game to look as good as the screenshots in the store page. I've even had where the lighting in a cutscene completely disappears when it's done.- The animations, man the animations. Why does everyone walk/run like they have a stick up their ars!- The dialogue all sounds like it's phoned in. The voice acting is /wrist worthy. There is no emotion in anything. In some voices, you can hear an echo from the room they were recording in!- Fighting is repetative and controles are bad. Playing as the male guy (already forget/don't care his name) plays your normal hack and slash game, but the female vampire (again) tries to have Twin Stick shooter controls, but they simply do not work well with Cinamatic Camera Systems. She has auto lock on, and won't always lock onto what ever you are pointing at, which is anoying. I've had to aim pretty far off of enemies before the lock on would even work.- LOCAL COOP ONLY! Are you kidding me?! If there was online play this game would be a little more fun to play with a friend, but you can't.- Maps/Levels are not too interesting. But my main issues is some of the ""platforming"" sections. Having these bad controls, and trying to jump platform to platform, only to have the camera move, and fall to your death. AND find out that the last checkpoint was 5 min ago. I've had checkpoints not go off, even going up and touching the checkpoints and still not activating, forcing me to play to the next point and hope it works.- Borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI. I've had enemies get stuck on rocks, run off cliffs, run into water and drown themselves. I've even had enemies clip through the floor and walls.- Bugs, oh so many bugs. I've actually KILLED NPC that give you dialogue in a cutscene, and it played through normally, but you can see them dead on the ground.The only ""good"" things I've been able to get out of Blood Knights are as follows:- Steam Trading Cards- Achievements- All female characters wear very reveling clothing/armor and have big chests?- Items look pretty cool, and do change what your character looks like.- There is a speach volume slider. It does go all the way to off.... That's it I'm afraid. I personally say do not buy at all, but if you are curious and really wanna hurt yourself, as always wait for a Steam Sale. This is not worth $16.99 (CAN), or even $5.  I gave this game a good try, but I can't play it. Glad I got this from a bundle.			"

												The only reason I bought this game was for the local co-op option. After having bought the game and attempting to play it with a friend I have discovered that the game was unplayable with the controller configuration we wanted. I wanted one person to use a controller and the second person to use keyboard and mouse, but this game does not allow for that; it requires both players to use a controller. I now cannot play the game that I paid for unless I buy a second controller. This is ridiculous. Trine 2, and I am sure other games which advertise local co-op, have the ability of both controller and keyboard/mouse use at the same time. Why not this game? This was falsely advertised and I am not happy about it.			"

												Blood Knights is pretty bad. The story is trite and filled with wooden characters and campy dialogue. The enemy AI is as basic as it gets, so most enemies can be shot to death from a distance and most bosses (including the anticlimactic final boss) can be killed easily by kiting them or running back and forth while attacking. Game progression is linear, and peppered throughout are a small series of choices for the player to make, though they only make a difference to the story if you make particular combinations of choices. Sound is buggy, and frankly, so are many aspects of the game. It's full of gameplay ideas that probably sounded great when they were pitched, but by the time the game was done, everything just ended up as a severely underpolished and generic hack n' slash. For all of its many faults, I will say that Blood Knights provides brief glimmers of really satisfying gameplay, and I did have enough fun playing it to devote just under 5 hours to beating it. It's probably worth at least one playthrough for most people, but with all that went wrong, I'd have problems recommending it at its ridiculous price of $14.99.			"

												I was given this game, so I enjoyed it in the way one enjoys a train wreck. I think I would be much less inclined to enjoy it, had I bought it. The hack & slash mechanics are barely competent and midly enjoyable, the character swap mechanics are criminally underused, the upgrade system is boring and the loot system woudl actually be nice, if the camera would only get up closer on ocasion to let us enjoy the shiny loot!The writing and acting are some of the worst I've seen in a video game, EVER. And this is coming from a guy who looks pretty favourably on PS2-era Japanese RPGS. Seriously bad stuff here, and the charactersm on top of it, are simply annoying, unpleasant people.Vampire boobs, though. If that's your thing, well, this is the game for you! OR you could go look for the BloodRayne titles...The Best:-- Sweet, shiny loot-- Sweet, shiny vampire breasts-- Move along, nothing to see here.The Worst:-- Main character is thouroughly unlikeable-- The plot is horribly, terrifingly dumb-- Mediocre hack & slash mechanics-- Acting. If you can call it that.			"

												The gameplay for Blood Knights is decent. Its a hack and slash with some puzzles and a few tricky jumps here and there. I used an xbox gamepad, I'd imagine it would be very hard to play with keyboard/mouse. Coop requires teamwork to get around the world, you use vampire powers to push or pull your partner over chasms, whereas in single player you can just jump without help. A little bit of character skills and stats to choose as well as weapon upgrades.The story is ... off. The voice acting (particularly the bosses) is mostly very poor with a few times when its just ok. Its worse than B movie cheesyness. I'd say its a strong D movie in how poor the story and voice acting are.I got all the achievements with 16 hours of gameplay. Roughly going through the game 1 1/2 times. I'd recommend this game for its gameplay only, Cutscenes/story are horrible. Being able to get all the achievements in less than 20 hours is a plus.			"

												Won this game at steamgifts platform.The game looked promising. Nice graphic, nice female vampire, nice character switching, not bad combat, intruding story, BUT I'm playing with my mouse and keyboard. If you are like me then safe yourself gigantic frustration of all time falling into chasms and between platforms. Also I ware looking for more RPG and action elements then the platformer ones. If you like 3d platform games  and have controller though, then this title may be far better for you.			"

												This game is not very good. I bought it because I love dumb vampire stuff. I really like vampires and anime and japan games and all that stuff I got made fun of in high school and you will get made fun of too if you buy this game. People will slam you into lockers and you might pee your pants in front of the girl you like named Jillian. She will probably remember that when you ask her to prom and you'll completely ignore her less cute but much more likable friend who has had a crush on you just as long. You never get the chance to go back and try for romance. Now I am in a good relationship but sometimes I wonder what could have been. Long story short don't pay full price for this.			"

												A simple game, more an action hack 'n slash than RPG, with platform aspects that will more often than not leave you slightly irritated as you fall from heights or miss ledges that are hard to judge or see from the nonadjustable aerial camera view, these will lead to your death more often and likely than any confrontation with the NPC enemies.The plot is straight forward with a couple of side points, these do not allow for much expansion on the story and have no impact if missed or just avoided, there are a few decision moments that mostly seem inconsequential.Am okay game to play, it'll take about 5 hours to complete the main story. Would not recommend spending more than $5.			"

												This game feels like it was rushed to reach it's completion, being graphically well made, but it's story, fights, exploration, most of the boss fights, being a bit wrong and missing of some details and informations.As i played it the game didn't seem to be bad at all, but the gameplay tend to be somewhat repetitive, and as i mentioned most of the bosses are easily doable thanks to the classic shoot and run of the ranged attacks of Alysa, without opposing much resistance to you, if not running uselessly towards you;other bosses could need both the characters to be played, but only to do a faster job.The story of the game has been made so fragmented, that seems to have tried to made a plot in the shortest time possible, leaving some scars that are not healed even at the end of the game.The last thing that made me really upset is the Coop function: there are lots of games like this that gives the chance for an internet coop, but this one doesn't, it gives only a local coop, that still i couldn't managed to make it work. Really strange for a game of modern generation, but you will get the reason when you see that Kalypso Media worked on it.I wouldn't gave this game a negative review, because overall i ""enjoyed"" part of the gameplay, even if i struggled to follow it's plot and found the game pretty repetitive, but i don't think the game can be recommendable for a price of 15€.

												Okay, I actually did enjoy it a little. Call it guilty pleasure. Whatever. Let's get to why you shouldn't buy it unless you have a soft spot for crummy games. It's not worth the $15.1. Terrible controls in terms of platforming. I know I'm terrible at platforming to begin with, but I found myself struggling with jumps that should have been baby town frolics. I had to use Jeremy for all the jumps because it seemed like the cursor for aiming Alysa's crossbows interferred with the direction your charcter would actually jump in, regardless of WASD.2. Voice acting was off. It didn't feel intergrated with the game at all, like the script was read off in awkward monotone by actors who had just woken up. I know vampires are best portrayed as emotionless, but jeez.3. It's actually a very short game. Other than interuptions by crashing, it didn't take me but a few hours to beat it.4. Armor design rotation. In any rpg some fun is derived from all the different designs of armor appearances. There were like four per character that were just cycled through with better stats.5. Almost a Capcom camera issue. I say almost because I didn't really have much of a problem with it due to a love for the Resident Evil titles, but I could see where camera angles interferred with gameplay. Particularily with spotting and object that was required to be triggered but out of sight.I sort of expected a little better from Deck13. Ventica and Jack Keane got me to this game, but sadly I felt like there should have been more to do at the end. I'll give credit to character design at least. They probably deserved a better game to star in.			"

												With a substandard story, poor camera controls, easily broken combat and unenjoyable environments, Blood Knights has all the hallmarks of an unfinished, rushed product. The game is bare bones at most, and will not carry an average player for long. It's played as a top down, hack and slash rpg type of game, and succeeds at none of these genres. If you really must get it, buy it on sale; this game is not worth your time, my time, or anyone else's.			"

												Holy Hell this game is incredible. Incredibly BAD I mean ! There aren't many games with vampire so when I saw this one I pre-oredered it like an idiot and paid full price. I tried to play it but got stuck on an overpowered boss ( in normal, not even in hard ). The characters just die way too quickly and the controls suck so much there is nothing you can do about that.Also the game displays 60fps but stutters like crazy it's unplayable, no matter the settings ( well, there aren't any settings anyway except resolution and some slider for graphics quality that does nothing ). Tried to deactivate Vsync, it doesn't work, tried launching in compatibility mode without Windows fancy visuals, still stutters.I tried starting a new game, the tutorial bugged out after 2 minutes, when you take control of the girl and needs to kill two guys with yout crossbow : one of the enemy didn't show up, no way to continue...On top of that the voice acting is laughable, the graphics are worst than a 2010 game, and it's just not fun to play, at all.I like to play ""bad"" games, you can learn a lot from other's mistakes, gameplay wise, but at least the games I generally play WORK.

												A guilty Pleasure - 50/100Blood Knights is a game that is suffering from a lot of issues. For starters, its very buggy. I could not complete a Sidequest, in which I was supposed to find a special Ring, because I happend to stumble across the Ring before I got the quest. When playing Co-Op the Camera can also be a mess and can even get you killed, because it tends to follow player 1, instead of zooming out to create a better view for both players. Last but not least, the Game is very short. I played it on Normal Co-Op Mode and beat the game in less than 4 Hours on my first run.Wih that being said though, I still enjoyed playing the Game in Co-Op. The Story, albeit nothing outstanding, is interesting  (and cheesy) enough to keep you going, the Combat System, albeit a bit clunky, is entertaining enough as well. As you play through the game, you gain experience points and level up, gain more passive abilities, items etc etc. You can think of the Game as a very, very low budget version of ""Dungeon Siege 3""Long Story short, is it worth the Money? Probably not. But when its discounted or you are looking for a cheap Co-Op Game that keeps you and your friends entertained for a couple of hours, it might be worth a shot.			"

												Let me preface this by stating that I do not actually think Blood Knights is a game I would recommend EXCEPT under a very specific situation: You want to play a B-movie. If you've ever enjoyed truly silly, cheesy 80s films with disjointed dialogue and cliche characters for their campy, goofy style and are in the mood for adventuring in that sort of camp Blood Knights fits the bill. It would have been better titled Vampire Plan from the Sealed Crypt: Fangs for Blowing up the Moon!Simply put, the game is of average quality in most things. The art and audio aren't bad, the music is generic, the story is pure cliche camp. Nothing about it is really exceptional in either direction, except the voice acting is gloriously silly and the two lead VAs seem on the verge of laughter. But I did have fun with it, because I went in with low expectations and honestly the game worked fine.So if you're in the mood for a great game with a stunning story about the human conditions and the depths of the mind - get something else! If you're in the mood for something silly to play, possibly with a buddy since it has coop, and laugh at how ridiculous it is, then this title will suit you just fine.			"

												There is so much to like about Blood Knights, unfortunately a few bad spots really overshadow its positives.Likes :- combat is fun and engaging- you can choose to be the male or female character.  - rpg element, like being able to upgrade your character/skills and choose different weapons.Dislikes :- horrible camera, I found it difficult to view the map ahead, and the camera angles would adjust suddenly and in a weird way.  Due to this fact, jumping from one spot to another was a crap shoot.  I found if you use the mouse pointer as your target destination it lessened the chances that you'll fall off a cliff, but I found I died more often being unable to judge jumping distances/platforms than I did from the enemies.- horrible aiming especially if you play as the female character.  I had a general rule that the mouse pointer was the crosshairs, but that wasn't 100% all the time, and the special crossbow shot would more often than not wind up missing its mark.- while not critical, the voice acting was deplorable, especially the banter between jeremy and alyssa (I can overlook this point though, as it doesn't impact the game too much).I found buying anything at the trader a waste of gold coins, if you grind it out long enough you'll find good weapons.  I don't know if this is a good or bad point, but the game is relatively short.			"

												The game is very crude . Its full price does not deserve . Short ( for some it will be a plus ) .Cons - Graphics is far from ideal . Sound often late in the commercials . Manage uncomfortable ( held on the controller ) . Play as Alice is almost impossible (where the sight of the character - hand ?) , And for Jeremy boring. Reception times two and miscalculated . The plot is largely trivial . Not the most successful arcade elements , possibly due to errors in the game design levels. Very boring .Pros - Present Russian language . Though unoriginal plot (especially tie) , but still a couple of interesting plot moves there . Grim surroundings . A bit like a series Castlevania. Simpotichnye female characters - when you look at outfits Alice doubly sorry about graphics quality ;)Bottom line - If absolutely nothing to buy, and then we can take. Maybe fans like vampires and the Middle Ages. But for fans hack'n'slay this year released The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing.			"

												Blood Knights (Deck 13, 2013)The whole time while playing I'm stuck thinking to myself, ""I wish I had someone who could play with."" But before you call a friend and buy the game, take note:This game has problems: it's graphically and aurally bland, it's unoptimised (runs unexpectedly slow for me considering the simple aesthetics), has an awful camera that is horribly unsuited to a game of this type, lacks features we've come to expect as standard from PC games (e.g. you cannot bind keys, you cannot change video settings beyond a single slider), and I suspect the game itself is a cut-down version of what was meant to be a much more ambitious project, hence the simple storytelling despite hints of a much bigger backstory, few locations despite what appears to be a much larger game world, very few sidequests, many useless items, etc. Then you also have a variety of bugs and glitches popping up randomlyAlso, I havn't tried the game with a pad yet, but apparently you need TWO gamepads for the co-op to work.  Customer feedback is an indication that not all gamepads are equally supported (a Xbox 360 pad is recommended -- I don't own one).Additionally, there hasn't been a single patch since release (as far as I know).Having said all that, I am having fun. Not a lot, but the enjoyment is there. If only for the general cheesiness of the storytelling. I have completed two single-player playthroughs, each time focusing on a different character (one is melee, the other ranged).  The melee character has proven to be a lot more satisfying (and challenging) to play as.  Note, you still need the ranged character for certain challenges.I reckon the devs (Deck13) really need to start paying attention to this PC version (it's also on consoles). They're soiling their reputation in the process of ignoring the issues.SCORESGraphics:  61 %Hints of greatness;  with other games we've seen these guys can do great art;  sadly lacking here.Sound:  64 %Cheesy voice acting;  some really nice atmospheric music though.Execution:  50 %Constantly moving, horrible camera that often causes you to lose your bearings;  also leads to many instant deaths as camera fails to reveal gaps and falls (game has some ill-considered platforming segments).  There are hints of a much larger background story that is never explored, sadly the developers have failed in their attempts to bring that story across in any way that is involving or interesting.Addictiveness:  68 %I've completed the game twice.  That's saying something for a product that clearly has its problems.Overall:  60 %Short but reasonably fun.  I havn't played co-op yet (remember:  game only has off-line co-op) but I can imagine it begin fun, provided the horrible camera doesn't follow one character, which could cause a puke inducing sensation for player two, who would be unprepared for the constantly shifting viewpoint.To close off, the developers, Deck13, are so much better this.  They made the great Venetica, for crying out loud.  How and why they fell this low would undoubtedly make for an interesting post-mortem.			"

The game plays alot like God of War, except badly, and on a PC instead of a console. And it's not like God of War was a great game to begin with. You play as a human who was bonded to a vampire, and you can switch between the two. One character you have is a melee character, and one is ranged. The ranged character is insanely powerful, and the melee character dies in just a few hits. If you like autoaiming crossbows that only shoot where the game wants you to, then this game is for you. The game was really easy, but then you get to level two and find yourself chasing vampires and demons through a beachside scene. Well apparently, vampires in this universe are worse than the aliens in Signs. If you touch ANY water, you immediatly explode into a game over. What's even better is half the time you can't even tell the difference between water and regular ground, so you just end up running around and dying alot. If you also like a fixed camera angle that rotates around as you try to navigate difficult gaps you need to leap over (with water at the bottom) this games for you. I think the best part of the game was when during a cutscene, a NPC pathed through some fire in the beginning and died during the scene, but still kept talking to me. That's when i fully realized exactly what i wasted my money on.			"

												This is one of those ""so bad it's good"" games.Or maybe it's a ""so bad it sucks"" game?Perhaps you should give it a go and draw your own conclusion.While I'm a non-smoker that wears glasses and is (probably) not your dad, I'm not an expert critic. My opinion is neither better nor worse than any other (IMO). Unfortunately this isn't the end of the review. Blood Knights follows the misadventures of Jeremy. He was a vampyre hunter but now he's Alysa's little ♥♥♥♥♥. This might be Jeremy's story, but Alysa seems to be the one with all of the advantages. The most obvious is that she has a sweet pair of.... auto-crossbows. If you don't mind the sound of ""thwip thwip thwip"" for nearly 4 hours straight, Alysa is your go-to gal for massacring all of those pathetic humans, stupid were-wolves, butt-ugly undead, and wimpy demons. Jeremy is more of a diplomat. He does most of the talking while Alysa looks at him with this constant ""Is this geek for real?"" face.The plot (I nearly forgot!) involves finding and protecting something called a blood seal. It's like a bandage that protects the world from devastation. Somebody or something wants to cause the deluge, which could kill millions of humans. Somehow Vampyre veteran Alysa and vampire-newbie Jeremy have to work out their differences and straighten this mess out. While there is a village for purchasing supplies and a map-screen, this is a very linear game. You can't revisit previous areas to find stuff you missed or grind out some extra experience levels. Jumping all over the map would probably take focus away from the story. That was the part where you chuckle to yourself.Anyway, each level involves lots of killing, platforming, switches, and traps. Attribute-boosting blood coins can also be found if you're willing to poke your nose in various places. Otherwise, expect the majority of your acquisitions to be equipment upgrades. Level-ups award skill-points, which can be used to unlock skills (fascinating!). Early on you might have a little trouble, because enemies do heavy amounts of damage. This game suffers from reverse difficulty. As you progress, the game gets easier and easier. After awhile, the enemies just seem really in-effective. Most of your deaths are going to come from the janky platforming sections, and a handful of traps. The bosses of Blood Knights are the biggest losers on the planet. At one point you fight a succubus. Wait...Actually you impale a Succubus a hundred times while she floats in the air and does NOTHING. Before that, there's a fight with some big dude who was probably Jeremy's buddy. His attack pattern is spinning around with his axe, and doing some leaping move. In the very next stage there are enemies that have that exact same move-set! The final boss is also a bum. He runs like he's skipping through a garden of posies. He's referred to as ""Rome's Greatest Warrior"", which is just the biggest insult to Rome imaginable.On its own, this game isn't good. It's still enjoyable though, thanks to how unpolished it is. The voice-acting is hilariously bad, the cut-scenes are silly, and there's this wonderful aura of ineptitude throughout the game. One of my favorite moments is SPOILERSwhen you defeat the Succubus. She's talking about where the bad guys took the Blood Seal, but then makes one last attempt at seducing Jeremy. For her trouble, she gets a bolt in the chest. Jeremy gets angry at Alysa for a hot second and then says ""It's just... she might have known all their plans. Now we'll never know.""  Alysa responds with ""At least we know the last thing that went through her head.""That joke might have worked IF SHE WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD! But, I think that's what makes it funny. If Alysa shot the succubus in the head and then made the joke, I'd probably just say something like ""Seriously?"" or ""Oh...oh that was a joke...oh God."" or *GROAN*. This screw-up completely justifies the scene. Blood Knights is not a game I can recommend on normal terms. I'd compare it to a B-movie, but it's about twice as long, and requires you to hold a controller and press buttons. It's certainly not a good game, due to the complete lack of challenge and compelling game-design. This is something you can play high, or drunk, or on some experimental drugs not even fit for sponge consumption. Maybe that's appealing to somebody out there? I don't know.All I know is that I actually don't regret the time I spent with this game. That's saying a lot, considering how short and precious a life is. I won't give it a thumbs up though			"

												I read many gamers saying that this is a low budget and very lousy game. Not worth buying. But I'm the kind of person that will never believe what other might say. I will trust and believe only myself. And I've found out that this game as for myself and my point of view is great! It's awesome. I don't feel that the camera and the voice acting was lame. It's a nice and exciting game for me. As I progress down the chapters in the mission, it is getting more and more interesting! I really loved the blood sucking skill. Because it is exactly like the game ""Legacy Of Kain"" The way the vampire Kain suck the blood from mortal beings excites me a lot! So I say that this game is nice. So readers never trust others point of view. Trust your own instinct. Everyone had their own taste on games. What's yours???			"

All the way you still got a plenty of health (but this depends  how good you are in H&S games ... if you suck this ""plenty"" of health will be still not enough for you),Game is then still quite good ... and its pretty addicting and still fun.BUT !!!I like to kill the dude who ""create"" this stupid static camera view ... OMG !!! stop playing PS and XBOX games ... and try sometimes real gaming = PC GAMING !!! ... CAMERA IS STUPID !!! because is fixed on some positions that change depends where your hero is standing.FOR THIS CAMERA GAME SUX !!!But still pretty fun H&S game when you wont on that camera.

												If this had been release in 2001  or was released as a smartphone game it would have carried some merit. But this offering, the game is a poor example of both an adventure and a hack'n'slash game. I Love both genres.The game mechanics and visuals are slow, stiff and unintelligent. The gameplay and storyline builds itself around the concept of controlling a vampire and human bound to each other through magic... and once you get over the novelty of that fact and the ability to control them both (which takes about 5mins) you begin to feel a sense of emptiness and boredom.There is no style and no substance. You shouldn't judge a book by it's cover - but I did because it is a hack-n-slash involving vampires. I thought.... SOLD! And now I feel conned out of both my time and my money.Installed played for 12mins then uninstallled. Utter tripe.Seriously, don't bother. I dont write many reviews, but I feel this is my moral duty.			"

												Short of the long: - If you can get it for 80% off, you will be getting full value from the gameplay. - Plays best with a local co-op buddy. - Short; less than 6 hours of gameplay.- B-movie bad & hilarious for that.5/10So for starters, the male protagonist jaunts around like he has the gross motor skills of a four year old. The female protagonist gives a voice over with as much passion as the recorded voice that plays after the dial tone ends. Much of the other characters have similar uninspired voice overs.It does have decent combat, it is a button masher with a few power attacks that have cooldowns. The gear progression is nothing special, most of the purchases you could make from stores should be avoided because you will be finding the full sets in the treasure chests scattered through the next area. The rpg elements seem unnecessary as most of the important power ups are automatically awarded and the skill point distibution makes minimal difference on gameplay; the fake enemy difficulty is neutralized by adding a point to make your attacks deal more damage. This leaves a rather flat experience that could have been achieved by keeping the starting gear and starting enemy hit points and damage.I can only recommend this if you can get it on sale for 80% off or so, and have someone to play the game with you. Was not terrible, was not great, just average and a little unpolished. If there was a neutral button, I would have clicked it instead.			"

												This game is pretty bad, but considering the fact it was made by small company and does not claim to be a top AAA game aka ""Diablo killer"" I will still play it a bit so that I could feel like I am supporting someone who probably worked hard on the game... even if he did a bad job on animations and gameplay in general. Maybe next time Deck 13 will do better. Their Venetica was way more fun then this Blood Knights. I can compare BK with Dungeon Siege 3. It looks way more sloppy then DS3, gameplay is sort of in there, but does not feel like fun (just like in Dungeon Siege 3). Plus this game needs controller just like steam page says.Long story short: if you are looking for something new or something that will replace your favorite game in same genre - don't buy it. If you are just bored and want to see Blood Knights in action-go ahead. But I would recommend buying something else instead.Yet once again you can't expect much from 3D game that costs just 15 usd. But if you have only 15 usd on a game, I would reccomend you buying CoJ:Gunslinger. Sure it is different genre, but damn CoJ:G is worth way more then 15 usd.			"

												Worst action RPG I have ever played.  The controls are horrible at times.  The voice acting is some of the worst I've ever seen.  And I got to a point where my save glitched out so I couldn't continue.  You level WAY too often so you are contatntly returning to your skill screen to spend points that don't feel rewarding.  A couple of the quest items I had to get seemed extremely anti-climatctic when I finally picked them up.  On the plus side it does have the ability to switch back in forth between the two characters, however I found myself using the ranged character most of the time.  I don't recommend this game at all.  3/10			"

												Hello everybody, my name is Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) and I'm the writer of a game review and article website known as Universal Gaming Reviews. This is my review of action RPG Blood Knights. It's a rather mediocre experience overall, the addition of platforming mechanics make it even worse and I have to wonder why they would add platforming mechanics into an isometric action RPG because it doesn't work. Jumping is innaccurate, character models look like bricks and Alysa (the vampire) looks like she has rigor mortis in her arms because they're constantly extended which looks incredibly weird and painful. If you're looking for a new action RPG I'd recommend looking elsewhere as there isn't a whole lot of fun to be had here. Thanks for reading folks, happy gaming!You can read our full review here: http://www.universalgamingreviews.com/2013/11/blood-knights-overview-review/ "

												A fun blast for a throw away evenings entertainment.Brainless button pressy fun. Feel powerful,  look cool, wreck♥♥♥♥♥♥The games as shallow as the above paragraph, and the combat is as dynamic to match.The story, characters and acting are all quite naff, but the combat is more than entertaining enough to carry it, for its short 5 hour duration. Interesting premise and setting incidentally.Technical wise, it's a bit juddery occasionaly in cut scenes, but gameplay'is super smooth, and it looks good. Has fantastic controller support- probaly essential as I see other PC players complaining about the controls, no complaints here using a pad.If you can pick this up for  $5 or a bundle, I heartily recommend it.

												What can I say, an action-RPG game set in a world with vampires and humans. Overall, it was a fun hack'n'slash... but short one. I recommend it though, as it was nice.Pros:-good graphics and sound-some plot twists-moral choices-no bugs or crashes that I could find-character upgrades (both gear and abilities).-platformer (lots of jumping around, and it's nice when the camera works with you, not against you).Cons:-too short (normally you'd need 2 plays to get all content if you want to check both sides, but overall my almost 6 hours were one full play)-the damned camera - the game is clearly aimed at consoles so the camera moves as you move, and it's annoying and creates problems in several parts of the game as your characters move further according to the camera. So, for example, you might click the left arrow to jump but as the camera shifts you also need to click the up arrow as your trajectory on the next jump, despite being the same, would now land you over the edge. Horrible camera, most annoying part.-minor inconvenience: the SHIFT key is not an UP arrow for ages. This confused me and can turn away other players when they want to suck blood. You use SHIFT, not UP arrow.Overall, as I said, it was a fun hack'n'slash with a terrible camera and a bit short. Still interesting while it lasted.			"

												The Gameplay was very good. The storyline was also very good. When considering buying this game, I was looking for something casual to play that was storyline heavy and had lots of cutscenes. I didn't want all the hassle and tasks that concerns games like the elder scrolls, dragon age and whatnot, you know where you gotta constantly recycle your inventory and carefully choose your skills and build and all the rest of it. This was perfect for that. The only significant downside was that it was too short. But still very good, clocked it in 6 or 7 hours I think. It doesn't have a new game plus, which is unfortunate. The story and the dialogue were very good it should be noted. I don't want to spoil it but there was a convorsation with a succubus and a summuned demon that was particularly amusing			"

												I love the economics of the game. “How to gain the most gold and experience within limits” was a mini-game that I played continuously.There’s nothing original about this game but for the life of me I couldn’t stop playing it. This is what it felt like playing Blood Knights. I enjoyed maximizing the gold boosts and experience boosts so that I could get those end tier weapons really quick from the shop trader. I think that alone was what kept me playing the game to the very end.Some parts of the game are frustrating such as the platforming sequences due to undefined areas or camera shifting which lead to instant death. I’m forced to backtrack to checkpoints so that I don’t have to fight enemies over and over when I die due to bad jumps.I like how my look changes when I change equipment. The graphics aren’t too amazing but they aren’t ugly either. Although I had fun playing on hard more the entire time, I wouldn’t play again even if there was a new game plus feature as there were a lot of aspects that were rough about the game such as the synching of cut scenes, odd voice acting, the hero becoming a sarcastic jester of sorts, enemy bosses that had potential to be great but were doomed to be uninspiring.Blood Knights is a good bang for your buck as it a semi-solid action RPG that you can bite and suck on for a good few hours, granted that you are willing to ignore some of it’s flaws. It will suck a good chunk of your time and you won’t regret it as long as you buy this game during a sale.			"

												Decent game - don't expect something super deep and complicated and you wont be disappointed. I got this with 6 other games for $3 from bundlestars. This game alone was worth that purchase price. This is a better game than the Metacritic scores suggest, not everything has to be AAA to be enjoyable, this is no Witcher 3 but it doesn't cost as much as that either.Pros* Game play is good, switching characters is fun and mostly works* Concept is simple and interesting * Character progression via gear and skills albeit somewhat shallow still works well for this game and not nearly as underwhelming as some other reviews suggest.* Story choices - basically be the bad vampire or the goody two shoes vampire hunter (aka paladin).Cons* Most of the voice acting is bad with some exceptions but the script is too so.* There are some bugs - for example getting stuck locked on to some off screen something as ranged sucks.* I have an xbox 360 controller and the controls could still be better. This was clearly designed with a console in mind and I wouldn't play it at all with just a mouse and keyboard.* No shared inventory means you have to switch characters to sell/buy for a specific one.* Autosave system, as they go this one is playable and I hate autosaves but you can sometimes back track and trigger one again after you do something - I would recommend this before doing a lot of jumping sections if possible.Neutral* People are saying this is extremely short.

												This game is about a templer and a vampiress trying to get a blood seal back from vampires to prevent world destruction.I liked this game overall but it has many flaws. The story itself isn't written very well and the script and voice acting was uninteresting.  Monsters get bugged on the ledge if you're on a differen't level so you can hit them for free making this game very easy.  The female protagonist is much much more OP than the male protagonist and this unbalance of power makes the game less interesting.  I like the different maps or atmosphere as you go to different levels and the ""secrets"" are easy to find (sometimes items just become much less visible with the camera angle).  I will say I got this game for free from someone who bought it from a bundle so very little money was spent on this game and it was worth that little amount.  There is some replay value for people who are interested in different achievements.  I wouldn't buy this game unless it is 80-90% discount.  However, I might have been spoiled by bundle sites that allow me to buy games at low prices that I've played a lot of bad and boring games and this is better than those average games as such I took the time to complete it. 6.5/10			"

It is not worth $15 but I am EXTREMELY HAPPY for having got it in a bundle! This is probably the best game I have gotten out of all of the games included in my bundles :)Pros: Fun as hell.Extremely fun game while drunk - Simple yet challenging!Graphics are great.Controls are great.Character design and abilities. Great.The perk system and similarities to God of War's upgrade system! Loved it.Overall very charming, something about it is just...

BUT at times it could become annoying. Very minor annoyance, however.Had so much fun playing this! Will keep an eye on the developers!8/10. Straight up rolled off the tongue.			"

												A mediocre dungeon-crawler, truth be told. The game revolves around a pair of pre-disposed foes, a fallen holy knight and a vampire warrioress cursed to serve him, the pair must kill and consume his former allies in an attempt to prove that being turned into a vampire has not turned him into a blood-thirsty war monger who kills and eats people to further his own goals. You gain levels, buy new weapons and armor, and rise in power through a skill tree full of generic abilities.My greatest complaint is not about the level design, or the lackluster story, but rather how complete and utterly inept the voice actors are. I swear to zombie Jesus that these people are so wooden, any sex scenes they might contribute to would result in splinters in awkward places.Honestly, if you want a dungeon crawler RPG, buy Diabo, Gauntlet, or Van Helsing. While the intention may have been to provide players with a source of entertainment, this game falls depressingly short.			"

												So bad it's good. Sort of. If you want a dumb action game go ahead and get it on a sale. I got it in a bundle. Was worth the laughs.Voice acting and dialog is funny. There are questionable design choices everywhere. You can fall through the map. Checkpoint save system. Fixed camera angles that sometimes change mid jump. This game has it all. Probably would be even better with a friend. In single player you can switch characters with a single button press. Early game I relied on the fighter but later the archer was the obvious choice for almost every encounter. Took 5 hours to beat it. I got what I paid for.			"

The story and the acting will win no rewards, and that goes the same with the graphics. But even as such, they managed to pull me in and the solid gameplay and music make my stay enjoyable. I'm looking forward to finishing the game, maybe even replay it in future. All I'm saying, it's a nice little gem. Def a lot better then the swarm of indies that keep appearing around every corner.

												Highly recommended. And not just because I'm obsessed with vampires.The camera control -- or, more accurately, lack thereof -- is a little strange, and sometimes it'll hide important things from you -- like one lethal pit toward the end -- but it works rather well, once you get used to it. The voice acting is good at times, not so much at others, but certainly charming and really (intentionally) funny in some parts. Looks good and has pretty excellent gameplay.8/10, will play again.

												The story is so ridiculous. The levels are much empty. The battles are very imbalanced. The amount of vampires is such overwhelming. The connection to ""roman army"" is many random. The graphics are so 2007. The dialog choices are worse than in Mass Effect. Wow!This is that kind of games that are obviously below the quality bar, but they are short enough to keep it fresh til the end.  It takes only 5 hours to beat the game and it doesn't really have enough time to bore you with all the flaws mentioned above. At some point you take it as a parody to modern RPGs. The acting is hilarious, but it makes it more real. Not sure if devs expected this to be serious at all or I just made it up in my mind, but this ""parodyness"" feel is what I liked about this game. Spolier: Story about vampires trying to stop roman catholics from exploding the moon to start a new great flood to turn more people into their religion? Still a better love story than twilight. "

												ALMOST there, but a major lack of polish, poorly mapped keys and an inability to remap, combined with insta-death platforming ruin what is an otherwise enjoyable game. PROS:-Good gameplay-Simple but good RPG elements for a hack n slash-Cutscenes can be skipped easilyNEUTRALS:-Graphics weren't bad, but they certainly aren't good.-Voice acting was hit and miss. Overall not bad.CONS:-Controls can't be remapped. -Default control mapping is TERRIBLE (WASD to move, F to dodge; very unnatural key especially when trying to move in the D direction)-Camera can't be controlled. (Combine this with the poor default controls and instant death platforming...)-Animations are clunky and awkward.I skipped all the cutscenes (as I almost always do in games like this) and this was a breeze which is important as forced cutscenes (esp in areas where they are repeated due to deaths) is an incredibly infuriating experience, but thankfully here it is not. However, the poorly mapped controls combined with an inability to remap keys is a major deal breaker. There are several platforming elements that result in an instant death and send you back to the last save point, which means you usually have to fight a number of mobs just to get a chance to make the jump again....and if you fall....fight those mobs again...tedious and frustrating since the only reason you will fall is due to the bad controls (the platforming elements themselves are VERY simple and straightforward). With some polish this game can be quite fun, but it needs to fix the controls first and foremost.			"

I haven't finished yet so no comment.			"

												The graphics and sound are terrible, but the story and gameplay are not bad. I recommend if it is on sale.			"

												I´m really liking it, a lot, its very dynamic and you can do a lot of beautiful moves with limited actions. The story its simple, but I find it very atractive. less than two dollar for it its a steal. If you like vampires and gothic environments, and you like very continous action games, you will enjoy it.			"

												If this was set in Nosgoth I could see this as a cheaply made cashgrab tie-in to the original Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain - as it is this is just a cheap hack and slash action/arcade game with vampires in it.Nothing is really that hard, and the programming is basic, so there is a lot of exploits to use, if it gets too hard at times - and when you die, reloading is fast. The camera is not the best in the world, the voices sound bored, and it is easiest to play as a shooter, but while some thinks that the action is repetitive, I found that it worked fine, considering the short game length Honestly if you are looking for a RPG, look somewhere else - if you are looking for gameplay worth 5+ bucks - again look somewhere else; but if it is a rainy sunday, this game is on sale (I bought it for 2.50 euro) and you just want something easy and shallow to help you lose part of a day, then this game is alright.

												I've played a lot of games, especially RPGs and there's something about Blood Knights that I find appealing. The story and the acting will win no rewards, and that goes the same with the graphics. But even as such, they managed to pull me in and the solid gameplay and music make my stay enjoyable. I'm looking forward to finishing the game, maybe even replay it in future. All I'm saying, it's a nice little gem. Def a lot better then the swarm of indies that keep appearing around every corner.

												So bad it's good. Sort of. If you want a dumb action game go ahead and get it on a sale. I got it in a bundle. Was worth the laughs.Voice acting and dialog is funny. There are questionable design choices everywhere. You can fall through the map. Checkpoint save system. Fixed camera angles that sometimes change mid jump. This game has it all. Probably would be even better with a friend. In single player you can switch characters with a single button press. Early game I relied on the fighter but later the archer was the obvious choice for almost every encounter. Took 5 hours to beat it. I got what I paid for.			"

												If you want to have a little bit of fun it is a good game. You can play it without getting too frustrated at certain points. And no: it´s not rewarding to finish an enemy after having tried it a lots of times (see Dark Souls). People want entertainment, not work. This game is good for entertainment. The camera is a little bit odd at the beginning...but you get used to it pretty fast.			"

												Grey screen with a small HUD in the bottom left corner. Takes 2 - 3 times longer than needed to quit the game , ""Menus are broken"". I cants see any characters. Just Grey! I'm Guessing some prerequisites are missing. maybe even some that require royalties.?? IDK..			"

												This game is about a templer and a vampiress trying to get a blood seal back from vampires to prevent world destruction.I liked this game overall but it has many flaws. The story itself isn't written very well and the script and voice acting was uninteresting.  Monsters get bugged on the ledge if you're on a differen't level so you can hit them for free making this game very easy.  The female protagonist is much much more OP than the male protagonist and this unbalance of power makes the game less interesting.  I like the different maps or atmosphere as you go to different levels and the ""secrets"" are easy to find (sometimes items just become much less visible with the camera angle).  I will say I got this game for free from someone who bought it from a bundle so very little money was spent on this game and it was worth that little amount.  There is some replay value for people who are interested in different achievements.  I wouldn't buy this game unless it is 80-90% discount.  However, I might have been spoiled by bundle sites that allow me to buy games at low prices that I've played a lot of bad and boring games and this is better than those average games as such I took the time to complete it. 6.5/10			"

												A good funny game, the story is a bit thin but if you just want to play a game where you have to hack and slash nonstop this is it.			"

												Attempting to play it using keyboard and mouse has turned my evening into life or death fight with the environment. Forget vampires, forget priests, forget wolves. Rocks, barrels, messy collision boxes and tragic steering are the real enemies in this game. After my clumsy excuse of a vampire fell off from the same cliff for the fifth time, this game fell off my ""to play"" list.			"
