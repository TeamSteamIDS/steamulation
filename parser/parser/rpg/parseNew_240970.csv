												The second game in a series about saving the world in only half a minute has once again won my love in only half an hour. All the gameplay you know and love from the first game is back and upgraded just a tad for more dynamic fights without losing its original feel. If you've played the first game you'll have a good time seeing some subtle callbacks, but if you're jumping into the series with this game you'll still have a grand time; skipping the first game in no way makes the game any less fun.Outside of fighting, there's so much to be done. Weapon crafting, skill leveling, bonus content you purchase using gold saved up from missions, and so forth. It's so easy to climb your way up to 100% completion and yet so difficult to successfully achieve that goal with such a large number of tasks to complete. You won't be left feeling like you didn't have enough to do.Plus there's a leaderboard for benchmark testing the game on your computer so you can compare your results to other players for whatever reason. How can you not love this game?			"

												My first impression after having done the first part of the story:Don't let the appearance of this game fool you; it's a badass game and offers some quick fun if you are lacking of time or if you are a hardcore player, finish the game in a long session. Do not feel disheartened if you completed the first mission set ---- Your journey is just the beginning! If you are a completionist, check out the gallery and unlock artworks, videos and soundtracks by finishing the game! The only complain I have is only the music transition while fighting against the enemies while not on any mission, since it gets rather repetitive. Steam Workshop support allows map creation for increased gameplay value.For the options, each gamepad and keyboard bindings can be customized to your liking and for the first time, occulus VR mode on a 2d game(?).Experience great soundtrack (especially the main menu!), improved battle (now you have skills, class, party and formation) and having the money-minded goddess along with your journey, HMH fans and newcomers will love it!

												MULTIPLAYER REVIEW:This is one of the most competitive games I have ever played in Multiplayer, even more so than the first game. Goddess whims, the new feature in multiplayer mix things up nicely, with levels being doubled and gold being taken away at every turn. Also the inclusion of community created maps is a nice touch, giving this game literally infinite lifespan.An absolute treat for RPG fans who are looking for something a little different, or anyone for that matter. My one and only nitpick with this game is the fact there is no volume settings for sound and music, only allowing each to be turned off and on. Other than that though, it's definitely worth €19.99 for all the content you recieve.I have yet to touch upon the single player aspects of the game, but I know for sure I will not be disappointed. When I do get stuck into the story, I'll update this review. "

												If you LOVED the first title you'll......feel torn on this one.It's not a bad game. Like all sequels it does everything its predecessor did with bells and whistles added. Unlike the previous title, you get an art gallery, unlockable costumes for the Time Goddess, and  a more cohesive plotline with cutscenes and character development.But that's what's off-putting for some. The first title had miniature 30 second quests selected from a world map where the boss, area, and quest were all self-contained. The bosses were made to be humorous and you'd get a small 4 sentence 'epilogue' to the quest that had a joke or two in it. The plot-line was backdrop: it merely explained why you were traveling the world.The Second Coming places the plot in center-row and heavily emphasizes it. You get cut-scenes pre and post quest, flashbacks while you travel the world map, and character exposition and development. Bosses are no longer humorous with ridiculous motivations for their actions: they are taken much more seriously. Granted, we aren't dealing with Final Fantasy levels of writing and exposition, but the humor is considerably toned down. You'll either appreciate the expansion or hate it vehemently.There were some casualties in transitioning to a story-driven game. Whereas you were timed in the previous title and graded on it after a quest, this game merely continues on with the storyline after a quest is finished. They've done away with the quest completion screen, which details your time and objectives completed, so the game places less emphasis on speed-running. Ironically, time is less emphasized in the series than ever before. The sequel DOES fu*k up in two indisputable ways: the ability to go back to completed quests in a time trial mode and the ability to level up in the over-world map. When you level up outside of a quest, your level carries over to the next quest. Which means the element of grinding is introduced in a series where a 30 second quest's challenges include getting strong enough to defeat a boss. You can realistically grind outside of a quest so that when you enter it you're already set to beat the boss, which is beyond ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in this series. Secondly, while you can go back to completed quests to beat the clock, you keep all of your current equipment and levels, which is doubly insane and defeats the point of the 30 second timer and a time trial challenge.Granted, you don't NEED to grind, ever. But the fact that it's even an option is just as bad as auto-aim in a PC FPS. Two ♥♥♥♥-ups aside I'm really split on this game. The previous title had a more arcade-like feel and you could pick up and play it whenever and put it down a minute later. This title has a more continuous feel to it, and in transitioning to a serious RPG some of the humor of the last title is lost. I miss bosses that wanted to blow up the world because others confused their species for a similar looking species. But it's still an enjoyable title that tries something new with the base 'Half-Minute Hero' experience still lying underneath.  "

												I have been waiting for a long time to play this game, waiting for a good sale, and even if I only found a 50% one on this Summer Sale, oh man, if it was worth it.Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming is, as you might have know, the sequel of ""Half Minute Hero; Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy"" (the hell is going on with the names, man?), and it does fell true to the first one, while being original on his own.The story picks up on the year 200, 100 years after the first one, and as the original one, has multiple stories (5 in total, the first one being a bit short as the introduction and tutorial, while the last one is pretty much the ending and final battles), most of them with their own characters, like in the original (the Hero Mode, Princess mode, Evil Lord mode, and Knight mode on the original).The main thing that has changed here is the seriousness. This game is more serious than the last one, where half the stages where filled with parodies, jokes, easter eggs and references. There are still some quite hillarious stages, but nowhere near before. Instead, you can find parodies and references in the story, maps, and even the items (really? The bike and Buster Sword from Cloud? I rather wear Vivi's outfit...).The soundtrack is f#cking boss. I'm not even kidding. Not only it sounds way better while having the same style, but each episode of the game has multiple themes for each battle and map. And I can tell you, the music just gets better the further you go into the game.One main problem is the difficulty...It might be that I'm a Badass, or something, but I found it a bit easy. Specially with the ""Global Level system"", and the ""Global Dungeons"". The idea is that you can level up out of the stages, so when you start your next battle, you will start at level 5 or so, instead of level 1. The Global dungeons are a good adition, but it's way TOO easy to level up in them, while searching for the loot on them.Another trouble I find on this game, is that the story doesn't have multiple routes like the original. Further more, while in the original there where multiple ways to finish a stage, here there are not much of those. There are, though, some secret companions that are not easy to find, and usually need some backtracking to get (like Cozain, who you will need a guide to find, like me).Something that has also been done well, are the cameos. A good amount of characters from the original can be found in here: Allied characters, the other heroes of the game, some Evil Lords...Even the main character itself! Most of them will join you in some way, and only a few of them will serve of any way on the story (like Geezer, who I'm not gonna spoil who he is, since it's quite obvious, but appears in all the chapters, helping the heroes). The new Formation system also makes the allies feel a bit more usefull than before, and now both you, allies and enemies have skills...Even though they appear out of chance, making them pretty luck-based.Something great, and that I wanted really bad on the game, is the Map Editor. I mean, IT'S PERFECT! Now you can make your own maps, or download the maps from others, play them alone, or with friends! It makes the game last much more, and it's something that A LOT of games should have by default.While it took me about 14 hours to unlock most of the original Half Minute Hero, I have played this one for 20 hours, and I'm nowhere near getting everything (Dude, the Demon Maze is a nightmare...). I would totally recommend this game, SPECIALLY if you played the first one. 20€ is a bit too much, though, so wait for a sale like I did. 10€ or less is a good price, and you should buy it from that point. There are probably DLC's for this game, I haven't checked them yet, but you could also buy them to extend the game, if you want.			"

												This game is amazing. While the first one had several frantic levels to complete, this one has periods of calm to make yourself stronger at a slower rate, before you gain temporary levels at a rapid rate in quests. The soundtrack is intense, with the quests having pumped up, energetic sounds.This one has quite a bit more depth to the way you manage your equipment and party. You can actually position everyone and give them little orders, and you can also select a skill to randomly fire upon landing a hit.The story this time around is highly engaging. There is less humour in the first chapter of this adventue, but it makes up for this lacking with a web of character relations and situations. The fate of the characters are actually of high interest this time around. The story also brings back several moments from the first game.This is a more modern, better written Half-Minute Hero.			"

												Okay after beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everyone I can finally review this game and giving my own opinions about it.Let's start saying: OMG YOU SHOULD REALLY BUY IT YOU PIE-Uhm sorry where was I? Oh okay thank you.The story is the sequel to Half Minute Hero Super Mega Bla Bla Bla and if you're planning to buy this game you have the chance to play the first one for knowing what should you wait after you beat the game. The story if you play it right should be long about 26 hours.The gameplay is simple, you have 30 seconds to level up to defeat the boss of the level. If you can't make it in time you lose. The soundtrack is one of the best I ever heard, Is composed by multiple people but one of these guys is Motoi Sakuraba, the artist who made the Dark Souls soundtrack.My last words are please buy this game, support the company! I want a sequel!			"

												The Time Goddess has given me more than 30 seconds to review this game, so I will make use of her charitable nature.Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming is the second (obviously) Half Minute Hero game. With a good mix of RPG, puzzle, and action all packed into one hilarious RPG which lampoons pretty much everything in those games. You have several stories to go through which span an impressive plot which is told in a series of (technically) 30 second levels. The characters are colorful and the gameplay is amazingly fun. Keeping in touch with true frantic action, you must make all your choices quickly, lest those 30 seconds you have be wasted, or you could always pay the stingy Time Goddess.The game is extremely fun, with the game keeping the pedal to the metal at all times. The story and dialogue gloriously pokes and prods fun at many tropes present in video games, from forcing you to pick a specific choice to giant robots (who doesn't love giant robots?)! This game, like its predecessor, has an overarching story that encompasses several campaigns following different heroes of different eras, all helped by the Time Goddess. The gameplay is simple, but fun. You'll find yourself smiling as you plow through fields or Global Dungeons looking for EXP, gold, and items. During missions, you have to balance time and money, adding a strategic / tactical aspect to each and every mission. Do you plow through to the boss and risk being too weak or grind your levels until you're strong enough? Not only there, there's plenty of secrets in the game that'll keep you engaged for awhile as well.There's also a map creation system where you can create your own maps to play and download creations of other players, to further add to the content of this game!It also has a multiplayer function, though I've yet to try that out.Overall, it's an amazing game that is definitely worth the price tag that it has.Unfortunately for me, the Time Goddess noticed I called her stingy and has taken all my money, my shoes, and my shirt.Thankfully, I still have my pants. Wait, no. She took those too.			"

												Definitely one of my favorite RPGs that I have played recently. I saw this ages ago and did not get it. I did play the first one but the first game had plenty of problems in it (Such as quests being nearly identical to each other and not much variety in them). That was a stupid decision. This game fixes all the problems in the first game and makes it a almost perfect game. Here's how.Story:There are 4 (5? I'm on Ragnarok at the minute and I don't really know if there is more.) eras to play in this game. They all have different stories. The eras are Overture, Judgement, Revolution and Ragnarock. Judgement is a kind of part 2 to Overture so it does not have a different protagonist unlike the others. I will only explain the Overture story because 1. I don't want to spoil much. 2. I don't want to waste time on a review. So overture follows the story of Yusha. A royal commando sent on a mission to destroy the Evil Lords alongside a group that contains Yashu and Guy. The Evil Lords get their hands on the Spell of Destruction. This spell makes the world end in 30 seconds. Thus the 30 second gimmick. Wow. I thought Overture had a bit more to the story that I could say without spoiling anything. Anyway over to the gameplay.Gameplay:This really is the highlight of the game. So basically you are hunting Evil Lords and♥♥♥♥♥♥ They use their Spell of Destruction to make the world end in 30 seconds. This means you only have 30 seconds to teach the Evil Lord a lesson. Each quest (level) starts off with the Godess telling you things that may help you  defeat the Evil Lord. Each Evil Lord has their own quirk. For example. The Light boss blinds the player with light every few seconds and can be defeated using some kind of dark energy. Anyway the actual gameplay. After the godess tells you♥♥♥♥♥♥ you need to scurry around the map and take out monsters to level up and talk to villagers. You're basically trying to level up as fast as you can and take down the evil lord before 30 seconds is up. However you can pray to the Time Godess to reset your time however it costs money to do so. There is more to the gameplay but I gotta type this quick so whoop.Music:Oh my god. Oh my actual god. This music. This is SO good. I have been listening to this all week. It really is a pleasure to listen to. It's basically chiptune mixed with normal stuff. It is such a good blend. There is not much I can say about the music apart from its amazing.Graphics:It's pixel art. Nuff said. OH WAIT! I almost forgot about the animation parts. Okay so there are small parts of this game that are animated. These are pretty cool i guess. I mean they dont really show it off that much and the animation does not have a lot going on in it so yeah.Overall Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming is a great game and I highly reccommend the game. It is fun, addicting and...fun. So what are you waiting for? Buy it now! Heck, You get the first Half Minute hero with it.8/10 "

												A huge step forward compared to the first game. The addition of freeroaming, the connected world, global level and permanent companions are just a few additions that made this game much more enjoyable than Half Minute Hero 1 (which I already liked). There are tons of hidden items, achievements, formations, companions, dungeons... you name it. The dialog and story is typical in the style of a cheesy JRPG. Not my taste but it's a minor complaint. While the very core gameplay is truthful to that of it's predecessor, the content compared was quadrupled. You can expect 20 hours of gametime, for completionists it's easily double. Overall a very enjoyable experience with minor flaws, definitely recommend buying it.			"

												Fantastic game and a worthy sequel, even if the gameplay is a bit different this time around. Then again, the first game constantly mixed things up to keep it fresh, so I should expect nothing less out of the second game. The story retains the same balance between parodical comedy and semi-serious drama, though it is significantly deeper this time around. Many characters from the previous game make a reappearance in some form, in fact, the bumbling but lovable Knight is back as a constant party member, and his interactions with the Goddess are hilarious.Give the game a shot, but keep in mind that the first Hero 30 is basically an extended tutorial, this game takes a while to get off the ground compared to the first one.

Review in English/Spanish Análisis en Inglés y Español: English:   Not as good as the first one Looks like the developers tried to expand the solid concept of half minute hero and ended with mixed results, the new additions are fine but they don’t add much overall, don’t worry though; the game is still quirky and fun, however do yourself a favor and play the first one. If you still are craving for more go ahead and play the second coming (shouldn’t be a problem since you get both by buying the bundle for the price of one!). Español:   No tan bueno como el primero Los desarrolladores fueron más ambiciosos con esta segunda parte y expandieron el gameplay con nuevos elementos que a mi parecer no funcionan del todo. Sigue siendo bastante entretenido y la premisa la misma (¡salvar al mundo en 30 segundos!) pero me encontré en más de una ocasión deseando que se terminara pronto.Recomendaría jugar el primero y darle una oportunidad a este si quedas con ganas de más.

												This game had been in my wishlist since oct 2014 and got it on summer sale 2015. I've been playing for 14 hours now and this game is A LOT better than previous half minute hero (Super Mega Neo Climax).. I played the it first before playing Second Coming. If you wonder how I could have Super Mega Neo Climax without Second Coming, well Super Mega Neo Climax used to be bundled and on steam you get both games! You are able to form your party and set formation, it does feel more like RPG with time management now. The musics in Half Minute Hero: The second Coming is awesome! They have a lot of composers in this game.. one of them is Yasunori mitsuda (I do look at the credit section because the musics in this game does feel made by some people) The story is interesting, maybe some people think it's dull but this game does have a lot of twist and jokes! HIghly recommended!!			"

												Does what every single second part of game should do: take first game and shine it to perfection. PC version has made significant improvement to first part, they actually got resolution as well as benchmark, which means that pixel art actually scales properly this time without blurring and menus seem to work naturally. There even seems to be VR-support but I can't even imagine how that works :DGame itself now actually feels like story based RPG where after missions you can roam around and collect money, XP and secrets, where first game at least I simply started skipping text and that end credits joke got old really fast. Missions are pretty much the same like in first game with little variances, which definitly isn't bad thing as that was best part of first game. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Tekee juuri sen mitä joka ikinen pelin toinen osa pitäisikin tehdä: ottaa ensimmäinen peli ja hioa se täydellisyyteen. PC versio on aivan selvä parannus ensimmäiseen osaan, mukaan on lisätty niin resoluutiovalinnat kuin benchmarkki, meinaten että pikselitaide skaalautuu nyt hyvin ilman blurrausta ja valikot toimivat tällä kertaa ihan järjen mukaan. Jopa VR-tuki näyttää olevan mukana, mutten pysty edes kuvittelemaan miten se toimii :D Itse peli tuntuu nyt ihan oikealta tarinalliselta roolipeliltä missä tehtävien välissä voit kulkea maailmassa ja keräillä rahaa, XP:tä ja salaisuuksia, missä ensimmäisessä pelissä alkoi skippailla tarinaa ja lopputekstivitsi alkoi käydä vanhaksi. Tehtävät ovat aika hyvin samanlaisia pienillä tuoreilla muutoksilla, joka ei todellakaan ole huono asia koska se oli ensimmäisen pelin paras osa.			"

												Ok after 100% achievements I think its about time I finally did a review on this.To start off this sequel pretty much takes the Hero 30 gamemode from the first game and expands everything about it (unfortinately there are no other gamemodes from the first game)As usual you got your hero who has 30 seconds to defeat the evil lord and save the day and all that. Pretty much what you would expect from playing the first game but what is different here is how the quests are bigger, theres overworld exploration, and even little dungeons you can go through without worrying about the time in between quests. The game also has roughly twice as much content in the story compared to the first. As for more gameplay you got time attack, infinite battle, multiplayer, and the custom levels you can make and play.So about the story I can say its pretty good. Starts off from where the last game left off but this time around it parodies the RPGs around like the SNES and PS1 era with more drama and character development (similar to that one quest in the first game). Even with that It still keeps its humor and makes me smile at some parts of it.With all that I say its worth checking out.			"

												You >> Evil! Or at least you can hope you become greater than evil in under 30 seconds with The Second Coming, the long awaited sequel to Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy. This time you are joined by two partners as a band of mercenaries for the King. Your quest is to defeat 8 elemental dragons, and save the world like usual. But this game brings something that the previous entries don't, world map traversal, this is the calm before the storm, a gentle stroll in between your 30 second quests, along with a new mechanic. G-level, this is your base level before you enter quests, so you can grind, before you grind! Genius! Other new features to the game include time attack, and workshop content. That's right you can write your own story and add it to the tapestry of Half Minute Hero. There is also a Goddess Room, its essentially a tamagotchi for the Time Goddess. This game takes a more tongue-in-cheek, parody approach than the previous game, plenty of cold-shoulders and fourth wall breaking, a great experience for even non-RPG fans.-10/10Super Mega Neo Etc...

												Such a great game, Definitely an upgrade from the first one. Being able to fight and explore outside of the 30 second time limit is a very welcome addition. There is much more customization and the fact that you have a party this time around is great. definitely going to spend a lot more time with this all weekend.			"

												What a disappointing sequel !Half-Minute Hero was a very clever game. At first glance, it seemed to be just a parody : it mocked grindy RPG with cliche story. But once you delved into it you found a very original gameplay system, with lots of cool ideas. The maps were full of secrets and branching paths, and the combat system had some clever mechanics for people that wanted a challenge or wanted to find all secrets.The Second Coming, by trying to add more stuff is now...a grindy RPG with cliche story. The super cliche plots are force fed to you through endless and pointless dialogs. The ""metagame"" added is a grindy RPG (not sped up) with linear plot, repetitive gameplay, forced backtracking to unlock all items, etc. Exactly the kind of games the first game was mocking. The new combat features (Skills, formations, party, classes, etc...) are also completely broken. All attempts to use theses features will be constantly thwarted by the game, which reset your formations, party, equipment everytime a story event requires a single change (which is...almost always). ""Luckily"" you actually you do not have to use theses features most of the time, as brute forcing is often the way to go.Unfortunately, brute forcing can be applied to everything in the Second Coming. Most of the cleverness of the combat is gone : there are tons of items, but they don't have special attributes anymore like you could find in the first game. So you just get whatever give you the biggest stats bonus and rush. No need to be clever anymore, just go through the motions, endure the repetitive combats and you will win all missions. Even the secret titles, which used to be a challenge in the first game, are now rather straightforward and super easy to get.On the bright side, for people who are looking for a challenge, there is a very challenging ""endless"" mode, but i doubt you will come back to it once you've finished it, since the maps are always the same.Multiplayer has also been upgraded, but since there are very few players, I've been unable to try it, which will be the case for you too if you don't have friends who own the game.On the whole, I don't see enough good stuff in this game to alievate the bad, and I can only advise you to stick to the first game. I completed the game, but it wasnt because i enjoyed it, it was only for completion sake and to be sure i wasn't missing something....			"

												Not as funny or challenging as the first game.The parody aspect is excellent when it's present, but sometimes the game forgets it's supposed to be a parody and tries to be serious and emotional, resulting in many awkward cliche moments that just aren't funny or interesting. It's worth sitting through those for those brilliant silly Half-Minute Hero moments though, and there are more than enough of them to justify sitting through the boring overall story.This has a lot more features than the original game, which I've got mixed feelings about.Classes don't do much, but they're a nice idea. Battle formations are awesome. Searching for medals on the overworld? Eh, why not. I'm indifferent about skills and Hero Castle stuff, though I think a lot of people would probably like those. I don't know.Since you can now grind on the overworld for permanent level ups, and are allowed to keep the gear you've obtained in later quests even when redoing quests, there's never any point in strategizing as to which gear and path will let you earn the best time, as you can just come back later in the game with max levels and the best equipment, and redo the quest with no challenge. Maybe I'm being too harsh as there's a separate Time Attack mode that plays more like the original, but I just don't see the appeal of redoing story quests in a different mode.This game is much more friendly to newcomers and casual players than the original was, and so it is the best place to pick up the series, though veterans of the original may be disappointed that it's nowhere near as challenging.Still a great game though, and I had a ton of fun with it despite all the things I've nitpicked about it. I definitely recommend both Half-Minute Hero titles to anyone who's a fan of retro console JRPGs, and since you get the first game for free with this one, my complaints are pretty much null!TLDR; Very funny and good, rant about it being easier than the first game, and new features being meh, still worth your time, buy it!

SummaryIf you've played Half-Minute Hero (the first game), The Second Coming is a true sequel that certainly builds upon its origins but on a much larger scale. You control a small, useless ""hero"" in an RPG world, set to save that very world from certain destruction. Not much different from most other classic RPGs, I know. The one caveat is that you only have 30 seconds to do so, and therein lies the series' unique gameplay and quirky humour.Rush through the intro, the world is about to end. Battle monsters to level up, do side quests to unlock alternate routes or equipment, become better than the Evil Lords and destroy them, all in less than half a minute. Just as you've completed the credits, a new threat appears, and you have to do it all over again! While it is possible to beat many of the quests (levels) within this time limit, you actually get to rewind time to make it all more digestible. Though, the Goddess of Time is not a fan of the greater good, as she takes an increasingly larger fee each time you make use of her ability.New additionsThe Second Coming contains several new campaigns to a tried and loved concept without changing the formulae too much. While the first game was a nice little distraction from daily chores, you'll have to take a week off to complete all of the content in this game. And you should complete it all, as that is where a lot of this game's quirkyness and gameplay challenge actually lies. In addition to a plethora of new quests, there's also a map editor and a multiplayer segment added, so the fun can continue endlessly if you so wish! And if the map editor is not enough, there is literally an endless mode as well, which is comparable to a boss rush.It's definitely a title that hands you a unique experience along with a lot to do compared to what you paid for it. Did your download finish yet?			"

												**Recommend that you played Half minute hero before**If you like the  Half minute hero and want more depth, this is the game for you.This second title focus on story A LOT MORE than the first.this game, unlike the first title, need some grinding (which is not a lot though), or the waekest monster on the map will send you flying.You can expect to find many more things than the first part.Throwing reasons and story become EPIC.

Its really just _that good_A++ Plot, Gameplay, Engine, Character Development, Artwork, World Design, SOUNDTRACK YES THE SOUNDTRACK <3.A little Pros/Cons list: !!Comes with the first game AND the soundtrack (!!) +++Plot+++Soundtrack+++Unique Engine+++Gigantic options/party members/classes to choose.++ Artwork ++Gameplay+ Map editor and stuff+ ReplayabilityCons:-There's only 3 gameplay modes and they dont change a lot of the game but hey there's a giang world map and like 9999 global dungeons/village quests. So it pays off well. -If you're playing on hard mode, you'll die many MANY times before understanding what the hell you're supposed to do to be able to grind yourself to the victory. -Has a DLC, but its very cheap, and it adds tons of things to the game. Some people say the first one was better and that Second Coming has way too much dialogue and its way too easy.That's because they're probably playing in easy/normal mode, and probably skipping the dialogues/not paying attention to the story/plot. Dont do that. Just dont. Or do, the game's still very enjoyable to plot-skippers. But even if you dont want, you'll end up loving the story and replaying the whole game just to read everything. Like i did.			"

												""Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming"" is the sequel to Marvelous's Half Minute Hero, which I strongly suggest playing first. The first game is shorter, lighter, and a good indicator of how you'll feel about the sequel. If you liked the first game, you'll also like the sequel. If you didn't like the first one because it didn't feel enough like a JRPG, you should try this one. If you simply didn't like the first game, you won't like this one either.I'm going to write this review as though you're familiar with the first game.Quick summary:- Much longer than the first game. Supports multiplayer with lobbies and Community Maps. Community Maps are awesome and could add a lot of replayability.- Very much a sequel to Half Minute Hero. It's a JRPG/Puzzle/Action hybrid that focuses on fun, but allows for challenge.- Only has RPG-mode, so Evil Lord/Princess/Knight fans are out of luck. RPG-mode fans are in for a huge treat.- Story is more of a take on epic SNES RPGs (e.g. Final Fantasy VI) than of classic NES RPGs (e.g. Dragon Quest).- Story mode less arcade-y. All the half-minute quests are in the framework of a traditional overworld RPG, although quests are individually replayable with leaderboards.- Lots of secret equipment/party members, as well as significant post story content. Maybe a 20-40 hour game, unless you really get into score attack or user levels.- Lots of extra modes, notably user generated levels and infinite play modes.- Music, graphics (retro 16 bit), and gameplay elements are all a big upgrade over the original.From all this, you can probably tell if you'd like the game or not. It's definitely not for everyone. I personally loved it. I'm arbitrarily giving it a score of 9, mostly because it's a niche game and I'd understand people who find it repetitive. I'll go into much more detail now.- GAMEPLAY -Like in the original, you take control of different main characters in different eras. Unlike the original, this game plays much more like a traditional JRPG. It is huge world with a lot of text and a lot of cutscenes. You explore an overworld map, fight battles, and progress the story. You equip yourself, you choose your party members, you choose your battle formations, you can switch classes, and you can look for secrets.How does the overworld map work? You wander around and any leveling you do contributes to your ""global level."" Grinding this way is slow, but you do get unlimited dash. Grinding isn't necessary to beat the main game at all. As you explore, you run into areas that lock you into a subarea and start a Half Minute Quest. Your starting level is your global level and the quest plays out a lot like a quest from the original game, in which you have thirty seconds to defeat an Evil Lord before they destroy the world. Sometimes you have to trigger certain events, like finding a key or building a bridge, in order to find and defeat the boss. You can pay a money hungry goddess to reset your thirty second timer. When you finish the quest, the barriers and time limit go away and you reset to your global level. And you continue on like you were playing a traditional JRPG.The basic game mechanics are almost exactly like the first game, except that you can see your enemies. If you're at a much a higher level than the enemy, you won't be forced into a battle screen when you touch them... you'll just automatically win. The quests are still very creative in this game and there are lots of new gimmicks (hope you don't mind solving ice puzzles or dealing with flipped controls in 30 seconds...) Some of the quests feel really epic. It's a lot of fun.In addition to the five part story mode, there are four other modes to play.Time Attack: You can replay the quests you've unlocked from story mode. You can freely set your equipment, party, and formation to go for a high score.Infinite Mode: You fight an infinite number of evil lords. You go through different maps and have to kill ten evil lords that randomly spawn in the stage. After you beat ten, you move to a different stage and repeat until you can't restart the timer.Map Editor: Make/Share your own quests. This is pretty well done and not too hard to use. You can search for, download, and play other people's quests. Most of the highly ranked quests are really fun.Battle: Multiplayer mode, you compete with other people to defeat the evil lord first. There are eight different maps in this mode.- STORY -The story is a lot richer and more serious this time around, but it still keeps its tongue-in-cheek tone. It is a continuation to the original Half Minute Hero story. There are actually a lot of callbacks to the first game. A surprising amount of familiar faces show up again as villians, heroes, or both. It's a good take on the huge RPGs of the SNES era. I enjoyed the story (especially from the second chapter onwards), but I could understand people thinking it's too slow or too cliche (even though it's cliche on purpose.)The story mode follows three generations of heroes: Yuusha, Yushia, and Yuja. Yuusha is a play on the amnesiac, emo hero. He's even got one wing. He's captain of the royal forces on a special mission. Although he has a cold demeanor, he's a very caring guy. Yushia is a student of the Goddess school in a world ruled by the Empire. She's a bit naive and has to deal with a crazy escalating situation. Yuja is a brawn over brains kind of guy who's living in a post-apocalyptic type world that's been ruined by the gods. Each story mostly deals with saving the world within 30 seconds, but the overarching threat is different each time and each story has its own themes. Each of the heroes makes a contract with a Time Goddess who will reset time for them... for an increasingly high fee. Both main characters and supporting cast are pretty endearing.As you can guess, this game addresses a lot of RPG tropes. You get lots of adventure, romance, betrayal, artifact collecting, and plot twists. There are evil empires, dark lords, time streams, and rivals to fight. You take on evil groups like the ""Eight Elementals"", ""The Three Generals"", the ""Dark Time Goddess"", and the ""Venus Seven."" The creators use a lot of cliches, but they use them knowingly. The story is clearly a take on character driven SNES-rpgs, especially Final Fantasy.- PRESENTATION -The graphics follow the original Half Minute Hero's retro look, although this time around, the style is much closer to 16-bit RPGs of the SNES era. If you like that look, you'll love the art. There are a ton of sprites and a ton of maps. Most of the main characters and villians have concept art you can collect in game. The concepts were drawn by different artists and it's fun to compare the concept to the actual sprite.The music is really great and done by a large group of great composers. There are vocal songs this time too, which add a really epic feel.- CLOSING -I'm a huge Half Minute Hero fan and grew up playing SNES RPGs, so I really loved this game. It's not just more of the same, I'd say the developers took even bigger risks this time by trying to make a full length game. It feels like a loving, fast paced take on a great traditional RPG.			"

												Amazing Game, a parody on RPGs that is really underrated and a great sequel to the first game. The story is funny, and when it gets serious out of nowhere it is, most of the time, really done well. Compared to the first game, the tone is really different and the game itself stops being a complete parody around the end of the first ""chapter"" (Overture).The gameplay keeps the core mechanic of the first game and greatly expands it, being basically Hero 30 with classes, a new revamped Allies system and skills. It kinda slows down compared to the first one thanks to the skills but there is a way to turn their effects off to get the feeling of rush from the first game.While I do recommend playing its prequel first, especially because the story has some important ties to the first one, it is not required at all and most of the jokes and characters won't really stop being interesting.The crafting and cassino system are not really well done, but they are not required at all and are clearly there to keep the game going after it ended, though are not executed really well.On the other hand, the Time Attack, Map Creation are really cool and can keep people who really liked the game interested. The game has some really cool quests, but that can be kind of ""grindy"" if people didn't really like the Global System, which is a system that tranforms the game into a more traditional RPG outside of the main quests.Finally, the game has loads of content, and if people liked the core gameplay, they really won't be running out of time anytime soon, as long as they have the coins needed to keep going.

Perfect RPG for people who don't have time for epic 60 hours stories where you need to play for at least 3 hours each time if you want it to be worth it. Half Minute Hero's quests are a 5 to 10 minutes thing on your first playthrough, which is perfect for someone who can barely manage 30 minutes of playtime per day.			"

												Even more brilliant than the first game to play through.  Unfortunately the Global Level system hampers the ""Master each individual stage"" aspect that was a huge draw in the first game... but the actual main adventure this time is several times bigger and more creative than the original Hero 30 mode, and the level creator and sharing in Steam Workshop is fantastic.  Seriously, play this.			"

												I played the first game on PSP, it's a truly innovative game, but then i was saddened because i had no way to play the second game(Because my PSP broke and no english Localization) until realizing that Gaben had brought this blessing upon Steam, even localized, i did not know of this until the year 2016, i was so late on buying this game.My main reason to buy this game would be because of35% - A certain green haired monster from the first game getting her happy ending after being reborn as an angel (Sasha ;D) 20% - Sequel of such an innovative game35% - Coo's Song and Magnolia10% - Want to contribute by buying the gameNot going to be too detailed, but to make this a real review, here are the pros and cons which i think are the easiest to spot, and some gameplay review.-Pros-Enhancement of core gameplay.Better party system than the first game.Better UI than the first game.Great Soundtracks made by great artists.Funny and Great Story with a great conclusion.-Cons-The second game gave up the multiple gameplay uniqueness that the first game had, only focusing on HERO30(core) gameplay.The first game had better final battle(imo).Not as innovative as the first game.The game is fairly simple at first, you get 30 seconds before the world is doomed, you level up super fast and kill the boss before he finishes dooming the world, almost every stage seemed impossible to finish in 30 seconds, but there's this gimmick( lolyoucanresettimebypayinggolds ) to help you manage, you need to go to towns, gather informations, get to hidden places, get hidden stuffs, trigger events for gud stories, and anything to make defeating the boss easy, if you've played Final Fantasy VI before, the game actually carries some reference from that game, like where you have to wait until the last second to wait for certain someone and the  last boss battle where the boss fights with his body part from bottom to top resembling Kefka's last boss battleBefore deciding to play this game, i highly recommend you to play the first game, they gave you the first game and the soundtrack for Free if you bought the second game(Ermahgerd free Coo's Song D:), the first game is also a great game, some may also think that it's better, to understand the story of the game's universe, i really recommend you to play the first game first before playing the second one, it could also make you feel a lot better encountering all those cameos from the first game.I finished the game without trying to complete everything in 15 hours, it's a good trip for 10$(2.5$ if you bought it on summer sale), really... really good trip ;_; .

												I loved the first Half Minute Hero and I was excited to see a follow up , but was dissappointed when I gave it a go.The graphic style has lost its 8 bit pixel charm and whilst I understand they need to make it better and different from the original offering, it just doesn't work and it looks any another game made using RPG maker.The fast paced action is also gone and is turned into a repetitive grind as there are no longer random encounters and instead the quests and monsters appear on the world map, making it lack the variety found in Half Minute Hero 1.The story gets a more serious spin as well, but for a game of a parody nature it just doesn't work. All of the characters are flat, 1 dimensional and uninspired (which would not have been a problem in the original).The parody, jokes and 4th wall humour are much less and almost absent, making this game feel really empty compared to the first one.I tried to like this game but just couldn't. Instead, I highly reccomend playing Half Minute Hero 1 if you have not played it already. For any returning players, you may be disappointed. "

												The first game was awesome. Original, excellent gameplay, excellent OST, excellent characters...This game has all of that except the originality just because is the second game, but is still a unique game, even compared with the first one.Every level is a 30 second RPG. Thankfully you have the goddess of the Time to help you... if you pay her.The difference with the first game is that while the first game had level selection, this has a map where you can level up and get gold and items outside the levels. But don't worry, the level in the map and the levels is different. In the map you earn the 10% of the gold you get in the levels, so buying weapons in the levels is cheaper (but usually you don't have time enough to buy them or you can't afford them because you are praying to the goddess a lot).There are more differences like a party and a formation for battles, but I think that is better if you see that by yourself.Oh, and there's a map editor.If you liked the first one you'll like this. If you haven't played the first one... do it yourself a favor and do it.			"

												What do you get when you mix a plethora of humor, moments that will make you go ""......Oh man"", a story that has a suprisingly good amount of depth, amazing music, and entertaining quality to boot? You get the sequal of Half Minute Hero, which was already a good game to begin with. This sequal steps up the quality in almost every way which I find is quite rare in sequals these days. With new features such as the new free roam, level creation,  the Hero Castle and much more, I found it not only to be a great game, but a amazing one as well.Of course every game has faults. Sure you might not connect with the hero you start with at first, theres a quest here and there that might force you to pull your hair, and the final boss won't satisfy all, but these shortcomings are extremely overshadowed by the games positives!If you are in anyway a fan of JRPGs, if you want to be entertained by fast paced and, at the same time, gameplay that makes you think. If you want to laugh and shed a tear for the characters you play as and meet along the way. Hell, if you are, in any remote way, a fan of the previous game or want to try your hand at this series: GET. THIS. GAME!I'm not personally a fan of scores, but in this case my thoughts are to it being almost perfect, with some drawbacks holding the game back. It's a 9/10 in my eyes and I hope there are those out there that have similar views. I hope you enjoy!			"

												This game should be renamed Half Minute Hero: The AnimeNo really, I'm serious.First take the really good gameplay of the first half minute hero and then smash it at all the cliches from all action anime that you have ever seen in your life. It will create the most beautiful and awesome game made in anime heaven. For most people this would seem like a turn-off from the first game since it would take nearly everything from the story, art and a bit of the soundtrack out of the window. They would expect another same looking JRPG with a bit more fleshed out story and gameplay than the first one, but instead they got a massive RPGmaker looking game coated in anime weaboo sparkles.Am I the only one who was actually ok with this? Yea? Ok then.Weaboo Review:For me, the story was AMAZING. It literally was a massive throwback to all my favorite action animes, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam, Code Geass, etc. It was complete with some 4th wall breaking jokes and the ending battle cliche where the protag remembers his fallen friends and the protag's journey to fight his own fate/destiny. There was a LOT of reading to be done in this game though. It's almost like a VN. -Story- Game w/ weaboo glasses:       10000/10Real Review:Story w/out weaboo glasses:  5/10Now, taking the weaboo glasses off, the story was almost bland to the extent of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥people off. The characters didn't seem to have that much depth. The first protag guy who seemed to be the stereotypical Kirito, who at first seemed really normal-ish but then got kicked in the nuts by reality and now turns into a overreactional emo b*tch. The other protag characters were also stereotypical, the girl protag who raises your hopes of being more fleshed out than the other ones but turned out to be another determined stereotypical Asuna (who cries alot). The third one was simply... Naruto. Just.. Naruto. There's literally no other way I can express him.The gameplay was basically the same as the first one except they threw out all of the cleveressness and the parody-ish style of the first one where they mocked the all the grinding in JRPG games and instead replaced it with just.. Grinding. Like, grinding for ?? f*cking minutes to get to  lvl ????? You can literally brute force your way to any situation. It literally goes like this.  Get Objective ---> Grind ---> ???? ---> ProfitI myself didn't really fell the grind while playing this game because the dialouge usually kept things fresh with a small joke or some 4th wall breaking. They also added a bit of a mech thing gameplay that I don't really get. It didn't actually change anything from the original fast-paced grinding of the first one but.. it was simply a thing. That was there. o.OGameplay: 6/10The art? Ehh, the first one was better. The first one gave it a standard-ish RPG looking game that you would normally find on other online flash games like Kongregate, etc. which you don't usually find in other JRPG games and gave it a really unique and memorable feel to the game. The second one just seems like another one of those... RPG maker types of games. >.>Art: 6/10 (Why is it not 5? Because of the PLOT.)Soundtrack? Umm.. It was okay I guess...?It didn't really stand out much apart from the boss scenes when you're rewarded with rock music blaring from your speakers that would make any rock fan proud. The music at times gets cut off by battles with monsters and after you complete them it starts back from the start. So you can't really enjoy the soundtrack unless you literally just put your controller down and listen.Ain't nobody got time for dat.So yeah.. 6/10 for the soundtrack.And right now, I could just guess what you're thinking, 'With all these horrible scores why would you recommend this game?' Because I can't. I really can't not (double negatives woo) recommend this game. My inner weaboo keeps my hand from clicking the No in the recommendation bar. So to anyone who is still reading don't buy this game if you CAN'T STAND action cliche's or just anime in general.			"

												Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming is a lot like the first game, but even better.  The music is top notch and the gameplay is very different and fun. The game is beautiful in its aesthetic and the humor is very fun. If you enjoyed the first game, you will enjoy this game.  If you didn't like the first one, you may not like this one. For those on the fence, I think it is worth a look. The one negative is that the game can be pretty difficult the first time through, perhaps the game should have had more tutorials to it.			"

												This game totally fits my preference of wanting to play JRPGs without sitting through lengthy talking and pretty effects.   Dialogue is concise, to the point, and funny.  The localization keeps the original Japanese's style and feeling without being too literal or losing humor.  Grinding 10 levels in a few seconds and wacking enemies away is always satisfying, and the difference between the 16-bit dot-art and the artist renderings crack me up as usual.I like that this gives you an optional mode to grind for permanent stats; what you get out of it is miniscule but it helps if you're completely stuck.  If you want a challenge you can ignore it and charge ahead, choosing your own difficulty.			"

												It may seem unassuming from the screenshots, but make no mistake, this is one of my top 10 games of all time. And it almost didn't come to the West at all. It was a Japan only PSP game for years before getting ported on the fly due to the success of the first game on Steam.Half Minute Hero 2 is a direct sequel to the first Half Minute Hero, and it contains similar gameplay to the Hero mode from the original. You play as a series of powerful heroes in different time periods and must embark on a mission to save the world from whatever threat exists at that point in time. The twist? It's only 30 seconds till the world is destroyed and only the Time Goddess can turn back time and let you survive - but only if you pay her.This sets the stage for one of the most crazy fast-paced RPGs ever made, and while it felt somewhat repetitive in the original game, The Second Coming turns it up to 11 with a huge cast of characters, eargasmic music from the greatest video game composers to ever grace the planet, and even a giant mecha-slash-castle that serves as a home base AND a robotic monster slaying machne.Very few games have used many heroes across time before, but when they do, they seem to pull it off very well. Just look at Live A Live. This game is no exception and the story keeps on getting better as the game progresses.That's not to say this game isn't flawed, far from it. The missions can still be a little repetitious as the game goes on, and the story, while fun, won't win any awards for best writing (though it may hit you in the feels). But as a sum of its parts, it's a glorious homage to old school RPGs while not getting bogged down with old school gameplay and being original enough to do its own thing.			"

Overall, a decent sequel to the original, though some may find the focus on story to be a detractor from what made the original game so good.			"

												Uhh... Sh*t, i'm speechless. How can i put this down? Let's see... Take the character development, the RPG style and the feels of the Final Fantasy golden era, and a ground-breaking game concept such as the 1st Half Minute Hero game. Give them some wine, some private space, you know what i'm talking about. Wait for 30 seconds and you get this game. This game just feels like it knows what it is, and does what it should do amazingly. The first game did it nicely, but... there was something missing. The RPG feel was kinda lacking, the character development was not done to maximum potential, and the gameplay just felt a bit too linear. It was basically a concept with an insane amount of potential. Now, don't take me wrong. i played the game, i liked it. But this game managed to squeeze every ounce of potential off of the concept, and did it in the best way possible. The sheer amounts of content in this game are impressive. Multiplayer, Level Editor, Steam Workshop support, infinite mode, time attack And almost 30 hours of main storyline. The soundtrack is possibly one of the most well composed ones out there, boosting the game feel by a lot. None of the characters in this game are stand-off or flat in any way, but the game doesn't slap your face with their attitudes, and are just dang fun to play with. The storyline's fairly simple to understand, but complex enough to keep you interested into what's going to happen. As i already said, this game knows what it wants to be, and does it in the best way possible. The feeling of the game is silly in an enjoyable way, but this can change to best fit certain parts of the game (such as when Coo dies in the 4th chapter, so sad ;_;). In my opinion, though, the best improvement from the previous game is how they handled the Overworld outside of quests. In the first one, the overworld was almost not there. It was a level select, pretty much. But in this one, you could walk around, raid Dungeons outside of quests, visit villages without the 30 seconds limit, buy gear that you couldn't afford during quests, and just generally have a good time. Then again, this game's 10€ (11, including the DLC containing perhaps the best DLC section ever made, check some of my screenshots out for more information).  AND by paying 10€, you even get the first game! That's even more content for such a low price! In total, the first and the second are gonna be roughly 50-55 hours of Gameplay. So yeah, if you have some spare money on your wallet and still don't have this game, this is definitely the way to go if you like RPGs and fun games.			"

												This game is a worthy successor to the first game, which you get for free when buying this, so that's a hell of a deal right there. While the first game felt a bit more of a parody of the whole JRPG genre, this one feels more like they're playing it straight, while at the same time keeping their very unique and quirky style. While this game doesn't seem to feature extra modes like Evil Lord 30, Princess 30, or Knight 30, it does expand greatly upon the Hero 30; play an entire JRPG adventure in 30 seconds style, adding things like weapon crafting, global dungeons, a traversable map, collectibles and a pretty sweet castle. This game isn't quite as out there as the first, but it also feels better from a gameplay perspective, now when you go back to get certain titles or equipment, you may do so with your full party and equipment from where you are in the currently, not being restricted to items that you had on your first pass of the level. These games have always felt more like puzzle games to me rather than JRPGs, you have to figure out how to level up, manage your money, and do it all within a certain time limit. The game gets very intense in later levels, and has an absolutely fantastic soundtrack that makes the best parts of this game shine even brighter. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of JRPGs or anime, or anyone who like speed-running games. There are other modes to speak of, but I haven't played the Multiplayer yet, though the Infinite Hero mode was really fun, you basically just keep leveling up and fighting one Evil Lord after another, trying to set a high score, changing levels every 10 bosses you defeat. Honestly this game is a really fun game to just pick up and play, its levels take probably 1-5 minutes, with the longer ones being probably at least 10-15 minutes, but there are a lot of levels, and it feels good to binge play or to just do 3-4 levels at a time. The levels consist of you sprinting around a map, fighting enemies, helping people, leveling up, and trying to defeat some sort of enemy in 30 seconds, on the normal setting, time is paused in towns, and you can reset time by paying a certain amount of money to a goddess statue in town, the fee gets greater and greater each time. The story can be a bit bland/jrpg-ish when it's not being funny or having completely badass moments. The characters are likable, even if Yusha is kind of that emo jrpg protag, he's still cool, and he's only really bad if you choose to make him be bad. I highly recommend playing the first game before you play this one, there are lots and lots of references to the first game, and you would probably be missing something if you just jumped right into the second one, which should kind of be obvious, but don't worry, as I said, you get the first game free with the purchase of this one. I'm just gonna stop my disjointed ramblings now and say: It's a good game, full of good humor, fun characters, and a great OST, which also comes bundled with the game.			"

												Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming is carefully orchestrated chaos. It is, at its core, frantic slices of old-school RPG action bookended by massive lumps of old-school RPG text dump. It’s kind of satirical of the grind-fests at old, but it’s that special kind of satire we don’t see enough of that manages to stand strong on its own merits while poking fun at its foundations. It’s inventive and clever and, thankfully, has a skip key for when all that text starts to crush you in sheer weight. It’s also crazy long thanks to an embarrassment of options, which would make its very title an oxymoron if it wasn’t also completely accurate.Full review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12271/pc/half-minute-hero-the-second-coming/review.html "

												There are not many games that live up to the word ""sequel"". ""Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming"" is definitely not one such game. This sequel of ""Half Minute Hero"" expands on the simple game-play by adding more items, skills, and developing the already amazing storyline. ""Second Coming"" has a more traditional RPG feel but still has a distinguishable style that fans have come to love from the first game. One new feature allows the player to level up the base level of the hero. This allows a player to start at a higher level when they begin a new quest. Another new feature is the ability to create and share custom maps with other players. A core mechanic from “Half Minute Hero” is the ability to find new armor and weapons as you play the game. You are able to go back and play the same map again so that you can earn weapons that you may have missed. You may also find a different path that may lead to a secret. These new features, combined with the story, make this game worth buying.The “Hero 30” series is known to have a great story that spans across the different game modes. The story is filled with great characters to fight by your side, tongue and cheek comedy, and the every so greedy Time Goddess. It takes place hundreds of years after the first game where the Hero has saved the world from destruction. I won't spoil the story for you as it is very well done and is worth experiencing for yourself. All in all, if you are looking for a fast paced game brimming with personality and content then “Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming” is worth your TIME and money but remember....You only have 30 SECONDS to save the world.

												The game so far is like the original minus some elements that have been remastered the controls are as follows.Arrows keys for movement, C for Accept X for decline and so on you just require them to edit the settings.The controller support doesn't work and I'm using a Xbox 360 Controller though this seems odd due to it having Joystick support and seeming to accept the controller layout quite well.Also this game has a few launching issues IE black screen on start up please type the following into the launch settings from the steam launch settings for the game (-height 1080 -width 1920) this works for me you may also wish to try -win and -autoconfig (Please upvote so people can see this and know the resolution for these issues pardon the Pun)I would rate the game at a ecstatic 7.5/10 so far and I'm at the second chapter not a game I would advise to the norm but if you love 2d pixels graphics, Epic music and lots of text (Which can be skipped with ease by using ENTER then this is the game for you.

												to those just entering the series, wait. pick up the original first!.. its not required for this per se, but i highly reccomend it just for the sake of knowing what to expect for half the price (and also, i does tie in somewhat[AND you get 25% off owning the original]).on the outside it might just look like another pixel-art-indie-rpg, but you're wrong to assume that. these games are a great value and poke fun at a lot of the industries tropes, while having an identity of their own. the whole 30 second thing might sound kind of gimmicky, and it kind of is, but in the best way. it keeps you on the edge of your seat every level, and in turn, failure is extremely forgiving because you dont lose too much progress.im about 5 hours in. finished the first ""section"" of the story and probably about half of the second. i'd say i'm probably 15-20% done with the singleplayer so its well worth the price, not to mention extra game modes... and while it only has the ""hero"" modes, lacking variety from the first, it still doesnt feel any less a game at all. its a more focused experience and it shows right off the bat.

												Note  :  If you buy the bundle you get this game and the first game. You only get the first game if you do not have it in your library already. For $21 i say go for it !  This game is simply amazing from the pixel art story and sound track. The game may look like it is form the snes ara but do not let that fool you throw your money at the screen now. Story The story of the game is filled with love betrayel and did the really just happen moments. I cannot really say much about it without spoiling it so ill let you find out for your self But you do have 30 seconds to save the world can you do it  ?  Gameplayyou only have 30 seconds to do everything. Level grind, find out information, go through dungeons,figure out puzzles. It may seem intimidating at first but this game does it right. battles are automated so you don't really have do worry about those. The only thing you do have to do is level up as fast as you can and give the goddes your money. when you get stronger you can one hit monsters off in the field without going into battle which is a nice feature. Towns feature shops,people you can talk to and the goddes statue. Dungeons feature alot of thinsg from monsters to puzzle to mazes . The mazes may take a bit to figure out. sound Man the ost in this game is simpy amazing.

												Long story short? It's a lot of fun.For those who haven't played the first and don't know what to expect, this game isn't exactly what you'd expect just by hearing about it and looking at it.The first game is less of a ""rapid RPG"" or speedrun-esque thing and more of a large series of puzzles. This is true as well in the sequel, although in the later stretches of the game, you will definitely feel more of an action RPG vibe.You can mash through any level simply by grinding hard enough on the overworld, but a true challenge presents itself when you refuse to grind, and push onward using your wits. It's a nice timesink, and incredibly worth your money, considering you get this game, a kickass OST, and the (admittedly poorly handled) port of the first game.I've not done the multiplayer or messed with the level creation tools all that much, but in my honest opinion, that stuff really isn't why you buy the game.

												This is a game series about saving the world in 30 seconds... sort of. Actually anywhere from 2 to 5 minutes in practice but it still has the ""Wario Ware roleplaying game"" feel about it.What's kind of interesting and ambitious is that the nature of the parody is naturally running a little dry, so the game doesn't sell itself strictly on its core gimmick anymore. That was a very smart move on the developer's part, in my opinion. It doesn't strictly feel like a series of action levels emulating an RPG this time around. This game is actually a true RPG as well. You explore, grind on enemies, search for collectables, all that good stuff. Just that the original game's arcadey gameplay is the meat of the story segments and are replayable in much the same way (with the ability to turn off the advantage the RPG-side of the game offers). The story is a bit more substantial and the characters have a more coherent and central role, with the ability to set your own party and no restrictions on equipment. It's not quite as *overtly* silly as the original game, it takes itself a bit more seriously -- but not by a whole lot. A defining silly moment for me is when one of the protagonists goes inside a virtual boy game and inside the game you have to use a controller to clear a path. Trippy.There aren't other gameplay modes besides the standard this time, but those were kinda weak additions to the original game in the first place. Instead you play through different protagonists across time and each story has a distinctly different tone or feel, ranging from deadly serious to a lighthearted Chrono Trigger-style affair. The best part to me has to be the expanded multiplayer functions  -- you can play any of the protagonists! -- and the ability to make your story maps. Being able to share through the steam workshop is a plus too. The interface is a lot better and it's a much more natural PC port than the original and doesn't suffer the same shortcomings i.e. the lag, bugs and cut features.It's a great sequel and consider it strongly recommended if you enjoy the original. The story has a lot of continuity and connection to the original, a really surprising degree. I'd recommend trying out the original game to really feel some of that impact, but it's far from required to enjoy the whole thing.			"

												It is hard for me to recommend this game after dragging through it for so long. This is coming from someone who loved the first half min hero.(This is worth buying due to having the first game also when you buy this)Unlike the first game that was semi serious (in a sense) and had hits of RPG of parody, this game is almost a damn parody in itself where the humor is literal nonexistent and cringe worthy after the constant jokes it tries to convey.The thing that the first half min hero did well was keeping the gameplay fresh, with 4 different stories in it with all different types of gameplay. However, in this game you are force to do 75 levels of the same♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over again, where it becomes boring and dull.This game also has a open world system where your only task is to GRIND, and that’s it.I still enjoyed it up into the half way point but the game should've ended a lot earlier than it did. If you like JRPG grinding then you’ll love this game. I just hope if a third game is made, they learn from their mistakes,			"

												The sequel to the ultimate ""JRPG lite"" game. Stages are 30 seconds long (but you can rewind time) and you need to grind monsters and save the world before you run out of time. This one comes with the first game bundled for free now which makes it an even better offer.Not too deep but still great and full of JRPG satire.			"

												Having 100%'d this game after 40+ hours and found myself wanting more, it's safe to say I thoroughly enjoyed this game.Whereas the first game's RPG mode was only one of several different modes with unique gameplay, Half-Minute Hero: The Second Coming scraps those secondary modes and focuses solely on the high-speed RPG. You spend most of the game doing quests that usually give you a 30 second time limit to complete them. It's hard to impossible to actually complete any quest in that amount of time however, so there are almost always Goddess Statues to reset the timer for a small amount of gold. Each of the 80 or so quests pretty much boils down to going to a town to find out how to solve the gimmick blocking access to the boss, solving the gimmick, then going to beat the boss... resetting the timer whenever necessary. Thankfully, a surprisingly engaging hilarious story and the occasional quest that mixes things up keeps the formula from becoming too grating.The biggest difference between this game and the first is the world map. Instead of simply picking a quest, you actually explore with your team in true RPG fashion. You can even level up, collect gold to spend on items you may have missed during quests, and go into some dungeons free of a time limit. Best of all, your level will carry over to the quests you play, lessening the amount of grinding necessary to complete each one. Another great thing is that you can use any gear in any quest after you obtain it. The first game locked gear away making it all feel kind of pointless, but in this one, if you want to take your ultimate gear to the first quest and wreck the boss in one hit, feel free!There's really not much more to say. This baby is well worth the asking price, especially since it comes with the first game AND the entire soundtrack (which has some damn great tunes in it).			"

												a sequel done right. it has all of the features that you know and love but with even more fun. instead of the original mission based gameplay, you have the global map and the mission areas. on the global map you can earn money and kill monsters to increase your global level and get better gear. the gear and global level then can be taken into the mission area to give you a starting edge. they have also added in team formations. as you are going along, you will get new teamates to take with you into battle and arrange them in a formation that suits you best. on top of all of this, the game comes with a map editor so that you can create your own maps or download an play others which makes this game virtually endless.the only problem that i have with the game so far is the the global level can make the game very easy at points. the ability to grind without a time limit means that you can kill the same monster 50 times and go into the next mission starting at level 15. this is of course an overexageration, because the leveling system in the missions is far more sped up than the leveling system on the global map, but it gets my point across.all in all, a wonderful game that gives me more of the fast paced gameplay that i have been wanting.

												Great Game!If you played the first one, you'll love it, but keep in mind that part 2 is much more RPG then the first game. You don't do every mission via some sort of mission-selection, but you will just play on and on switching some continents which are big maps in which you walk around. You will also walk around without 30 second missions to level up your ""Global Level"" which will be the starting level you start your 30 second quests with. Also there is much more and deeper story than before, so if you like story -> Go for it. If you just want action, skip the story via ENTER and dash forward.So, stop reading and buy it already !p.s. AWESOME Soundtrack!!!			"

												Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming is 100% of my favourites of this year. The game has brought great joy to me. And while the story can be (They are) rather silly, I have to say that I just really loved it, no matter how silly or sad it got. The gameplay is the same as in the first game and that's completely alright.Half Minute Hero 2 kept surprising me over and over again and I always lighted up with a smile when i saw the next story arc and found secrets here and there.This is a true gem for every Action RPG lover, do not make a mistake by taking this game lightly for it's graphics.

The game is still missing some things that should of been added but they weren't. In-game chat, that's it =3. This won't be added though since the game's code is coming from the PSP and chat from PSP is a long sale without any type of keyboard. Overall, THIS GAME IS AWESOME! and my review was done in over 30 sec... wait what *BOOM*			"

												I loved every second.For a parody game, it has a fantastic story.  It perfectly balances the humour and seriousness at the right times so it never feels out of place. Even though the characters are such low res sprites, they are brimming with personality. I literally could not put this game down. It kept me hooked the whole way.The game is held up by a wonderful soundtrack. Every tune fits the scenario it is played for and is varied enough that everyone will find at least a couple songs that they absolutely love.Overall it was a blast to play. If you are unsure about it, a gameplay trailer would be able to descride it better than words can.Side note: The DLC missions are 100% worth it as well.This is definitely one of my favorite games.

												INDONESIAN FIRST IMPRESSION


YouTube™ Video: Game Apaan Ini! Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming 

			Views: 68		

			First Impression gw tentang Half Minute Hero Second Coming! Beli disini: http://bit.ly/1q2SwGN dan main bareng gw. Developer: OPUS Publisher: MarvelousAQL Producer: salazar@maql.jp Gabung Pemuda...		

Pengalaman pertama gw terhadap game ini setelah main 3 jam pertama. Ruarrrrrr Biasa! (Review ini bakal direvisi terus)Feel Fast Paced RPG-nya dapet banget, dimana kita jadi Hero yang sama yang ngelanjutin cerita Half Minute Hero sebelumnya. Jujur gw belom nyobain yang pertama dan cuma nonton di Youtube. Game ini masih soal nyelamatin dunia dari semua Evil Demons yang muncul dan menghancurkan dunia dalam waktu 30 Detik saja. Gameplaynya yang menarik juga disuguhi dengan background music yang luar biasa bikin deg-deg-ser. Main Storynya kita bakal mainin sampai 500 tahun cerita dan bakal banyak dialog juga di game ini dan hati-hati dengan tombol enter, bakal skip dialognya dan bener-bener cepet banget. Salah satu hal menariknya adanya dukungan Oculust Rift dan Map Editor, bukan cuma Multiplayer Battle yang selalu bikin rame game ini tapi juga bisa share Map bikinan kita sendiri di steam workshop. Terus selain Multiplayer Battle, ada juga Infinite Battle dan Time Attack Battle yang bisa nyombongin hasilnya ke Leaderboards secara global.Ngomongin soal Multiplayer, jangan tanya soal serunya, pasti seru! kalian bisa cepet-cepetan ngalahin Evil Demons ataupun Co-op. Yang nyesek sekaligus bikin seru ya siapa yang terakhir nge-kill dia dinobatin sebagai HERO! tapi, titlenya bisa aja jadi Fake Hero. Harganya $19,99? Bisa dibilang mahal tapi worth to buy. Karena emang dahsyat dan banyak fiturnya. 90/100 dari gw untuk saat ini.			"

												Man, for a supposedly fast JRPG series, there sure is a lot of talking. In fact in my one hour of playtime, I think I spent more time reading dialogue than playing the game. I don't remember the first game wasting so much of my TIME. Not to mention the tutorials just go on and on, injecting humor when all I can think about is how much I want to put into PRACTICE ALREADY what was just explained to me.I think I liked the first one better.One out of five Lennys( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )			"

												Get the first game instead (Half Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy). The second one is dull and grindy (exactly the thing that the first game was mocking), there's endless and ultimately meaningless dialogues which slow this game down to a crawl, while it should be relatively fast-paced. The game lacks the humor the first one had, and I could go on and on.The concept is good, and the game itself isn't that bad. But I just cannot recommend this game over the first one.			"

												Yeah no.  They took everything about the first game's retro RPG style and turned it completely weeaboo... In a game that's supposed to be fast paced and right down to action, there's TOO much dialog for a game called Half Minute Hero... some of the dialog in the first area alone can take up to 5 minutes to sit through and read. This is just unacceptable on every level. I literally pressed start to skip past the dialog and skipping past some of the dialog would take upwards of 10 full seconds... I'm here to play a faced paced game, not read a novel.This game is more grindy than the first, there's a lot more back and forth running between areas, the enemies are much tougher than they were in the first game  as well which is exactly why the game is more of a grind out. I hate the characters, they're all weeaboos, the menu is too weeaboo as well with convoluted ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t vomited bile and the art style is really bunk.In this installment instead of controlling a single character you have an entire posse watching your back, except you can't equip them with gear so I mean, what's the point of having a party if you can't manage them? Aren't these weeaboo games supposed to be all about sifting through menus and upgrading characters for 20 minutes before moving 10 feet and having to reconfigure again? They even tried to implement the feel of those style of games by letting you walk around on the over world map and gain another set of levels separate from the levels you gain inside of a stage... sounds ridiculous? It is. This game hardly makes sense, not that I don't understand it, it's just incredibly convoluted for no apparent reason other than to be a schizophrenic disaster like most weeb games are... like just keep it simple... why all this noise and distraction every time I want to move forward?If you're a weeb, this is probably right up your autistic alleyway. For normal RPG lovers and gamers who enjoyed the first game, because it reminded them of old school pixel games like Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, (Which again is weeb, just not to the Nth degree that it's become now with dudes that other dudes would like to bang because they look like chicks) then steer very clear of it... I got sick of the pacing after 40 minutes and uninstalled it. 4 / 10.First one did it better.			"

												I really enjoyed the first Half Minute Hero. The writing was minimal and charming.This game is the exact opposite. People talk too much, and what they say is insipid, cliched, stereotypical anime writing.There are additional features which come off as ridiculous, like party members, unlockable skills and riding a moving castle. I say they are ridiculous because none of them seem to affect the gameplay in any substantial way whatsoever. The gameplay is still running around the map quickly and knowing what your objectives are. I think if you have mediocre taste due to watching bad anime, and you are desperate for any JRPG, you will enjoy this. But if you are at all scrutinizing, this sequel is a let-down.			"

												Absolutely phenomenal game.  Game is broken down into several, alternating sections of old school RPG leading into 30 second quests.  Progress in 30 second quests is done in a hyper time where you level and earn gold like crazy.  The goal is to complete the quest in 30 seconds, but you can use (increasing) amounts of gold to reset the time.  Game is surprisingly long and broken into several chapters.  Alternate modes include a time trial of any quest or an 'infinite evil' where your goal is to kill as many bosses in a rogue-like setting.  While not difficult in really any aspect, it allows you to play entire RPGs in minutes instead of weeks.  Characters are amusing and reminded me of Magicka in their general lack of seriousness..Overall:  8.5/10  (Play it!)			"

												It's a solid game. If you liked the original HMH, you'll like this. Just make sure to turn off skill animations. Trust me >_>Unfortunately, this port leaves unchanged what I felt was one of the greatest flaws of the PSP version, which is that the time trial mode doesn't limit equipment you can use in any meaningful fashion. This makes the mode extremely boring (having OP equipment makes most stages complete jokes), which is a shame; trying to get better and better times on each stage is what made the first game awesome. Furthermore, the translation is... questionable at best. Much of the original characters' charm is gone (for instance, there's a character whose entire shtick is that she tries to act dignified, winds up getting angered by something, and then tries to switch back to formal speech as if nothing had happened; in the translation, she never acts dignified, barely sounds like she's getting mad, and then says ""Yes, I would."" Yes, I would have liked her to be localized better); literally translated names make puns unintelligible (""Yuusha"" literally means ""hero""... Why leave this untranslated? And there's one character whose name is a shortened version of his name in the previous game, but the names in the translation are completely different!); and ""Ojisama"" was translated as ""Geezer,"" which makes me cry.I realize I've been mostly negative, so let me say again: the core gameplay is still solid. If you treat it as a JPRG with a time-limit twist, you'll be in love. But after how superb the localization of the first game was, and how addicting and satisfying it was to solve the puzzles that were the individual level runs in the original, it's a shame to see the ball dropped so... thoroughly.

												I'd say this game is a weird commentary on the nature of JRPGs. The half minute hero format is interesting, though! You have 30 seconds to defeat whatever evil force is threatening to destroy the world/continent/whatever. Point is, you have 30 seconds! Oh no! That's not NEARLY enough time! Well luckily you have ""The power of the goddess"" on your side! Essentially you grind for 29 seconds, run to town, and pay N*100 gold to reset the clock, where N=1. This means the first reset is 100g, the 2nd 200 and so on. The challenge shifts from simply grinding until you're sufficiently leveled (the game literally tells you ""You>Evil!"" to say you're leveled enough) to managing your resets efficiently. I remember a mission, mission 3 or 4, where all of the good grinding mobs were a good deal further in the level. You will not always succeed the first time through, you need to know all the parameters to the challenge before you can farm and grind effectively. After you defeat a boss, you usually get put back in the open world, where your level and gold revert to a sort of macro profile. You had 10000 gold and 30 levels in the challenge? Tough, you're back to your global level and gold. The good news is the next time you start a new mission, you start at your global level, so a little in-between mission grinding goes a long way. Also in between missions is my preferred time to buy gear, because there are serious penalties if you can't afford a reset during a mission. I just got explained some sort of skill system. It sounds like it boils down to grinding a certain weapon to unlock sweet super moves. None of which you can pick, combat is entirely automated all the time. Hell, if you're too overpowered, you dont even get a battle screen, you just run over the enemy and it flies off the map, team rocket style. The writing is bleh, thank goodness you can skip it with a simple press of the start button. The goddess is this annoying money-♥♥♥♥♥ who loves getting gold, so while she's essential to saving the world, she's also a stupidly annoying character. Your hero is some generic angsty dude, I dont really know what his deal is. It's not very engaging.Overall, I suggest this game to anyone who likes JRPGs and something new. I'd pay 10, maybe 15 bucks for this game.			"

												I would be willing to say that this is just as good as the first one. To be Honest I was alright with the other modes in the original but my favorite by far was Hero 30. this game pretty much focuses on that alone as far as the main story is concerned. The original style of combat is still there with two added bonuses, players can learn special moves and equipt for in battle as well as any special move attached to the weapon being used. players can also level up outside of battle and earn money to catch a few items they may have missed during a quest. In turn you don't always have to replay a level to get items you may have missed. Global dungeons are cool too. They add a little extra to the play with more enemies and loot. overall it's a solid game.			"

												Thirty seconds to save the world once again. Half-minute hero second coming plays pretty much the same as it’s predecessor. For those unfamiliar with the series, it basically takes the main elements of JRPGS, like grinding, buying better equipment , doing side quests and beating the boss of the area and gives you 30 seconds to accomplish it. You can reset the clock by praying to the time goddess statues you’ll find in towns(where the counter stops), but each time you do will cost more money than the last one.So the game is basically a fast-paced puzzle where you must decide what to do first. While the first game had 4 types of game modes, this one only has the RPG one, that is divided in 5 main Arcs. The are various additions to the game though, like a walking castle that serves not only as a base but also as a giant robot you’ll use to fight overly big bosses, an overworld that you can explore for secrets without having to worry about the time and a class and skill system.The plot is still charmingly silly, parodying classic rpgs clichés and story patterns, packed with charismatic characters and some more serious heartfelt moments now and then. This time around there’s more space for character development and a bigger emphasis on story, all while maintaining  the game’s humorous mood most of the times. For those who don’t want to be bothered with lengthy story though, a simple click on the action button will skip all the text.Half-minute Hero: The second coming is a worthy successor and an upgrade in almost every way from the original, fans of the first one and newcomers to the series alike should definitively give it a try. It’s well worth your money, and your time. "

												Marvelous USA gives us another fantastic helping of 30-second long JRPG action, with some very nice new features like map creation and parties, an actual overworld map and tons of silliness along the way. This is a wild speedrunning ride that only gets more frantic as you progress through the game's main story. This is an improvement over the original in pretty much every way, although that game is worth checking out as well. You say you don't have the time for a Japanese RPG? I think you can and should spare a lot more than 30 seconds for this game. Highly recommended.			"

 Running for your life at it's best  I've played this on the PSP and quite frankly I still have this and the original on my library(PSP), I must say that the translation is quite superb. I've been on the series ever since day-one of the release of the original Yuusha 30(Half Minute Hero) for the PSP back in 2009. With parodies like no other and insane fourth-wall retorts, this game is a must have. I'm very glad that MAQL decided to promote it to English speaking countries. And as always, a big thanks to Opus for creating the entire franchise XD.  Verdict  --30% of needed skill (100% completionist)...--50% of insane jokes...--80% of awesome storyline...--90% of amazing soundtrack...--95% of exhilarating gameplay...--100% reason to play the game...

												Best game i've played in quite a while.Half minute hero 2 (Or the second coming) is like the first one, mixes silly humor, challenge, speed, RPG elements and OH GOD WHY ARE YOU MAKING ME CRY LIKE THIS?!.The storyline of this games follows several generations of protagonists, I would say this game gets better if you played the first one first, otherwise a lot of references and characters will go over your head.The game is long, took me 12 hours to beat doing some side-quest stuff, i'm 14h in and I still have modes to do, the game also includes a map creator.Combat works as follows: You and your party are on the left side of the screen, que enemies on the right... your character will keep running to the right until he hits an enemy, and you will both take damage, automated? Yes, kinda, but that also makes it so you have to think ahead, calculating the time that it will possibly take to finish the battle, and yes, you don't want to lose time, since the world will blow up, and that hurts a little.This game also includes the first one and the soundtrack, so go and grab it!

												i have no idea how to put in to words how marvelous this game is.it has the best story i have seen in ages. easily beating triple a rpg titles.loveable characters. even characters from the previous (mostly) game make a comeback.however. unlike the previous game. this one no longer has the bullet hell or rts type (or sage defense) game anymore and instead put everything on rpg. which is damn awesome. you have skills. levels. weapon classes. jobs. the works. i recommend this game to those who have and have not played the first game.(last note: this game also includes it's OST album. which contains awesome songs)			"

												I miss those kind of Badassery JRPG storyline. This game, along with adrenaline long rushing gameplay with driving soundtracks, brings me back to those times when I'm addicted to Gameboy games as a kid. One of the games that I played when I was in primary school is Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. Both share similar approaches, indie style, emotional climax and an addictive, rushing, neverending-like gameplay.First time I took notice of this game was from Pewdiepie. As I watched those videos, the co-op feature was nice and make me want to play it. Bought this game during the Christmas sales as I prefer to save money. RM23 along with the first series was totally worth it. The only downside is the series doesn't have a large fanbase. Also, if you're looking to complete the game, there are some easter eggs that you need to look back and research and that takes away some of the fun.*Note that I never tried multiplayer.Overall it's my type of game. I would give it a 9/10 cuz I enjoyed it a lot.			"

 Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming review (as if you couldn't guess)  This game is literally everything you loved about the first game, and then more! Except if you loved the shooting mini-games of Princess 30, or pseudo-tactical segments of Evil-Lord 30 and Knight 30. Those aren't available. However! This game has an actual interesting story, which is something I really didn't expect from a game that got so little praise. Is there a reason not a lot of people talk about this game? WHO KNOWS!?It's got a world map which you're free to explore and increase your ""gLevel"" which is basically your starting level at the beginning of an actual quest. There's no time limit, and story points are very clear because there's literally a cursor pointing at the spot you go to advance the plot. It's great! Multiple storylines covering 500 years? AWWWWRIGHT! Great music? INDEED SO!Classes, parties, formations for those parties, actual equipment that matters that's also upgradeable!? SUMMON STONES!? THE HYPE INTENSIFIES. There's also a map editor for nerds that like that stuff. And an endless mode where you rush from Evil Lord to Evil Lord. Endlessly. I got 67 on normal mode. 6 on Hard. I will add more to this totally non-bias review once I finish all the campaigns and unlock all the achievements. Overall: 9/10-1 point for lack of modes other than hit stuff and level up. But the world map sure makes up for lack of modes.			"

												The gameplay is fun. That being said, it's constantly interrupted by the 'story.' At first, it seems to parody the generic save-the-world jRPG formula, but nearing the end it feels like they genuinely wanted a serious story and just couldn't decide so they went half-way on both. The quests take about 30 seconds to 2 minutes to complete, which gives the game a nice fast-paced feel. But, again, there's at least 2 minutes of pre-quest talk, and another 2-5 after it ends. It really breaks the flow of the game.Still, fun enough.			"

												A beautiful sequel to an already amazing game, enough said. The overall storyline is both funny and interesting. The soundtrack and music in this game also does it job remarkably well, blending in perfectly with the theme or to bring in emotions. I especially loved ""Coo's Song"" at the end of Ragnarok. The gameplay also lasts for around 20 hours with 5 gamemodes focusing on different timelines or story plots and 3 different ""Heroes/Heroine"". I haven't been so absorbed in a game since 5 years ago. This game is highly recommended.			"

												High speed Mission based format coupled with slower paced exploration make for a game that is fun in bursts, high-risk/reward without feeling too draining or stressful, and downright fun to play.There are only minor things that are handled badly in this game, and easily the worst is global level. If they wanted to do that they should've tied it to how many bosses have been defeated, or titles earned or something. As it stands it's easy to end up too strong for missions, when it feels like they shouldn't be too variable in the first place (have global enemies give gold, but not global experience).Despite this flaw, I can still strongly recommend this.

												Like the first game, 'Half Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy', you need to defeat the evil lords in 30 seconds. There's a Global map where you can run around and visit towns and find quests with no time limit. When you enter a quest, you have 30 seconds to finish it, which as far as I've seen involves defeating the quest boss, though everything between the quests start and the bosses defeat varies greatly, so there's no tedium there. Of course, realistically, you can't finish the quest in soley 30 seconds. You are 'aided' by the Goddess of Time, who will restore the time limit back to 30 seconds for a fee, a fee that increases each time you use it. So while it's not merely 30 seconds, ya need to get the lead out of yer♥♥♥♥♥ :D:Unlike the first game, you have a party, better equipment management, and instead of a caravan you see at the end of a quest/level, you have an overworld to explore.It's a great RPG, and if you liked the first game, you'll love the second(this one).

												This game is probably one of the most underrated games on Steam. It is basically a RPG where you have 30 seconds to complete each level.The game does not take itself seriously and contains parodies of the famous JRPG and constantly use self referential humour for example for the fact that you have to beat the boss within 30 seconds in each level.

												Really original concept and quite entertaining. More so than many other more traditional RPG.It features a nice JRPG-like story with a lot of humor and funny characters.The battles are automatic and fast, in contrast to the slow paced and repetitive traditional JRPG. And yet it is compelling since you have to watch your health and take care of having the right level when you go against each enemy (leveling is very fast during the matches, though).The matches involve small puzzles (some of them optional) where you have to visit certain points in the right order during 30 seconds bursts of time. You can reset the 30 seconds timer every time you visit a goddess statue but each time you need to spend more money on it, thus you have to use your time wisely and try to find out what's the best way to do it. The matches are sometimes quite tense, you can only relax between matches or when you visit a town.The custom maps, multiplayer and other goodies (various sets that will warrant you extra hours if you are a completionist) give it some replayability, also way more than your average RPG.

												I'd say this game is a weird commentary on the nature of JRPGs. The half minute hero format is interesting, though! You have 30 seconds to defeat whatever evil force is threatening to destroy the world/continent/whatever. Point is, you have 30 seconds! Oh no! That's not NEARLY enough time! Well luckily you have ""The power of the goddess"" on your side! Essentially you grind for 29 seconds, run to town, and pay N*100 gold to reset the clock, where N=1. This means the first reset is 100g, the 2nd 200 and so on. The challenge shifts from simply grinding until you're sufficiently leveled (the game literally tells you ""You>Evil!"" to say you're leveled enough) to managing your resets efficiently. I remember a mission, mission 3 or 4, where all of the good grinding mobs were a good deal further in the level. You will not always succeed the first time through, you need to know all the parameters to the challenge before you can farm and grind effectively. After you defeat a boss, you usually get put back in the open world, where your level and gold revert to a sort of macro profile. You had 10000 gold and 30 levels in the challenge? Tough, you're back to your global level and gold. The good news is the next time you start a new mission, you start at your global level, so a little in-between mission grinding goes a long way. Also in between missions is my preferred time to buy gear, because there are serious penalties if you can't afford a reset during a mission. I just got explained some sort of skill system. It sounds like it boils down to grinding a certain weapon to unlock sweet super moves. None of which you can pick, combat is entirely automated all the time. Hell, if you're too overpowered, you dont even get a battle screen, you just run over the enemy and it flies off the map, team rocket style. The writing is bleh, thank goodness you can skip it with a simple press of the start button. The goddess is this annoying money-♥♥♥♥♥ who loves getting gold, so while she's essential to saving the world, she's also a stupidly annoying character. Your hero is some generic angsty dude, I dont really know what his deal is. It's not very engaging.Overall, I suggest this game to anyone who likes JRPGs and something new. I'd pay 10, maybe 15 bucks for this game.			"

												Thirty seconds to save the world once again. Half-minute hero second coming plays pretty much the same as it’s predecessor. For those unfamiliar with the series, it basically takes the main elements of JRPGS, like grinding, buying better equipment , doing side quests and beating the boss of the area and gives you 30 seconds to accomplish it. You can reset the clock by praying to the time goddess statues you’ll find in towns(where the counter stops), but each time you do will cost more money than the last one.So the game is basically a fast-paced puzzle where you must decide what to do first. While the first game had 4 types of game modes, this one only has the RPG one, that is divided in 5 main Arcs. The are various additions to the game though, like a walking castle that serves not only as a base but also as a giant robot you’ll use to fight overly big bosses, an overworld that you can explore for secrets without having to worry about the time and a class and skill system.The plot is still charmingly silly, parodying classic rpgs clichés and story patterns, packed with charismatic characters and some more serious heartfelt moments now and then. This time around there’s more space for character development and a bigger emphasis on story, all while maintaining  the game’s humorous mood most of the times. For those who don’t want to be bothered with lengthy story though, a simple click on the action button will skip all the text.Half-minute Hero: The second coming is a worthy successor and an upgrade in almost every way from the original, fans of the first one and newcomers to the series alike should definitively give it a try. It’s well worth your money, and your time. "

												I would be willing to say that this is just as good as the first one. To be Honest I was alright with the other modes in the original but my favorite by far was Hero 30. this game pretty much focuses on that alone as far as the main story is concerned. The original style of combat is still there with two added bonuses, players can learn special moves and equipt for in battle as well as any special move attached to the weapon being used. players can also level up outside of battle and earn money to catch a few items they may have missed during a quest. In turn you don't always have to replay a level to get items you may have missed. Global dungeons are cool too. They add a little extra to the play with more enemies and loot. overall it's a solid game.			"

												Best game i've played in quite a while.Half minute hero 2 (Or the second coming) is like the first one, mixes silly humor, challenge, speed, RPG elements and OH GOD WHY ARE YOU MAKING ME CRY LIKE THIS?!.The storyline of this games follows several generations of protagonists, I would say this game gets better if you played the first one first, otherwise a lot of references and characters will go over your head.The game is long, took me 12 hours to beat doing some side-quest stuff, i'm 14h in and I still have modes to do, the game also includes a map creator.Combat works as follows: You and your party are on the left side of the screen, que enemies on the right... your character will keep running to the right until he hits an enemy, and you will both take damage, automated? Yes, kinda, but that also makes it so you have to think ahead, calculating the time that it will possibly take to finish the battle, and yes, you don't want to lose time, since the world will blow up, and that hurts a little.This game also includes the first one and the soundtrack, so go and grab it!

												Like the first game, 'Half Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy', you need to defeat the evil lords in 30 seconds. There's a Global map where you can run around and visit towns and find quests with no time limit. When you enter a quest, you have 30 seconds to finish it, which as far as I've seen involves defeating the quest boss, though everything between the quests start and the bosses defeat varies greatly, so there's no tedium there. Of course, realistically, you can't finish the quest in soley 30 seconds. You are 'aided' by the Goddess of Time, who will restore the time limit back to 30 seconds for a fee, a fee that increases each time you use it. So while it's not merely 30 seconds, ya need to get the lead out of yer♥♥♥♥♥ :D:Unlike the first game, you have a party, better equipment management, and instead of a caravan you see at the end of a quest/level, you have an overworld to explore.It's a great RPG, and if you liked the first game, you'll love the second(this one). Even better, if you don't have the first game, you get it for free when you buy this game			"

												Now One of my fav game after playing it and waiting 4 Years just to play it.-Anyway This Awsome game came out for the PSP IN JAPAN in 2010 And finally out in the US (But sadly not for PSP (nor PSvita)just PC) HMH2 Has A Better Story,Better Main Antagonist,And More Humor Than The First game. I will NOT spoil this game to anyone Who has not Played it Though I do want to talk about some things in the game and Story but I will say lots of things in the goddess room that you have to buy. As for the DLCs some content in it is not for childern. Sorry if it not much of a review but Being only on the PC help me find my lost account is one good thing that came out of it.9.1 Go ahead play it And by the way during the 4 year wait I had a japanese demo of this game I got from a website call PSP demo Center.com "

												A noticeable improvement over the first. I am baffled at how well done this game is, and here I was expecting some cheap iphone title. Surprise surprise, it's a well made, deep game. Has the charm of Earthbound to an extent (R.I.P Mr. Iwata) and is pretty long too for its price tag. If you haven't already experienced this little baby, then get on it.			"

												Awesome second installment, loved the humor and long story. I completed it in about 17 hours, and how is that not getting your monies worth? If you love a real RPG, this is what you are looking for, something different. I have to give it an 8.5, I had a lot of fun even when I completed the game.			"

												Pretty much like HMH1, but with serious story this time.Other gameplay variations (like princess 30 or evil lord 30) are gone in favor of massive improvements to the overworld.Overall a very enjoyable game for me!----------------------------------------::One thing worth noting::If you have played a Cave SHMUP game ""Deathsmiles"" before, you will immediately notice that one of the soundtracks in this game sounds a bit too familiar.For comparison, see ""Battle of the venus 7"" and ""burning halloween town"" "

												I thought I already did a review for this game.Having beaten the game, got all the items, unlocked all achievements, I must say this game really was the perfect fit for me. The action is fast paced just as the first game, but with some key elements that make the gameplay more enjoyable, a story simply awesome with lots of background.Pros:- Good story with many hours of gameplay, you will always take your time to do it right- A massive improvement in the mechanics compared to its predecessor- Many modes to have fun with- SPEED RUNS- A Workshop so you can share your own map, story, and adventure.- A ton of weapons and even styles, choose the one that fits the most to your character!- Lots of kinky jokes- Flat-chested girl- Three heroes- A MOVING LEGGED CASTLE- If you haven't played the first one, you get both by buying this. THE BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCKCons:- New mechanics certainly made the game more enjoyable, but also easier. On roaming, you can still level up but slower, these level up DO carry on into missions, so you are not gonna start from level one as always, but from level X (X, being your current roaming level). Also you can use late-game weapons so you can repeat missions completely broken on power- The level maker was a good startup, but an underdeveloped idea. They could have expanded further and make an aside client so you could make entire campaings out of it, custom sprites and that sort of stuff, but it has none of it, which is a little underwhelming.- No alternate endings like the first one, which were really fun			"

												Like with my previous review of Half minute hero 1, Dont let my playtime fool you, a friend of mine let me play this in his account in 2014 I played and completed it 100% with secret characters, the angel diaries, that global dungeon at the end of the game (Really long and frustrating) i plan to do it again now that i own the gameThis is what a sequel should be, I takes what worked in the first game and expands upon it.The gameplay style is similar to the hero30 style of the first game with a lot of changes-No more random encounters, all enemies can be seen -An actual overworld to explore. With dungeons-You can grind outside of battle to start the mission with an advantage and not start at a low level (its still possible since time attack requires it)-Weapon crafting and combining weapons-Skills and classes that affect how effective certain weapons are.-Party members that actually matter, and also combination attacks depending of the party member you have-Party positions that gives you and your party buffs.Since this game is more story centered i cant do it justice, play it by yourself, you wont regret it, it has a lot of charm, characters are likeable and some moments that actually made me cry			"

												Buy it! I do not care what people say, this is an absolutely amazing game with an amazing story and.... omg im a little speechless. Plus if you get this game you get the first game with it as well so you can see the whole story. For a 20$ value that is only worth 10$ it is a must buy for anyone who is a fan of this kind of genre.			"

												This game is amazing, and has become my all time favorite game of all time.It has frantic fun gameplay, rocking music, and a pretty good story to boot. (With quite a bit of hilarous narrative too!)I HIGHLY recommend you play it, and play the first one first, since it can give you a good idea of what it is.			"

												I will be honest and say that I didn't think this game would be as good as the first Half Minute Hero. To me it looked... less impressive. However I decided to buy the game and I was shocked at the result. I've had more fun with this game than the first. So if you are a fan of the first game and you don't think this will as good, put simply, this game adds so much more than the first game did.			"

												Second Coming takes the best parts of the previous Half Minute Hero and makes them even more fun, while bringing back more of the same humor and characters that made us fall in love the first time. It even remembers to add that dash of epicness that just makes the whole thing a masterpiece. Wonderful game.			"

												As far as quirky game goes this is by far my favorite. It has not only a deep difficulty curve but also a sense of panic as you are getting close to the wire. Only having 30 seconds to decide how to get from area to area. Which path is yours? Will you be able to kill enough? Will you have enough gold for the damnable greedy Time Godess? It all comes down to you in 30 seconds. Good luck. I very much recomened this game.			"

												Fun, fast-paced game with a story that makes fun of itself. The game can be flawed on it's repetitive nature, but the puns and the gameplay make it seem all but repetitive.The simple fact that the game acknowledges this fact by making fun of itself multiple times during 4th wall-breaking moments makes it enough to laugh at this fact.If you don't screw up too much, you should be able to finish the game just in under 30 Seconds.gettitActually it's something along the lines of 7-10 hours.The multiplayer aspect of the game however is completelly dead, as this game is getting old. RIP10/10			"

												Better than the first. Though, you probably want to get and beat the first one, 'cause this is a sequel AND you can unlock some bonus items if you have the first game. Also, if you want to go for 100%, you NEED to get the SEXY DLC package (as otherwise some items will never respawn in the vanilla game, meaning one-time items... ugh... good thing the DLC fixes that problem).
