												First i like to mention that Deus Ex is my favourite Game of all time, and Deus Ex:Human Revolution was my GOTY 2011, but Deus Ex: The Fall has very little in common to both of them. It is buggy, which i could get over because it can be patched, but let me explain one of the most amazing Bugs i found, once you get a certain Augmentation that allows you to walk faster, you get ingame Lag, yes, Lag, not FPS problems, but Lag, you walk 5 steps forward, 2 steps back, i have no idea how they managed to do that, but its certainly a first for me in a Singleplayer Game.The Game runs stable, i didnt experience any FPS drops, mostly between 90-100 FPS.The Voice acting is dreadful, imagine playing as an augmented version of Peter Stormare, who sounds like a Brit with autism.The Gameplay is a dumbed down version of Deus Ex:HR, you can access an  item shop at all times, where you can buy unlimited amounts of ammo/upgrades and items, the Game itself has no Inventory System, so for people who were excited for Inventory Tetris, im sorry, you can carry 20 times the Items you could in Deus Ex: HR at any time. You ran out of Stun-Gun Ammo but there are still Enemys left? No problem, ingame Store allows you to buy it for Ingame Credits at any time.I do not recommend it to people who enjoyed the Deus Ex and Deus Ex:HR, Eidos Montreal should have taken their time to create a worthy Sequel/Prequel instead of throwing out a Mobile Game that cant keep up with its predecessors.

												Deus Ex: The Fall is easily one of the worst games I've ever played, and it breaks my heart to write that.I'm a huge fan of the Deus Ex franchise, having ritually played the original at least once per year for the last decade. I eat up news and announcements about the games like a rabid fanboy, and I was onboard with Human Revolution as soon as they announced it.What a shame, then, that The Fall (a port of a mobile game) is so terrible in just about every conceivable way. Broken game mechanics, stiff AI and level interaction and an equally lethargic and boring storyline combine to make this one of the worst games released in 2014, system be damned.To talk about this game, we first need to discuss the expanded universe. When Human Revolution came out, there was a tie-in novel called Icarus Effect that was released too. That novel was a prequel/interquel that had the dual duty of setting up events from the original game and telling its own story within the framework of Human Revolution. A British SAS soldier-turned-mercenary named Ben Saxon allied with a Secret Service agent named Anna Kelso to attempt to stop the Tyrants (the antagonists of HR) and working to expose the Illuminati for their crimes.The Fall is a pseudo-sequel to that book, and either retcons or reframes certain events so that they fit in line with this game's storyline. It does such a poor job with it that I wondered why they even bothered. The rationale for why Jaron Namir (the leader of the Tyrants) brought Saxon onboard in the book - that he was largely doing it as a way to acknowledge the guilt for all the crimes he's committed over the years - is largely ignored here. Anna Kelso, a level-headed and strong character in the books, becomes a woman who practically stays in the fetal position throughout the whole game. The death of Saxon's friend in the book becomes a retcon where he miraculously survived and became a new member of the Tyrants. Memorable events (like Saxon leaping out of a cargo plane and using his Icarus Landing System to survive a fatal drop into the ocean) are so buggy and half-finished that they become laughably bad.Nearly every facet of the gameplay is counter to the franchise's design philosophy. Levels are disappointingly linear, with only the barest attention paid to the world-building and characterization that's so famous in other installments. Guns feel like pea-shooters, and the oft-mentioned zoom-in-while-aiming is incredibly frustrating. There's no sense of martialing the story with the gameplay - you can buy extra ammo and guns whenever you feel like it, trivializing the role inventory plays in these games.The worst part is that this game sets up a sequel hook that will probably never be addressed, concerning characters we have no reason to care or be interested about.I remember when this game was first announced, and the scorn it reaped on the internet. Incredibly, the final product was even worse than I thought. I still feel like I was ripped off, even after buying the game at 75% off.Don't waste your time with this. Go back to the original game or Human Revolution for a far better experience.			"

												Deus Ex: Dalek Simulator!Things I've encountered in the first hour of play: - A complete inability to climb short knee-height ledges.- Foes who can see me behind solid objects - ""I'VE GOT VISUAL!"", even though they clearly don't.- Riot cops who can magically detect my failed hack attempt, even though it gives no indication that an alarm has been raised.- The magical ability to purchase weapons out of thin air. It's a game feature, as demonstrated by it being in the tutorial. Doesn't cause it to make any more sense, though. :-/- Completely uninterested voice-acting. The lady who voices the tutorial instructions clearly wasn't paid enough for the job - she sounds like she'd rather be anywhere else but recording these lines. This, I have no fault with. That this audio made it into a game from a large franchise, made it past review, through playtesting, and out into the public market... it's amazing that nobody thought ""hey, maybe this dialogue should be *slightly* more engaging"".As for me, I'm going to leave this game open for a couple hours to get Steam Trading Cards, then promptly forget I ever acquired the thing.

												Bad mobile port. Controls are too horrid to keep on playing : Binding not changable, Mouse Sensitivity too low even at max, hacking UI broken, Inventory gone(or casualized for mobile-use), Not-so-reactive AIs and Bodies disappear in 5 seconds.For that price, you should instead go for Deus Ex HR Director's Cut.Important : This only offers FIRST CHAPTER. I DON'T KNOW IF LATER CHAPTERS ARE PRICED OR NOT. HOPE THEY DON'T. SERIOUSLY.モバイル版ベタ移植。操作設定が変更できないわ、マウス感度が低すぎるわ、ハッキングUIでスクロールできないわ、死体は５秒で消えてAIもすぐ忘れるわと言う酷さ。この値段なら本編ディレクターズカットを買ったほうがずっとマシ。重要：現状では第１章しかなく、「続く」でスタッフロール入りする。続きの章が無料で遊べるならいいんだが、これはひどすぎる。			"

												Very lousy port from the mobile version. DON'T BUY ITEdit: For the people who are interested what kind of bugs or silly ideas are in the game, here are a few examples:-You can not JUMP. Remember the original Deus Ex or Deus Ex: Human Revolution, which offered you a lot of pathways and a real open-world feeling? Well guess what, they decided to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and changed it to a silly ""Jump over object"" animation, and even that is limited to some objects.-You have access to a credit-shop at ANYTIME in the game, not matter what happens. Need some ammo? Sure, you can buy it straight away. Remember the times in Deus Ex when you needed to find medkits to heal your 25/250 HP Torso? Don't worry! Now you simply can buy ""Painkillers"" at anytime, which obviously makes the entire game way too easy.-AI in the game is incredibly inpredictable. Sometimes when you are 1 meter in front of their face they don't see you, yet when you're behind a solid object they manage to see you. And no, they don't have ""radars"".There are alot more of bugs or silly mistakes, but i'm too lazy to name them all.TL;DR: It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port-over from the original IOS version. Save your 10 euros/dollars and buy the original Deus Ex or Deus Ex: Human Revolution. If you own both games, buy Dishonored, which is basically Deus Ex, but with swords and magic.			"

												IF you LOVED Deus Ex: Human Revolution, you will be very offended by this prequel to it!!!... I found out after buying it that it was intended to play ON-THE-GO for your tablet, then they brought it over to PC to rip you off money and time.  Seriously, not worth your time, unless it's a clearance price of .99 cents... I do not recommend this game, although I did play it all the way through.  The game is just --- OKAY!  And misses all of the great flavor of the game prior (Deus Ex: HR).			"

												Deus Ex: The Fall; let me first point out that I went into The Fall expecting it to be the absolutely worst game I have played, this was due to the media completely disregarding it straight away. I also want to point out that this is the first Deus Ex game I have played. So lets get into it;The gameplay in The Fall is your pretty standard first person shooter/stealthy type game. Sadly though they are not done brilliantly. The gun play is bad to say the least, you can shoot a guy in the head at point blank range with a shot gun five or six times and he still won't die, you can also be crouching right in front of an enemy and he won't notice you, like literally, you can be under his nose and he won't bat an eye lid. The graphics are OK, that's all. It is in no way a pretty looking game, it looks as if it is straight off the PlayStation 1 (no disrespect to the games on that platform, it just looks very dated). It tries to make it self look better than it is by using plenty of lens flare though. The voice acting is really bad, the main character, Ben Saxton, is British, and boy do they put that point across, it is the most generic British accent you will ever hear and at points made me cringe; games that have been out for ten years or so have better voice acting in than The Fall...Level design is a very narrow sighted open world type setting, you can roam around the city, exploring, having meaningless conversations with civilians, and finding items. You will also run into a couple of side quests, five or six to be exact. Granted that's nothing really to brag about when you compare it to other games which have side quests, but this is certainly not a completely linear game and leaves room for the player to choose what to do and when. With the gameplay elements not being exactly up to scratch, this can fluctuate the difficulty levels at time. I didn't feel as if it was a good enough stealth system for me to use the stealth approach, so I just went with the all guns-blazing tactic. I hardly ran into any difficult parts throughout my play-through. The most difficult aspect I encountered was the hacking system on doors and computers. You can either find out the password/pass-code by exploring the world for clues, or hack the system. The hacking system at times was infuriating and I had to resort to looking up codes on the wiki, or looking up the location of the clue. I finished Deus Ex: The Fall in just about four and a half hours, this was including doing the majority of the side quests and doing a fair amount of exploring for extra items and codes. If you want a Pound (£) to hour ratio, it's not bad on that front, the game does end on a cliff-hanger and I would of liked to have seen just a little bit more of what happens, looking at the chronology of Dues Ex, this is one of the first games in the story, and Human Revolution will reveal all I suppose. There is a mire of technical issues with this game too; firstly the controls, you are not able to rebind any of the keys - this to me is an absolute must in ANY PC game. If I have a whole keyboard in front of me, let me use it damn it! Also, when navigating through the menus, your mouse clicks are sometimes not registered until you click four or five times, this made purchasing extra painkillers (the game's version of a health pack) and ammo become something of a chore. This problem also makes it into the actual game play too, as you can be standing behind an enemy, hit your stealthy take down key, but have to press it a number of times before the game recognizes it.  These little things made me annoyed, and they could of been fixed very easily if it was QA'ed properly. The final verdict, do I recommend Deus Ex: The Fall? This is when I wish Steam would have a ""maybe"" option available; because I had to admit, I did have some fun while playing, I finished the game after all so it wasn't so bad I couldn't bring my self from seeing the ending. But it is a bad game, it doesn't do much right, the poor voice acting, the buggy interface and broken game play elements would of grown tiresome if the game's length was any longer than it already is. So as I have to give a straight yes or no answer, I will sadly have to go with a ""Do Not Recommend"" for Dues Ex: The Fall. Fans of the Deus Ex series will probably want to play it purely for the lore and story aspect, but nothing more. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Alright, bear with me now, because I'm about to ♥♥♥♥ing recommend Deus Ex: The Fall. Buckle up.Now, first things first. This game is $9.99. Do not pay $9.99. If it's 75% or more off, I totally recommend purchasing, and I'm going to really struggle to articulate exactly how I feel about this game, but here we go.This is a port of a mobile game. It was not developed for PC in mind. That is a shame, and I really do wish they would've considered that route instead, but this is the route Eidos took, so we just have to keep that in mind. It's graphics are shoddy, physics are missing, models look bland, levels are downscaled, and certain gameplay mechanics are missing entirely. However... I had fun. I honestly did. The basic gameplay of stealthily manuevering throughout the shadows and picking off troops one by one is still there, and is still as fun as it was in Human Revolution. The level design is still well done, even if it is small, and features multiple paths to reach your objectives, just as Human Revolution did. The voice acting is very well done, with the exception of the tutorial lady, who should really be put on suicide watch. The story is incredibly well done, with the fantastic writing of Human Revolution manifesting itself in The Fall through dialogue, pocket secretaries, and emails. There are some sidequests that present some variety in options. There are interesting characters. Of course, things have also been simplified, and probably not to its advantage. Multiple saves don't exist, which wasn't really a problem for me, but I can see that unnerving certain people. The inventory system allows infinite of anything, and items are actually purchased through a tab rather than an individual. It's convenient, but rather odd and unusual.  So to conclude, yes, I do actually recommend Deus Ex: The Fall. There is love in this game that is evident, and I hate to see their effort wasted under a plethora of hatred and backlash. If you loved Deus Ex and Deius Ex: Human Revolution just as much as I did, you'll enjoy this adventure as well. Hell, I did everything you could possibly do in the game and managed to clock in at 8 hours, which isn't too shabby.			"

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Deus Ex: The Fall 

			Views: 1,018		

			Deus Ex: The Fall was originally an installment of the hit cyberpunk RPG for mobile devices that has been made available on Steam.		

Square Enix is the corporate equivalent of a person with a self mutilating disorder. No longer content to stand by and watch the Final Fantasy franchise drag it's crippled carcass to store shelves where it can be purchased by fans who are blind to how far downhill it has descended, Square Enix has set it's sights on humiliating the Deus Ex franchise. Taking it's subtitle quite literally, The Fall was originally brought to mobile devices where it was greeted with mixed reactions. Now, as if condemning the franchise to commit harikiri, the decision was made to release a quick and dirty port of The Fall on Steam, plunging a wakizashi deep into the semi-conductor filled belly of the franchise and slowly dragging the blade across it's abdomen without the dignity of providing a second.  Deus Ex is an unusually complex title to adapt to primitive phones and tablets without completely changing the gameplay, making it hard to fault Eidos Montreal and N-Fusion interactive for a lack of ambition. Dialogue trees, a wide array of augmentations, a large arsenal of weapons, branching paths and side quests are all present. The problem is that most of these have been compromised in some way and many would find these compromises forgivable on a mobile device but with the PC port of The Fall, the sliced corners are exacerbated. While Human Revolution offered a number of cleverly concealed paths to traverse it's often sizable levels, The Fall has to operate on a more modest scale and as a result level design is rather bland with the exception of a late game hotel mission that challenges players to make it to a penthouse suite. Many of the more covert paths lie almost in plain sight since the ability to jump has been removed. Often times, bypassing the entryway to the next area will give players a vent or tunnel to crawl through allowing them to breeze past enemies, not that  taking them on is overly difficult. While the future setting of Deus Ex portrays humans augmenting themselves with robotic attachments, like some sort of Kurzweilian wet dream, it seems that your adversaries couldn't be bothered to enhance their mental condition beyond mouth breather status. Giving your adversaries the slip is as easy as finding a crawlspace to sit in and upon returning to an area after things have settled, it isn't out of the ordinary to see your former pursuers walking into walls. If being stupid wasn't enough, your foes are also severely myopic meaning that using a take down on enemy while one of his allies faces the action from 30 feet away is not likely to raise an alarm.  Further crippling the experience, The Fall allows players to make purchases anywhere, anytime so in the middle of a mission it's easy to pause and purchase additional ammunition and health items. A large arsenal of weapons is also available for purchase consisting of crossbows, shotguns, pistols, assault rifles, plasma rifles, RPGs and grenades. Silencers, armor piercing rounds and other attachments can also be purchased as well as upgrades for damage and ammo capacity. Praxis points can also be purchased in order to upgrade your augmentations. The list of augs is equally impressive and most of the abilities from Human Revolution are present here. While this is all impressive, it's entirely unnecessary since the game never conjures a scenario that would require juggling such a vast arsenal.  The Fall's narrative benefits from Deus Ex's rich cyberpunk world as you take control of Ben Saxon, a former member of a black ops group known as The Tyrants who is taking refuge in a safe house in Costa Rica with Anna Kelso. Since both have augmentations, they require Neuropozyne, a drug design to combat their body's inclination to reject their artificial upgrades and it just so happens there is a shortage of the drug. Saxon's quest to find a supply of Neuropozyne, leads him to discover the existence of a competing drug and a malicious corporate conspiracy to quickly and cheaply test it. Just as the intrigue builds and it seems like the plot might redeem a few of the game's shortcomings, a “to be continued screen” materializes. The Fall was planned to release in episodes though Square Enix has failed to provide any information on a followup.  Embracing Human Revolution's golden glow and featuring the same visual motifs, The Fall looks like a proper Deus Ex game at a quick glance but this port has not received any upgrades from the cell phone version aside from anti aliasing and higher resolution textures. The end result is appalling. It would appears that the citizens of Panama have been exposed to Agent Orange since NPCs appear deformed as a result of an extremely low poly count and textures that consist of a simple diffuse map with very little if any detail. Oddly enough, Saxon's model looks passable with a higher poly count and more thoughtful texturing, it's just a shame that the game is played in first person so players will rarely see it. Environments themselves also suffer from objects with simple color diffuse maps and a tremendous amount of repetition. Much of this is to be expected given the game's mobile device origins but a small amount of work would have gone a long way toward making this port acceptable. In addition to the lazy visual upgrade, The Fall doesn't feature remappable keys, the mouse control feels slippery and imprecise and recoil when firing a weapon is represented by an absurd zooming effect. The Fall has quick buck written all over it. It's difficult to fathom why Square Enix though the complexities of Deus Ex would translate well to mobile devices and its even more baffling why they thought it would be a good idea to port a compromised product back over to the platform that made this franchise what it is in the first place. What is tolerable on a phone or tablet becomes unbearable and embarrassing on a PC, and by not making a few tweaks to the visuals and forgoing features like remappable keys,  Eidos Montreal and N-Fusion have earned the ire of fans. The Fall's few strong points are crushed a brutal counterpoints. It's impressive arsenal and upgrades are rendered useless by horrendous AI and it's intriguing narrative ends with a cliff hanger with no follow-up in sight.  These wounds are just too large for a few augments to mend.			"

												Note: I didn't review Deus Ex: Human Revolution & The Missing Link DLC due to having the original versions of the game instead of the Directors Cut edition, which contains both. But if you must, I rated Deus Ex: HR a 8.75/10 and Missing Link a 6/10.Deus Ex: The Fall is a prequel to Deus Ex: Human Revolution and it takes place in 2027 following Deus Ex: Icarus Effect's ending. The protagonist is Anna Kelso and Ben Saxon and the antagonist is Jaron Namir. Namir is the leader of the Tyrants while Saxon used to work for them, but was betrayed by them. This game is a iOS port. Due to this, critics have hammered the game with very negative reviews. Campaign: The campaign is solid. As normal with Deus Ex, this game's storyline was solid and fits into the world of Deus Ex. The story starts off bland at the beginning but becomes increasingly enjoyable as the game progresses, however the game is subject to an anti-climactic ending, ruining the atmosphere. There is a DLC tab in the game, so it seems as if there was meant to be more missions, but stopped after the poor reviews. Regarding Saxon, as the player, you can invest into him as the story progresses due to uncovering mysteries. In saying that, the story and investment of Saxon doesn't hit high gear, rather it progresses slowly passing average territory. The game is relatively short clocking in at 4.5 hours playtime. There was only three main missions in the game and five side quests, so wasn't in-depth by any means.Gameplay and Graphics: The technical aspect of this game was awful. I will state a few notable issues. The game looks zoomed in due to the port despite being 1920x1080 resolution. The graphics are pretty bad compared to Human Revolution, especially for a 2013 game. There are noticeable frequent FPS drops, but are relatively minor drops. Actions and movement tend to be delayed, for example, moving against the wall. The gameplay also feels limited with no sprint button, no jump button, and only one kill/knockout animation. There are speech issues with dialogue between characters. Basically, there are few good things about the gameplay and graphics, but are plagued by numerous issues, glitches, and bugs.Positives: Of course, the negatives outweigh the positives. However, the campaign and storyline was solid. I overly liked the revamped inventory system. Comparing to HR, now you can buy weapons, upgrade those weapons, buy grenades, etc. essentially you can use your credits more frequently. Despite liking it, buying weapons is unnecessary due to making the game easier. Another positive is the usefulness of hacking. In Human revolution, if you hacked a computer, there would be relevant information for the player that the game would not find useful. Whereas in The Fall, if you hacked a computer, it would contain very useful information to help in the game. Overall: The game had its moments in the campaign and through the few positives I just mentioned, but frankly, the game is a bad iOS port. I bought it for $2.49 on sale and I wouldn't recommend it, especially at full price. 3/10.----Thanks for reading my review!

												First off: Yes, it's a port of a mobile game. Ideally they'd have remade/reworked the entire game system to that of Human Revolution, but they didn't. That's reality, and to be fair they've marketed it as nothing less. So yes, most of the game systems are heavily simplified, and the interactive depth fails to touch Human Revolution. This is very much a port based on the idea that maybe you didn't play the original release for whatever reason (disliking iOS controls, not owning a decent mobile, etc), and so here's your chance. ""Did you play The Fall? No? Well, here's a PC verison"". Nothing more, nothing less.While actual design quality and expectation is subjective, what IS inexcusable is technical issues that are fundamentally game breaker. At time of writing, The Fall has issues where sound (music) overrides all other audio effects. This includes footsteps, dialogue, gunshots, and so on. When this issue occurs dialogue will bug out, conversations missing audio and ending in half a second, leading to lost chunks of story and inability to hear your surroundings (NPC chatter, enemy footsteps). Reducing music volume to zero is not a solution, you pretty much have to luck it out. Additionally, the game has weird lag-like stutter on aiming and movement with certain augs. It's seriously like playing a multiplayer game with high ping: jerky movement.And so, as it stands, Deus Ex: The Fall is a broken port. Maybe it's a game you want to play even though it's a mobile port. Maybe you expected a total revision and won't touch it because it's not. But end of the day, if the game does not work, if it's fundamentally broken, that is the biggest problem. And so The Fall is not worth a cent from anybody regardless of standing until these issues are fixed.			"

A P.O.S. embarrassment to an otherwise fantastic seriesBoy oh boy, am I glad that Steam allows players to ""not recommend"" games, because this atrocity does not deserve the Deus Ex moniker. It doesn't even deserve to be a PC or home-console game. To quote Adam Jensen, ""I never asked for this"".On the surface, the game looks promising. You play as Ben Saxon, a mercenary once affiliated with the Tyrants (the guys who attack Sarif Industries in Human Revolution), who defected from the Tyrants and is now pursuing his own investigation into the global conspiracy. Ben Saxon is basically a reskinned Adam Jensen - the HUD and augmentations from Human Revolution are all intact.Sounds like it could be fun, right? Well, maybe, if the game were developed as proper Human Revolution DLC using that game's engine. Except it's not. It's a port of a mobile game. You think console ports are bad? I'd take a console port over a mobile port any day of the week. The technical flaws due to ""mobile-itis"" are apparent from the very beginning. The controls are god awful, and at the time of release, could not be remapped. Movement feels stiff and it's easy to tell that the mouse is just simulating a finger drawing across a touch screen. Worse still, some compromises that were made for touch screens also crept into the PC port. For example, on the mobile version, to fire your weapon you need to hold down a button, which brings up the weapon sight. You aim the weapon and release the button to fire. On the PC, you hold down the left mouse, aim, and release the left mouse to fire. Yeah, what the F-word?! I don't know if this was patched as of 2015, but it sure wasn't working too well last year when I played this game.The graphics may have won praise when viewed on a small phone or tablet screen. On a PC monitor, they're inexcusably bad. The models are low res, animations are choppy, and corpses just disappear into thin air due to game engine constraints. Even the Xbox 360 can do better than this, and that's a 10 year old console. Now all this could be forgiven if the gameplay were even half as amazing as Deus EX HR or the Missing Link DLC. Well, obviously it's not! Enemy AI is beyond ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Human Revolution's AI was often the butt of jokes, but those guys are Einsteins compared to the stooges you face in The Fall. I couldn't believe it when I was able to walk up to enemies HEAD ON and do stealth takedowns without raising alarms. They must be blind, deaf, and dead. It's almost like the devs turned on cheat codes for everyone.Part of the fun of Human Revolution was carefully rationing resources when upgrading augmentations and weapons. It was also necessary to visit specific locations to get upgrades, and this encouraged exploration (which opened side quests). In The Fall, you can simply buy augs and weapon upgrades and even ammo on-the-fly, and somehow it magically appears in your inventory. Finding money is also stupidly easy. That kills incentive for exploration, and it's far too easy to become The Terminator in a short time, which removes any challenge in the game (not helped by the dumb-as-dirt AI). To add insult to injury, the game's SHORT. I finished it in five hours. It ends with a message telling me to wait for the next episode, just like a typical mobile game. So far, there has been no mention of that second episode.This game should be ignored by everyone. Don't even pirate it. Send a message to Square Enix that we will not tolerate this sort of blasphemy. At least Mankind Divided looks like it'll be a proper game...			"

												This game is solid proof that mobile platforms are time machines. This game's quality is at least from 10 years before its release.  It's just not up to snuff compared to what I'd expect from Square Enix and its subsidiaries, especially after playing Deus Ex: Human Revolution.I hesistate to say this because I'll have to accept its existence, but I'm pretty sure Invisible War's character models look better at times than those in this game released for PC in 2014!  The best examples are the NPCs that pepper Panama. They have a polycount for a PSX game.As for the gameplay, it is a toned-down version of that in Human Revolution.  For example of how the gameplay has been reduced, there is no jumping. You can fall off of things, climb latters, and vault over those designated as acceptable, but no free jumping.  The player also cannot pick up and move items, like boxes. That's not entirely true. There is an aug to move heavy objects, but it has been reduced to shoving scripted XNG crates from preset position A to preset position B. Aside from those examples, it's pretty much HR. One more thing and spoiler warning! There are no boss fights in this game. The closest thing you get is a single box guard and it's only a fight it if you are a terrible at stealth.The level design is still complex at the very least. Lots of possibilities for the player to explore, mostly through man-sized vents. The designers did make more breakable walls, which I appreciate as well.The voice acting is probably the most impressive feature of this game.  I really hope that the assets are reused because they are a waste on this game in its current form.The writing is a mixed bag. I find the method Namir was planning to employ Ben Saxon to be ludicrious and the twist to be pants-on-head. Doesn't make a lick of sense. That said, I think Ben Saxon and Anna Kelso to have potential as good characters with some depth.It should be apparent that I cannot recommend this game. It is not good enough for the consumer and not good enough for the franchise. The best thing the developer and publisher could do is drop this whole idea of putting this kind of game on a phone or tablet. Since The Fall is part of an episodic series, they would be wise to remake this installment with the existing Human Revolution tools and assets as well as the next installment. Then, stitch them together like DX: HR Director's Cut. As a consumer, I would advise you to wait for that to happen or, if you cannot hold back your curiosity, wait until this version of the game is very cheap. I bought it for 2USD and I did get my money's worth.			"

												It is quite clear that this game is simply a port from the mobile Android/iOS versions. Does not match up to Human Revolution by any standards, and it's also quite clear this was never really meant for PC play. Do not buy this if you have played the story before, and do seriously consider getting it on your Android/iOS device since it is definitely more optimized for mobile play if you've never played the story before (or, you could, you know watch YouTube playthroughs or something).Though, of course, if you have cash to burn...

												I've tried and tried to give this game a chance. It has graphics similar to Deus Ex: Human Revolution, but it doesn't feel like a fully fledged game. It comes off as one of those partially done, episodic games where they leave it open, but nothing ever comes of it. If you love the Deus Ex series and expect it to be similar to Human Revolution, you are going to be disappointed. It has alot of the same features, but doesn't really feel the same. My advice friends, save the couple of dollars, and put it toward Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. From what I've read, that game sounds amazing. Thumbs down, sorry.			"

												Way too short for what I've come to expect after Deus Ex and Deus Ex:Invisible War. You know why I've only played 4 hours? because thats how long it takes to beat the game in stealth mode on your first try. I'm sure you could run through it guns blazing in an hour or less. Thats not even the worst part, the game doesn't even come to a conclusion. Compared to the first two, this game is just a starting mission where you secure yourself some international transportation - you don't find out who is pulling the strings or even what they are up to, you don't have any boss fights, you don't get revenge on the people hunting you, you don't make the world a better place. You just get a helicopter.I wouldn't buy this game on anything less than 90% off individually. But If this is the route the Deus Ex series is taking, then I'd wait for an anthology pack thats 75% off. "

												I absolutely love the Deus Ex franchise, and was excited to hear the mobile game was coming to pc.  However, once the game was officially released, I realize that this game probably should have stayed on the mobile platform.  So far, I've only played through the tutorial part of the story, and it is absolutely riddled with bugs.-Spoken dialog being skipped altogether-Spoken dialog being silent-Constant bugged sounds (no gunshot sound, no walking sound, no explosion, no takedown noises, etc)-Laggy video screen (my character kept jumping all around)-The tutorial popups, although I'm sure is easy to turn off, were extremely annoying and prohibitive during the tutorial-Outdated graphics for the time-Awful animations-Uneditable ControlsThis game has the potential to be a decent game on the pc, they just reaaallllly need to work on all the bugs that are prevalent.However, my least favorite thing about this game is the item system. Unlike the item system in HR, one can purchase any weapon/ammo/grenade at any time.  There is also (seemingly) no limit on how many items that one can pick up.  It really dumbs down the experience.

												I have never written a review before as I've never felt the need.  Now I just really wish I'd read one or two before this lacklustre and seriously flawed game.  The producers should be ashamed.  I imagine that the developers who ported it to the PC must spend a lot of time pretending they had nothing to do with it.  I doubt they could bear the embarrassment - better and more honest to admit to poor personal hygiene I would imagine.As a seasoned gamer since 1981 and having recently finished the latest instalments of Bioshock, Thief, Tomb Raider, Dishonoured, Metro Redux (2033 and Last Light - both excellent games) and Deus Ex: Human Revolution (The Director's Cut), unwittingly I fell into the trap of thinking that this recently released game would bear some of the hallmarks of the above titles.  Unfortunately I couldn't have been more wrong - a view borne out by reading user reviews (sadly after buying the game) - all of which seemed to emphasise that a port from a  tablet or phone hasn't really worked in this case.  The keys can now be customised to (say) make ""SPACE"" = USE ITEM.  All fine except on-screen in the game, it says something like ""Press 'F' to USE ITEM"" - i.e. the customisations don't carry through into the on-screen dialogue or tutorial which does make it a bit confusing and liable to get you killed or stuck in one place as you frantically search your keyboard for the move forward command.  Graphically it's okay but reminiscent of a game 10+ years ago.  Most of the time, the movement is clunky and the keys fail to respond.  Even on the first level, the number of bugs was enough to make me just delete the game.  I'd delete it at four times the price; it's that bad.  Imagine opening a door in the game, the door opens, you turn around to go back and it asks you to open the visibly open door - and won't let you go through until you go through the pretence of ""opening"" the door.  The range of keys that can be used is ridiculous - at one point I was thinking of bringing my nose into play to perform the complicated manoeuvre of jumping over a low box.  First I had to ""break cover"" - very hard to do when you've got to press two keys and they're not the ones being stated on the screen that you must press.  The you have to press up to the low box and then finally press ""Use"" (or it may have been Inventory"" or ""Map"" - no idea in the end.  There is no ""JUMP"" button unlike in Human Revolution which manages to get along with considerably less keys to press and confuse.  As for using my nose as an extra digit,  I have a cold and couldn't face the mess.I'd say that words fail me but actually they don't.  It's polite words that I'm having a degree of difficulty with.  Of all the games in all the bars, this one sucks the most.  From this ""Does it have the X-factor"" judge, it's a big no.  This game has ""FALL""en at the first hurdle (see what I did there?), leaving human kind to fend for itself - and it'll be glad it did!			"

												BEFORE YOU BUY THIS GAME please not that it was originally a game for mobile devices and this is just a PC port of that game. As such, it doesn't really hold its own as a PC game. Usually in these kind of reviews, people will mention how they have ""over 100 hours"" in the game to lend to their credibility. I've put a whopping 7 hours into this game, and I didn't even rush the main questline. I did every sidequest (as far as I'm aware), picked up every item (as far as I'm aware), ...you get the idea. Now, granted, I didn't do the ""new game +"", but all that does is increase the difficulty. On top of that, combat and conrols are clunky, and the game is glitchy as heck (especially when doing takedown moves). The story is somewhat interesting, but is of course ridiculously short and ends with a very disappointing ""to be continued"".Now, all that being said, let me reiterate that this is just a port of a mobile game. Had I played it on a mobile device, I probably wouldn't have had all of these complaints. And to be fair, I've had a hard time getting the other games to run right on my computer, and I just went ahead and played this one, so maybe the ""to be continued"" isn't as disappointing as I think it is. Plus, I didn't even know until 5 minutes ago that there was a novel.  :-/So yeah, long story short, just keep in mind that this is actually a mobile game, and take this review with a grain of salt.

												I have to clean up this review. The review before was a list of pros and cons, and since is this is my most popular review, I will fix it just before Mankind Divided's launch.Before the review starts, I need to mention this is an iOS port.When many people think Deus Ex, they think of either the original or Human Revolution. The original is considered one of the best videogames of all-time and was ambitious for the time. Human Revolution took the license back after 7 years of hibernation to revive it and did a great job. Now, this intermission between Human Revolution and Mankind Divided steps in, is it good?It's mediocre. The maps, controls, and microtansactions (still left in the port, even though you can't buy anything with real money besides the base game) feel like an iOS game. The maps were shrunken down so that mobile phones could play the game. The controls also aren't the best and can feel awkward. The augments and mechanics are similar to Human Revolution's, so if you liked those, then you'll feel at home (with the exception of the controls). It will take about 2-4 hours to finish the game (4 if you are like me and do side missions etc). Also, expect an occasional bug, but nothing gamebreaking.Deus Ex games are known for their story, so does this game have a good story?Not really. It is very forgetable and writing this over a year after playing it, the only thing I really remember about the story is the cliffhanger ending, like the developers were planning future DLC but then decided to call it quits after the average reviews came out.Rating:4.10-MediocreRating for Deus Ex Fans:5/10-Average			"

												This game adds nothing of worth to the Deus Ex story. While it might work well on a tablet, on PC this game is a letdown. Terrible voice acting, wireframe script and plywood plot aside, the gameplay is just clunky and limiting. It is true there are multiple paths (in some places) but they're too obvious, the AI is too dumb and the shooting mechanics are frustratingly wonky at times. My primary complaint: too easy. I found myself waltzing invisibly past practically blind enemies right off the bat. The in-game buy system is overpowered, as you can at any time access 'the black market' to purchase whatever you may need, from praxis kits to grenades to protien bars. The dialogue options are horribly limited and yawn-worthy. Really the only challenge for me was to stay awake. The game lasts six hours, though the vast majority of it was spent jogging from one side of a map to another with little worthwile opposition. It was kinda neat to be able to visit venues I wasn't yet required to clear out and preemptively kill all the things inside so that it was a breeze when the storyline called. This led to silly amounts of experience for stealth when in reality I had gone rambo before I was supposed to. There is a lot of 'content', you could argue. after my first playthrough I only found about half the 'collectible' turntable figures. But really, that's just a gimick. This game is a gimick. While sparse fun can be dredged up occasionally, ultimately this game is not worth your time.			"

												This review is based on a stealth/no kills only run of Deus Ex: The Fall. I like Deus Ex: The Fall but there is also a lot of things it does wrong. The game isn't much of a graphics powerhouse and is based on an iOS/Android version of the game, it is plagued with low resolution textures, bad object geometry and terrible character models. The options are fairly limited and you only have the ability to change resolution and anti-aliasing and none of the various options you would expect to find in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. You only have 1 save slot and if you have auto saving on it is possible to ruin your game if you run into the many glitches this game has. One such example was I missed out on a side quest but was unable to load to an earlier state.Being based on a mobile port leads to other issues in which I will go on with. The game has a store menu which has being lifted from mobile version without the real money transactions where you can buy Praxis kits, weapons, ammo and health any time you want as long has you have the credits. I don't like this system as I feel it's lazy and all this should of being available from NPC vendors within the game or found via the world of Deus Ex: The Fall. There is no jump button in this game which creates frustration at times when wanting to go over simple obstacles. Another legacy of The Fall's humble mobile origins is disappearing bodies are in the PC version, whether you knock out or kill an enemy their body just disappears a few seconds later right before your eyes. Ignoring everything else negative I have mentioned about this game so far my biggest pet peeve is the terrible A.I. You can literally perform take downs on enemies from 100° angles and they easily give up on you after getting bored hunting you down and go back to their regular patrol routes as if nothing happened. What weapons I did use in the game had barely any recoil, bad animations and explosions from grenades and mines where terrible.After getting all the negatives out of the way Deus Ex: The Fall does have redeeming qualities as hard as it is to believe. It plays similar to Deus Ex: Human Revolution with hidden areas, hacking, the ability to take stealth or guns blazing approach to situations, the ability to upgrade your augmentations/weapons, it has a HUB area and even some side quests with a multi branching dialogue system. The story is actually interesting, Ben Saxon was a better protagonist than I was expecting, the level design is ok and the voice acting outside Anna was pretty decent. The game ends of a cliff-hanger so it’s unclear if we will ever actually get a conclusion to this story via an Episode 2. To 100% the game it will take players around 6 hours.If you are thirsty for more Deus Ex go ahead and play it. As a mobile game it might be the best on the platform but as a PC title, it is hard to indorse.2.9 out of 5.			"

												Getting into DE:TF is a real chore. This game is a poor iOS port that is littered with bugs, so be warned before you go out and buy it!DE:TF is a prequel to Human Revolution and follows the augmented soldier Ben Saxon who is on the run from the Tyrants (the very same ops unit that Adam Jensen faces throughout Human Revolution). The game has a suitable plot for its length, but the game is heavily padded by 5 side-missions which actually make up the bulk of content in DE:TF. Almost the entire game takes place in Panama city and the surrounding buildings, and will have you backtrack across previously cleared areas a few times when doing missions. The game also has a ""New-Game Plus"" feature (NG+) where you start the story again with all your previous augmentations & weapons. This sounds like a good idea, but honestly NG+ is far far far too easy and you can breeze through the second playthrough in just over an hour (I would know, I did it).The game itself plays fairly similarly to Human Revolution, except that everything is more sluggish and awkward. As of the time of writing. the keys cannot be rebound which made gameplay irritating in places. I personally really dislike C to toggle crouch instead of L-Ctrl and rebind this in every game I play. The cover system can also be a glitchy (I fell through the map to my doom twice while trying to get into cover), but for the most part it is at least functional. While the gunplay is downright awful, playing the game as a non-lethal melee character is surprisingly rewarding and quite loyal to the same playstyle in Human Revolution. There are a few hidden paths scattered around that allow you to approach (or avoid) your enemies from various angles.The graphics & audio of DE:TF are almost criminally bad. Even while staying loyal to the overall aesthetic of Human Revolution with the art-style, this game still manages to look terrible. There has not really been much of an attempt to make them suitable for a PC release, with the textures and character models in particular looking incredibly bland.The audio is the real crime though. The sound effects and OST ripped straight from Human Revolution are decent enough, but the sound frequently cuts out. It makes following the narrative very difficult as the voice-overs are skipped. What makes this even worse is that when the audio skips, the subtitles do too, which is absolutely INFURIATING as it prevents you from at least reading the audio you are missing. As well as ruining the story, the absent audio also destroys the atmosphere of the game and often leaves you running about in total silence.I cannot recommend this until the audio is fixed. Until then, avoid DE:TF unless you are a die-hard fan of the franchise and really want to know a little back story behind Human Revolution			"

												Deus Ex: The Fall should be taken for what it is. A mobile entry into the Deus Ex Universe. Admittedly, I'm a fan of the universe and getting another chance to play in this world, is something I am always looking forward to. So there may be some bias. One thing that must first be noted, is that this game is a direct port from Mobile. If you look at what the game offers from a mobile perspective, it's pretty amazing. I wouldn't actually want to play it on mobile, as I can't imagine pulling off some of the stuff I do with just gestures, but hey, more power to those who want to. As a direct port, this game did not have graphical update, the controls can be unresponsive, and the options are limited. Graphics: for a mobile game this is excellent. As a PC port though, the graphics are okay. They aren't amazing, but they aren't completely terrible. I tried to remember where it was coming from. There are some glitches from time to time when you're climbing ladders, or performing takedowns where you will see through the scenery, which can be a little confusing the first time it happens. Yes, it will likely happen.... and more than once. Sound: For a game that comes from mobile, the Sounds aren't bad at all. In fact, I was typically content with the music and the voice acting. It wasn't horrible, though one of the characters is a little over the top, but aren't villains always portrayed that way?Story:  The story is rather interesting, to me at least. I liked the characters, although some of the missions seem rather structured for a Deus Ex game. Unforutnately, as the story is short, the characters don't really get all the attention they deserve. If the game had more support, we likely would have seen more with further chapters and installments in the series. Unfortunately, it's unlikely this will occur, so you get what you get and until it's decided what to do with this particular piece of IP, we likely won't see anything more for awhile. Controls: This is where the game really shows it's mobile origins. The developers could have spent a little time smoothing out the controls for PC but unfortunately this didn't occur. Sometimes when trying to accomplish certain tasks the game will get confused as to what you're trying to do and won't allow it. I.e. if you're taking cover and you press in a direction at a corner, the game won't allow you to move out of cover, because it will only accept you taking cover again. Another major issue is when you are trying to vault over small obstacles, sometimes you will be able to walk over to them and do this instantly, and others the game will not allow it unless you are taking cover and then you can repeatedly hit spacebar to vault over the object. It can be very frustrating. Another major issue is when you are trying to interact with certain objects you cannot because the hitbox for lack of a better term of other NPCs are in the way. You can clearly see the object, you are clearly pointing at it, but the game has decided that the object next to it takes priority even though that is not the option available when you press the E button to interact. This can be highly frustrating from time to time, but fortuntely doesn't occur as often as it could. There is still one computer I couldn't hack, because the receptionist was in the way, and when I decided I was angry and shot her in the head, I discovered she had invisible bio-organic titanium shielding protecting her that seemed to have infinite regenerative properties and no matter how much I made it bleed, it wouldn't allow me to destroy it and then kill her :POverall: 5/10 - If you're a Deus Ex fan, go in with low expectations and you can still enjoy it. However, if you expect excellence, you will be disappointed. Take the game for what it is worth but NEVER buy it at full price. It's not polished enough for that, and it was much cheaper originally even on Android and Apple stores. I would recommend getting it for maybe $2 if you can and then in my opinion it's worth it. Base pricing of $10 is ridiculous and should never be considered.Honestly this is one of the few games where I wish I could choose a Neutral instead of Yes or No. But because I enjoy the universe and with the above caveats, I will still give it a thumbs up... so long as you remember, it's not gonna be great, and you don't spend much on it.

												Not as bad as people say. Not worth its money, on the other hand.The Fall is the simplified byproduct piece of Deus Ex Human Revolution - not complex, not clever, not accurate with details. And not so required to see as a part of full picture, even if you're a big fan of reincarnated franchise.The game is using mostly the same mechanic as the big one - only dumbed down, without ability to jump, with crude controls and levels designed for mobile platform - which is, obviously, means smaller size and far-from-the-edge graphics. Some are comparing it with N64, but that is an exaggeration. Still, nothing too fancy.The narrative, which I liked for some point, felt more pure cyberpunk, than in Human Revolution case. Sadly, that feeling was not lasted for long, as the ""professional"" merc Ben Saxon started to act even more unnatural than Adam Jensen in his quest, with all those morality checks and sudden bursts of unpredicted generosity, which is so inproper in the merc's praxis...Why thumbs up, then? As of little product, which is now sells in bundle either with Deus Ex titles, or with all Eidos anthology - even with all simplicity and the feeling of unfinished product the Fall is providing - still the gameplay is not completely broken. It feels like separate level of Deus Ex HR, which was cutted off as improper, and then sold as separate game - yes, that's true. But, it is still a piece of the great game. Just one of the worst pieces.My mark is 5.8/10. I recommend to start it only for achievement hunters - as this one is so simple for full complete - or for people who played in Human Revolution for too long, but still not enough for satisfaction. Maybe ""The Fall"" will work as a sobering pill - if Mankind Divided was not chilled you out yet.			"

												Deus Ex: The Fall is a PC port of the iOS mobile title and serves as a prequel to Deux Ex: Human Revolution. The game is itself a sequel to the Deux Ex: Icarus Effect prequel novel. This severely limits its chances to do its own thing, even if it does an admirable job at the dystopian cyberpunk the series is known for.You play as Ben Saxon, a member of the Tyrants gone rogue, who is trying to unravel a conspiracy while keeping himself and former Secret Service agent Anna Kelso out of his erstwhile team's hands. Their backgrounds are briefly adressed in the game, but if you want the full story, read the book. This is not required to understand the game's narrative, largely because you'll care very little about the uninteresting Saxon and his quest. The story is hurt further by the unsatisfying 'to be continued' screen at the end, with no word on whether it actually will. You do get to interact a bit with the boss characters from DX:HR. This fleshes them out a bit and is one of the game's few saving graces.Ok, so storywise, the game is nothing much. What about gameplay? Well, Ben Saxon is an expy of Adam Jensen, right down to the futuristic sunglasses. He has almost all the same abilities and augs. You can do takedowns, hack computers and keypads, crawl through vents, shoot from cover, .... Pretty much everything big bro Adam Jensen can, except jump. You'll use these skills to explore an urban hub, Panama City. You'll talk to npcs, some sidequests and work your way through enemy hideouts and complexes with combat and stealth, while upgrading your weapons and augs.The extent to which developer nFusion translated DX:HRs gameplay to a tablet is pretty impressive. Unfortunately, this is also the game's downfall. The limitations of tablets really hurt the game's scope, with frequent loading times and a cramped design. Nowhere is this better exemplified than in the tutorial mission. You're faced with a locked door. You can hack the keypad or use a vent next to the door that deposits you right behind it. I'm not saying all Deux Ex entries are perfect, but when they gave you multiple solutions, you were at least got more progress than literally one meter.Bodies dissolve after a few seconds, dead or alive. So why bother with slower pacifist stealthy when when a quick headsot is much faster. It makes little difference. No, not to conserve ammo. You can simply buy it from the ingame shop. This store is not an npc vendor, but a menu you can call up any time, including mid-combat. Need an EMP grenade? Buy one. Plenty of money lying around. Problem solved. It's an optional holdover from the microtransations of the tablet version, but it sucks out the challenge, planning and resource management.The controls also suffer from the tablet origins. They're clunky and unresponsive. Combat from cover is a chore and often ineffective, as enemy bullets like curving around cover. Oh, and sometimes you'll clip through the world and die. Same for the UI, which has been barely converted from tablet-friendly to something suitable for PC.OK, the story is a wash and the gameplay a mere shadow of its bigger brothers. Maybe the production values can salvage it? Don't count on the graphics. They would look great on a tablet, helped by same aesthetics featured inDX:HR. Upon closer inspection though, the ingame models and textures wouldn't look out of place on a Playstation 2, except with some glossy visual effects. The game does better in the sound department, but not because of voice acting or sound fx. Michael McCann, the guy behind the exceptional soundtrack of DX:HR, returns for The Fall and delivers music that is the best part of the game. Oh, and Saxon kind of looks like Jean Reno. I like Jean Reno.Deux Ex: The Fall is a deeply flawed game, hampered heavily by its tablet origins. I can't recommend it to anyone except the most diehard fans starved for more Deux Ex. With a playtime of 4-6 hours, they'll a modestly sized, but unsatisfying serving. Everyone else: maybe, MAYBE, pick it up for a buck in a sale. Otherwise, skip it, buy any of the other games or wait for Mankind Divided.I rate Deus Ex: The Fall 1 banana out of 5.			"

												I had read a bunch of god-awful reviews about this game before finally finding the courage to dish a few Euros out for it. Perhaps the fact that I was expecting an unplayable mess let me enjoy it more than I should have. Or maybe my tolerance for crap has increased manifold since I last had it checked. Either way, The Fall felt like a stripped down, flatter version of Human Revolution - and having said that, it didn't feel unplayable at all.What the rest of the review talks about:+ visually faithful to the previous games+ good potential for exploration+ a short story in the Deus Ex universe+/- easier and (more) relaxing to play as sleuth+/- few familiar characters- poor UI adaptation and game mechanics- some obvious glitches- no real boss fightsAdmitting that I am a huge fan of Deus Ex, I enjoyed doing all the stuff I did in the main game: hacking, sleuthing, taking down anything that moves on the map in the most Ghandi-esque manner possible. The main quest is supported by five side-quests, the map is structured in three large areas with several buildings accessible in each and the environments are all very familiar if you've played Human Revolution. It is absolutely a retread of the original and took me about six hours to complete, while eliminating all AI enemies. So I can understand why someone who doesn't have the patience to go through this level of time-wrapping and wishes for something new and original in the Deus Ex universe will be disappointed. Although conceived like the Missing Link, this port is inferior in its execution and obvious bugs arise that smack of superficiality from the developers. Most if not all the ones I encountered were just glitches though and did not pose any software farts. Storywise, only a few familiar characters appear with minimal roles and there are no real boss fights to talk about. What compounds the bad word of mouth for any new player will be the irritating tutorial which introduces you to the world and the slightly altered game mechanics and controls, which are simplified compared to the original. Oh, and the messy interface too. But these seemed mostly trivial obstacles to me, none of which were deal-breakers. The game, while quick and dirty in a sense, allowed me to roam across the map and do things at my own pace, with few restrictions controlling story elements. I feel I paid a fair (discounted) price for a minor entry in the Deus Ex universe and was able to enjoy the hours spent playing it. So I would go out on a limb and recommend it to fans of the series who have a sense of lenience and patience about themselves.			"

												Steam reviews really need a neutral recommend option, but I'll make do with what I have. So let me clarify, I would only recommend this game to people who have finished Deus Ex: Human Revolution and The Missing Link DLC (or DE:HR - The Director's Cut), and really want more. Having played through DE:HR multiple times a year or so ago, it was enjoyable to get more content in that world. Granted, it's extremely neutered and simplified content, but it scratched the itch I had to go back to DE:HR.The other reviews seem almost unanimously negative and I really don't think Deus Ex: The Fall warrants that harsh of criticism. You definitely need to know and expect that you are playing a port of a mobile game, and it's not going to live up to complexity or visual fidelity of a full PC title. But that being said, I was really surprised that this was a mobile game first and I think I would have been pretty impressed if I saw it running on a tablet. It's certainly an extremely simplified version of DE:HR, but that doesn't mean there isn't anything to enjoy.Things it does well:-Borrows enough assets (visual and audio) that it's immediately recognizable as the world of DE:HR.-Has mandatory Deus Ex freedom of approach. You can burst through the front door on a murderous rampage or sneak through side tunnels reaching your objective with only the occasional thug knocked unconscious.-Very stable from my experience. I expected a mobile port to be much more buggy.-It's a good length and the pacing is decent. At 5-7 hours to complete it doesn't overstay it's welcome and I never felt like there was filler content for the sake of stretching out the game.Things it does poorly:-Graphic fidelity is low, both in 3D models and animations. But hey, it was a mobile game, so you shouldn't be expecting the Crysis engine.-It's easy. My playthrough was based on stealth and no-kills, and was completed without much difficulty.-All of the systems from DE:HR are VERY simplified. Some to the point of making them less interesting (ie: being able to buy any item from the inventory menu instead of having to find an arms dealer in game).-The voice acting is pretty sub-par. It's fully voiced, which is nice, but the acting is all pretty bland and npc voices seem disconnected.-The controls can be wonky in some situations. I can't imagine playing this on a touch screen as there are some problematic controls even with a k/m.-The interface buttons are really unresponsive. This is actually the thing that probably bothers me the most. Clicking a large button that your cursor easily fits inside almost always takes at least 2 clicks to get it to work.As I said earlier, I'm recommending this ONLY for people who have played all of the other Deus Ex: Human Revolution content and want more. It is absolutely skippable if you don't feel the need for another story in the same world and should definitely be avoided if you haven't played DE:HR. It certainly pales in comparison to the game it's based on, but with a cheap price, I personally enjoyed jumping back into that world for a few hours (although I'd wait for a sale if you haven't bought it yet, there's seriously no rush).

												Never asked for this.Started playing and thought ""weird, everything seems like a cheap ripoff of the actual Deus Ex"". The UI, the graphics, the combat, the hacking, even moving around feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cheap version of Deus Ex. I thought for a minute that I had accidentally bought a third party product from some scammer who used the Deus Ex name. When I found out this was a port from mobile I felt ripped off, unfortunately I can't return it as I got the bundle of all DX games (and I already owned the old games so Fall was the only benefit). I mean on an actual mobile device this would be quite impressive, but I paid for this on a PC!			"

												I can see why this slipped under my radar, and I'm a huge fan of the series. Clunky, ugly port using an buggy engine that has a tendency to change the direction you're looking randomly. This honestly feels like an fan recreation of DXHR's aesthetics and features but is in dire need of polishing; if you're coming from PC DXHR and expecting things like cover, AI, and weapon shooting to feel similar then you'll be very surprised.At time of writing this should be returned to beta status for the developers to fix technical issues, the graphics people to repurpose the PC models and textures they already have access to, and the sound people to re-record the female lead's leaden reading. I wouldn't have minded paying more for this if it was better.			"

												Don't waste your time here. If you're itching for more Deus Ex: Human Revolution, just play the game again. The controls, menu, dialogue, story/plot, characters, and upgrades are a sad shell of the original. Worst of all, the effort you invested into this game is rewarded with ""To Be Continued"" after the final cutscene and I serisouly doubt there will be any resolution to the plot they've set up.			"

												Ok, here goes: This is a game made for mobile and sloppily tossed onto pc in an attempt to please a screaming crowd of deus ex fans wanting to be able to play the game on computers, and it's quite evident in its content (or lack thereof).The game looks.. OK for the most part. The character models suffered the most, while the environment is close to deus ex: HR which this game obviously borrowed most of its assets from. Even the soundtrack is the exact same as in HR, which collides a little bit with the whole idea of bringing a unique sound depending on the setting or city the players find themselves in.There are still a lot of augmentations to choose from, but the casie-mod has been dumbed down to simply activating it to win a conversation. Merchants have been completely removed, making you unable to sell the stuff you pick up, and instead replaced with a menu from which weapons, items and ammo can be directly bought.Inventory space is also gone, allowing you to carry several metric tons of crap without having to drop anyting.During my playthroughs I also encountered some frustrating bugs.The most common is the horribly unresponsive ""E"" key for picking up small items or choosing a dialogue option.If you see a little energy-bar or credit-chip anywhere on the map, you need to make sure there are no NPC's nearby, since the game assumes you're activating them instead of the item you want. You will find yourself spamming the E-key when trying to pick something up.There is also the chance of enemies you've taken down falling into walls, making it impossible to get the stuff they drop.In a few locations you can even takedown an enemy from a floor below if your position is right.Like countless reviewers have said before me, this game is amazing on mobile, but severly lacking on pc.The animations are stiff, making it difficult to connect with the characters because of the primitive movements, and character models are repeated as much, if not even more, as in the original deus ex from 17 years ago.The game teases you with more locations in its opening scene, like Australia and New York, but all you get is a quick tutorial level, a miniscule plane flashback-mission and Panama city which serves as the main hub for the first (and only) act of the game.That being said, the voice acting is quite alright, and has the original actors return to their roles of characters such as Namir and Barrett.The different variations of weapons is also a plus, having 3 models (or reskins) of pistols and crossbowsIf you head into this game thinking it's gonna be like DX:HR in all aspects, you'll find yourself dissappointed.DO NOT purchase for the full 10-dollar price tag. At this point with the lacking content, it's a robbery.			"

												Unless you want to play what is technically every game in the series, I wouldn't bother. While it is a decent mobile port, I would have actually preferred had they made this a DLC for Deus Ex: Human Revolution so it could have reached its full potential. What really did me in though is that the story was left on ""to be continued..."" but there is no sign of ever doing that. Squeenix dropped the ball there. If it was decided not to continue then the game should be patched to give it a proper ending. This is sloppy and below their usual standards. Weren't it for that I might have recommended it, but now I simply can't.			"

												Firstly, I love both the original Deus Ex and DEHR. Thus, I bought ""Deus Ex: The Fall"" (DETF) on sales for 1.5 bucks because it belonged to that series.As each game of the series, you will move in an awesome cyberpunk environment, which is as complex and consistent as in the best SF books. Cyberpunk games are usually really interesting because they often deal with a lot of interesting concepts such as transhumanism, bioethics, economy and law.However, this game is the poorest one from the set. Indeed, it was designed as a mobile game and the PC-port is very crap!### Pros:- Interesting story & good cyberpunk environment- Global aesthetic (similar to DEHR but in lower resolution)- Large number of side quests (you have to speak with most NPC to find them)- You start on the Tyrant side, and Jaron Namir is your boss xD- Steam achievements### Cons:- NOT a FULL game (short game & there is no ending (""just wait/buy the hypothetical part2"")- Bad PC-port (Devs did not even reworked on texture quality, no rebindable keys)- Both gameplay and inventory management are oversimplified- You can buy ammo/guns at any time (you don't even need to go to a gun shop!)- Tiny levels => loading screens every 5 min- AI can be improvable### Conclusion:DETF could be a better game but Devs decided to release a bad PC-port and an unfinished game ==> that's why most people badly criticised it !8/20			"

												TL;DR the TL;DR - I liked HR but this PC version gets: 4/10 - Would not recommend.*Possible spoliers below*TL;DR - Unfortunatley this game is a mobile game that has also been compiled to the PC, and therefore, performs rather bad on the PC. Controls are clunky and graphics are worse than the original installement. Storyline and gameplay feel a bit like playing an OK/good clone, but a clone nonetheless. Might be better on mobile device. Relation to the original story: Damn near none.Long version.Graphics:  Graphics are worse, animations glitchy, and a lot of the effects in the UI that made you feel augmented are now replaced by a more vanilla-style HUD. Models are low-poly and repeat the same animations over and over :(Gameplay: Gameplay and UI feels very clunky as if they took the Android version, scaled the resolution, remapped the keys and called it a day. Controls are somewhat unresponsive, can't be changed, and a lot of the gameplay has been dumbed up. For instance, we can no longer jump, and there is a not-so-natural quickmenu-system that replaces the old UI. Liked being able to have more than one save? Well, you can't.Voice acting and story are sub-par and there is a fair amount of hand-waving with illuminati and the tyrants being thrown around. Doesn't capture me the same way that HR did. A shame really, since HR was (and still is) really nice.			"

												This is by far one of the worst video games I have ever played, this bearing the Deus Ex title is a complete joke. Horrible story telling, some of the worst voice acting I have ever heard. lazy and boring ever from Jean reno. The visuals are a joke and i came in expectin so little from a Mobile port, Like 2007 era games look beter and the character models here look so bad. jagged horrible. The game is so badly ported to pc, the controls are horrible and feel Slow.I put the mouse senetivity to the highest setting 10, yet i still have to shove my mouse hard to look around the tutorial is told to you by a horrible english lady like you are a ♥♥♥♥ing child. it feels more like an educational style thing really. like something told to autistic shool children. the npcs looks dopey and just stand there. the gun animations are horrible. swapping weapon is such a hassle. the game plays like Human Rev if you slowed it down by about 200 times and made it chugg along horribly. This game made me feel physically sick and im not joking here. I played 15 mins did not beat the tutorial mission but i just cant. this is so so so bad. and ive played bad pc ports. i got to the part where you threw a grenade for the first time. if you are unfortnate enough to be a ♥♥♥♥ing Idiot like me and own this. if you progress further you are a much stonger man than me. im feel really sick.

												Being a big fan of Deus Ex I bought this without any research since it was made by the same Dev as the reboot. However, that was a mistake since this game is a iOS port and the graphics are comparable to 1st gen. PS3 games at best. No physics, poor textures, clunky controls, AWFUL voice acting, the game is just bad.			"

												I dont know what people expected from a mobile port. I was surprised to be honest, I thought it was much much worse. Its not that long, thats my main issue, but then again i had reaaaally low expectations. After 2 short missions, the game contiunes in the main hub, Panama, where you can roam freely, follow the main storyline and do some side quests along the way. If you explore the main hub, it will take you around 4 to 5 hours to finish the game. Gameplay is simplified compared to the original, but again, not to the degree that I was expecting. Also, you will see a couple of familiar faces from the Human Revoultion.If it's on sale, and you crave for some Deus Ex vibe, its not that bad of a choice.			"

												I really like DX 1 and DX HR but this is something different. I did read somewhere that Eidos Montreal took the best in to DX HR and left the DX IW out. HR was a good game.This 4th installment is even worse that the DX IW. Textures looks taken from 1KB pixeljunk and streched to whole area. Audio just turns off and occaisonally you can actually hear dialogs. Viewbob isn't there, footsteps may or may not be heard. It really depends. Not sure why footsteps and ambient music and dialogs can't play along.Worst is the really really a n n o y i n g user interface. First you can only click pre-determined stuff in the inventory and then when using hack or leaving hacking terminal the huge textbox just floats until you leave the map. Everything is guided by force.This should be sequel to DX HR and it feels like C grade title. Don't try.  "

Short version: 67%The Fall is not as bad as most reviews imply, but with its greatly simplified mechanics, small map, and half-finished story, it falls short as a Deus Ex game. At least it is cheap and has a few enjoyable missions.Long version:Deus Ex is like Zelda: the first game only received one sequel, and every subsequent entry builds backwards in time: The Fall is the prequel of Human Revolution, which in turn was the prequel of Deus Ex 1.While technically this game is supposed to be a direct sequel to the first and only Deus Ex novel, Icarus Effect, it does a mighty poor job at that, because it only references events without any real context or background. We play as two agents on the run from one of the main antagonists of Human Revolution, Belltower PMC, but their tale just hangs in the air both in the beginning and at the conclusion: the game ends in a ‘to be continued’ screen, but Square Enix long ago abandoned all plans to make any sequel after this game flopped.Since The Fall was originally an iOS title, naturally a lot of sacrifices were made in game mechanics: there is only one city now – Panama, which feels like a bad attempt to merge the Detroit and Hengsha maps of Human Revolution – with a set of small missions and no role-playing whatsoever. The infinite inventory space, omnipresent shopping menu, lack of jumping, and the automatic vanishing of downed bodies all push the player towards a more aggressive play style opposed to the focus on stealth in other Deus Ex games.Still, frankly, I wouldn’t say The Fall is a bad game, because it is enjoyable as an almost indie quality (and indie price range). It’s just if you expect it to measure up to the Deus Ex name… then it cannot deliver.			"

												The Fall is a standalone spinoff game that uses a ton of the same stuff from human revolution but has a different story, characters, locations, etc. (Like Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon and Assassin's Creed: Freedom Cry)The major problem with the game is that it's a port of a mobile game which explains a lot.Gameplay is basically Human Revolution but with changes that were made to make the game easier because it was on iOS.The game plays fine but there were some changes I was a bit mixed on.The changes that stood out to me are-Ben Saxon has augmented pockets (Infinite inventory space)-A merchant follows you everywhere (You can buy things at anytime)-Ben Saxon isn't very athletic (No sprinting or Jumping)-It just feels like a mobile game despite being on PC Also, bugs, nothing game breaking though. Some people have run into problems like no music and such, worst I had was the world disappearing during takedowns.Overall, the game feels like it's on easy by default (there's no difficulty settings) and I felt limited due to no jumping and sprinting.Despite all that, I've been having fun with it so far (after the annoying tutorial of course)Would I recommend it? Right now? NoIf you're a fan that wants more Deus Ex, just to be safe, wait until it (hopefully) gets patched or until it goes on sale. If you're deciding which of the newer Deus Ex games to buy, just go with Human Revolution, it's pretty cheap when it's on sale and it's a bigger game (It usually gets a 75% discount which ends up being 5 dollars cheaper than The Fall at full price)			"

												Controls can't be rebound, at least not that I can see. There's no option to aim down sights at all, the only weapon I've found that has any aiming is bound to the same button as fire, truly the idea of a genius.The voice acting is absolutely dreadful and the textures look 5 years old at best. The AI is horrible (shoot a silenced weapon and everyone in the room instantly knows your location and is shooting at you). All that combined with the incredibly annoying fact that when you walk the main character has a habit of teleporting back 5 feet and spinning around every few seconds makes for a pretty bad game. Get Bad Rats instead and have a good laugh for half the price.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Deus Ex: The Fall Original Release: 2014 Genre Tags: RPG; Action; Sci-Fi; FPS My Overall Grade: B- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 3-7 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Fans of the intellectual property; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Casual gamers REVIEWIt's like some people order a hamburger at a restaurant and then complain that it isn't a steak.I enjoyed Deus Ex: The Fall.  This game gets a lot of flak from people who (for some reason) expected it to be up to par with Human Revolution.  But you must remember Human Revolution was one of the best games ever made; of course a cheaper, more simple, smaller-scale game that was originally developed for mobile devices isn't going to be on the same level as Human Revolution!Deus Ex: The Fall was going to be a “hamburger” from the inception of development to the very end.  I understand that there is a desire for more Deus Ex games of “steak” quality, and I share that desire.  But I don’t see why anyone should hate this game for not being something it was never supposed to be in the first place.  I greatly enjoyed my playthrough of this game and I think if you can understand and accept the game for what it is, and get it for a price you feel comfortable with: you will enjoy it too— especially if you are a fan of the genre or the Deus Ex atmosphere.Considering it is a mobile port, I personally thought the game ran great on my machine.  I liked the graphics; some scenes were nice to look at. There wasn't as much impressive lighting and effects as in Human Revolution, but I found some good shots here and there.  The controls were fine, and I experienced no bugs or crashing.It was toned down, sure, but I could still feel the Deus Ex atmosphere as I played.  I liked the story.  It was simple, easy to follow.  The game is only 5-ish hours long to beat, (maybe a little longer if you 100% it, which can be done on one playthrough).  Also the game is easy.  Whether you are sneaky or Rambo, the combat scenarios are mostly small and easy; and the RPG elements are toned down as well, (i.e.: there are not that many abilities, and you can access the shop from anywhere in the game).All together, the pieces fit nicely into a small package of a game.  There are some trivial decisions to be made, and a few alternate paths to choose from.  There's not that much to explore, but there's enough for the length of the game.  It can give you an enjoyable afternoon's worth of gameplay and a new, short, little story set in the Deus Ex universe... if you let it.  Get it for a price you feel comfortable with, and let yourself enjoy the game.  Just don't expect it to be what it isn't and what it was never going to be.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Noodling around Deus Ex land one more time was fun.  Sneaking, evading guards, the Human Revolution hacking mini-game - at times Deus Ex: The Fall felt like the real thing - but honestly, as a PC title it's a joke.  The gameplay is Junior's first Deus Ex adventure, and user interface, textures, tiny maps, single save game slot, disappearing bodies, non-rebindable keys all remind you: this is not a port of a mobile game, this is a mobile game.And the bugs...  Configure your speakers in Windows to Stereo or voices won't play, with subtitles only appearing for a fraction of a second.  And there were severe mouse issues - sometimes I would try to open a door, but had to click the ""hack"" button several times before the game noticed.  Also choosing the correct NPC for dialogue was a mini-game itself - how do I position myself to speak with that one? - with the bonus hazard of a container or door sometimes conspiring to steal my selection.Wouldn't be fair to comment on the shooty bits, since I always sneak around pacifist style in these games.  Maybe it's great, maybe it's garbage, but for Deus Ex, who cares?  If you are looking for FPS action, headshots, running around the map like Rambo, you bought the wrong game. :)So I've scoured the map for side quests, rummaged through every bin, spoken to every NPC I could find.  Guess it's safe to move to the next hub.  So I get to the choppa, a cutscene plays, ""TO BE CONTINUED"" appears and I discover I've completed the entire game.  Oh, right, $10.If you're a huge Deus Ex fan, and/or you have a good imagination maybe it's worth that price.  Otherwise I would call this a classic ""wait for a 75% discount"" situation.p.s. For one fanboy mini-letdown I couldn't find the original Deus Ex main title playing anywhere. :(Edit: It's not the worst game I've played, only the worst Deus Ex game I've played. :)I had fun with parts of The Fall; wouldn't have finished the game if I didn't enjoy any of it.  But I enjoyed the feeling of being in the Deus Ex world more than the actual game I was playing - if that makes any sense.  If you loved the previous Deus Ex games and want more of that world, this is as close as you're going to get.  Stealthy gameplay in a science fiction near-future, shadowy government/corporate conspiracies, sounds great!  But none of that happens in Deus Ex: The Fall - it's just your imagination filling in the gaps in the barren in-game world.Deus Ex: The Fall feels like an outline, or a rough draft, the bare skeleton of a Deus Ex game.  You can crouch, sneak, read notes, crawl through the vents, knock out the guards.  But it's all so small.  There's no depth, no moral ambiguity, no double-cross, no surprise.  No huge map where you explore, scout out the opposition, make plans, maybe fail and try again from a different direction.  You see a guard, you see a vent, you crawl behind the guard, you knock him out.  Then his body disappears.  Repeat until you run out of guards.If you've never played the original year-2000 Deus Ex, I recommend playing that game instead.  It's ancient by video game standards, and looks it, but it puts Deus Ex: The Fall to shame.  The last time I played was with a mod called ""New Vision"" which greatly improves the graphics but leaves the underlying game alone.  There may be other mods available by now, I haven't kept track so you will have to research that yourself. :)			"

												My guess is the developer of this ""game"" saw how bad Deus Ex: Invisable war was and thought, ""You know, we can do much, much worse,"" This is an unplayable mobile port and it is absolute garbage. From the total lack of options to the total lack of playability. Deus Ex is one of my favorite game series and this takes a big steaming (see what I did there?) dump right on top of the franchise. This game should be diassavowed and diassapeared. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. It will only encourage the developers to create more craptastic cash grabs. Not worth the price at ten dollars, not worth the price for free. In fact, I think they should pay me for the time wasted.			"

												Honestly this game isn't as bad as people think.Sure, it's not a full Deus Ex game, but it is part of the Deus Ex expanded universe and adds some intersting lore elements to factions that were otherwised not talked about much in Human Revolution. You take the role of Ben Saxon and his beef with Belltower, because much like it's real world counter part (Blackwater) they've done some shady stuff outside of the human trafficing that was shown in the Missing Link DLC.All in all I would really recommend this game if you really love the Deus Ex lore and it's web of conspiracies and rabbit holes. Gameplay is a bit stripped down but surprisingly intact for a Mobile port. Get it while it's cheap!I do hope that they continue the series, I beat it under 3 hours but if you take your time you can do it in 6. "

YouTube™ Video: Deus Ex The Fall Review 

			Views: 207		

			★ Cheapest Games - https://www♥♥♥♥♥com/r/sugoiprice Deus Ex: The Fall is a cyberpunk action role-playing and stealth video game, which is the fourth in the Deus Ex series.		

Whose Falling Now?I really wanted to be ""that guy"" and say its not that bad guys! but i would be lying to myself. I haven't played the IOS/Android version so i can't compare the two but i can make some comparison between human revolution and the Fall. The game's level design/graphics aren't really that bad, but when it comes to controls it feels like downgrade from HR - there is no jump option nor there is a sprint the game is much smaller in scale (Takes around 2-4h to play)Although it uses lot of same functions like wall cover, praxis, shop system, augments etc. but it feels lackluster in many ways. The story/dialogues and voice actors were really subpar in this whole game and the game doesn't conclude the story ""To be continued"" is the ending text so we can assume there is going to be sequel to the game in future. Lot of the characters including main character ben saxon are boring and non-interesting really. It feels more like a Fan made mod or campaign than actual product from Eidos. I mean for a IoS game though its rather impressive. It still has great soundtrack and i really did enjoy the level designs on the game (i would say they might've been better than Human Revolution maps.But if you happen to find this game on sale, i think it might be worth your time, but not for 10$/€			"

												1. What is Deus Ex The Fall?Deus Ex The Fall is a mobile port after the successful game Deus Ex Human Revolution (and DLC).2. Why all the negative reviews?I think people expected a full quality deus ex game, which is definitely not the case. It has a lot of flaws, but there are some things to like about The Fall. You should definitely ask yourself to try it out, it is NOT BAD IN EVERY CATEGORY!3. Do I have to play human revolution before?I highly recommend to play human revolution before and you absolutely have to read the official book ""Icarus Effect - James Swallow"" to fully understand the storyline and characters, because there is no explanation at the beginning of the game4. Do I still play as Adam Jensen?No, you will play as Ben Saxon, who gets hired by the Tyrants. The game continues where the book ends.5. What does the game right?It continues the story of the book in a good way. I liked the new setting around Panama city with the spanish speaking characters and there is still a lot to explore in the city, even if it is smaller. The music is great again and from the same composer. You will be able to play stealth or to do it the rambo way. You can again arm and augment yourself to upgrade your character and improve in a similar way as in human revolution. You will also have different side missions, It took me about 10 hours to complete the game.6. What does the game wrong?It is a mobile port which means that the graphics are worse than human revolution. The movement ingame is not as good as in human revolution (a bit clunky and you cannot jump). The voice acting is not as good as in human revolution. To upgrade yourself you have to open the shop und buy it, which breaks the immersion. When you shoot, you have this weird zoom effect, which simulates the recoil (If you play stealth as I did you will not recognize this). The game ends with a cliffhanger and no one knows if it will be continued some day.If you liked this review be sure to hit the like button to help other players with helpful reviews. Thanks!			"

												This game is trash, let me tell you why.There's an ingame cash store where you can buy any weapon or ammo you want at any time, completely removing the need to preserve items. Bodies disappear immediately after KO/kill, meaning that killing over silent takedowns is worthless as enemies cannot be woken up. Graphics are horrible, looking very much like a PS2 game; no graphic options other than resolution and AA, and all animations that aren't directly ripped from Human Revolution look stiff and janky. Levels are tiny and linear compared to the original Deus Ex, a game released 14 years ago. No way to rebind keys, period. UI and menus are clearly designed for tablets, are incredibly clunky, and don't make proper use of the many keys a keyboard has. The game babies you to the point of telling you how to walk before allowing you to do so. The story isn't even half as interesting as either Deus Ex or Human Revolution... oh, and it's unfinished, telling you to wait for a second episode that is likely never coming. This doesn't even cover the myriad of bugs that The Fall has, but merely the ""intended gameplay experience"" that the people at Eidos thought everyone would eat up and love.Don't buy this unless you are morbidly curious at what a bad Deus Ex game looks like.

												This is a difficult game to judge and review: if seen as a Deus Ex title, it is quite terrible, but in its own right, it isn't all that bad (albeit nothing special).This is effectively a sidestory, aimed at setting the scene for Human Revolution. However, it has the following problems:Poor graphics by PC standards [this is a ported mobile game]Clipping is noticable.Menus lack any sort of mouse optimisation.Cliffhanger ending - there was obviously meant to be a sequel, but guess it was scrapped due to the poor reception of this title.It is entertaining enough in its own right, but don't expect anything amazing. Would suggest buying this on special and make your own mind up... just don't compare to Human Revolution or you will be sorely disappointed.Very hard to judge, but call it a tentative recommendation.

												So you're thinking about buying Deus Ex: The Fall on SteamThis means one of two things:1) You've never played a Deus Ex game and you're looking for somewhere to start2) You're a fan of the Deus Ex series.I suppose it's also possible that you've played a Deus Ex game before and didn't like it, but then you either like being continuously disappointed or you do things you hate on purpose so you can complain about it on the internet. In either case, you probably shouldn't spend $10 on Deus Ex: The Fall and you probably shouldn't be using the internet.Now let's say you fall into the first category I have up there. I can say with some confindence that Deus Ex: The Fall isn't for you. If you're a typical hardcore gamer then the obvious start is with the first Deus Ex. I don't even know why you're here. Seriously, everyone knows that Deus Ex is one of the best games ever. Go play it. Go. Now if you're more of a casual gamer, looking for an easier, less ""old-school"" story telling experience, then go play Deus Ex: Human Revolution (director's cut or not, all they really did was make the game easier). That's not to say that Deus Ex: Human Revolution is at all a casual game. It's a wonderful stealth-shooter with really great voice acting, writing, level design, you name it. It's just that HR has things like quest markers and an active level map. Go play those games and come back when you fall into category 2.For all you remaining, let me try to break the game up by parts starting with the one you're probably most concerned with:Quality of Port If you've been living under a Samsung Galaxy for the last few months, you may have been surprised to hear about a new Deus Ex game that appeared seemingly out of nowhere. That's because it's a port. Of an Ipad game. Yes, that's right. Eidos Montreal made the next Deus Ex game for the Ipad. I was almost as disappoint when they announced it as I was when the announced the Human Revolution - Director's Cut for the WiiU. But just like that, it's on Steam now, so everything it fixed right? Not really. The port isn't perfect. Sure it came with things like variable resolution, but keys are complete un-remappable. Also something was lost moving between touch controls and the mouse as I found myself having to click things several times and dance around like an idiot, waiting for the game to let me hack a panel without talking to the NPC next to it. The worst issue of all by far though, was the lag. Not input lag, but lag like I was playing a multiplayer game. Sometimes, I'd just pop back to where I was facing a second ago. When you combine that with the PS2 level graphics, it got to be incredibly disorienting. Overall, I'd give it a 4 out of Saints Row 2. Story Deus Ex: The Fall picks up after the events of a novel by James Swallow called Deus Ex: Icarus Effect. And much like any canonology's expanded universe, it references events you may have never heard of and doesn't explain anything. Playing Human Revolution is pretty much all you'll need, but references to things like NSF and Janus may leave some more casual fans scratching their heads. I never read Icarus Effect and maybe everything is a little bit more hashed out there, but The Fall is pretty hallow. You play as Ben Saxon, former SAS member turned Belltower operative, recruited by the bad guys from Human Revolution. One day he learns the dark truth and decides he doesn't want to kill people for no reason anymore. Why? I don't know. Ben Saxon is pretty much ""a soldier."" He can never be out of character because he doesn't have one. You have a side kick whose name is Anna or something. She has at most 5 minutes of screen time and is basically Pritchard 2.0 only she's nice to you and doesn't actually do anything. Together you try to get your perscription filled and save the world. At least I assume you save the world. This is only part 1 of a longer story, the second part to which, I hope comes out for Android. I'll give the story makes-sense out of read-the-expanded-universe.Gameplay Despite its mouse and keyboardless origins, the gameplay is all right. You vault over cover instead of jumping, but other than that, it plays almost exactly like Human Revolution. There are actually certain elements that I thought were better than HR. For one, there are more than one type of every gun that you can purchase at anytime using Ben Saxon's 3D printer augment (that's not mentioned in the game, but I can only assume that's the explanation). There are different shotguns, different assault rifles, plasma rifles, even a gold plated pistol. Each weapon has it's own stats. It would be pretty sweet if the game gave you enough money to try them all out. Additionally, the British army is way better at picking augmentations than Sarif. All the useless augments are gone and some are broken up, so you can better pick the augmentations you want. Best of all, there's an augment that allows more than one dead power cell to fully recharge. I guess Ben cares more about his candy bar intake than Adam. Other than that, it's pretty much the same as Human Revolution. Open world, do some side quests, cover and shoot, hack computers. The usual. The one bad and frankly really frustrating change (which I assume was a simplification for the sake of the Ipad) was the change in the AI. When it comes to stealth games, there are two kinds of bad AI, the kind that will never see you and the kind that will attack you from miles away anytime you leave cover. The Fall is the latter. The grace period between a bad guy seeing you and attacking you is way shorter than in HR and when one guard becomes hostile, everyone does whether he shot at you or not. The game has a quick save feature (if you're a casual), but you only get one save at all, so you really have to sneak carefully. Overall, the gameplay gets a gold-plated-pistol out of 10.Graphics and Visuals I'm not going to linger on the graphics too long. It was an Ipad game afterall, and like I said, it was PS2 comparable. All the actors were incredibly stiff and some of the NPC's looked like burn victims, but that was pretty funny so I'll let it slide. As far as the visuals go, almost everything was cut and pasted from Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Same robots, same posters, same Belltower guards. Even Ben Saxon's takedown animations were the same as Adam Jensen's. This of course leads to two conclusion:1) Adam Jensen and Ben Saxon studied at the same dojo2) Hidden arm-swords come standard issue with all augmentations.Considering that Ben Saxon has only one augmented arm, it really leads you to wonder how effective a lot of Jensen's takedowns would be for Ben. There are a few new kinds of areas in the game which manage to be mostly original while still fitting in so that's a plus. I guess there isn't much to say really. If you like the way Human Revolution looked, you'll like the way The Fall looks. Except for all those burn victims. Ctrl-v out of 10.Level Design It's, well, it's pretty good. Different ways to sneak through areas (except one or two loading zones which are unique entrances to areas) and while all the textures are similar to past games, none of the actual level layouts were too similar. Pretty cool. No sewer level out of 10.Voice Acting Oh my god JC a bomb out of 10.All in all, the differences in gameplay and level design made The Fall a neat little 3-hour Deus Ex experience. Can't say it was great, but I had fun playing it. If you like the canon enough to drop $10 on a ""neat little 3-hour Deus Ex experience"" do it. Else wait for a sale.			"

I Never Asked for ThisWhen one thinks of Deus Ex, they think of multiple choice avenues to virtually every task they come up against. They think of smart storytelling that makes you want to keep playing. They think of all the unique situations that a play style gives. Well, don’t expect any of that here folks.Coming off the heels of Human Revolution, you would probably think it would play and look the same, if not better in every regard, but come on, we all know it’s a port of a mobile/tablet game so we can’t be expecting miracles, but the effort made by the developers to improve on the build and make it more PC friendly is comical.Let us start with the visuals. The game itself does indeed lend its art style from Human Revolution, although heavily watered down. The models of everything, from cars, NPC’s, buildings, you name it, are horribly rough edged, and don’t look much better than the original Deus Ex… which was released in the year 2000! The textures fair no better, sporting their low resolution sickness all over the place. It extends further though, as the UI, which again, is almost identical to HR, is poorly done, and is quite obviously up-scaled from a very low resolution, which results in that pixel edge look… nasty.Other SFX such as explosions and the sort have as much visual punch as a wet teabag. In fact, the only models in the game that even have a decent model and texture to them are some of the weapons. They’re obviously ripped directly from HR and watered down to match the rest of the game.Now don’t get me wrong! Visuals don’t make a game, I mean look at how well the original Deus Ex holds up, even today, but that has other features, such as great mechanics and story.The sound is no better, with most voice actors doing horrible jobs, on what sounds like very low grade microphones. The ambient sounds and soundtrack are similar to HR, and probably sourced from that also, so at least we’re good on that front.Putting that all aside, we come to the meat and potatoes of any game, THE GAMEPLAY! So then… the shambles of this becomes apparent from the start. Yet again it ports over Human Revolutions animations and pastes them onto the dreadful models. So you can expect most of the same features, such as cover and rolling from it, sneaking but OH NO WAIT! You can’t jump. For some reason Panama doesn’t stock jumping augs, and apparently has super gravity as you can’t even jump an inch, or even sprint for that matter! I don’t need to explain how much of a game breaking issue that is to a Deus Ex game.We do get practically every augmentation Jenson received, besides the aforementioned jumping augments, so you’ll be very familiar on this front at least. Oh, what’s that? No merchants in the hubs? No no no! Instead, we have a store that we can access on the go, at anywhere at any time. Obviously a remnant from the mobile version where players could dump their real money into the game to get items faster, and is extremely game breaking. You can just buy more painkillers mid fight and be fine, essentially making you invincible for all intents and purposes. Oh, and did I mention you don’t have an inventory screen and seem to able to carry everything?Maybe you’re like me. A man who was simply thirsty for a bit more Deus Ex and bought the game on sale in spite of all the bad tales I heard, because hey, it must have a story right aside from all the horrible gameplay? WRONG! The story is pathetically boring and simplistic that actually ends up with a “To be continued” screen, and guess what?! That will never come as the idea was obviously abandoned after its massive flop.In short, I don’t think it’s worth it even for the most hardcore of Deus Ex fans. Do yourself a favour and replay the original or Human Revolution until we get that sequel to HR that is on the horizon. Unless of course, you like torture, then I’m afraid you did ask for this…			"

Goods and contras: (+) Same atmosphere as ‘Deus Ex: Human Revolution’. ✅  (+) Good story and the main characters have good voice acting. ✅  (+) +New Game mod after you’ve finished the game. ✅ It means, you still have your inventory, money, and unlocked augmentations.   (-) Annoying and un-skipabel tutorial. ⍻  (-) Not working well pick-up system. It was a bit annoying. ⍻  (-) Worse graphics quality than ‘Deus Ex: Human Revolution’. ⍻  (-) The story won’t finish at the end. It said, ‘To be continued’  Crash, bug, glitch:I met just a few weird glitch. They didn’t bring too much trouble to me.  My personally opinion:Despite the many negative preview, I bough it. The ‘Deus Ex: The Fall’ definitely not as good as the ‘Deus Ex: Human Revolution’. But for me, it was enough good. It looks like as a fans mod. I enjoyed the game and the story was enough good.  Recommendation:I recommend the this game to those who; Liked the ‘Deus Ex: Human Revolution’. Like the stealth game style. Like the crime stories.  To the Achievement-Hunters:The most of the achievements are easy unlockable. Only the ‘Hard Times’ achievement is a bit buggy. But the troubleshoot is easy, just need a bit attention.			"

												Where to Start....Deus Ex: Human Revolution was one of my favorite games to play. I played it so much that I literally mastered the game, (Got every ending, got every achievement). So when I saw that Deus Ex: The Fall was on steam, of course I was excited about buying it...But given the couple hours I've sat and played it, my excitefulness has changed to a much more negative feeling..Deus Ex: The Fall follows Ben Saxon, a Former British SAS Agent turned Aug, as well as Government Agent gone rogue Anna Kelso, as they hide from the Illuminati and their elite team of mercenaries known as the Tyrants. That's pretty much all I can really say in terms of a story, otherwise I'd be spoiling the game..Many previous Human Revolution players will find the same gameplay elements in The Fall, however this time around, there's much more problems. Above all, I noticed constant glitches or stutters during gameplay, many bugs such as getting stuck on cover, being unable to click out of a menu, trying to grab an item with an NPC standing nearby and the game thinks you're trying to talk to the NPC, little to no ammo for non-lethal weaponry, and an in-game market you can use to buy new guns, ammo, or various items with the in-game ""Credits"", however everything is overpriced making the system completely pointless. One thing I was very annoyed about, was the inability to sell weapons picked up from enemies back to the market for credits...Despite knowing it was previously a mobile game, Deus Ex: The Fall is just ugly, running the game on the highest settings, character models look dreadful, the world looks bland, and many graphical glitches occur at various times for no explained reason. Players who do not like the layout of the control system will find no way of reconfiguring the controls, which is problematic for some.All in All, Deus Ex: The Fall is not worth the $10.00 asking price. The game is no longer than one and a half to two hours long (pending you do the sidequests), and doesn't offer much difficulty. Even on New Game Plus, where supposedly the difficulty is ""increased"", I never had a problem completing the game. If you really want to play it, at least wait for it to be on Sale for $3.00 or less...or if you want to experience the story without playing the game, then you should know that the game follows the exact same story as the book ""Deus Ex: The Icarus Effect"" by James Swallow. This is one time when the book is definitely better than the Game!(Time Played: 7.6 Hours, Completed the game Three (3) Times, and earned all 28 Achievements)			"

I like to see fixes to the game.At least that the old Human Revolutions Engine is used instead of the crap they used for PC.It will may not fix much, but it would be a step in the right direction.

												No keyboard button prompts, and there are parts of menus you literally cannot get out of without a controller, I've pressed every single key on this ♥♥♥♥♥ in every combo i can think of, but nope, gotta plug in a controller so I can press X.  Somebody should mail these devs a keyboard so they can educate themselves on what it is and how its used, apparently they missed that class. Can't use the mouse to click the menu option either, that's space-age technology evidently. What the ♥♥♥♥, how do you put a game on the PC, even a PORT, and not be able to navigate menus with a keyboard??  And more importantly, how does a developer of a game say ""I'm gonna put this on PC"" and not include the SIMPLEST of keyboard interfaces? I'm not even gonna whine about not being able to remap buttons, maybe I would complain about that if I'd gotten that far, I dunno. I do know these fellows need to stay away from PC development, we have standards over here.Don't care how good the game is beyond this, if the input is this broken its a bad, bad game not even worth the LOWEST discount prices. I'll plug in a controller and play through it, just because I own it and its a Deus Ex thing, but rarely is there a game in a series I love so much that feels like such an obligation.In the words of JC Denton... ""What a shame.""EDIT: Apparently my controller (Logitech F310, which uses xinput the same as an Xbox controller) doesn't work either, apparently ""Full Controller Support"" means ""only one controller support"" ... so basically, I can't play at all.  what a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I hope the developers' families starve honestly.

												I would like to say I'm a HUGE fan of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. I preordered this game knowing full well it was an iPad port. I didn't have super expectations giving the price of the game. I figured it would be ok for the story and expansion of the Deus Ex universe. Little did I know the full craptitude that would be unleashed onto my eyeballs and brain.First of all, there absolutely NO JUMPING! What gives?! I was hoping for multiple paths to complete missions and find extra goodies. You also can't just pickup boxes to throw at people. I got the strength mod only to find out it's to slide stuff around and not be like ""HULK SMASH!"" vending machine throw. The controls are really awkward and seem broken at times. Like I'll be hugging the wall crouched backing up, then my character gets kinda stuck and will still be in cover mode when I'm clearly in the middle of a doorway or edge of a box. Also, in menus and various prompts where you have to choose stuff, I've had to click a bunch of times to get the option to register. In the main menu for inventory and stuff like that, sometimes clicking works, others you have to highlight what you want, then hit enter.The environment graphics are ok, but the random npc models are awful. Alot of them look like mutated elf people. Also, the lighting doesn't look right on alot of things, like some polygons on a models face will be shadowed even when the light source is right infront of them. In the nightclub at Panama, there was this npc dancing like a derp, I actually thought it was a dude until she spoke because I thought I saw a 5 o'clock shadow. It's pretty bad when a player can't tell what they're looking at because of super low polys and the crappy lighting ingame. Facial movements are wonky as well. I've noticed that parts of the face don't move properly when the main characters are talking, like the upper lip doesn't move. Ben's and Anna's eyes are WAY too big, almost animeish. Barret's and Namir's models really look like they don't belong in this game. You can tell their models weren't made for the facial rigging in this game.The voice acting, oh dear lord, the voice acting is TERRIBLE. If you wanna hear Skwisgaar Skwigelf pretend to be Russian, or other borderline stereotype/horrendous accents, then this shouldn't bother you. The main characters are meh at best. I don't really have a problem for the characters you see in Human Revolution though, they're ok. I've also noticed some glitching with voices in cutscenes.The writing is lackluster. I found myself already clicking though emails not giving a flip what's going on in the world. There are plotholes as big as galaxies, and listening to the news reports and voice messages gave me a brain aneurysm. For example, in one message Anna says she would've cried if they didn't already take her eyes. That doesn't make any sense because tears don't come from your eyeballs. This is just one of many things that will make ocd people like me super mad.The help system is absolutely annoying. It's not like H.R. where you can just ignore it like a boss. It FORCES you to look at crap and doesn't go away till you click the stuff it wants you to.I feel Ben is just a bargain-bin version of Adam Jenson and this game is not worth the money. Overall I give the game a 2/10.			"

												More like Deus Ex: The Fail!!! About the only thing forgivable about this game is that it is a port of a mobile game. So, its understandable that the quality is unlikely to match the heights that the game's big brother, Deus Ex: Human Revolution did. The voice-acting was surprisingly horrendous, you'd think like DX:HR, they'd put some effort there but they didn't. The controls were alright but not exactly smooth. The audio cuts out during cutscenes and takedowns although it doesn't happen all the time. And certain aspects of gameplay like moving heavy boxes were simplified and there's no jumping even though I have to admit that was expected because again, this is a port from a mobile game.The story wasn't bad but it still wasn't enough to salvage the game. There's plenty of potential but it falls flat in presentation, not helped by the surprisingly poor dialogue and bad VA. The characters weren't as interesting as Adam Jensen and company in the main Human Revolution game and despite some familliar characters appearing (the Tyrants), their appearance was quite lacking. About the only thing I liked about the game was hearing Bob Page's (main villain in the original Deus Ex) evil voice once again.Overall, this game is to Human Revolution what Invisible War was to the original Deus Ex. A massive let-down. This isn't my worst purchase as I got a copy of the original Deus Ex GOTY version (the greatest game of all time) with my preorder. If you're in anyway interested to play this game, wait for a Steam sale. Its already cheap at $10, but it would probably feel more worth it if you get it for cheaper. "

GameplayDeus Ex: The Fall is a stealth action game. Although they can be played as a first-person shooter if you prefer a more aggressive approach, the Deus Ex games do encourage the player to take a stealthy approach. This means you study the pattern of patrolling guards, try to single out one of them and sneak up behind him, and then press a button on your keyboard or controller to take him down. While doing this, you want to avoid being caught in the act by other guards, security cameras or patrolling robots.You earn experience points (XP) for your actions and when you've earned enough XP, you get one point to spend on 'augmentations' (skills). Roughly, there are combat-oriented skills, exploration skills that allow you to get to places you wouldn't otherwise be able to reach, and hacking skills.To hack a computer or an electronic lock you need to complete a minigame. The minigame is based on pure luck, but you can invest in skills that raise your chance to succeed. You will also find items that can make hacking a bit easier.There's a main questline that will take you through the story and through every area of the game world. There are also 5 optional side quests that yield some additional XP, coin or useful items.Story and settingIn the world of Deus Ex, technology has evolved to a point where humans can be 'augmented' with technology like much stronger limbs or sophisticated eye prosthetics. Unfortunately, augmented people are dependent on a drug called Neuropozyne to prevent rejection of the implants, which would result in death.You're Benjamin 'Ben' Saxon, an augmented former Belltower agent who's recruited by a team of independent mercenaries called the Tyrants, led by Jaron Namir. Ben soon finds out what people who played Deus Ex: Human Revolution already know: they're not the nicest bunch of people. While on the run from both Belltower and the Tyrants, Ben and his girlfriend Anna find themselves in Panama when they start experiencing physical problems due to a lack of Neuropozyne. So Ben sets out to look for a solution to that problem, while trying to stay out of the clutches of the people who are after them at the same time.Panama consists of three small zones that each have a few buildings you can enter and where you'll find quest givers, quest targets and loot. It's not a huge place at all. If you rush through the game doing the main questline only, you'll probably be finished in 3 or 4 hours. If you do all the side quests, it takes about 5 to 6 hours to play through the game.Graphics, sound and controlsDeus Ex: The Fall was originally a game for mobile devices, developed in Unity. While I must say that graphically it's the best Unity-based game I have played so far, this is a big step down from Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The developers of Deus Ex: The Fall clearly added quite a few fringes to the basics that the Unity engine provides, but Unity graphics always look a bit crude and austere. Menu controls are clumsy: sometimes you need to click several times on a button before it registers. In-game, items dropped by opponents tend to sink into the floor. You can still pick them up if you know more or less where they are, but you can't see them. This is annoying and it looks and feels plain sloppy. Also, when an object you want to pick up is close to another object you can interact with, you will interact with the other object. In that case, you need to move around to try and focus the camera in a way that only the item you want to pick up is highlighted, which can be a pain. The music is okay. It sounds mostly copypasted from Deus Ex: Human Revolution but toned down a bit. It's certainly not memorable, although it isn't intrusive or annoying either. The same goes for the sound effects. They're probably copypasted as well, but they sound dull compared to Deus Ex: Human Revolution's sound effects. The voice acting of the main characters is fairly good, although Benjamin Saxon sounds er... very British, almost cockney. The voice acting of most of the secondary characters sounds mediocre at best. I think they hired voice actors who were asked to fake a Hispanic accent instead of hiring actual Hispanics.Comparison to Deus Ex: Human Revolution and conclusionWhen compared to its 'big brother', Deus Ex: The Fall lacks some mechanics that made Deus Ex: Human Revolution more interesting, and it shows some design flaws that are hard to understand, unless they're a direct consequence of the game being developed in Unity for mobile devices and then ported to pc.  The Benjamin Saxon character is a lot less cool than Adam Jensen, the protagonist in Deus Ex: Human Revolution There are less augments because skills have been merged or have disappeared completely. Although to be honest, it's mostly the less interesting skills that are gone. The protagonist can't jump. At all. This takes away quite a bit of mechanics that were present in Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and the tactics that came with it.   You don't see the chance to get detected (%) while hacking.The following points may be both positive and negative, depending on personal taste: You have access to a shop at any time through the game menu, where you can buy anything as long as you have the credits. Yes, that's handy but it's less tactical and a lot less immersive. You have unlimited inventory space. Again, handy but less tactical. Whether dead or unconscious, bodies that drop to the floor disappear after a few seconds. Sure, unconscious people can't accidentally get killed, which was a problem in Deus Ex: Human Revolution, but this makes Deus Ex: The Fall a lot less tactical as you don't need to drag bodies out of sight of patrols and cameras. The game allows only one save slot. This means you have to be careful when you save, but it also means you can't go back to a previous savegame if you discover you missed something or if you made a choice you regret. It also means you may want to switch off the autosave function in the game's options!You do get a Deus Ex game with basic Deus Ex gameplay and atmosphere. The story ties in to Deus Ex Human Revolution with plenty of references to that game. Deus Ex: The Fall isn't one of the greatest games ever but it's certainly enjoyable if you take it for what it is. It's a mobile port and it looks and feels like a lite-version of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. If an indie company would have made Deus Ex: The Fall as a tribute to Deus Ex: Human Revolution, it would get nothing but praise and love. But as it's made by the same company who published Deus Ex: Human Revolution, people's expectations were very high, maybe too high to be absolutely fair to the developers.Don't get me wrong. I understand people who are disappointed that Deus Ex: The Fall is not as good as Deus Ex: Human Revolution and who are disappointed that the series for which Deus Ex: The Fall is just the first chapter, was never completed. And I understand that this disappointment results in a 'mostly negative' reputation on Steam. However, when it comes to rendering a verdict, I think it's important to judge Deus Ex: The Fall for what it is and not compared to what was (i.e. Deus Ex: Human Revolution) or what could have been (i.e. completion of the story of Deus Ex: The Fall). From that standpoint, I did end up with an overall positive score for Deus Ex: The Fall.On Steam's extra featuresDeus Ex: The Fall has 6 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game.The 28 Steam Achievements aren't very challenging, except maybe the achievements for playing the game stealthily and one for which you need to gather 11,000 credits.

												This... is. I don't even know what this is. I suppose it's my fault for not reading up on it more before I purchased it, and now I have buyer's remorse. I can see how it'd be entertaining on a tablet, but on PC? For anyone who rejoiced at the prospect of more Human Revolution-esque Deus Ex like I did, this is NOT the same.

												During its five hours, Deus Ex: The Fall, presents a watered down, effectively castrated version of all the elements that made Human Revolution a true modern gaming classic. It may look like Deus Ex in a few strategically taken screenshots, but the actual experience is anything but. You will keep playing, desperately hoping for the glimpses of genius that are alluded to as part of the regular franchise, but players who are not fans of this franchise should stay well away from this cheap cash-in that only tarnishes the reputation of one of the most sterling franchises in gaming.The Fall could have been a much better game with just a little bit of push, but right now, it's just an opportunity to PC gamers to experience the iOS version. It's not a bad game, it's just way below the expectations.Once you get through a lot of the shock that comes with The Fall being a tablet conversion and all the little problems it has, fortunately you'll find that it's still a fun new slice of Human Revolution.The Praxiss options are awesome, the combat is very precise and responsive and the atmosphere is great. My judgement might be a bit clouded because I'm a huge fan of this franchise but my final verdict is 6/10.			"

Why?! Just Why???Apart from the story setting and the engine this has nothing to do with DE:HRNegative:-  There are no customizable control sets.-  Combat physics are basically non existent and the AI is plain dumb. -  Command input responsiveness is a game of luck in context situations, in the hacking mechanics as well as in the menu-  Only about 40% of cutscene dialogs are recorded or play at all-  Texture glitches in cutscenes and ingame-  Jumping is only context-sensitive-  close to no character facial animation-  you can basically buy any item from the invenotry which has no space limit-  Augmentation menu is cut down to a few augs/augtrees-  oh and only about 2 hours of gameplay, ending in a cliff hanger that smacks the 10€ you paid at your face, telling you to come back to throw more money at this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Positive::+  I know now I don't have to buy anything more from this developer+  The torture was over in only 2 hours (my 8hours gaming time mostly come from idling)+  It did not price you at AAA-Level+ if you took the limited offer you get one of the best games in gaming history ""Deus Ex GOTY"" with your purchase. If you have that already, avoid this piece of feces.			"

												First off, this is a mobile to pc port. Which oddly enough is not as bad as it sounds. If I was playing the game on my tablet or phone I'd be impressed with the game. The graphics are not near as bad as some make them out to be.  It was actually quite a bit of fun to play. For the most part the game plays with a controller extremly well, you'd almost think the game was made to be played that way. The game makes saving very easy, it auto saves very often and has a button on the controller that even saves the game.Now for the bad:If your not careful you can clip through the floor.Hacking is extremely hard to do with a controller. No matter what I did it just a tiny bump on the joystick seemed to fly the cursor from one side of the screen to the other.It is a very short game, roughly three hours. You can't jump. Don't ask me why but any 3d game where you can't jump just drives me crazy.I would still recommend the game when it is on sale for under $3. Full price is asking a bit too much for it though.			"

												Meh!Let me start by saying that, yes, I knew this was a PC version of a game that was originally made for mobile/tablet so I lowered my expectations before even playing it.  I'm a huge fan of all three Deus Ex games (The Conspiracy, Human Revolution, and...yes, even Invisible War).  But seriously, Deus Ex: The Fall is just WEAK.  They did a crappy job porting it to PC -- you can't even re-map the keys for crying out loud!  I mean, really?!?  They ported it to PC, a platform where most of the players will be using a mouse and keyboard...and they didn't include the ability to re-map the keys?  Lame!  Not to mention that the game play is a severely dumbed down version (yes, I know it's a mobile port...but it's THAT bad) of Human Revolution's game mechanics.  The graphics look like it's a game from 1999.  Oh, and the game is buggy...If the game was $2.50 I might be less annoyed, but $10?!?  Jeez!  Ok, well, you get the idea.P.S. Oh, and one more thing: From the part I've played so far, the game seems to be based on the novel ""Deus Ex: The Icarus Effect"" by James Swallow.  So if you're like me and enjoy the storylines of the Deus Ex games as much as the gameplay, then you can spend your $10 on a really good book instead of this crappy game.			"

												Preliminary Analysis Before the actual Review. (review available, scroll down.)Alright, in the hour or so that i have played the game there are already several problems with it. Namely with the controls and the somewhat buggy nature of the porting. Several of the games options are limited, some, like the Mouse Sensitivity. Seem to work in rather ""spaztic"" Patterns, being mostly unresponsive at times and then suddenly going all over the place. Keybindings cannot be modified, atleast not from the options menu, i need to take a look if there is an .INI-File that can be altered to improve some of these problems. FOV changes cannot be made in the options menu, which may cause some problems for people who are suffering from the seasickness like effect playing in too low FOV might cause.With these observations, in the first hour, i really cannot recommend this game yet. I need to play it through to make a proper review. I hope this brings to light some of the problems this game suffers from.Proper Review will follow...and now the review... (which is not really a review rather an extremely lengthy bug-report.)(which i had to redo, since Steam did not understand to open the screenshots in a different window.)Deus Ex: The Fall.Argh... This game.. While not a total pile of w*nk, it does not live to its name very well. This might be because of its shortness and buggy nature, which are the most notable things in the reviews on STEAM. While i did enjoy the game for what it was, a spinoff story add-on for DE:HR which ties in some of the characters from the first Deus Ex. It still felt.. Dissappointing. I know that that isn't the best of explanations, but let me try...As said in the Preliminary Analysis, the game is buggy as all hell. Although i suspect this being mostly due to the bad porting to PC, to make a note, i haven't played the IOS-Version, so i cannot say if the bugs were there from the beginning. This review just covers what i know and have seen during the one playthrough i did for this review. But after that derail..The bugs in this game are mostly centered around controls and graphics, both being equally noticable and annoying. Let's start with the graphical glitches.Multiple times i have seen the screen tear parts of the backround while the camera is in a certain angle, this being mostly prevelant during takedowns. Not being able to see stuff that falls onto the ground because they clip through and come invisible, i should recommend using the ""Object Highlights""-Option to make it better for you, although annoying, it shows the stuff you can interact with (mostly). Few times after loading a level, i had half of the options menu show up, i cannot properly explain it so..


Squenix ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it, test your sh*t properly.. 
A Screenshot of Deus Ex: The Fall
By: Valtheknight




Control issues, ironically enough. Are mostly centered at the ""Full Mouse & Keyboard control scheme"". One of the said ""Pc Steamwork optimizations"", yes. i hope that you are reading this in the ironic tone it deserves, since it is just... GARGH!Mouse & Keyboard, (atleast by me) is not recommended. since the game has someform of dementia, when it comes to mouse sensitivity. It being unresponsive most of the time, but sometimes when you load in another level, it goes all over the place. Most notable bug that i had playing with the mouse, was that out of nowhere it would change the position of the character. Just like that, i ended up banging my head into walls more than i did when i tried on my granmas glasses when i was a kid.The camera just goes spaztic, pointing randomly in totally different directions than you were facing and unless you have proper reaction-time to notice that, it will result in cheap deaths.The game is somewhat playable with a 360-controller, i say somewhat since in doesn't work properly wth the hacking minigame, being extremely sensitive and going all over the place with the cursor. Oh and don't even ask how bad the hacking was with the mouse, it didn't even scroll the panel with it, nor the keyboard for that matter. The only way to scroll the oanel when hacking was to use the controller to pan the view and use the mouse press the buttons.... (I don't even...)""Adjusted Artificial intelligence"".. Basically meaning that they are in the middle-ground between Deus Ex and Human Revolution, being mostly oblivious unless you stand in their cone of vision for more than two seconds. And when they do see you.. they dont even come to find you in numbers, only single soldiers will randomly charge at you, with no warning. They just slide of cover whip past you and empty a shotgun into your rear.Those are mostly the things i see that are faulty and/or buggy and need fixing.Oh, and i did take a look at the installation folder. No settings files to speak of. Might be because the game runs in Unity-Engine, but people would like to have options for tweaking some of the controls.And above all those bugs & problems, the game is very short. My current playtime is about 7-Hours, but this is with one re-start, going non-lethal and exploring everything. Other people most likely will blast through it in about.. Hour and a half or less. And the thing that bugs me, is that its an episodic game. Which is explained nowhere on the store-page. EPISODIC, are you kidding ?I know that people are fans of TellTale the master if episodic content, but not everything needs to copy them... I'm now trying to remember any other good spinoff title that, although short felt rewarding at the end. I can only think of Duty Calls, the parody/demo-piece for Bulletstorm. And that is not the best of comparisons i know, but that is the only good one i can think of the top of my head.I would have been a lot happier with a full game and i'm sure that many other people would have been too.I think i have ranted enough, this is giving me a headache.The Fall can just keep falling, catch it on your own risk. Just make sure you have appropriate painkillers and liqour available.Oh i just remembered, the trading cards are taken from inside the game, The office one, is one of the screenshots in the store-page. So yeah.. LAZYNESS!!!			"

												I never thought I'd give a negative review to a Deus Ex game but The Fall is terrible! I played Human Revolution first by accident, and all the flaws in The Fall have been fixed there so seeing things that are so familiar, but just don't work, is very disorienting. The Fall even looks incredibly like HR, but nothing works like it does in HR. Don't waste your time with The Fall, move straight on to the vastly superior Human Revolution!I'm going to just list the problems:- There are no separate save games!! Seriously, there is a single save and if it auto-saves after you saved manually, well, tough cookies for you.- One power cell that recharges - that's enough to take down a single person.- The inventory is a disaster - not only is it not an actual inventory with space allocation, your inventory shares space with a shop where you can just buy stuff, instead of finding it in the world. Very confusing and sometimes you pick up an item but it doesn't seem to be available in your inventory. One of the most thought-provoking things in Deus Ex was always figuring out what to keep and what to drop, to make the best use of your limited inventory space. A wrong choice spelled disaster. Being able to just buy anything, with apparently unlimited space, just sucks the fun out of the entire concept. It's a jumble of what you actually have and what you can buy.- Control allocation - I've been playing for 5 hours and I still have no idea how to access half the so-called shortcuts. The original Deus Ex introduced the easy-to-use 1 through 0 button allocation where you could drag weapons etc into the slots accordingly. If it ain't broke, don't fix it! They removed something that was incredibly simple to use and replaced it with confusing nonsense. Half the time I'm lucky to find the right gun.- Wow, the tutorials are appallingly bad. Not only are they delivered in this grim monotone, you get a single blurry picture to explain how to do whatever. In the beginning, the game actually freezes until you follow the instruction... if you can figure out what it actually wants you to do!- Whether you kill or knock unconscious, bodies disintegrate. No bodies to alarm guards that must be disposed of, they just disappear. Which is linked to the ridiculously bad AI which decides you've left the area, even if the guards saw you twenty seconds ago, hiding behind a wall.- You can't jump or throw things. Seriously, not at all. It sucks.- The zones are tiny and terrible which require multiple area transitions to get anywhere - not even exaggerating, at least 4 to go anywhere.- Hacking consoles (at least 80% of them) cannot zoom out correctly, so you can't hack it because you can't even see the nodes!- The character of Ben is just terrible, and Anna is actually worse. The story's thin and not remotely interesting.- Final nail in the coffin - took 7 hours to complete AND ended on 'To Be Continued'. What a waste of time.This game basically took everything that worked perfectly and threw it all out the window... and everything they changed gets changed back for Human Revolution, and then gets improved.I may as well finish it since I paid for it, but it is incredibly bad. Seriously, stop reading this and go play Human Revolution instead, it's really great.			"

												Another game that I long put off buying because the mass of negative reviews, but which is actually a pretty good game.It isn't the best game - it has it's share of flaws - but it's good.It's a port of a mobile game, so it has all the clunky baggage that you'd expect-The graphics are not up to the same standard as Human Revolution's.The VOs are of varying quality, with only the main character's dialogue sounding natural with any consistency.The controls are substandard, lacking a jump function, the ability the remap keys, and with loose enough precision that attempting to pick up an object near a person is more likely to make them talk than pick up the object on the first few attempts. Trying to navigate the menus is probably the biggest problem, as most buttons require several clicks before they'll register your interest in seeing their menu's contentsThe game itself is very short for an FPS RPG; I completed it in about six hours, and I'm the sort of person who doesn't think speedrunners understand how to enjoy a game, so it's probably possible to complete it in half that time.If you're expecting a triple-A game, Deus Ex: Human Revolution 1.5, move along - this is not that.That said, and keeping it in mind, it really is a decent game.The story - which, admittedly, is only part 1 of an unknown number of parts, and which might never be continued - is fairly compelling. Unlike Adam Jenson, Ben Saxon - the main character in this game - finds himself embroiled in the struggle against The Conspiracy, not because he's seeking revenge against those who, he thinks, killed his ex, but because he came across an injustice that he was unwilling to walk past. Your first objective outside of the tutorial is basic cyberpunk grocery shopping - you're just trying to get adequate access to healthcare, to keep your body from rejecting its augmentations - and once you've done that, you have no compelling personal reason to keep fighting. In fact, you have a compelling personal reason not to in that you're in hiding, on the run from the Tyrants - the antagonist squad from DX:HR. The driving force behind getting involved beyond that point is just the protagonist's social conscience. I know we're living in an era when having a social conscience is seen by many as a sign that you're some kind of deviant, driven by prejudice against white people, or men, or the richest members of society, etc. but, personally, I find it admirable.The economy is slightly stripped down, in that you can't sell any of items in your inventory that you may not wish to use, restricting your balance to those credits found in the world or earned through missions, and you buy new items through a menu screen, rather than going to any particular shop. At the same time, it is also expanded in other ways, giving you a greater variety of weapons than you have in Human Revolution. To be fair, the new weapons are basically just reskins with altered stats, but they're different enough to justify their existence. There are also bundles available, giving you the ability to buy a number of items at a lower overall price. I'm pretty sure this is a result of the original version being a mobile app, but, while I'm not a fan of in-app purchases, I actually don't mind this when it's in-game money that you're spending.The inventory is entirely abstracted. As long as you have the credits, you can have every item in the game in your posession and not have to worry about space or weight requirements - what presence the inventory has is in the in-game store, reduced to an item being owned or available for purchase, and number of owned consumables. The RPGer in me finds that irritating, because, while I don't mind the idea that you could own all of them and keep them somewhere secure, I'm not wild on the idea that you'd be able to carry your entire arsenal with you everywhere you go.The actual gameplay is pretty decent. The levels are pretty easily navigable, and have several available paths around them, allowing for frontal assaults, stealth, or hit and run tactics in combat zones. Gunplay feels fine for my play style, although seemingly restricted to reticle aiming, with the ability to aim down the sights being limited to scoped weapons. Hacking is essentially the same as in Human Revolution. AI isn't perfect, but enemies are reasonably smart, backing away from grenades, moving to flank you when they're alerted to your position.If you buy this expecting a triple-A experience, you will be disappointed, but, as mobile games go, this is a good one. It's worth playing.			"

												Pros:The story isn't bad (what little of it you get to experience)Cons:Crappy controlsCrappy interfaceHalf the weapons that were in Human Revolution, but they added some pretty recolors of the weapons they have!!Graphics are garbage, half of the NPCs look like they belong in AvatarOne (1, uno) save file to play withSwitching between weapons, consumeables, and augs is more complicated than it should beMost of the augs are useless, especially since the game is so shortThe armor aug now has to be activatedSometimes you can't pick up items because NPCs are too close to them, and your character would rather talk to them than pick up the itemHaving to confirm when you want to go from area to area can be annoyingThe setting is kind of blahClicking on something with the mouse (keypads, menus, etc.) only registered about 50% of the time.Bodies disappear after a few seconds of either killing or knocking them out, making clearing out a room of enemies trivial because they'll never see their dead comradesno jumping seems kind of dumbOverall, I think this game should've stayed on the mobile platform because it's a really disappointing port.

												You might've heard some things about this game and they were all bad. I'm here to tell you they were all true, too. You thought Invisible War was bad (I didn't, but I digress)? This is like three orders of magnitude worse.As a sidenote... blaming testers for the presence of bugs is often unfair. Bugs being found is absolutely not equal to them being fixed. Assigning resources to fixing bugs is a financial decision, and not at all as obvious to the suits as it might be to gamers.As for the actual design of the game, the fact that someone looked at this and thought ""yes, this is okay""... I have nothing to say in defence of that. Duh. It was passable as a mobile game (as it was initially intended), but bringing it to Steam was a bad idea, and at that price...			"

												The game is fairly broken. Most of your clicks won't really register when firing a weapon or selecting something. That might get patched later on. There are also some clipping issues, and I have even fallen through the floor once.Other than that, the game looks really ugly for a PC game. The animations are really amateur at best. Worst of all are the characrer models. While Ben and some other major NPC models look okay, the citizen models somehow look even worse than the character models in the original Deus Ex, which was released 14 years ago. Their eyes are really wide open, and most of them don't really have lip-syncing, so their jaws just kinda move up and down. On the upside, the game runs at a pretty astounding framerate.Keys cannot be rebinded. Seriously, why do developers still think it is okay to not have rebindable keys?You also cannot jump. You can only vault over objects when the game lets you. I'll admit, it actually is kind of a nice feature, but it doesn't justify not being able to jump.The tutorial treats you like a complete idiot as well. Those looking for the typical Deus Ex experience are going to find it dumbed down to the point where inventory management is no issue, since you can buy stuff at any time for in-game money.The story is still okay. It's a pretty much what you would expect. It works pretty much like in Human Revolution, where you could take side-quests along with the main objective. One part I sort of liked was a side-quest where a cop wants you to rat out a fellow doctor who was helping you out. You can go ahead and do that, or you can warn the doctor that the cops are after him. I don't think this has any sort of consequences yet, but it was a nice moment nonetheless.As far as gameplay, the maps are really small with lots of loading segments. There is still some good level design, like using vents to get around enemies, so if you can get past everything else being rubbish, you might still squeeze out a little enjoyment. However, people who choose to kill rather than render unconcious are going to find themselves at an extreme disadvantage. Bodies sort of ""evaporate"" after being on the ground for a few seconds. Since KO-ing people gives more experience, and they will go away anyway, the only reason to use lethal takedowns is to see those cool looking armblades. Human Revolution had this problem as well, but it was less so of a problem since enemies could revive unconcious enemies.The game is still going to be updated with more story, since it currently ends on a cliffhanger. Realize that if you buy it now, you'll still have to wait for the full game.Only buy this if you really, really, really want more from the Deus Ex universe.			"

												Is it a terrible port? Yes!Is it a really bad example of what the game engine is capable of? Yes!Is the story shallow and makes little sense in general? Yes!Did I still enjoy playing through this very short interlude of a Deus Ex game? You bet! Thumbs up then.Don't pay too much for it though. I bought it for 2 €, which I feel is a reasonable price.

												If you liked the deus ex games and do not want your view of them to be ruined do not purchase this. The lack of pc options is terrible, the controls feel lackluster, there is no way to change keybinds, the only graphics options you can change is the anti aliasing and the resolution. The story and charachters all feel dull and robotic. The amount of pop ups is ridiculous. Invisible walls block your progress until the game decides it wants you to go somewhere. The in game store ruins any sense of challenge. Steer clear of this game!			"

												Not RecommendedAs huge Deus Ex fan (way back since first game was released), I can't recommend this game. Please don't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t me and start saying this is a mobile game port so cut it some slack. NO!, they shouldn't have bothered porting it to begin with.This port is terrible, the gameplay is dull, the clicking in this game is awful (you have to click like 5-6 time on anything like menus, weapon store, etc... for the game to respond), just right when the story really starts getting interesting, a black screen pops up saying ""To Be Continued"". This is like a middle finger to Deus Ex fans from Eidos Montreal and their s**t hole of a publisher, Square Enix.Lol, the free verion of the original Deus Ex: GOTY Edition that you get if you've pre-ordered the game is a far better game than The Fall.I won't pay a single penny for the second part of the story, $10 for this crap ? seriously ??? why you didn't give this to Nixxes to work on it ? look at the awsome PC ports they did for Tomb Raider, and Deus Ex: HR			"

												Deus Ex: The Fall is a prequel to Deus Ex: Human Revolution, an amazing game. It has the same setting like HR and does an admirable job at the dystopian cyberpunk the series is known for. Unfortunately this is only a port from iOS and that effects on the gameplay. StoryYou play as Ben Saxon who is trying to find the truth behind the drug conspiracy because they are very rare and all people with augmentations need them. He was betrayed from his employer, a private Military – the tyrants. Now his life and all augmented people are in danger. The story part is nothing much and not really deep. GameplayThe gameplay is the same as in Deus Ex: HR, Ben Saxon has the same augments and abilities as Adam Jensen. You need to hack objects like locked door, are able to do takedowns, crawl through vents and shoot form cover. Next to the Main missions you can talk to NPC’s and maybe they give you a side mission and/or explore the world. You upgrade your augmentations and weapons while you playing stealth or kill anyone.As I said, this is a port from a tablet and this is a big problem. On the tablet it’s nice to play this game but the controls on a PC are terrible. They are clunky, unresponsive and the combat from cover is useless. What is very annoying is the fact, that bodies disable after a few seconds and you have many loading times. Just a terrible port.By the way there is an ingame store which allows you to buy ammo and gear every time. That’s unrealistic and too easy. You can shoot all enemies down like Rambo, you only need enough money.Graphic/SoundFor a mobile game its impressive but on the PC it’s not very well, it looks often very ugly. The textures look a bit weak but with the lights and shadows it’s okay. The User Interface is without a Touchscreen just terrible. It’s so annoying and uncomfortable to navigate with mouse and keyboard in Deus Ex: The Fall.The best part of the game is the Soundtrack form Michael McCann which create the amazing Soundtrack for Human Revolution. The voice acting is okay but nothing special.Deus Ex: The Fall on Steam is for fans only. If you like Human Revolution, you can try it but don’t expect a game like this. It's not a bad game but I can't recommend it, it has too much negative points. It’s a game for tablets and not for the PC, note that. If you are a hardcore fan of the franchise, than go for it. If you are not, don’t buy it. No matter what you are, wait for a sale or buy it in a key store. Don’t buy this for the full price, it’s not worth it, also not as a hardcore fan. "

												This is one of the rare cases in which I wish Steam had a ""maybe"" option for reviews, because whether or not you'll like this game depends on how much you pay for it and how much you're willing to overlook its undeniable flaws. I decided to give this a slight ""thumbs up"" because, let's face it, this game's page is already plastered with thumbs downs, and there are a few things to like about this game.tl;dr version+ Comprehensible plot+ Well-detailed environments+ Lots of exploration and breaking into places+ Sidequests and nooks & crannies to explore+ Consistently goes on sale for cheap- Laggy, unresponsive controls and interface- Idiotic AI- Abrupt and unsatisfying ending- Little to no graphical upgrades- Slight confusion if you haven't read the tie-in novel firstTime to expand on this a bit. I'll start with the stuff I didn't like, and the biggest thing had to be the game's pacing. There's not really a climax or falling action. You get about 3-6 hours of playtime depending on how much you obsessively-compulsively comb through the game's environments, but since this game is intended to be a multi-part experience, everything wraps up just as you start to become a badass. This is a pet peeve of mine. It is incredibly irritating to see developers interpreting ""episodic"" as ""we can just phone in Part 1, because technically we're not done making the game!""The other thing I disliked was the controls and the interface. They make it obvious that this was a straight port from touchscreen-based interfaces. I'm sure the big boxes and long-presses work perfectly for a buttonless interface, but now that we have a mouse, let alone a keyboard, there's no reason for the controls to be as ridiculously compact as they are. This compartmentalization isn't ""bad,"" per se, but it feels unnecessary when you have a wider range of input to work with. There's also the fact that the UI is SO sluggish. Clicking on certain buttons in the menu will sometimes work, or they'll require 3 or 4 presses. In-game actions such as taking things becomes frustrating when it's bunched up next to two other interactable objects, as the game doesn't have crosshairs and just kind of ""guesses"" at which object you want to use. I also found takedowns in this game to be unresponsive as well. It's hardly ever worth it to long-press for a lethal takedown, because it's a dice toss as to whether or not it'll work, and even a simple key press for the non-lethal takedown may or may not work. It's very frustrating, but it personally didn't break the game for me. YMMV, however.The rest of the items I listed above as negatives are subjective in that they may or may not break your experience. The enemies are low-poly Helen Kellers with a field of vision the size and length of cardboard tubes, but I was able to overlook it because it meant I could get away with some ridiculously funny shenanigans. The textures are blurry and the polygon counts are low, but I felt like the game made up for it with detailed environments (clutter, large spaces, that sort of thing). I do wish they could have at least improved the visuals, though. The only thing I didn't like about the visuals were the facial animations in dialogue scenes. The mouth movements are okay, and nothing comes across as too lazy or too uncanny valley, except for the eyes. They're not animated in the slightest, so characters have a dead stare if their heads aren't pointed in the right direction. If you've ever wanted to experience what it's like to talk to someone with Autism, this game is your answer.So, let's talk about the positives. As mentioned before, this game gets pretty cheap during sales. I can't remember the price I bought it at, but I think that anywhere between $1 to $3 is the perfect asking price. Don't buy this game at $10 or you're robbing yourself.The thing I like the most about this game is, well, the fact that it's Deus Ex. It's not ""kinda"" Deus Ex. It's not ""stripped down"" Deus Ex. You've got your air vents, your stealth options, your delicious cover system, your alternate routes, your goodies to read, your levelling up systems, and so on. Sure, you can't jump or throw stuff, there are some visual shortcuts scattered about, and bodies disintegrate after you lay down some augmented justice, but these never really get in the way of you enjoying the game.Deus Ex is about exploring a futuristic dystopia, going to places you shouldn't be and mopping the floor with bad guys in ways that feel emergent and satisfying. The fact that this game still manages to feel like Deus Ex despite being designed for vastly-underpowered and input-limited devices is an accolade in and of itself. And look at it this way--if for some reason you game on a netbook or a budget computer, this game is gonna run just fine.So yes, this game has problems, and if they're a dealbreaker for you, then it's totally understandable. But if you can get this game for cheap enough and know what to expect from it, you'll have a good time. Here's to hoping they make a part 2 to this after Mankind Divided comes out.			"

												I had heard that this was just a crappy port of a mobile game. But I loved Human Revolution fiercely, and I figured that most of the reviews were just pessimistic and the game couldn't be that bad.Nope, I was wrong, the reviews were right. Everything from the graphics to the controls to the story and dialogue is worse here. The world is incredibly limited and the whole game feels narrow and linear. And something is seriously off about the perspective angle. I never feel motion sick when playing games but here's a warning: this is the only game in my entire life that has given me motion sickness.This is not the hub-city quasi-open world, carefully directed and balanced game I was hoping for. Some of the elements are there, but really most of what this game has in common with Human Revolution is the name and yellow coloring.			"

												Deus Ex: The Fall presents the minimum amount of effort required to port a game to the PC and even if it were on its native mobile platform stands as an awful example of a game in general. From the monotone forced tutorial explaining WASD to the ability of the player character to spawn weapons and items from the ether, there is no example of this game having any concept of the Deus Ex audience. Not to mention the graphical quality that would embarass a developer on the Playstation 2.Don't buy this. If you get this for free, don't bother installing it. Time spent playing this is better spent reading the synopsis of the story. The worst part is that if this game had been made as an expansion to the original Human Revolution in the same engine and a little effort this could have been massively popular.But I'm not sure why I'm noting any of this. You are already aware that this game is an immense waste of the license and any talent involved in its creation.			"

PresentationDeus Ex: The Fall started as a mobile game back in 2013, exclusive to iOS, implementing touch screen controls and mechanics that fit a first person shooter well enough to be entertaining on a phone or tablet, but it was never meant to be played with a mouse and keyboard. The later Android version offered the same experience, and with a great success on the mobile market, it wasn't long before a PC version was announced, a version that comes with almost no improvements, which for a PC title end up close to a catastrophe. You play as Ben Saxon, ex-military at Belltower who ended up joining a secret squad known as the Tyrants, with the mission of keeping balance between organizations and eliminating possible threats. It won't be long until Saxon will realize that most of the things that the Tyrants told him were lies and soon enough his departure from the team will put him on the most wanted list, forcing him to go into hiding. The adventure begins when Saxon and his partner Anna run out of Neuropozyne, a drug used to prevent Neuroprosthesis, a build-up of scar tissue that blocks electrical signals between augmentation electrodes and human tissue, making any augmented human being unable to live without it. The whole plot rattles around Saxon's search for Neuropozyne, following gang leaders and completing different tasks for people who might be able to supply them with Neuropozyne in exchange. Even though all those details will be unravelled in the first five to ten minutes of the game, that pretty much sums up the entire story, as it is a short one to begin with, taking no more than three hours to complete, and even worse than that when it does get to a point where it seems like its action will change and the story will move on to the next plot point, it just ends, leaving you with a true sense of disappointment as if you accomplished nothing.Rating: 4GameplayAs mentioned before, this was originally a mobile game, and in that environment it would play decently; on the big screen however, things change as almost no improvements have been made to adapt this title for a keyboard and mouse control scheme. The movement is pretty much limited to what a phone or tablet can offer, and there is even the lack of a jump button, even though this version clearly needed one. Navigating through the menus is a nightmare, as it was meant to work under swipe movements, now having to use the mouse in order to drag the menu items and get where you want, and even worse than that there are no shortcuts for important things you might want to access more frequently such as your Augmentations or your Inventory; instead the game uses the Esc key to open up an enormous menu and letting you choose what you want to do from there whether it's a simple Save command or upgrading one of your weapons, which proves to be difficult to do at times. This rushed port of touch screen mechanics makes your life even harder when it comes to things such as hacking, where you might not be able to move the screen to the point where you want it to be at all, making it challenging to solve the hack or just forcing you to spend your credits on an autohack just so you can move onward with the game. The cover mechanic is just as bad, refusing to work properly at times, making it hard to switch cover and make your way past some guards undetected, but since the AI is almost absent that is the least of your worries. On top of the terrible AI that allows you to take multiple enemies in a row down with a melee attack as long as you time it right, there is a long list of bugs and glitches that came with the port, starting with unreachable items and ending with the fact that I inexplicably fell through the map more than once by doing nothing apart from following the instructions.Rating: 2.5GraphicsThis is just an upscaled version of a mobile game, which makes it a terrible looking game on the big screen, as the graphics seem outdated by an entire generation. On top of that we have the horrible animations, almost non-existent lip sync and facial animations of such detail you'd think this game was released on the N64. The visual effects are basic and even though they don't stand out as horrible since everything around them looks just as bad, they are still part of the same engine that looks outdated by a decade.Rating: 2.5AudioThe voice acting is a really bad joke, as it lacks basic concepts such pitch and tonality, and sometimes it will switch volume inexplicably, probably to wake you up because everything that comes out of a character's mouth is so boring and pointless. The dialogue is just as badly written, and for some reason subtitles kept disappearing from time to time, even though the character was still talking right in front of me.Rating: 2ExtrasOne simple playthrough can be completed in roughly three to four hours, add two more if you're staying for all the side quests and achievements, and since there is a New Game+ mode you can replay the entire game without starting all over again if you've missed some achievements on your first playthrough, but even with that in mind, there's isn't much else to do around a second time.Rating: 4.5VerdictDeus Ex: The Fall was a pretty bad game to begin with, but on the small screen of a phone or a tablet it somehow seemed bearable and the actually working touch screen mechanics made it fun to play despite all its other flaws, but on PC that simply isn't the case as those flaws are still there and on top of that, the gameplay mechanics are not optimized to work on a mouse and keyboard, and sometimes not even optimized to work at all.Rating Overall: 3.1Check out the full review and a lot more about Deus Ex: The Fall at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=332 "

												Possibly the most patronisingly easy game I've ever played. This is without a doubt due to it being originally only on iOS devices, but now that it is on PC, it is now exempt from such considerations and has to be judged on its own merits. Things don't look too good.Combat is almost a direct port of what was in Human Revolution, although much stiffer. There is no jump button, and no separate zoom button, you must now hold down the fire button to zoom in, letting go to fire off a shot. Selecting which grenade you want can be a bit of a hassle, where you are required to press in the mouse wheel and scroll down to whatever you want while still holding down the wheel. Not exactly comfortable.I made my way through the game without killing anyone, just using the stun gun and non-lethal takedowns. The only time I used any other primary weapon was when I bought a crossbow to use in the last room of the game. I bought this through a disembodied store which you can access at any time through the menu. There are no in-world merchants.There are only a handful of character models in the game that look good, including the main character. The rest look like claymations, both in texture and movement. Most of the music is reused from Human Revolution, so it's still great, but there is nothing really new here.The only real positive aspects of the game are it's environments, which look fantastic, and the story, which adds quite a bit to the lore of Deus Ex. That's it.Deus Ex: The Fall is short, took me 5 hours to complete it, including all of the side-quests. And the game ends on a cliffhanger with the promise of continuation through DLC. Only play this if you want to learn more of the world of Deus Ex, otherwise avoid it.			"

												I've been a huge fan of the Deus Ex universe ever since I played the original when it first came out. Unfortunately, this game does not live up to the legacy of its forebears.Deus Ex: The Fall retains the stylized golden appearance of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. I quite liked HR's art syle, which set it apart from the common browns and blacks of both the older Deus Ex games and so many others in the first person space. So, The Fall gets points for at least staying true to the style of HR. However, since this is a port to PC from an iOS/Android game, the graphics are severely lacking, even when compared with games several years old, such as HR.The mechanics of The Fall are significantly different from HR. Egregiously, your character cannot jump. The game has only a single ""save slot"" which is overwritten by every quicksave or even when changing areas. Controls are awkward at best, given that they cannot be remapped and the ""quickslot"" system is anything but quick. These limitations make sense for a mobile game. However, it's quite jaring when compared to other PC games, or even ports to PC from console (such has HR).Furthermore, aiming is simply awkward. For example, aiming a weapon with a scope without firing seems to be impossible. A single button controls both. Press and hold to aim, release to fire. The non-scoped weapons are only slightly easier to use. Gone are the ""iron sights"" aiming of HR.Other than by-design limitations of the game, it is also unfortunate that The Fall also riddled with bugs. The most glaring is that any system with more than stereo speakers is completely broken. Music consistently plays, but all other sounds drop out at random, taking captions along for the ride! There is a work-around: in Window's Sound settings, change your speakers back to simple stereo (from 5.1, 7.1, etc).More minor bugs abound, such as achievements that are listed as completed in-game but not in Steam. One must activate an ability, consume an item, or change areas in order to trigger the acheivement. While this is a minor annoyance, it illustrates the lack of effort put into the port. Since the game knows the achievement unlocked, it's inexcusable for the Steam unlock to be lagging.Not all is bad. The ""spirit"" of Deus Ex is present in that most missions can be completed in multiple ways. I suspect that shooting enthusiasts will be disappointed, but non-lethal stealth is quite possible. Oddly enough, bodies auto-disapear instead of sticking around to alert your enemies. This makes ""stealth"" almost trivial.			"

												Right so here we have a new game in the Dues Ex franchise. I thought: Awesome! I love Deus Ex! but after playing I felt hugely let down.What’s wrong?While Deus Ex: Human Revolution ran in the unreal engine, Deus Ex: The Fall runs on the Unity engine.You notice this straight away with the in game cinematic, models are lower resolution and that’s just the start of the problems I've noticed. You have a tutorial in game. but when I got my first aug upgrade kit I went straight away for cloaking. the next minute I came up to a laser detection gate. and it fired off a mandatory tutorial thingy. telling me to buy the cloak. Ok... I already bought it. and I don't have any more kits for it... how do I leave this tutorial BS or turn it off? answer: You can’t. and to ALT+F4 out to start a new game.another run through, bought plenty of ammo, then at a point prior to the laser gates I encountered my first patrol bot. up came a tutorial on how to buy an EMP grenade. 1 grenade, 250 credits. I only had 100. couldn't buy the damn emp grenade. how did I get out of these stupid tutorials? Oh right ALT+F4.More technical problemsOk so game play is♥♥♥♥♥♥when you can’t turn off the Tutorials. Mind you this isn't the first Deus Ex Game I've played and not much has changed apart from being able to buy equipment in mission. But here are the bugs in the game.Sound: Half of the time the game assets aren't loaded. so the sound of a hostile screaming bloody fire and murder doesn't play. only indication that you've been detected is that little ""detected"" notice that pops up in the lower left of the screen. something where you aren't even focused on.Likewise weapon reports don't play. bug honking SMG firing. 30 grounds in the mag. Did a Mag dump to see when the game would pick up the slack. only heard gunshots for the last 5. Now you'd think that: ""Ok It finally loaded the gun sound assets, now I should hear a gunshot on the first shot of the new mag"" That’s a big fat ""NO"" again it wouldn't play the sound on the second mag dump except for the last 5.movement: if you are familiar with Deus Ex, any Deus Ex then you just know how much you'll be using your leg wagon to cart your rear end around in the world. Deus Ex: The Fall is no different. But moving around is often jittery like you’re playing multiplayer and there is a tiny intermittent lag spike. Not enough to cause real problems but it’s annoying enough to get on your nerves. walking forward for a bit and then you jump a tiny bit ahead while moving as your connection to the server picks back up and the server says ""No you aren't at Coordinate 214X663 you are at 218X663."" Yep enough to be annoying, not enough to be a serious problem. Well actually it is a problem as I can’t begin the count the amount of times I move a little bit too far and out of cover just enough for NPC's to spot me while doing stealth. or that one mine you need to disarm.look and feel:I was impressed with Deus Ex Human Revolution, how realistic it all looked and high detail. I had hoped that Deus Ex: The Fall would be up to par but even that you can’t expect from this game. I don't know why they choose to start using Unity instead of the faithful Unreal Engine. but the results are apparent. So far it looks to me that Deus Ex: The Fall plays like a 480P game instead of the 1080P experience we got from Human Revolution.Recommendation for others interested in buying this game:I love Deus Ex, any Deus Ex. And I bought it for that reason. But if I could get my 10 euro's back from steam I would have asked for that Refund. This game plays more like a playable Early access instead of a full game with all the problems it has.Final Recommendation: Don't Buy It! "

												I'm a Deus Ex addict, love the series from the very start along with all the great mods that were created by talented gamers out there.  I bought this for $2.49 only because I wanted to know the story.  All the negative reviews people are writing about this game are true! LOL  It's buggy as sh*t!There are some serious bugs.  For example the sound cuts out during dialog, also during fights or during stealth moves which can cause you to get detected because you don't get the warning sounds, and so on basically the sounds can't be depended on.  Oh and there were some cut scenes where the dialog wasn't in text, and there was no audio so I had no clue what was said in that part of the story! Actually the dialog disappearing happened a lot so be prepared for a few huh?? moments! Whatever anyone else mentioned in the long list of negative reviews for bugs I'm sure they are well described by others who have played this game, so I won't repeat them.There are things also lacking you don't have full controls like you do in Human Revolution, this is a very scalled back version of controls obviously for a mobile device.  No lifting crates, and little details like that, etc.  Also you CAN'T remap keys.  HOWEVER GlovePIE works very well with this game and allows you to use whatever keyboard configuration you are most comfortable with.  I am a keyboard and mouse user, so I won't speak for the gamepad controls... I attempted to use my Logitech gamepad but meh... much preferred using the keyboard and mouse with GlovePIE running.For the one big positive that made it not a total loss .... I was enjoying the story line.  Kudos for the writing! I was getting into the story then BAM.. it ends! WTF?!?! It's only part 1, it doesn't say that in the overview anywhere I saw!?!?!  So you play through chapter 1 and then you get a stay tuned and the credits!  I was like WTF??!! I'm left wondering are they going to continue the story at all after the poor reviews and ratings this first part of the game had?  Would they continue the story line with a proper PC version and rebuild and repackage it like they did with DEHR Director's Cut?  Am I going to be forced to buy Part 2, Part 3 whatever and so on separately just to find out how the story ends?!?!  Hey will they just hand the addons to us poor suckers who bought this game in the first place?! LOL Well I'm left dangling at the edge of the unknown....BUY IT if you want a good story and will be satisfied without knowing how it ends! So I will recommend this game, because of the writing only... it's a good story line with interesting characters... and even though they cut the story off after the first chapter, leaving you hanging!  DON'T BUY IT if you can't tolerate some obvious bugs and glitches...it wasn't designed for PC... so buy at your own discretion or not or just hold out for a whole new release designed for PC (if you believe in miracles).EDIT: Thought of this after I posted and thought it was worth noting.  There is a store in your inventory, they eliminated vendor people in this game!  Also Their is no limit of storage in your inventory!  Drawback to the inventory store is I couldn't find a way to sell items for quick cash, for items I needed.  Also I miss the fact that without vendors to interact with you are missing out on some flavour of additional characters, and the feature of people vendors had where you could sell them your excess crap to stock up on mods and supplies quickly.  So it's much harder to make money quickly and limited to what you find on the people you knock out, and that is stashed in corners, etc. With no limit in my inventory and all the extra crap I picked up I could have sold a tons of stuff to buy more of those energy bar things, or praxis.  Kind of a waste of a store without a sell feature.			"

												I am a huge fan of the deus ex series when the game originally came out in 2001-2002, Since then i have been a loyal fan following the series right up till Deus Ex Human Revolution which i thought was a great come back for the series. So i thought the fall would keep that legacy going but alas its the worst game i have played in years! There are so many bugs i cannot begin to imagine, inventory system which is completely useless and unrealisitc. Combat system is even worse, a headshot isn't even a headshot, you have to kill them three times before they die in the head which makes no sense to me. One time i died because i crouched and tried to take an item and i fell through the map! When this australian character goes for cover, you can see still him over the cover, AI is just plain stupid! There is so much i want to say as a fan of the series, i think they need to apologize to the fans for making such a waste of a game, and make whatever dlcs they dare bring out for this game free to us.

												I was so excited to see a new Deus Ex title but I have had my hopes crushed into the ground, excreted and urinated and vomitted upon then kicked to death by this abhorrent piece of garbage that has no redeeming features whatsoever. Makes Takedown Brown Sabre look like an AAA title.  Nice going programmers, way to kill a franchise			"

												Can I get my money back? This game is terrible in every way. The graphics are awful, the controls are only minimally functional--and not remappable--the framerates are janky even on a very high-spec machine (i5 3570K, 24GB DDR3-1600 RAM, Geforce GTX 780), and the voice acting ranges from bad to painful. This is a very bad game, and I wish I hadn't bought it.			"

												My goodness...don't be deceived by the (currently) mostly negative 30% positive reviews.  Most of these were written by people who played Human Revolution and compared it to that-- or who dinged it for not being sufficiently complete or couldn't get past the fact that it has mobile origins.  Of course it's not going to be as good, or as complex, or as satisfying.  But for the price point, it gave me the opportunity to return to the Deus Ex world for a little augmented stealth fun while I wait for Mankind Divided.  It's basically a simplified, possibly even dumbed-down Deus Ex.  But it still the same world and *feels* like Deus Ex.So if you're looking for an HR experience, note the following differences:- No jumping or lifting!  But oddly, you get used to it.  You stop wanting to jump on every crate or move it to access a secret area and get your explorer XP.- No vendors.  You basically can buy anything anywhere just by going to a particular screen.  Yes, I'm sure that shows its mobile in-app purchase roots.  What this also means is no *selling*, so having to run around picking up and selling every gun for extra credits.- Infinite inventory.  Packrats rejoice.  Coupled with ""no vendors,"" you permanently have anything you pick up, unless you consume it.- Bodies disappear after a few seconds.  No having to drag them around the corner and hope they don't mysteriously switch to dead during your Pacifist play-through.- No boss fight!  Depending on what you thought of the boss fight (especially in the original DX:HR), you might consider this a good thing.Some of these changes may seem jarring.  It really is a dumbed down Deus Ex: HR, but that doesn't mean it's not fun.  As long as you go in knowing this, you can actually enjoy the game.  Because here are some things that *are* like DX:HR:- Play with stealth or with guns.- Lethal and non-lethal takedowns.- Hacking minigame almost the same- Rummaging through trash looking for credits or beer.  ;-)- Augs are a subset of DX:HR, but most are there.  Hacking, stealth, social enhancer, armor, cloak, aim stabilizer, etc.- Art style...graphics looked fine to me, not as good as DX:HR of course but still ""credible.""- Writing: main/side quests are in the same vein, as are NPC interactions and dialog trees.- Trading cards and achievements.  Easier to 100% than HR.So give it a shot if you're waiting for Mankind Divided's eventual deep discounts and price drops.			"

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 | *2* 3] = ~62% (50%-75%)This is a weak recommendation coming from someone who loves the Deus Ex franchise.You will get more exposure to the story around Deus Ex: Human Revolution (e.g. regarding the mercenaries). You can do stealthing, shooting, exploring the small world. The many weapons are supposedly interesting, but my one play-through was pacifist and used as little resources as possible, so I can't say from my own experience.That this was a mistake was surprisingly revealed to me after the 9 hours it took me to complete the game (HTLB[howlongtobeat.com] says 5-8 hours; I'm a passionate DX-player and therefore explore instead of focusing on the pursuit of the next goal). Just when I thought ""Ok, now the story will gain momentum."", that was actually the end. A very disappointing moment.The game has very low FOV, but this can supposedly be fixed[pcgamingwiki.com] with an external program.I liked the story, the character I was playing, and the experience overall even though it is seriously reduced from regular Deus Ex. I'm saying if you get the €10 game at a discount, fix the FOV, and reduce your Deus-Expectations, you will have a good time, it will be an enrichment of your accumulated DX franchise experiences. Therefore it's a recommendation.METASo, what about my new policy to thumbs-down anything, no matter how good it is, if the devs failed the FOV, like I did with DX:MD which deserves a 4of4 score? Well, the game is older (2014), and I didn't plan on retroactively changing my judgment based on my new policy.But most of all, I try to say the things that matter / things that have not been said (enough). This game has massively negative reviews, much(!) more negative than I believe it deserves.DX:MD will probably eventually reach ""mostly positive"" status once the bugs have been worked out, the relevance of the preorder bonus fraud (That's what it is.) has faded, and people have understood that DX:MD's built-in main-menu micro-transaction store for praxis kits, ammunition, etc. is something they won't need at all. Though I must say that the scarcity of crafting parts makes me quite a bit suspicious. This isn't alleviated by the fact that one of the DLCs (The ""Tactical Pack"", which is also part of the ""Season Pass"".) brings a new augmentation that allows to break down weapons into parts (e.g. 50 for a 10mm pistol). DX:MD will become a ""mostly positive""ly reviewed game, so I raise my voice with a thumbs down because how can they still not know how the primary interface works? That deserves punishment.DX:TF is stuck in the negatives, so if I want to contribute to the overall voices, my focus must be on the proper value, not on the (otherwise quite important) super baffling idiotic ignorance of the developers in regards to screen sizes / viewing distances. So, DX:MD thumbs-down, DX:TF thumbs-up. Sue me.			"

												In all honesty I enjoyed this game just because of the awesomeness that is the Deus Ex universe, however there are some things to note, it's an episodic game so it leaves off sort of abruptly, but really that's not that big of an issue the main things that need to be redone for this to score higher is the sound synchronization and some fps issues with tricky workarounds. Overall it runs ok, but not great or to the standards of a DX game in my opinion. I would definetly rate it much higher however after patches and fixes, but still it is just a tablet port so for that it's kinda decent. 6/10			"

												This game isn't as bad as everybody is making it seem. Sure if you expect a whole new game with upto 30+ hours of gameplay you are going to be dissapointed. The game isn't perfect and it has it's share of good and bad issues. Which I shall go into.The game runs smoothly at a pretty decent rate. (I have a plebtier PC) and there wasn't any framerates issues throughout the entire game. The game was smooth from start to finish.The HUD is pretty clean. It's got a few obvious touch screen elements that shouldn't really be there. Drop down menu's and a rather unusual ingame store (using ingame money). Overall the HUD is better than I've seen from other ports.The audio, the ingame music is pretty decent. Fairly similiar to Deus Ex:Human Revelution. It's very close to DXHR although it's not exactly the same. It's a very much welcome addition to somebody that enjoyed the soundtrack to Deus EX.The voice acting is so-so. It seems to fluctuate between the characters, depending on how important or the screentime they have, The main protagonist I feel has a decent amount of quality. However the training mission instructor is absoluetly terrible. She's rather dull and boring. Speaking with one tone. Just readling lines off of a script with absolutely no emotion what so ever.  However sometimes the audio in game skips and jumps. Sounds get repeated or the audio mutes itself for two seconds. I also personally found the ambient sounds to be annoying but that's just a niggle I have.The background music was also louder than everything else. I guess they wanted to cover up the bad voice acting. Luckily you can change that in the menu settings. The setting aren't great either to be honest. It's got audio setting and reset your data but there isn't one for brightness and this game really needs that. I was bumbling along for a bit in some places.The levels are split into short sections, this requires a lot of loading, luckily the loading only takes a few seconds but it all adds up. It could've been better but at least it's short.The cutscenes are pausable which I haven't seen too often in games, so it's good that you are able to pause the game and it's slightly difficult to accidentally skip the cutscene if you want to resume the game. The orange glow used for items and 'hints' are still visible in the cutscenes which is really distracting and I personally find it annoying. You maybe able to overlook it though.Unless you turn the Autosave feature off. Due to the fact that there is only one save slot that both you and the autosave is supposed to use. Technical problems.Whilst I was playing I found that the mouse would get stuck in the centre of the screen which then made it impossible to look or aim. Minimizing the game helped fix that issue. The buttons in game for the menu aren't always responsive, sometimes you have to click on it more than once and some times upto 3 times.Whenever I performed a takedown the entire world would flicker and drop out (during the cutscene) this happened mostly in tight places but seemed to be entirely random. Once you kill or knockout an enemy they just fizzle away into orange triangles and then vanish. Which makes stealthing this game so easy that it's a joke. If you are used to playing MGS on the hardest whilst going for a complete stealth run. This is going to be like 'Baby's first stealth game'This isn't really an issue but it's pretty damn lazy, all of the animations have been recycled from DX:HR. The game also ends on a cliffhanging telling you that more is coming. Which I highly doubt by now.Overal, it's a nice little package. It's not great and it definetly has it's fair share of issues, However if you can get it cheap during a sale and you like Deus Ex, I'd suggest picking it up.			"

												If you liked any other Deus Ex games, please don't buy this one. Rather than having in-depth gameplay like the other ones, this game dumbs it down, leaving you unsatisfied. Since I looks like the previous game's graphics and gameplay, you might be thinking ""Like human revolution with guns 10/10"" but you would be dead wrong. The game clocks in at around 3-4 hours. I know it's supposed to be episodic, but for a Deus Ex game, 4 hours really isn't enough to expand on anything. It's almost like a Deus Ex demo, because all other three games were so long and had so much stuff to do.Length shouldn't bother too many people, but everything else will. The game has been made insultingly easy. You have an in-game menu that allows you to buy anything you want. Seriously. It makes the game so easy because you can stop at any time to buy yourself a new gun or some ammo. There are not multiple paths through things anymore. There's usually one or two ways to approach something, no matter what it is. The graphics smell like mobile port, but that's because it IS a mobile port. Many models look very ugly. The voice acting for the main character is not great either.All in all, there's really not much to enjoy. For 10 dollars, you could buy yourself the original Deus Ex, or even Invisible War, the second Deus Ex game which now looks like Jesus compared to the Fall. Unless you are mad about Deus Ex and need to play every game, don't buy it.			"

												What can I say about Deus Ex: The Fall. I wouldn't recommend this game to any Deus Ex fans here or any other player because it's really bad and incompleted thing.First of all you can't rebind the controls, the game just shows you the list of buttons and no other option.You can't jump or run in this game. At all.Enemy AI is poor and weird. In most situations enemies will stop searching for you even if you killed any of them 10 seconds before or so.There is no difficulty option too which means almost no challenge in game besides a pacifist way.But most importantly, the whole game seems unfinished. Even the ending and final cutscene tell you that there supposed to be more content but the game ends after that. I have no idea why that happens or what that supposed to mean.Try to avoid this game at all cost. Save your money and buy something else.  3 out of 10.			"

												It's actually unbelievable how bad this game is...Voiceacting is so abysmal, that I actually turned off the sound at some points, because listening was bad for my blood pressure... I actually cannot believe that someone payed any amount of money to the people who did it... I mean, I would take random stray cats and dogs, and I believe they would randomly get better emotions in their ""voices"" for english subtitles... It just makes my mad!Gunplay is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... You can shoot a random mob in the head 3 times, before he dies, by melodramatically touching it's body and slowly falling to the floor...Gameplay is dreadful... There is no jump button. Everything is bought at any time through the menu, although you are having a hard time in game buying something, because you are a fugitive... But guns and ammo, magically apears, raising from the ashes of money... Hiding behind walls and such has almost no effect in fighting scenes... They will hit you, no problem...Graphics are awful... It's a mobile port, don't expect more than that...Skip this game... please...			"

												This was originally a tablet/phone game and it shows.  The cutscenes stutter a bit and the controls don't always respond correctly.  The gameplay is also very simple compared to the main games.  The only reason to play this is if you are really into the Deus Ex storyline and you don't want to miss anything.This game has the same characters from the book The Icarus Effect and it picks up where that book left off (it retells a few key events from the book and then the characters start a somewhat new storyline).  However, the game is only a few hours long, not much really happens in the way of plot development, and then the game ends with ""To Be Continued..."" and a promise that more content will be added later.I don't regret playing it because it was interesting enough to justify the time I spent playing it, but I think it will only be satisfying for completionists who want to see everything story-related that takes place in the Deus Ex universe.

												I've been a fan of the Deus Ex franchise since the box art for the original game caught my eye some 15 years ago.  I pushed through Invisible War and thoroughly enjoyed Human Revolution.  I knew The Fall was an iOS port and tried to take that into consideration, but that excuse can only stretch so far.The tragedy of this game is that it's episodic--Steam makes no mention of this--and development has seemingly ceased on the next episode.  For an episodic game that original came out in July of 2013 to have no mention of when the next episode is due is unacceptable.  The developer's website for the game leads to a 404 and DeusEx.com has removed all mention of The Fall.  How Steam can sell a cancelled game is beyond me.There's been no up-scaling of any of the 3D assets for the PC port at all.  The character models themselves, while angular, do not look terrible.  The buildings of Panama have a brutalist architecture vibe which fits well with the game's themes and low poly requirements.  The scenery pieces (e.g. rubbish bins, vending machines, fences) needed to be freshened up for a PC release.Music and sound design in the game is perfect and takes many cues from Human Revolution.The GUI is atrocious in it's overly large icons designed for a touch interface.   The worst aspect of it is your inventory; gone are the days of managing what you carry.  You can have every weapon and item in the game (though only assign a set amount to quick keys) magically appear in your hands just by clicking ""buy"" from the store.There's an incredibly annoying glitch were being in cover while using a takedown will randomly result in your character being unable to move.  This happened about once an hour for me.  How this got past QA in what is a stealth title baffles me.			"

												TL;DR - Don't buy it, really not worth it.Full review:Was hoping for something similar to the DE:HR dlc, a miniature game. Should have looked online first.Graphics are subpar (really subpar) but I can deal with that.Not a fan of the in game shop, but okay, I can handle that too.Main character voice acting was bland.Cannot deal with the horrible, horrible interface issues though. Bugs everywhere. Buttons don't always worked when clicked. You have to mouse over the button and mash until it works sometimes. Despite struggling with basic things DE:HR excelled at, I was determined to give it a fair go. At least until while crouching behind cover my guy suddenly couldn't perform any actions or move. Menus did nothing to help. It was at this point I gave up.Do yourself a favour and buy two indie games for $5 instead. Unless they remake it from the ground up for PC, this is not worth buying			"

												If you enjoy Deus Ex you will enjoy this game.  Yes it does seem to have a few glitches and the graphics quality is not 100 %; e.g. some parts look good others look like bocks of colour, (but maybe that is my system).   Most disapointing to find out how short the game is, so be prepared for that; I just got into it and it ended.  I bought it as part of the bundel so didn't mind it being too short.			"

												I'm new to the seires so I dont have as much background as others but I do have fresh eyes.1) This game is insanely short (despite 5 hours of gameplay). Had the game been longer I would've reccomended it.2) Gameplay is very good in there being multiple ways to do things, I pretty much always chose stealth approach and finfing backways. The robots however are insaenly overpowered, the only one I was able to kill was only because I spent about 15 minutes dodging bullets and firing bullets that did almost nothing. The shooting itself was very smooth but the guns didn't do a lot of damage, even with low level enemies it'd still take two shotgun blasts to the face usually.3) Visuals were amazing (ignoring some odd polygons on locals that made their faces look so round they could be fruit while others were completely unaffected) and it definetly has the strong cyberpunk atmosphere it was going for.4) Characters we really didn't see much of, I can barely tell you anything past the short backstory debriefings.5) All the weapon upgrades are pointless, don't bother. It's difficult to get enough credits to buy one gun let alone the whole stock and the shop is useless because the game is so short there's no time to save up for let alone use the gun or weapon selection. I wasn't even able to buy half the aug upgrades the game was so short.Overall, had the game been longer it would've been amazing. But because of it's short length a lot of the game was rendered utterly useless. I only reccomend buying if it's on a really good sale just to try it out, otherwise it really is just that much of a waste of time.			"

												So as it turns out this is ported to PC from iOS, and Android. This is a mobile game. I wish I had realised this BEFORE I bought the game. I was excited and bought it since I love Deus Ex: Human Revolution and thought this would be similar.It's not.Graphics suck and everything is poorly textured, the game and character handles very clumsily, and the even though it looks kinda like Human Revolution, it feels and handles like some game I used to play on PS1.Also NPC textures and animations are very bland. almost non-existent. They kinda are there but they really aren't there. Although the screenshots and cinematics look nice, the actual enemies look like hastily made wax figures.Can't really say much more because I played this game for less than an hour and it was enough for me. Horrible.Overall ugly, buggy, and clumsy game that shouldn't even be played on mobile devices in my opinion. Total waste of your money.DO-NOT-BUY-IT.Buy something else.EDIT:If you don't believe me and / or simply need more proof than my word, I recommend watching TotalBiscuit's review on this game, on YouTube.

												Adding to the already long list of people who ordered this without reading the forums, I too believe you should wait for a sale on this one. On the Humble Store page, it lists this as DRM-free with a Steam code so you know a sale is gonna happen eventually. Square's been porting some of their games to the PC with only few problems so I assumed this would either be as flawed or better because the game's relatively new. Nope. It's a mess. On the bright side, the achievement system is broken and easily manipulated in such a way that it actually feels like you're humiliating the game. As for everything else... eh. It's buggy, the map designs are boring, you can't jump, the quickslot controls are terrible and the story is basically just stretching the novel, ""Icarus Effect,"" which is better imo.Here's another bad example: They left the touch-screen microtransaction buttons in there but took out the functionality. And you know it's a sign of more dangers to come. Seriously, it was bad news when they said they were making an iOS game for this series and when you see those microtransaction ""buy now"" buttons, you can't help but fear for Deus Ex Universe. Playing this game is a warning that, sadly, it's going to get much worse for Deus Ex. They did it with Hitman and Thief. This is next.Deus Ex: The Fall, if it worked and looked (oh god those models) perfectly, would be a solid $6.99 purchase. $10 for an unfinished port? I never asked f-- god, I'm sorry I almost said that joke. That was awful of me...			"

												No customizable binds is an unholy sin right out of the gate. The voiceovers are lackluster and most of the accents are noticeably forced and fake. The writing is mediocre at best, the script is in dire need of an editor to add some narrative and not just exposition for its own sake.The gameplay is par for par same mechanics as Human Revolution but the in-inventory purchasing reeks of laziness, not to mention it makes no practical sense. As usual the aesthetics are gorgeous if somewhat buggy here and there. Facial expressions are mostly emotionless and cutscenes models have that subtle sickening jerk to them like their limbs are taut rubberbands.Despite all this, it wouldn't be half bad but for the non customizable keybinds. What in the hell was the rush? All this time was taken to introduce these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t unskippable tutorial popup menus in some vapid attempt to not lose someone who may not be familiar with the series' mechanics and then you don't give them free range of keybinds in an ostensible action RPG?This game reeks of the typical Square Enix approach to every game it regurgitates. Gorgeous visuals that play like♥♥♥♥♥with writing that is reminiscient of tween anime crossover fanfiction. Which is a shame given the setting.			"

												I am really disappointed in Deus Ex The Fall and Square Enix should be totally ashamed to have put out this product into the Deus Ex Community.   It should have stayed as a mobile game, if it could not have been ported over to more playable game for the PC, for which in its current state is not.  I hope Square Enix fixes the glaring problems in this game for which would make it more enjoyable for a Community that loves this franchise.  I have not completed this game yet, but these are the problems that I have discovered in this game that needs fixing NOW.  (1) Save system needs attention.  Basically make it like what Human Revolution had, a system for which you can Save in Steps, over just to ""Continue"" on from your last game play.  (2) The Keyboard/Mouse Option Needs Re-worked.  Currently you are stuck with what the developers made ""for you"".  Make it where the Keyboard and Mouse controls are configurable to a players needs.  Basically if a player does not like the W, A, S, D movement keys and prefers say a T, F, G, H config make the controls able to accomplish that.  And what I personally don't like is the mouse configuration.  There is absolutely NO Thumb Button support!  Make it that the mouse' thumb buttons can be configured to a command.  (3)  Many Sound Glitches (this has been addressed many times before me) where the voices or game sounds completely disappear, but does come back a little later.Those are the Three Basic Problems for this game in its current state, I know there are much more by the other comments I have read, but the 3 above would make the game more enjoyable for me to personally play.  But I have been playing and purchasing PC games since 1988 and in my own personal opinion the price of $9.99 is not that bad for this experience.  I have paid over $50 for games that had these same basic problems, but the developer fixed them and finally made them playable for the PC Community.  Hopefully Square Enix will fix this game.			"

												It sets out to bring the Deus Ex experience to the IOS market, and succeeded in doing that. That is, it succeeded in bringing a very small, cut down, simplified version of the Deus Ex experience that lasts 5-6 hours and consists of a tutorial, a lengthy chat with your friend, and ONE hub area.Visually, I think the only upgrades provided for the port are MSAA and resolution selection. With the tablet-optimized graphics, you could set the resolution to 640x480 and fool yourself into thinking you're playing a PS2 game with some bloom and some Doom-3-on-Xbox-quality per-pixel lighting on Ben Saxon's face. It apparently runs on Unity as well.Story-wise, it's ok until the end. Not nearly on the level of even Invisible War, the previous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of the series, but passable... until it just abruptly ends with a cliffhanger for a sequel/episode 2 that may or may not even happen, with no main-quest plot threads tied up whatsoever. Oh, and as an added bonus, nothing you do with your augmentations or weapons in the prologue carries over to the rest of the game, so save your credits!Control-wise, it's a mess. In porting, the developers decided not to bother with customization support, so you're stuck with the defaults. Admittedly, its defaults do line up with a lot of other games' default controls. Mouse sensitivity is the biggest offender here, as vertical and horizontal are not in sync with each other (with no separate control option) and mouse smoothing is most certainly in effect.Hate in-app purchases? Guess what- they're still here! Near as I can tell they're in-game money only now, which is far less awful, but it's also the only way to acquire equipment that isn't laying around. Need credits? They're everywhere, and you can even get some just by offing civilians. Just don't expect to know how much a weapon upgrade costs unless you have enough money to afford it AND start the buying process, as it won't tell you otherwise.Overall, it's... ok. Something to pick up and rush through when it's on sale, but nothing great. Hell, for better value, you could instead just pick up The Missing Link DLC for Human Revolution or play Deus Ex: Nihilum, which give you more of a proper Deus Ex feel with a much better cost-value ratio.

												It's not awful, but it's also not amazing - the gameplay was very much designed for a phone or tablet, not a keyboard and mouse, and unless you have an irrational aversion to playing games on something other than a PC I'd suggest looking there for a much smoother experience with this title. For a cheap Deus Ex-like experience with the decent-to-high-quality writing and story telling and good-to-very-mediocre voice acting you expect from the Deus Ex series this is worth $5.There's no word as of yet on when part two will be released, or if it ever will be--I've contacted the developers about this and they've remained tight-lipped which doesn't bode well for the future of the game.

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution was one of my all-time favorite games. That's what makes Deus Ex: The Fall such an incredibly disappointing experience. Apparently this was originally released on the iPad, which explains a lot. The graphics are middling, and the controls rarely work. There's an emphasis on clicking a lot, and often the first, second, and possibly trhird time I click on something it doesn't actually recognize my click. The narrator for the tutorial sounds both bored and frustrated; although so was I so maybe that was actually clever. The storyline is incredibly weak. The first part of the game is a very long ""conversation"" where the main character narrates everything that's happened so far, while a bored bystander occasionally asks ""Ooh, and then what happened?"" The cool thing about games is you can unravel a story through gameplay, not exposition, but they missed that point entirely for this game.I managed to play through a couple hours of it before I decided to stop wasting my time. This game is an embarrasment to the Deus Ex franchise. Glad I got it on sale at least so I'm only out $2.50, but I wish I had read more reviews before impulse-buying it.			"

												TL;DR at bottom--Cons--No re-bindable keys, constant popups, no jump ability, low quality models and low resolution textures. When you pick up a pocket secretary it immediately opens it up to read it. Very poor voice acting, and quite buggy (most times it takes multiple mouse clicks to select an option/item etc.). I tried skipping the first cutscene by pressing the spacebar, it paused the cutscene but showed no indication that it had paused other than everything stopping, so I assumed the game process had hung. Also, there is no ability to look down your iron sights.The ""ability"" to buy any inventory item from the menu, using credits earned in the game, makes it far too easy. And speaking of the menu, the layout for the menu is still heavily optimized for a mobile platform. It feels as though the only thing they may have changed in the game when porting to the PC are those explicitly pointed out in the game description. It plays like a game developed in the late '90s.--Pros--You can scale some cover----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I should have read description more thoroughly; when I first saw another installment of the Deus Ex game available, I jumped on the offer for it, and quickly scanning through it's description I missed that it was simply a port from a mobile version.I'll play some more of it to get the trading cards, since I've wasted my money on it. But once I have the free drops I'm uninstalling and never touching this game again.TLDR;Terrible experience for a PC game, especially considering how powerful PCs are today; do not buy.			"

												Yes, the overall review rating for this game is mostly negative, but, its not that bad. Take the game for what it is, a mobile game, but that being said, its pretty much a watered down Human Revolution, a more linear game, where you can just cruse through. Yes, it does have its problems, as I use a controller for this game (because the controls are basically the same as HR) and the original intention for this is obviously to be used on a touch screen, the hacking in the game is very difficult as the curser flys across the screen when you have about 3 seconds to click on something to complete the hack. And the AI is really OP for some reason too. That being said, the story is decent enough, gameplay is pretty much the same as Human Revolution, the voice acting is great (Apart from the tutorial woman who needs to be shot) and overall im enjoying it. Definately pick this up when its on sale as its only £1.99.			"

												Deus Ex The Fall isn't as bad as people say it is, but after having played the wonderful Deus Ex Human Revolution it is a disappointment. I shall sum some things up in a small overview:Pros;- Graphics don't look half bad, except for the faces- Stealthy gameplay (if you wish to play that way)- Buying items on the move (even though this doesn't make any sense)Cons:- Small areas- Controls are terrible and don't fit a PC port- Buying items on the move- Short (maybe that's a good thing ?)- Ending is sudden and unexpected- On-screen button don't always work; lots of frustration hereSo all in all it's not bad, but if you want to play a proper stealth game try Deus Ex Human Revolution, Dishonored, Splinter Cell or Hitman instead. This one is 'just ok'.[Rating: 72/100]			"

												This game. This game before you right now. It is not worth money. Any amount. It is not worth any asking price at its current state. This is a horrible slapdash PC port of an iOS/Android game that took nearly a year to gestate, but it still came out completely malformed. The graphics aren't horrible, but a stickler for PC gaming standards would swear this off the moment they see the game in action, because it looks extremely old, like by Playstation 2 and original Xbox standards, but I'd be able to live with it. However, the problem with this game is the sheer lack of effort and Quality Control that went into the port. For the best gameplay experience, you would need to be willing to switch controls between the keyboard+mouse and an Xbox 360 controller on the fly, there's just so much wrong with this game's controls that it's hard to explain in a short amount of time.The experience of playing with a keyboard and mouse makes me feel physically ill from the amount of visual whiplash involved in the simple act of turning when you walk. It's like the mouselook is locked at 45 degree angles, regardless of mouse sensitivity options, your view speed will be extremely sluggish and stopping your view anywhere between the preset angles will cause your view to snap to the nearest one. Strangely enough the xbox 360 controller does not have this problem, so I would suggest that for walking around and looking at things and maybe shooting. I say MAYBE shooting because you use the right trigger to shoot here and it's extremely unresponsive as well, in addition to the fact that guns, when fired, appear to snap your field of view back and forth to try and loosely simulate recoil. You cannot jump, and I cannot find a button on the controller that allows you to sprint or run. In hacking, the controller is overly-sensitive and uses a method for node capture that is liable to send your view of the hacking puzzle careening in whatever vague directions you were selecting with the left analog stick. You can browse menus using the controller mostly with ease EXCEPT, in order to scroll through the list of quests, you need to use the mousewheel, so in short, the best gameplay experience as far as controls is swapping between a controller and keyboard+mouse on the fly.Stealth afficianados will notice that the only bits of stealth left in this are line of sight, silent takedowns, and cloaking. Enemies will not react to hearing you, only to seeing you, and it doesn't seem to matter anymore to care about where you take out an enemy, as their bodies dissolve into gold triangles as soon as you take them down, lethal or not. The levels are very short, shorter infact than Deus Ex: Invisible War's. There's also no shops, you carry a replicator in your pause menu now that makes you whatever item you want for an in-game currency fee (this was were microtransactions were in the iOS/Android releases). You can even buy praxis kits. The story, while it might have been well-written and thought out, is delivered very poorly with deadpan and comedically bad voice acting across the board and occasionally way too long dialogue that overstays its welcome long before it's finished.On the positive side, it does look and feel like Deus Ex: Human Revolution, if it were to be put under by a mad doctor, had random guts taken out, and then lobotomized. The saddest thing about this game is really all the wasted potential. Square-Enix could have made this natively for PCs or Consoles rather than jumping headlong to the current Japanese game industry standard of 'everything is better mobile'. This game is proof positive that that is not the case, or at least that what works for one system does not work for another. The port job in and of itself, disregarding the original iOS release, is terrible and on the verge of unplayable to anyone besides the most patient or tolerant of gamers, and the controls all on their own should relegate this title to discussions where you would mention Superman 64 and E.T. for the Atari 2600 in the same breath.At least, all this is the case unless they somehow pull the best patch ever out and fix everything, which I hope they do, because I really want to enjoy this game, but you know they won't. This PC Port is a sad case of wasted potential, and now this is technically the earliest entry in series canon, meaning Deus Ex, as of now, begins with The Fall, and ends with Invisible War. It's like a delicious gooey center that is Human Revolution and the Original game, sandwiched in rancid feces, and we certainly didn't ask for this.***Edit: After recording more footage for the game and getting excessively frustrated with playing the game, I looked for solutions on the mouselook issue since writing this review. Lo and behold, there is an almost-fix, turn on the vsync. I didn't have vsync on at all because I was trying to record footage and I found that usually when I use vsync during recording, it usually screws with a game's performance or the recording, but apparently without vsync on, the keyboard and mouse controls do not work properly at all.Using this trick made the game far more enjoyable, to the point that I'm actually kinda getting into the story (now that it's finally also going somewhere), but that doesn't excuse the fact that I dunno what kind of failures of programmers or QA a development team would need to have to have the stsatus of the vsync, a GRAPHICAL option, effect the CONTROLS of the whole game, thus adversely effecting the gameplay. I could do a better job than whoever Squeenix or Eidos-Montreal or N-Fusion hired for this game, and I have no programming knowledge whatsoever outside of altering .ini files.***			"

												Stop trying to port games like this from mobile, it's not on par with the basic quality PC games now offer in terms of graphics, but also in terms of gameplay and storytelling.The game is awful, it doesn't feel fun, it's ugly, the animations are low quality, most of the time lips don't move during dialogue, theres barely any graphical options, the gameplay was designed for mobile, the story is overhyped and boring and the list goes on! The voice acting was ok and I can see how this wouldn't be so bad if it stayed on mobile.To be completely fair, the game doesn't look half-bad for a mobile game, it even looks somewhat pretty considering the size of the screen its usually played on. I wouldn't recommend it on PC.			"

												Deus Ex: The Fall is garbage. Absolute garbage. The controls are♥♥♥♥♥♥and the storyline is even worse. Don't let the requirements or graphics fool you. You're better off not buying this game.The only reason I own this game is because it was included with my purchase of the Deus Ex Collection. If it wasn't I doubt I would have even bothered with this game.My Breakdown of Deus Ex: The Fall:Pros+ Graphics are pretty good+ Menus/UI is clean and original fits the Deus Ex theme well+ Requirements are very low making it possible to run on almost any computer+ Includes 80 Steam Achievements and 6 Steam Trading CardsCons- Controls are garbage- Tutorial system is better used in a decompiling program than in this game- Game is a mobile port which is the most likely reason why this sucks- Your objectives are not clearly elaborated, neither are your hacking abilities/limitations- Might be fun for a hardcore Deus Ex fan, but thankfully I'm not a hardcore Deus Ex fanMy Rating: 0/10 (Not Recommended) "

												Rating 6.5/10What is it?First Person RPG- Deus Ex Lite VersionThe Good:+If there is one aspect of the game they got absolutely right, its the music, it perfectly sets the mood + Atmosphere feels very 'deus ex' like,+ Story is good and somewhat interesting, + Easy achievements. One glitchy achievement The Bad:- Can not remap gamepad controls and the sensitivity option is all over the place. Even when I lowered the sensitivity to 0 moving the cursor during hacking caused the cursor to zoom all over the place making hacking a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ - Graphically its all over the place, character models look basic while certain environments look decent. I know its an IOS port but atleast try to make your game look up to par with the rest of the series.- Stupidly easy. Beat the entire game without firing a single bullet. I just ran up to enemies and knocked them out with relative ease.  Bodies also disappear magically. -ONE save file, if you accidently saved, or if the save file gets corrupted then you are♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck, get ready to start over. This is unacceptable for a PC game, port or not. - Graphical glitches are very apparent. -Boring lead characterConclusionI was so torn with this game. There were times when I wanted to reccomment it but ultimately I couldn't. Their are too many problems with this game, most notably (if you played any other Deus Ex) this game feels very basic to the other entries in the series.  The level design is pretty basic, the AI pretty stupid, and the game just ends just when it gets interesting. I know this is an IOS port but if you bring it to the PC where you have Deus Ex:GOTY edition and Human Revolution, is there any reason for this game to be in the state that its in?			"

 Deus Ex: The Gall Review  en anglais (ouais!)First off, I have to say that I like deus ex. I bought the original deus ex in a bargain store in 2003 or 2004, I first thought to myself: dis sux. Later I enjoyed it before it got ported to steam or whatever because it is a thinking man's shooter. You get to use your augmentations and your writable notepad (really, you could press I think an f key and it would pop up a functional wordpad to write down all the codes and what they said to put together what the hell was going on). Then Hummus Revolution came out and I found that to be a good modern interpretation of the original, pretty damn good. I think the first time I played through was like 15 hours which was pretty short but that's better than what we get these days.Then The Fall...Oh gawd, non.I don't know if this game's title was supposed to be foreshadowing but this is like invisible war which was mediocre at best, but now it makes you sad in the light of your computer, all alone, expecting to stay up all night long to play this mobile version.First, let's get the engine out of the way: Hummus Revolution was a reworked Crystal Dynamics Engine that was used in Tomb Raider: Underworld. This one uses unity probably because it is better built for the mobile market, and probably this was a low budget so they didn't want to waste a lot of money. But without splitting any hairs, this looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ I swear this looks like 2005 quality. This may seem unfair because it was a moblie game at first, but you have the name Deus Ex on the box. After coming off Human Revolution, the shock was jarring. I was playing a beautiful well lighted game to OH GAWD.I was expecting the porting people to try to rework the UI to be more faithful to Human Revolution because it was a Unity game which is a very flexible engine, but no. There is no multiple saves like in any other good PC game, there isn't a smooth UI. Hell, not even the mouse works properly. It won't detect blatant clicks I started to click furiously and I might have cut the like of the damn thing in half. The difficulty of inventory management (which is a good thing, mind you) was cut completely, going for a teleport my rocket launcher from nowhere into my hands, kaboom. Going around people is the suggested idea in Deus Ex, not anymore. You can get a stun gun, and then stun your enemies, pick up the credits and keep buying the ammo and you won't run out of cash money. Hell, you can't even jump in this game, really. It is a port from iOS and it shows. The stealth detection is wonky, half the the time they will ignore you, the other time they are a god damn eagle. At least the level design is okay for the most part. People are probably going to ask me why I am so focused on Human than the ones before. That's because it has the same art style, the same year as Human Revo. (instead of the 25 year difference between the first two), and the same weapon designs and praxis system. You might say that I haven't played enough to make an objective opinion. Well that's because the game has only one section, Panama City, and it's shorter than the shortest part of Hummus Revolution: part 2 of Hengsha. Half of that time is me going idle or killing random people and resetting the save. I feel awful for those that bought this at full price, because that is barely any content. What I hate about that is when you click on ""More Content"" it says ""MOAR TO COME!"". We know that is unlikely, don't lie you French ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Even if they did, it's irrelevant because I know how this ends because I'm the Batman.  it's the jews  "

												This is a port of an iOS game, and it shows, but it's not necessarily bad, just really barebones. If you're okay with playing a stripped down version of Human Revolution with a little bit of new story that follows up the Icarus Effect book then go for it, but I'd personally recommend waiting for a sale because this is only Part 1 and there is still no Part 2, and Part 1 ends on a pretty underwhelming cliffhanger. I'll still give it a Yes, but only because there's no ""Maybe"" option for steam recommendations.			"

												Does Deus Ex: The Fall deserve all the hate? My answer; yes and no.On some things I have to agree, bugs ever present, gameplay a husk compared to Human Revolution. Those aside, it was still enjoyable, albeit lacking the amount of depth and content HR had, but what were people expecting from an iOS port. I myself never expected the graphics to be stellar, all I've ever cared about when it comes to ports is optimisation, and frankly The Fall ticks that box, running flawlessly minus a few minor bugs; never experienced lag nor any crashes whilst playing. As a game itself I'd argue it is one of the weaker entries to the franchise, but it's decent enough to warrant at least a single playthrough. The story continues from where the Icarus Effect novel left off, as such you may be confused going in without having read it. Seeing as the game ends on a cliff-hanger it can be assumed a sequel was planned, up until the massive backlash and as such, it's unlikely we'll see the end of Ben and Anna's story. I'd recommend against buying at full price, buy on sale instead if you're considering it.			"

												Played the intro and a quite a few minutes into the game. If you buy this game because of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, you will be really disappointed and I strongly advice you to NOT to buy this game. You WILL be disappointed. The movement felt clunky and several bugs were encountered, as for example I skipped frames whenever turned for more than 45°. Also the controls are not rebindable. Doesnt bother everyboy, but as they were imho just terrible compared to DX:HR, that DID bother me. But so much about the functionality.Design-wise, this game is a HUGE let down compared to DX:HR. I really loved that game and that is the reason why I outright bought DX: The Fall when I heard of it. Do not be as foolish as I was. For instance: Corpses disappear and do no longer have any meaning. The intro/tutorial wasn't the best either, as it made one thing clear to me: I will be flooded with worthless achievements for clicking (a) button(s).The only thing that would make the game appealing to me would be the lore, as everything else causes the opposite. Sadly, that is not enough for me to dig myself through this game.I'd give it 3/10 just for being a Deus Ex title. I do not recomment it.			"

												Once again, like it was said so many times, I wish there was option to mark it as neutral.At begin, if you are a hardcore fan of Deus Ex games you should probably skip this one - or play it on your smartphone in order to not be dissapoint. Compared to other games in series, The Fall is no good. But for something that was made for smarphones - yes, you can enjoy it. Everybody know it doesn't met with so many nowadays standards. That doesn't matter. Also, maybe I'm alone, but I think it's nice to see good smartphone games avaible also on PC, so even people with nomrla cellphones would be able to enjoy it.So, that's probably everything I can say is positive in Deus Ex: The Fall. I'm not fan of mobile gaming, it's good for little games, less for something more ""serious"". It's well made SMARTPHONE game, which surprised me few times. While I played The Fall, it reminded me with not so good fps games from many years ago. Yup, it was almost same. It's not a bad thing, a little nostalgia while playing something not so old. Sometimes AI acted foolish, boss fight (if you can call something at the end like this) felt like a joke and same goes for ending. What I really enjoyed were making takedowns, maybe because it's a Human Revolution things. Graphics, music, UI and many others are fine - for a SMARTPHONE game. It's rather decent if you would want to compare it to some PC games, even those 10+ years older than Deus Ex: The Fall.If you want it, get it on sale, or maybe on your phone (if you have a powerful one), so you will have your little Deus Ex universe in your pocket. I can't truly recommend it or not, so I guess it leaves me no other option as mark it negative. There is no harm in giving it a chance but you need to be rather prepared to be dissapointed with this one.			"

Before anything else: if you're a Deus Ex fan, this game might be worth getting. If you're not, you simply will not have the patience for its crap. So with that out of the way, the rest of the review....I snagged this game during an Amazon sale for significantly less than full price, and I have to say it's not nearly as bad as I expected.  Hardly stunning praise, but I'll freely admit to having some fun playing the game, in between dealing with its problems.  The biggest problem is of course the mangled interface, specifically the hard-coded keybindings and the mouse smoothing+acceleration combo that the game forces. Once I used AutoHotkey to fix the bindings though my biggest problem with the game went away. The mouse issues, while still present, aren't as bad because frankly the AI isn't tetchy enough for it to matter. They always give you ample room to aim at all their vulnerable bits.I'm not saying it's a great game. It's certainly nowhere near as detailed and complex as any of the previous Deus Ex titles, not by a long shot, but given the price I paid I'm willing to forgive that. It's also surprisingly easy, undoubtedly due to the straight mobile-to-PC port.  Any experienced Deus Ex player is only going to have trouble with this game if they insist on going for a perfect no-detection non-lethal run, especially with built-in health regen and items you can literally buy mid-battle. Despite that though, the game is still fun in the same way that DX:HR was fun, albeit not as well fleshed out and significantly shorter (you can breeze through the full campaign and all sidequests in a few hours). It's sort of like eating a frozen pizza: yeah, it's not as good as a restaurant-made pizza, but it's still a pizza, and if you like pizza sometimes that's enough.Really though, what drags this game down are the control issues. The rest of the issues with the game - low rez models, simplified level design, almost ridiculously dumb AI - can be given a pass because the game was ported from a mobile platform. The controls though... that's kind of a basic, required component of games, plus, this game is a Unity engine game. Someone with three weeks of programming classes could make remappable controls in Unity. Not making remappable controls in Unity engine is beyond lazy, it's downright negligent. And to add further insult to injury, this awful hackjob of a port costs more than the original mobile version, despite having nothing new to it.  Completely inexcusable.Bottom line: if you can get past the control issues (or use a workaround like AutoHotkey), there's a fun game lurking under here, along with some interesting depth and backstory.  Unfortunately there's a lot to get past within that, and that coupled with the somewhat dumbed down game may make it too much for you to be willing to deal with.  If it's not though, the game is worth your time, but not the full asking price.			"

												Deus Ex: The Fall is a direct port from mobile devices. As such, it suffers from a few common issues; non-rebindable keys, relatively poor graphics and sometimes clunky controls. However, it is not a terrible game.The Fall was clearly made to milk the franchise. There isn't much love or inspiration to be felt in its level design, weapons or story.The levels are linear, but the developers clearly tried to copy the standard Deus Ex multiple-paths approach. It's clearly inferior to HR's (and the original's) excellently designed areas. Its hub, Panama, also doesn't feel very new or interesting, but it offers some variety in missions which I actually found fun.The visuals are dated, which comes as no surprise given it's a mobile port, but they aren't horribly ugly and have that Human Revolution look. The soundtrack was ripped from HR in an attempt to bring back the atmosphere of the former (it does, to some degree, succeed in that).The block-based Deus Ex inventory system was scrapped in favor of an unlimited all-in-one inventory-store, which works well considered this is a relatively entry to the series. Enemy AI is, at most, downright handicapped, so stealth is easier than it should be.However, I was able to look past all this and found a fun little Deus Ex fix. Why am I giving it a thumbs down, then? See, I expected the game to be short, five or six hours, ten at most. I got my 6 hours out of it, but I also expected an ending to the story, however uninteresting it may be. It ends with a cliffhanger. A ♥♥♥♥ing ""To be continued..."" that cuts you off without anything remotely similar to a conclusion. One moment, you're sitting tight, expecting an epic final mission, or at least a boss fight and explanations for some loose plotpoints, and the next you realize you get none of it and are basically screwed. And since this game was generally unfavorably received, it isn't likely Ben Saxon's story will continue, at least in its current form.So there you go, Deus Ex: The Fall isn't as bad as some might make you believe. It doesn't live up to the high standards of Deus Ex, but is fun in its own right. Without Deus Ex slapped on it, and maybe if it was originally on PC, it would score a solid 7.5/10. It isn't, however, finished, so keep that in mind if you ever want to buy it.			"

												I DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS.There is a reson why they call this game Deus Ex : ""The Fall"". I was going in to this game open minded hoping to be half a good as Human Revolution, but no it was just so bad.PROS- i can't think of any.CONS-  The graphics. Having to load 50 diffrent areas just to complete one side mission. The way people die in this game. I might have to put that in pros beacuse its so ridiculous. The invetory if i had one. The guns i collected if i collected guns The whole game.PROS2.0- The ridiculous way people die.Now it was not the worst game ever just the worst stealth game of 2014.			"

												What a shame. I am a sucker for the Deus Ex franchise and I was quite hyped for The Fall when it got announced, but I didn't have an iPad so I had to pass. After some time, the PC port came out and I got it in a bundle but I knew how awfully received it was so I didn't even look at it. Now I did, and I am just really disappointed. I played around 40 minutes and what I noticed where wonky controls, meh graphics (I don't give a damn about the graphics, they are♥♥♥♥♥♥but they aren't super awful) and pretty terrible voiceacting. But another thing I noticed was the Human Revolution styled soundtrack which is again really nice to hear and the artstyle and worlddesign. Clearly a lot of love and time went into designing the places, the world and so on. It got dumbed down a bit to fit on phones but it still looks phenomenal, pretty much Human Revolution (or Mankind Divided) with less polygons. Such a shame, because I just adore Deus Ex's style (especially the latest Square Enix installments). Why wasted such potential on a mobile phone and a horrid port!? Square Enix and its choices, shame on you. Hitman episodes, FF7 episodic as well, Mankind Divided microtransactions, Just Cause 3's stupid online annoyance, same goes for Hitman and so on. I am so mad.			"

												The game is actually pretty decent despite the control issues and poor conversion to PC. However its an unfinished game and likely will never be finished. And when I say unfinished I mean it literally stops mid story. Its much like those season finale cliffhanger eps for a show, that gets cancelled after the season. So if its part of a bundle go for it, however as a stand alone product its a waste of money.			"

												So you purchased our game! Thanks for your money. Actually, we only made one act. But fear not! You can replay it on higher difficulty. You know, like Diablo. We bet you wanted Deus Ex to be more like Diablo. Well yes, Diablo has more than one act, but that is not important, right?The gameplay is ridiculously dumbed down, partly because of nigh impossibility of making a good action game for tablets: both dead and unconscious bodies disappear in several seconds, moving objects around is allowed only in approved by the Party ways, no jumping, no iron sights, enemies forget where they have seen you in like 10 seconds, you can buy anything anywhere, and you have no limits on inventory. And on top of that, instead of an interesting story I expect from a Deus Ex game I got a ""to be continued"" in my face, while I still was not really involved in the story.			"

												For fans of the Deus Ex series, The Fall is trying on the nerves. The only real good thing here is the fact you get some behind the scenes story of the Merc team you faced in Human Revolution. Let me stress that this is the ONLY good thing, aside from what appears to be some minor graphics updates. Here's a quick, dirty list of cons:> Aiming is very sluggish> No aiming down sights> Firing from cover is sluggish> Numerous glitches (Can fall through world, cursor will disappear reading books, Keypads sometimes don't read your clicks)> Hacking icons look like they were very roughly/quickly cut from the other game, and pasted onto the screen, losing serious resolution on the icons and making them look cheap. > AI isnt the brightest> Infinite buying ability, so there's no tactical planning> No inventory so you have unlimited space (removes difficulty)> Can't use AUDs even though they're implementedAnd that's just a small number of things I found wrong. There's a reason this game has TONS of negative feedback. I would avoid it.			"

												Ah, Deus Ex: Human Revolution! That was and still is an amazing game! Later, Eidos Montreal revealed that they were working on another DE title. How excited I was! More Deus Ex! Bummer, Mobile platform only...On Mobile, the game seemed to perform well and was decently rated, for a mobile game! Now that Eidos Montreal said they were going to bring this DE: The Fall to PC, that was good news! Or is it?In this game, you play as Ben Saxon, a Merc that used to work for Belltower Mercenaries. After some incident, you're recruited by Namir, the antagonist of Human Revolution, and sent somewhere for assassination. Now, your guy, Ben, develops a conscience and decides to quit Namir's friends and pals, the Tyrants. And that's where I am at, in the game now. I'll update this review once I finish this digital-only game but still, here's a rundown of PROS and CONS that I'm experiencing currently.PROS:+Interested in more DE backstory? The Fall shall fill that craving! Many PDA to read infos, so you get to know some more.+Hacking minigame is the same as Human Revolution.+Music by same composer as HR. Really great... when it works!+Voice acting is okay, more or less! It's not HR quality, but serviceable for a ""Mobile"" game.+Deus Ex GOTY free with this purchase... well, at this point, if you still haven't got DE GOTY, you should get The Fall!CONS:-Straight Port from Mobile to PC. Nothing ""extra"" or noteworthy added in the PC version.-No rebindable keys for Keyboard AND EVEN Xbox 360 Gamepad (totally unnacceptable and hopefully patched later on)-Wonky controls. The sensitivity of the mouse feels way off. If you can't adjust your sensitivity ""on-the-fly"", you'll likely have issues with this game!-Lots of sound clipping and worse, sound crash at times. Best advice, active subtiles if you want to ""hear"" a nearby enemy!-Many annoying ""help pop ups"".-Unintuitive menus.-Poor AI.-Visuals/Graphics/Animations are all really bad. Low res textures, wonky/stiff animations.OVERALL:Well, kinda disappointed really. Sure this isn't a AAA full game but I still expected something decently done for the porting, alas, it wasn't. It's like this port feels rushed, no special love added in the PC version. Granted it was designed as a mobile game so no one should have expected a killer treatment but at least, a working game would've been greatly appreciated!RECOMMENDATION:So, since I haven't finished the game yet, I'll finish it off in the coming days, unsure when as I'm flooded with PlayStation 4 titles all of the sudden! So do I recommend? Not really. Not at full price! And at least not right now... better wait until this game get's properly patched, especially for the audio issues and wonky controls! By that time, it may be in a Steam sale!RATING:5.0 / 10			"

												worst game ive ever playedlets go over the things that are wrong in this game:1. Cover System: is laughable at best, you dont get put where you actually want to take cover, it seems liek its random, cover firing is okay but its not like you pop out shoot and come back, if you want to continue shooting it will pop you ina and out of cover to shoot, this leads into my next issue2. Shooting: in any good shooter you expect that when you shoot, your bullets would actually do something  right? well not in deus ex the fall, you can shoot a guy 3 times in the head and he wont go down, shoot a different guy in the leg with a full clip and he still doesnt go down? that shows theres something wrong right there3. Controls: being that i hadnt played a deus ex game in a few months i admit i was still a bit rusty at the controls, but heres the kicker, you cant remap them, i ended up having to dust off the controller to play this game effectively becasue the keyboard controls are terrible4. Price: its ten bucks, thats wa to high for as crappy a game as this, i got it when it was on sale for 2.50, but it still wasnt worth it, dont buy this, unless you want to waste moneyEDIT: I actually finished the game, holy ♥♥♥♥ was it bad, not only did it take me less than  hours, but this was supposed to be an episodic series, holy ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥, my verdict still stands DONT BUY THIS			"

												If you have the burning desire to play Deus Ex on your phone, go pick this up for iOS or Android, but as a PC game, it's a disaster. I don't care that it's a mobile port. If you're going to release it for PC, it should be altered to work well on a PC, and this doesn't. Deus Ex: Human Revolution is one of my favorite games of all time, and I was expecting more of the same. Instead, I got a pale imitation with clunky and unresponsive controls, keys you can't rebind, people who look like they're from a game a decade older, disappearing bodies, a ubiquitous store screen that lets you materialize a weapon out of nowhere, and areas so small, it feels like there's a load screen every 90 seconds. No matter how much you loved Human Revolution, this is awful.			"

												This game is a major disappointment. After Human Revolution, I was all set for a new Deus Ex game to play. And after playing The Fall, I guess that ""new"" game is Deus Ex GOTY (thanks preorder). The way I look at it now is I (over)paid 9.98 for Deus Ex GOTY, and a penny for this pile of garbage.  The voice for the tutorial is beyond aggravating, sounding robotic for most of the intro and then all of a sudden sounding normal.  There's no control mapping, which any PC game that doesn't have that is a joke.  Not only that, but hey, hope you remember what the controls are, because if you pause and go to ""Controls"" you sure aren't going to see the controller map to see what the buttons do. There are plenty of broken hacking sequences where you either really struggle to click the capture button because it's partially off screen, or there is one instance where you can't hack the door at all because one of the nodes you need to capture is completely off screen, even after a full zoom out.  The game feels sluggish, looks awful (npc characters especially), and is honestly a complete waste of time.  Don't get tricked into buying this game because it bears the Deus Ex name.			"

												Do NOT buy this piece of crap mobile device port! It's filled with bugs and is a very poor port as well. The developers of this game must've hibernated from the moment they released this on mobiles last summer, until now. There are so many bugs that they certainly don't seem to have had any testers on it. Personally I experienced:Sound holes: Often I wasn't able to hear dialogue, even in cut scenes. Weapon noises would disappear from time to time and the music would clip weirdly.Cover mechanics: So very buggy. Often I'd shoot into the cover itself, even with my cross hairs well clear of the cover itself. I also managed to fall through the world one time, because I clipped through the cover somehow.The game has an awful awful AWFUL mouse acceleration that makes you do weird twists and turns very often, disorienting you thoroughly.The textures look OLD. Of course that's due to it being a mobile port, but they've had 9 months to do something about that. They could even have used some Deus Ex: Human Revolution material to make it easier for themselves.Over all it feels like a super lazy job by the devs. I guess they try to make us swallow this crap by giving us the original Deus Ex for free.

												It is NOT a good PC port. It started as a mobile game set just before Deus Ex: Human Revolution and shares similar qualities with it HR, but, there are ZERO graphics settings so the only benefit you get on PC is that you can play with a controller. It has some assets that certainly look like they are from HR but the menus are very different and gameplay is nowhere near what HR accomplished. And yes, it still looks like an iPhone game set to the resolution of your PC. It looks horrible and the only reason I feel happy that I got it is because I got a free copy of the original Deus Ex GOTY since I bought this game 8 hours before it came out. 3/10 They tried			"

Deus Ex: The Fail Fall is literally the worst game of the series. Sure, Invisible War has problems; Sure, Human Revolution has its problems- But this game is just... terrible. Invisible War and Human Revolution both have good things and bad things, but at least they were competent and complete. Oh yeah, The Fail Fall isn't a complete game, it ends with a cliffhanger ""To be Continued"". This is first Deus Ex game to not be a complete story, and it's doubtful it will ever be completed because The Fail's Fall's a piece of ♥♥♥♥ing dog garbage.The gameplay is just a dumbed down Human Revolution with terrible controls. The inventory has been completely removed, and now you can buy any items from anywhere in the game! Yeah, the stores from HR have been removed and instead you can just buy weapons, ammo, and items at anytime, anywhere. You can hold as many weapons as you want now, because you just equip weapons through this store menu. I'm sure the original mobile version of this game probably included microtransactions, too!The levels are terrible and unmemorable. In my opinion, some of the best levels of Human Revolution are those long levels in security buildings and stuff like that. However, The Fail Fall only has one level similar to those! Not only that, that level is only a sheer imitation of its counter-part. Oh, I forgot to say, at the end of the game they hint the next level will be a level like that... but guess what....""TO BE CONTINUED""Yeah... this game sucks...The story is so♥♥♥♥♥♥I'm not even going to talk about it because it isn't even ♥♥♥♥in' complete!So in conclusion, I'd say Deus Ex: The Fail is...""THIS REVIEW TO BE CONTINUED""-MandatoryAlcatraz "

												If you have the burning desire to play Deus Ex on your phone, go pick this up for iOS or Android, but as a PC game, it's a disaster. I don't care that it's a mobile port. If you're going to release it for PC, it should be altered to work well on a PC, and this doesn't. Deus Ex: Human Revolution is one of my favorite games of all time, and I was expecting more of the same. Instead, I got a pale imitation with clunky and unresponsive controls, keys you can't rebind, people who look like they're from a game a decade older, disappearing bodies, a ubiquitous store screen that lets you materialize a weapon out of nowhere, and areas so small, it feels like there's a load screen every 90 seconds. No matter how much you loved Human Revolution, this is awful.			"

This would have been better had they just cloned DE: HR, thrown in another storyline and called it a new product.			"

												Okay, so I gave the game a break. The reviews said that you couldn't rebind keys, annoying but not critical. And the inventory system, notice I left out the work ""managment"" there, is pretty mobile/console esque. So no deciding what equipment to pick up and what to trow away. The graphics where fine, and the story was good. The one problem was that when I finally got comfortable with the controls and started getting into the mystery of the story it abruptly ended. I don't know what I was expecting, but this is a half baked demo at best. Skip it and spend your money elsewhere.			"

												I've heard some nasty things about Deus Ex: The Fall, so I booted it up cautiously. I'm a fan of Icarus Effect, the prequel novel to Human Revolution which this game pulls its characters and plot from, and I ventured into this game with the understanding that I may or may not get burned. What I found was a game that really wasn't all that bad, for being an iOS port job.The most immediate thing you'll notice is the inferior graphics when compared to Human Revolution. This is natural for a straight port of a tablet/phone game, and doesn't really bother me. In fact, I consider it a plus, as the game actually runs very well with my integrated Intel setup. You'll then notice the widely varying quality of voicework, ""eh"" models, and stiff animations. The protagonist seems fidgety in conversation, but his entire upper body fidgets in a way that makes it seem as though his neck can't move, resulting in him turning his chest and head at the same time to look left and right and left and right and never at the person that he's talking to.This is the sort of thing that you'll notice the game over. Everything's a little downgraded from Human Revolution, but not so downgraded as to ruin the game. There are certainly a number of faults, some of which I will be going over, but despite it all, the game is still fun to play. If you just want a little more Human Revolution and you've already played The Missing Link, then The Fall can do an alright enough job of filling that void for six or so hours.Actually, on that note, let's just go ahead and address the length. I don't know what's going on with these people who complain that the game's so short because they beat it in two or four hours. You'd honestly have to be sprinting from objective to objective and ignoring all of the side quests for that to happen on your first playthrough. My first time through I explored the world, stealthed my way through everything, and did every sidequest available. Took me around nine hours. I'm not saying you'll definitely get nine, but expect at least six or seven if your goal is to enjoy the game, and not to reach the ending as quickly as possible.The Fall is definitely easier than Human Revolution. Enemies don't spot you as easily, you can do takedowns and hack things while in cover and without poking your head out, and there aren't really enough consequences for being seen. If there are no enemies within the immediate vicinity, there's literally no reason to avoid being spotted by a camera. There aren't even any achievements for staying out of sight. Bodies disappear after a few seconds of being dead or unconscious. Other enemies can still see them for those few seconds, but once they fizzle out you're in the clear. Sneaking up on enemies and executing a takedown is still rewarding, it's just a little cheaper. And getting shot is certainly dangerous and something to be avoided. In fact, in close quarters, I've found that enemies can sometimes (and by sometimes I mean kind of embarrassingly often, in my case) shoot you for a one-hit kill.There's no difficulty select in The Fall. You just start the game and go. Once you finish it, you can start again in new game+ with a tougher difficulty, but it turns out that that just means that the enemies have more health. The enemies are found in the same numbers, and they aren't any more aware of their surroundings. They just take a fat ton of shots to kill, which, if you're stealthing, should never even be a factor.You can also go anywhere as soon as you get to the hub area. Anywhere at all that's accessible from that hub. There are no plot significant reasons keeping you from wandering into a place where you don't need to go yet, and murdering everything inside. In fact, the final minutes of the game can be made easier if you head through the area ahead of time and hack things and shut stuff down awhile.There are visual glitches. The mouse tends to linger onscreen for a bit too long after closing anything that makes it appear, like ebooks and computer screens. Takedown animations have the worst of it, though. But as this doesn't really affect the gameplay and you'll be watching the same couple animations over and over again anyways, I find it more amusing than annoying.Shooting is mostly from the hip-ish, which isn't as big of a problem as it sounds. You just have to get used to aiming better. Or, you know, forego guns and knock people out. Grenades aren't fun to aim, though. I usually save before throwing one because I know I'll probably miss once or twice.Also, I don't entirely understand one major mechanic of hacking, which is that sometimes I can hack a node that's been taken over by the red node's creeping influence, but other times I can't. I wasn't able to figure out what decides this before I had enough praxis points in hacking that I never had to cross the problem again, anyways.Apparently there were microtransactions in the iOS version, but those have thankfully been removed, here (unlike, say, Halo: Spartan Assault which hates you and wants you to know it). The persistent store still remains, and you can buy items at anytime with in-game currency, rather than finding a character in the hub to buy from. This can make things easier when you're low on snacks or booze (which I actually usually was, as I found it fun to drink ten bottles of beer and then pretend the audio was funky because I was having war flashbacks), but if you're smart you won't need to buy anything other than extra praxis kits because why be a human with a gun when you can be an invisible superhuman with the ability to shiskebab two low-paid hotel guards with families at the same time?Deus Ex: The Fall can be fun if you're not expecting another Human Revolution DLC. It's lower quality in most aspects, but it's still worth a play. There's less detail than you might hope, but there was honestly more than I had expected, considering its original platform. The levels don't feel empty, things proceed quickly and can be as actiony as you'd like them to be. Unlike, say, Halo: Spartan Assault, where everything is slow and boring and levels are like three minutes long with twelve enemies to kill. It has a few social battles, it has some variety in action locations, and the writing and plot aren't awful (though the voice acting sometimes is). I do personally think that the game might have been better suited to being mission-based, rather than having a Human Revolution-styled hub. It's neat, but if you're going to make this mobile, I'd just like to jump in and out of some stealth, you know?Also, I feel like I should mention that this is not a complete story. It ends on a to be continued, which is a bit of a bummer as I doubt whether we'll ever actually see another installment (which would have taken us to Australia, where I've been wanting to go in one of these ever since first reading about the Australian War in Icarus Effect).Deus Ex: The Fall is decent enough. If you can find it for $2.50, or maybe even $5 if you're feeling adventurous, it'll work off its debt. And for the love of J.C. Denton, don't buy Halo: Spartan Assault. That's $3 I'll never get back.			"

												I'm currently only part way through, but these are my impressions thus far.TL;DR. Do not pay more than a dollars or so for this game. And only buy it if you wish to say ""I have ALL the Deus Ex games"" at parties and/or special events.I had played Deus Ex: Human Revolution imediately prior to this, so this has shaped my judgement on DX:The FallWhat I likeI like the ability to vault over cover. I think that is a cool / cute addition to the game.ummmmm... Alright, then:What I don't likeI think this would be better served as a list. Inability to jump. Come on. Seriously? I know this was a tablet/phone touch screen based game but come on.  NPCs lack of personality / movement in open world. NPCs lack of personality / movement in cut scenes. The voice acting. It's stilted and... bored? Sounds like they collected a bunch of people who'd never done this before. You can't shorten the cut scenes! Ahhh! I don't care. I want less of your stilted, stiff recitation of your lines. I know you're an NPC, who says the same lines over and over, but don't burden me with your problems! ... oh, right, sorry - reviewing. Do you even headshot? Apparently, there are invisible objects EVERYWHERE O_O preventing the ol'sneaky-sneaky 'round the corner headshot' The haphazard way that shots hit enemies. The secondary weapon/item selector systems. You get three use keys. (I think I'll get used to this though - one is for world items, the other two are for items/grenades.) The is a disjoint between the mouse pointer and the options in menus & switching between some options. Buttons you click on, frequently don't actually acknowledge the interaction. It's short. It's like a two or so sitting to completion.It's fairly safe to say, that while I'm replaying DX:HR for the second time - I'll never launch this game again.			"

Costa Rica is an interesting location for a Deus Ex game; it's nice to have a slightly different flair to the city. This isn't a long game, but for the price, you get a decent amount of content. There are a couple new weapons/mods to use, which are fun. The bad: This is a port from mobile platforms, and the controls were poorly done IMO. They just seem very finicky and timing for quick movements is difficult. The graphics are not up to the standard of Deus Ex Human Revolution, again due to the port. The game was intended to be the first in a series, but the others have not yet been made, so the ending leaves you hanging. General info: The player character, Ben Saxon, was introduced to the Deus Ex universe in the companion novel The Icarus Effect, which takes place just prior to and during Human Revolution. If you enjoy the lore of Deus Ex, this is a nice little addition with some more info on one of the Tyrants. The game gets a lot of hate, but I think most of that is due to the poor PC port. If you know what to expect going in, I think it can be enjoyable for fans of the series.Overall: Would recommend it to those who are already Deus Ex fans; if you've never played a Deus Ex game before, start with the original Deus Ex or Human Revolution first.System Specs Used: Intel Core i7-3610QM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 670M / 3GB GDDR5, DDRIII 12GB RAM, Windows 7			"

												I was a massive fan of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and I was expecting a lot from this prequel. However, if the lack of the ability to jump says anything about this, it seems like a MASSIVE technological step backwards from DE:HR. Using a controller, the hacking system is unusuable, due to the sensitivity for the controller jumping many magnitudes as soon as you enter into the hacking mode. On top of that, the combat system is messed up, and the stealth system makes very little sense. Some enemies can hear you from across the map, while others are nearly entirely deaf. Enemy bodies disappear, making the entire body-hiding mechanic null and void. Also, it's nearly, if not wholly, impossible to get a headshot in the game, which instantly makes it impossible to kill someone from a distance and not alert every enemy around, once again destroying the stealth mechanic. The cover is ridiculous as well, my head bobbing clearly above the edges of the cover, with oblivious enemies glaring intently at me without seeing a thing. It's really a twisted combination of irritating, confusing, and hilarious.Overall, I feel like this game was a waste of money. Perhaps some serious patching could fix the gameplay, but either way, the game is depressingly short, and the saving system is also pretty jacked, since there can only be one save at a time, and the game doesn't even save after completing a mission, only on a level change. This was a sad waste of money in its current state, and has hurt my faith in Square Enix as a company.			"

												The bad reviews for this game are bs... The story, setting and gameplay is interesting/good, and the only real issue is the bug which causes ""click detection"" issues (which only happens in menus). If you enjoyed the two first Deus Ex games, pick this one up, preferably on sale because the game is not so long. You should play this after the first two, but before Human Revolution :)			"

												For me this game is a guilty pleasure. A Deus EX snack right before the main dish - Humankind Divided.Here we get a better understanding of the plight of augmented people and their neuropozyne addiction. In Human Revolution, with Adam, it is easy to forget about the drug dependency, since it doesn't have any impact on the player. So I am thankful for the different perspective. It adds value to the series.It is sad to see that this game has so many negative reviews, because it isn't a bad game, it is just unpolished. Please keep in mind, that it was originally made as a mobile game. It isn't fair to compare it to HR. I really find it charming and enjoyable. I hope this didn't discourage the Devs, I really want a continuation of Ben and Anna's story.			"

												If you're looking for more Deus Ex: Human Revolution, then this is the wrong game.The voice acting is horrible and rather laughable at times.  The controls are muddy.  The audio is buggy.  Often the background music will play and cut off all other sound (voice-overs, foot steps, bullets being fired, everything except the background music).You can tell that it's a sloppy port from iOS.  I can only hope the controls and audio are better on iOS, but that won't fix the bad voice acting.			"

												This is a slice of the Deus Ex universe. And thats about it. Took me 3 hours to complete with most of the side quests as well. This game is a mobile port and it shows. However it does a good job of copying Dues Exs core mechanics. I cant recommend this game however because of the story and length . Its way too short and the story leads nowhere. This game came out in 2014 for pc and ends with a ""to be continued.... "" Ha! like a conclusion will come after 3 years ( at writiing this review) Its almost a scary sign of the Square Enix plan going forwards. Cutting games up to finish at a later date or merely leaving to the side. I hope we see more games in the Deus Ex franchise. More like Human Revolution and less like this and Man Kind Divided. "

												The first chapter of an intended (and never finished) series, Deus Ex: The Fall manages to very competently convey some of the basic ideas of Human Revolution, but essentially never manages to use them in any meaningful way. You barely have space to begin exploring what you can do with the game before it's over, and the few levels in the game are geared towards this low-powered approach, meaning there aren't many opportunities for a player to get creative or work around tough obstacles.Half of what's in this game is good, but the other half is tutorial and filler for the start of a game that never gets BEYOND the start, and the confusing microtransaction-esque menu and other clunky design decisions leave it in the 'forgettable' category. I find it a pity, as the story seemed headed in an interesting direction.			"

												I had low expectations, I've read the PC Gamer review but being a Deus Ex fan I bought it anyway but the truth is I'm actually enjoying the game. When compared to other games on the series, this one is without doubt, the weakest but being a spin-off and actually having a low launch price(10€ offers the first Deus Ex from 2000) kinda makes up for it in my opinion.Let's get down to business, the game is a straight mobile port, it has low polygon models, average textures anmd it is clear that it is a mobile port because, you can't jump, the control scheme is mobile friendly and there's some bugs on the GUI that are a consequence of the ""touch"" to mouse conversion done badly. With that said, it feels like a bare-bones Human Revolution experience, and a small one, but while it  might lack much replay value and there are some hard to ignore faults, the experience is fun and that's what counts in my opinion, it does leave you the feeling that it could be so much more.Why do I recommend this game then? Because if you don't compare it to the other Deux Ex games, it's enjoyable, it's a side story in the Deux Ex universe, and I think it's worth at a 6€ or lower price gauging for the experience it provides versus the faults.My final word?

												I love Deus Ex. I loved HR. I never played this on a tablet or anything, so when I saw it here for just a few bucks it seemed like a great idea to try, even if I knew it wouldn't be anywhere near as polished as its predecessor. And I was completely and utterly unprepared for how bad it is. The story is alright, at least. The screenshots up there look acceptable but rest assured, most of the time it looks like garbage. The animation is bad. Lips don't sync at all, characters are all wooden. And it's buggy to boot: I gave up in the first chapter after falling through the floor four different times. The whole thing is a port, and it definitely comes across like an atrociously bad port. Just avoid this. The scraps of story it offers aren't sufficient to redeem it to the real DX fans.			"

												I am a huge Deus Ex fan. My first deus ex was at age 23 and I am a 36 year old man. Do not play this on pc. It is terrible. Everything looks low quality and plays like a shockwave flash game from the 90's. I now feel incomplete that I can't say that I have played every deus ex game ever but if I finish this game I am going to end up hating the franchise. When you take an amazing pc game and move it into lesser hardware this is what happens.			"

Many levels with multiple rooms in them, its a real jump in technology.The dialogue is gripping and the voice actors the best I have heard so far.I am truly glad that I got over my phobia of games and upgraded from my Spectrum with this, it even runs smoothly on it!Weird, innit?

 Deus Ex: The Fall After seeing all the hate this game got I still bought it because I love Deus Ex and wanted to give this game a honest review. While I understand all the hate this game does do some things good.The gameplay:This game plays almost completely the same as Deus ex: Human Revolution only worse and with less features.You got your choice of going loud or stealth into a situation and overall you get quite a bit of choice.Hacking is complety the same and the weapons are a mix of new ones and older ones already in Human Revolution.One thing this game does very wrong is having a shop that you can use at any time taking away most of the reason to explore.The graphics:Are very outdated and quite frankly ugly, character models are not good looking textures look bad and the gun models look undetailed. It has the same orange glow style that Human Revolution had.The soundtrackIs pretty good and the sound design is pretty decent, voice acting is pretty good aswell.The story:I was very interested in the story and it was pretty nicely done the problem is this game is really short and I did not find any reason to replay it. It end suddenly and for no reason really and then just says to be continued in part 2 the thing with this is there is no part 2 and probaly will never be made.Conclusion:I find it sad how short this game was i enjoyed it but that is simply because its just like Human Revolution only worse.If it lasted longer I would recommend it a bit more because at the moment its just way to short.I say only buy this game if it is on sale for a low price.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, And checking out my Profile for more reviews.

 Story If there is a story, it's rushed and incomplete.  The game ends with a TO BE CONTINUED before it even picks up.You play as Ben Saxon, an ex-tyrant, who is off the grid. You are trying to find a supply of Neuropozyne so that your body doesn't reject your augmentations while you (GIRLFRIEND???) stays at home and suffers from Neuropozyne withrawl. Gameplay You can tell it's an iOS port. It's bad, real bad.Sometimes while shooting, your gun will stop.   It won't start shooting again untill you select another gun and then go back to the your original weapon.  There's so many loading screens. Go five feet to reach that loading screen over there to go another five feet and reach a loading screen and then come back and you've wasted 5 minutes of your life only to realize that you've just completed the most unrewarding sidequest you've ever done. The lack of a decent physics engine causes you not to be able to pick up boxes and move them out of your way or throw them at enemies, instead you press E and the box slides into a set position, sometimes from behind an airvent. To top it off, you get a crappy AI that throws grenades in the wrong direction and can't see you while you're in front of them. Conclusion This is a bad stealth game. This is a bad FPS. This is a bad Deus Ex game. It's unfinished and probably never will be.Spend your money on any other Deus Ex game if you want a solid stealth fps. Lemon-Lime/Orange (3/10)  "

												I´ve just started playing and I haven´t finished the first mission yet. However, here are my comments:CONSThis doesn´t look like an Action RPG, instead, it is surely an Action Game. Hence, it seems to be no RPG elements.PROSMovement are smooth;Inventory gives players the full list of weapons, items, gadgets possible to be found throughout the gameplay;Visual and environment resemble previous DE HR installment;Gamepad users can choose from customized keyboard assigned keys plus Xpadder-like software or a full XBOX controller support;Aiming system is combined into shooting system. I mean, hold to aim, release to shoot;Cover movement includes the vault feature like Mass Effect 3;Weapons upgrade is visual. Now, you can see which upgrades can be used for which weapon. I mean, now every weapon has it own list of possible upgrade in a more visual way.It seems to be a enjoyable game. "

												This PC port is pretty much trash, as you can see from the other reviews, but the game itself is actually not bad. Ben Saxon's haircut is atrocious, that's true, but the mobile version frequently goes on sale on Google Play for about $1, and it's an excellent mobile game. The controls are smooth and customizable, the graphics are very Deus Ex and pretty nice for mobile, and the story is decent (not amazing, especially compared to DX or DX:HR, but decent). It's one of the most satisfying shooting experiences I've had on a phone, anyways. But yes, the PC port is pretty much trash.Rating (Steam version): 1/5Rating (Deus Ex: The Fall overall): 4/55: Loved it; 4: Liked it; 3: It's OK; 2: Didn't like it; 1: Hated it "

												As a big fan of Deus Ex games, I had to buy this game eventually. Playing it was mediocre, until ""ending""... It was disappointment. To the players that are new for the series; go and grap Deus Ex: Human Revolution instead.- Solid 5 hours gameplay time + 2-3 hours if you are achievement hunter- There was no keyboard binding option at the time of my playthrough (I read update news that option for binding keys came 2 days after my play time)- Atmosphere is pretty much same like in Deus Ex: HRPoints 1-10- Graphics 6/10- Story 4/10 because cliffhanger of the ending- Gameplay 6/10Overall score: 4/10 because of huge effect of the storyRecommend only if:- You are very, I mean VERY huge fan of Deus Ex series- You can buy it at least -75 %			"

 The FailDeus Ex: Human Revolution was one of my top games of the last console generation with it's innovative gameplay, memorable characters, and an all around excellent presentation. With it's prequel ""The Fall"" I expected a game with the same sort of quality  as Human Revolution, unfortunately this game is nothing more than a mobile port straight to PC.---The story in The Fall is a sequel to the story Deus Ex: Icarus Effect, a novel released around the same time as Human Revolution and providing a good side story for fans in the Deus Ex universe. In The Fall you play as Ben Saxon, an ex-military and ex-mercenary of The Tyrants (the three mercenaries from Human Revolution that shot up Sariff Industries) on the run with his friend Anna Kelso in Panama shortly after being betrayed by The Tyrants.Throughout the (short) story you will play as Ben running around Panama doing the main story and side missions, talking to people around the city, and having the choice of going into gun combat or using stealth.While Panama does not have the same detail and feel as Detroit in Human Revolution, it still feel's like being a part of the Deus Ex Universe and works okay.Unfortunately, a majority of the game is mediocre to poor.---The Good:- Fans of the series will enjoy revisiting the Deus Ex universe.- The soundtrack is very good with new tracks and returning tracks from Human Revolution.- The game has the same augmentation system from Human Revolution.- No micro-transactions.- The game has decent textures, anti-aliasing options, and ran on my cheap system at 60FPS.- Has a new game+ mode.- With a recent patch (most) controls are rebindable.The Bad:- Story and characters are weak.- No harder difficulty options other than new game+ mode.- The inventory system from Human Revolution is replaced with an inventory system with no ammo/item limits.- Item/weapon dealers are non-existent in The Fall as you will buy everything through the inventory system.- Selling items/weapons is not an option.- When an enemy is knocked out or killed their bodies simply disappear rather than remain.- The AI is not smart and tend to miss shots.- Ben takes quite a bit of damage before dying making the game too easy.- Only one save slot and quick save.- Guns have almost no recoil (and this is before upgrading recoil reduction augments)- While the game's environment look okay, character models looks atrocious with bad animations.- Voice acting is also not great.- The game is extremely easy and short, with no real need to replay other than wanting to earn achievements. - and even more.---Throughout my entire playthrough the game was a disappointment and I spent a majority of the time comparing the game to Human Revolution, completing the game in 4-5 hours with a short TO BE CONTINUED ending. While I received my copy as a gift and only goes for $10 on Steam (even cheaper during sales) I cannot recommend this game to many people including Deus Ex fans.If you are going to play this, expect a very mediocre to poor experience.

												Why is this even a thing?If you loved every single second from ""Deus Ex: Human Revolution"", you will be pretty dissapointed with this game. Story is boring, dialogues are a one big emotionless meh, model animations are awkward with lifeless artificial stare into the bottom of your soul, controls are sloppy and uncomfortable. And hey... Didn't you just loved the freedom of choise in Human Revolution? Well, forget about it... You will be walked from the beginning untill the end by the tutorial sistem, which will tell you ""You know that praxis you have? Use them on that skill to get past the obstacle you are having infront of you. No, there is no other way. No, you can't lvl up whatever you want, do as I tell you"".It's pretty dissapointing. But if you overlook all these details and you really love ""Deus Ex"" series, you could buy it. You shouldn't, though, in my personal opinion. This game exhales MEH with every step you take, but the worst part is not even all that I mentioned before. The worst part is, this game is INCOMPLETE, it's just a FIRST EPISODE of saga that will never be continued because of the storm of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t this game is. So, yeah... Enjoy that terrible abortion of a game if you can but I would not recommend it to anyone... Ever.Tl/Dr: This game is a fat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (Mentally challanged) brother of ""Deus Ex: Human Revolution"".

												It pains me not to recommend this game because Deus Ex is one of my favourite franchises, for the same reasons I also love the Elder Scrolls. The universe is full of detailed history, unique subject matter, and great RPG options, but with The Fall you only get the tiniest peak into what is an otherwise magnificent franchise. Keeping in mind that it is a port, the controls are clunky and force you to almost ignore what was a great cover/stealth system released in the complete Human Revolution title, and I can't understnd why it wouldn't have been worthwhile to simply redo The Fall with all the polish and joy of the other engine. If I was the King of Square Enix, I would be expecting ritual seppuku from whoever's bright idea it was to release such an embarrassment to the public. I can't believe they allowed it to be released.If you are new to the Deus Ex franchise DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME FIRST, and please don't judge those of us who would normally sing the praise of Edios' jewel.

Posted: March 23, 2014
												Before i begin, let me say that the game as it is right now has several issues, including a bug with vsync that makes the game unplayable with broken mouse controls and recoil. If you have seen TotalBiscuit's WTF is... video you'd know what i'm talking about (note that TB didn't notice that this is caused from vsync). The workaround is to enable vsync, but this introduces input lag. The developers should fix this ASAP. But in hopes that they do, i'm going to ignore that for now. Now about the game. AFAIK story-wise this is supposed to be the sequel of a book (Icarus Effect), which itself was a prequel to the story of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Sadly the game doesn't seem to make much of a introduction to this and for the first hour or so you will feel disconnected from the characters since it starts assuming that you already know them. Personally i had never read the book (i actually didn't knew about it, but now i will try and get it) so it took me a while to get any attachment with the characters. As the game began i didn't knew why i should care about the main character, especially considering his background. The fact that the game seems to ignore some parts of the book didn't help either (at least according to people who have read it). Fortunately after a while, once you start figuring out what the actual story of the game is all about (which happens about when you meet the crook doctor, a few moments after TB decided to stop playing the game, if you watched that video) both the characters and story start to pick up and become interesting.The game's visuals are ok, they remind me of some early 2000s games. The environments are good to look at, although if you have a large monitor you'll certainly notice the low texture resolution and the bad tiling in a few of them doesn't help either. Still, as far as environments go, they are nice to look at and remind of lower fidelity version of HR's environments. The worse parts IMO are the character models: they look attrocious, especially the heads of the woman junkies which are all over the place. The lighting on them equeally bad, as if someone didn't knew about smoothing groups in 3ds max or whatever modelling program they used and there doesn't seem to be enough animations for all the character actions (f.e. at several points the enemies will try to strafe left and right but there isn't any animation for that so they just slide with their feet motionless). The only good model is the one of the pilot you'll meet near the end, but even that looks like a bad copy of Faridah Malik (and apparently in the Deus Ex:HR universe all pilots must have a mole :-P). But if you can ignore the bad character modelling, the game looks fine. Technically it is quite simple, but as a theme the visuals work fine.The best part IMO is the sound - the guns sound good and the music is really good. At a couple of places i just stopped playing for a while to listen to the background music. Most of it sounds like a remixed version of HR's music (which i suppose it is) but i think there are a couple of original scores as well.Sadly, following the bad modelling the game also has bad voice acting with hilariously awful accents. The only good audio come from the TV broadcaster Eliza, which i assume uses the same voice actor as HR. The writing doesn't help either since in many cases you'll be left wondering why the writers thought that a specific line was a good idea.The gameplay is basically a simplified version of HR's gameplay. You still have the hacking, shooting, sneaking, etc as HR and the original game, but the RPG elements are mostly removed beyond a very simplistic upgrade system (which most of the time isn't needed, except in a couple of areas where you have to use a specific augmentation). Also you can upgrade guns, but i didn't notice that, never needed it and finally decided to try it out almost at the end of the game but even after upgrading a gun to the maximum settings it didn't made much of a difference. Also there is an in-game shop where you get to buy stuff with in-game currency that you gain by doing stuff. I suspect that on iOS this was tied to IAP because the shop is available at any point (not just to some vendor or whatever like in HR) and contains almost everything you may want, including even a kit that brings you back to life when you die. This makes the game much easier, although the most interesting items are expensive enough so that you don't get them instantly. Still, it removes the tension from small things like running out of bullets (since the price of the bullets is very low).The level design is ok, but for the first few levels it is quite linear. The interesting levels begin at the slums, where you start getting alternative routes and more areas to explore (incintentally this is where TB stopped playing). Up to that point it was mostly linear and played more like a tutorial than the real game. I think the devs thought nobody would have played HR so they wanted to reintroduce the gameplay - and did it in the worst way possible, by destroying most first impressions and filling the first few moments with awful tutorial panels with one of the most obnoxious voices you'll hear in a tutorial. The game however becomes even more interesting in the later stages like in the hotel.Wrapping it up (and because i got bored typing this :-P), i think that there is a good game in there that tries to come out and the story is interesting, but the way it is told and the presentation (as far as animation and character models  go at least) isn't up to the task. I don't recommend it for the full price, especially considering the bugs that the game has, but i would recommend it if the bugs were fixed and the price was halved. It does have some interesting moments and does provide some story to the Deus Ex universe that seems to fit in, so it has that going for it. Also the gameplay, even if simplistic, can be enjoyable - if you can overlook the first hour or so.I'm not generally recommending this game unless you are a fan of Deus Ex that is curious to see what this has to offer (and again, i'd recommend to wait for a price drop). If the bugs are  fixed and the price is dropped, i may change my recommendation to Yes, but even then be cautious about the other issues that the game has and mentioned above.			"

I bought this game a while back when it was only $2 and after enduring just under an hour of trying to see this game through, it's simply just not worth it.I don't have a clue how this game is $10. It's not even worth your time if it was FREE. Here is what you get in Deus Ex: The Fall:-A story that should be interesting but absolutely isn't-Abysmal voice acting-N64 style FPS (you can't jump, plenty of tight corridors, when characters talk outside of cutscenes their mouths don't move, etc.)-You can't run. You can walk or walk slower.-Controls are clunky and buggy-INSANELY long audio logs scattered around. If you want story, prepare to stand still in a room for several minutes at a time. The voice acting in the audio logs are also awful.Plain and simple, this is a clunky half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cash grab.If you're absolutely hungry for more Deus Ex then don't make the mistake by playing this. Play DX1 or DX: Revision, play DX:HR again, play Invisible War even! Anything else with the Deus Ex name is far more worth your time.Avoid/Don't Recommend/Stay Away/Kill It With Fire/0 out of 10/I Didn't Ask For This.			"

												I think I got this game in a Humble Bundle sale or something, at least I really hope I didn't pay much for it. I played about an hour now, and I can't decide what I dislike most about this game. Is it the horrible quality of textures? Maybe the terrible.. terrible voice acting? Or is it just the gameplay that feels sluggish and far from immersive?I didn't realize this was originally a mobile game. This explains why the textures and lighting is pretty sh*t, but there's no excuse for the horrible voice acting and gameplay.I played all DE games, and after DE:HR, I expected much more of this, but it's probably the worst game in the series.Just don't get it and act like it never got released.

												This was one of those games that i really had hard time to decide if i was going to waste money on it or not, even being a Deus ex fan since start, finishing the game before even bought it, didnt help too.This was Mobile game that was ported to the PC with so little effort in it that almost granted all the sales only by using Deus Ex label, wich may pass wrong impression for new player that come for the first time to the franchise and start by first playing this game.There isnt any comparation with any of the games released to date, and is shame to see such poor game linked to a great series, but its not all bad things, and if we can forget about the other games while playing the Fall, you can still get something out of it, because the setting is there, it was just poorly executed.The game isnt optimazed for PC since lack some of its features, the graphics are poor and even voice actors are just hilarious to game that wants to be linked with Deus Ex world.To fans, it may be something to have in your library if you can buy it on sale, to a common shooter fan, you have far better options on steam store.

												Ugh, I don't know whether to be sad or angry about this game. It's obviously a modded version of the original xbox dx:hr then backported to PC. The UI is horribly large and controller-optimized. You can't rebind keys for keyboard+mouse - you only have a quick graphical guide to what the keys do like on most xbox games. The model complexity and shaders in game are terribad. Animations are clumsy and some aspects of the game are dumbed down.Backporting aside, the game itself. The story takes some elements from the original deus ex and incorporates them into the DX:HR world. But, the writing is lackluster, and the VA is not well done at all. In fact, some of the dialogue VA is missing from the game, as are sound effects.I really wish I hadn't gotten this game.			"

												I usually don't review games, but this is necessary.  This is by far and away the biggest waste of $10 I have spent on a video game.  I don't know how they managed to ruin the combat system so much from Deus Ex Human Revolution which wasn't that great to begin with.  There's nothing really worth playing here.  A mediocore at best story line, with the clunkiest cover system I've seen.  You won't figure much out about Deus Ex Human Revolution by playing The Fall.  It's a plain terrible game.  I hope they release more content but actually spend more than a couple of weeks throwing it together.  Seriously, what a dissapointment from the original game.  Do not buy.			"

												This ""game"" is a joke...that's all it is, it's a joke compared to the franchise RPG fans grew up with.  Setting itself up as the Spin-Off of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, you play as Ben Sakson, ex-Tyrant who has some cheap voice acting, even with the reprising cast from HR.  The story does have potential, but the cheap characters won't live up to the franchise' legacy.  Maybe if this wasn't a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥port of a mobile game, then we wouldn't have to worry about the franchise for a second time, like we feared Deus Ex: Invisible War.The Negatives-Voice acting ranges from cheap to terrible-The graphics were clearly not updated for the Steam version-The Key Bindings are awkward and terrible, you can't even change them either-The game claims it has ""Full"" controller support, but the Left Stick and Start button don't work!-The Right Stick/Mouse sensitivity is out of control-Open world and Jumping are eliminated (mobile game)-The shooting mechanics are both wonky and slow-The cover mechanics are broken-A.I. range from psycic mediums that know where you are to outright idiots who can't see perapheral vision!-THIS GAME COSTS REAL MONEY			"

												I'm betting a lot of us know about the debacle that came when they tried to import Bioshock to the iOS and wound up with a horrible mess of trying to change a fast paced FPS game into something you can play with a touch screen.This is the same problem, but in reverse. Deus Ex: The Fall was originally intended for the iOS and Android, but they brought it to the PC exactly as is.The controls are awful, moving is a chore, and the game was clearly designed with a touch screen in mind. Now it's just a glitchy broken mess where no matter how much you change the mouse sensitivity your character will insist on taking his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time moving his gun around even if enemies are blasting away at him from all sides.If you want a good newer title for this series get Deus Ex: Human Revolution (the ending is meh, but the rest is great). If you want this game, get an iPad.			"

												Buying this was a painful reminder to always check reviews before getting something. It's actually a ported Android game, and I guess it's fine if you want something to play on your tablet. But as a PC game, especially a Deus Ex game, it's a joke.The UI is big and weird, and not just in the usual console port way. It's really strange and awkward to use with a mouse. (It's probably more or less the original made-for touch-screens interface)The tutorial forces me to do very specific things, like attaching a silencer to a certain weapon. So much for player choice.While the art style definitely looks like DX:HR, the level design is much simpler, the rooms are smaller, more blocky and your choice of non-obvious approaches usually boils down to a single alternative air-vent route.Combat doesn't feel that great, you basically have the same cover system as in DX:HR, but it didn't work as well, can't quite say why exactly, it just isn't as satisfying. And the AI is really wonky and stupid.I can't say much about the story, since I didn't play that much, but it certainly wasn't interesting enough to keep me playing despite of the lackluster gameplay.Finally, my GTX 980 didn't even go above 35° C when playing, which tells you everything you need to know about this game's graphics.

Without saying much about the actual game, the gameplay, controls, animations, models, and textures were massively improved from the Vita original to be close to par with actual games. This however, shows no change from the ios version. Textures are garbage, controls are locked in a garbage setup, models are garbage, and the whole unlock system reeks of mobile gaming. You can't even jump. That's right, there is NO JUMPING in this pile of trash. Lowest possible effort in a mobile port I've ever seen. The game is quite enjoyable as a mobile game on a touchscreen device as it is meant to be. If you want it, get it on your phone.

												I finally went back and beat this game. In summary:-A laughable TWO HOUR story-Awful voice acting, not even worth the merit of hilarity that the original game attained-Gameplay that feels more like a low-quality fan-made DX:HR clone than a fully licensed Deus Ex game-Extremely small levels with far less options of traversal than the other Deus Ex games-The AI is botched to the point where you can brush the back of an enemy's leg and he somehow won't see you-A very sudden, abrupt cliffhanger ending that literally reads ""to be continued"" (oh boy I wonder how the sequel is coming along)I understand this is a mobile port, but I thought the idea of bringing this to PC would to showcase its true potential, whereas it actually ends up feeling more like a sloppily cobbled together itch.io fan game.As a huge fan of the Deus Ex franchise I just cannot recommend this, even to the biggest fan of the franchise. I feel like that's fairly obvious though, considering the amount of negative reception the game has received. delet this/10 "

												Quite the good game, even keeping in mind its port from mobile platform. Yeah, it's simplified a lot, has small locations, somewhat buggy (hacking interface doesn't scroll), but otherwise it's a good side story to DXHR, plays good. Recommended to play.			"

												This game does not totally destroy the Deus Ex expeerience, although they really did try.  I didn't expect perfection.  i actually like the story line so far. I  haven't been able to figure out how to use the hacking ability.  I can't get it to work same way twice. I even wound up using a combination of the keyboard, mouse and controller and i still don't know how I made it work.  If they are really planning to release more episodes, I hope that they go back and take a close look at what they did and didn't do and at least try for a game with some degree of the Deus Ex quality that we all have come to expect.

												I think this is one of those games that as a player you're implicitly supposed to bash, or otherwise you loose credibility in the gaming community. I can't care less about the gaming community and what people think I should say about what I play, so I can honestly tell you: I enjoyed this game.First of all, a disclaimer: all the negative reviews made me hesitant about whether or not getting the game in the first place (that's what a Negative rating does on Steam). But I had loved DXHR, enjoyed the first Deus Ex (I'm still missing Invisible Wars, another one people are supposed to bash by default, apparently), so when I found it on sale on Humble Bundle a few days ago, I decided to buy it nevertheless.That said, absolutely DON'T buy the game at full price. But at 2/3€ or something like that, if you're a fan, definitely buy it. At the very least, you get some quality entertainment in a world you've learned to love.And from the experience point of view, I was pleasantly surprised. Apart from some quirky UI controls (e.g., how you're supposed to swipe scrollable text, which makes it obvious it is a mobile port) and a couple of bugs (I had to change the vsync setting to get hacking to work) I enjoyed the game. It looks and feels very much like DXHR, even though of course in a simplified way: the game is simpler, graphics do look a bit cheaper (enemies and NPCs are often recycled, less animations in general), but the sound effects and soundtracks are great, the UI is very similar, so are the minigames, and most of the game mechanics as well. I've read around that the game falls short anytime action takes place, but I've played all Deus Ex games with stealth in mind, so I never noticed anything particularly broken.One of the greatest critics is it's short: it took me 6 hours and a half to complete it, trying to complete as many quests as possible, which is a reasonable length I believe, especially for the price. People saying it takes 2/3 hours are rushing it, which means they never got Deus Ex in the first place. The Missing Link DLC was around there as well in terms of length. It does end in an ""episodic"" way, and apparently we're never going to learn how it ends, but the game does end in a more or less satisfactory way anyway, with no cliffhangers or anything like that, so I can't complain.Long story short: if you find it on sale, give it a try despite the hate: you might be surprised.

												Overall, I enjoyed the game; however I do agree with most of the points made by the majority of the negative reviews. For me, the story and gameplay are decent, but the combat and controls -mainly the responsiveness in the menus- leave a lot to be desired. Obviously most of this has do to with the fact that its a port, from mobile devices, and a very poor one at that. I also didn't like how atleast as far as i could tell you are unable to sell things you don't want/need anymore, and there is no jumping, though you don't really need it, as there is nothing to jump onto, you can do some slide move to get over some obstacles. The cover mechanic and the controls surrounding that are quite poor as well. TL:DR: Yes I reccommend this game, BUT only if its on sale or something, overall a short game and being a poor mobile port, not worth the $10 price tag. I believe i got it from the last humble bundle along with Deus Ex, Invisible War and HR, among others.			"

												The Fall tells the story of Ben, a mercenary, who works with Namir's team then gets betrayed. Essentially, the story is his struggle against his former team members while at the same time he tries to uncover why there is a shortage of the so-called Neuropozyne which is a must medicine for all augmented people.Now, what should be noted about the game is that while it looks similar to Human Revolution it is a toned-down version of it. This was initially released for iOS mobile systems but later on was ported to the PC. Unfortunately, many limitations remained on the PC version so much so that this is amongst the worst PC ports.The upside:- an interesting story that serves as a sort of prequel to Human Revolution; while it is not as complex or interesting as the ""main"" game it is nice to see Ben's story through and meeting some familiar faces during the missions- considering it was initially made for the iOS the game looks quite well - naturally, textures are of lower resolution and characters / objects consist of fewer polygons but the creators did their best to make a game that reminds us of Human Revolution - the story wraps up around 5 hours which is not bad for a game originally intended for mobile phone users; many achievements and a new game plus mode make sure we have a long-lasting experienceThe downside:- Putting aside the toned-down graphics the game has some awful limitations: jumping and picking up objects is simply not possible this time. While the former I did not particularly mind the latter would have been good for distracting enemies. Also, the inventory we have now represents the shop itself: all items show up in our inventory, we just need to buy the missing ones - provided we have enough cash. They could have just put a vendor guy somewhere in the slum to make it a little harder to purchase stuff.- Pressing buttons does not always work. It's best to click twice when picking options during dialogues as the game finds it really hard to register our selections in menus. During gameplay this is not an issue. Oh yeah and the menu options are simply HUGE - they could have just created a different main menu with smaller font size.- While the 5-hour long story I appreciated I did not understand the ""to be continued"" message at the end. The ""Pacifist"" achievement that refers to the story calls it ""Part 1"" which makes me assume originally there were plans to release further episodes. I guess the game did not do well financially.Deus Ex The Fall is an interesting game whose shortcomings mainly stem from the fact that it is a port. While I do appreciate what N-Fusion has done with a little more effort the result could have been closer to offering a real PC experience.Do I recommend this game? Well, if you are not a die hard Deus Ex fan I do not. But if you are and you do not mind spending 2 euros when the game is discounted you may find this game an entertaining one. After Human Revolution and before Mankind Divided I enjoyed the ride - I just wish it'd been better.			"

												I'm actually a huge fan of the Deus Ex franchise (played all of the games multiple times) and all other games in this genre (System Shock, System Shock 2, Bioshock, Ultima UW, Fallout 3/NV, Morrowind, Skyrim, Half-Life (all), etc...basically any immersive games like this from way back to now...yes, I'm old). I've also never written a review for a Steam game before but felt I had to re: this one. I don't remember what the original price was for this game but it must have been high because I can think of no other reason for the rabidly-bad reviews. Either that or it was heavily patched by the time I bought it. I actually put off buying this for a while due to these reviews which I shouldn't have. Frankly, the game isn't THAT bad...I actually like it, for what it is (a tablet port). And I think that's the problem...everyone bought it expecting Deus Ex: Human Revolution 2 (which, of course, there is no way a game like this could be...again, it's a TABLET PORT) and then got all♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off thinking they were cheated some how. For what it is and for what I purchased it at ($4.99), it's exactly what I was expecting and is a lot of fun, which is all I ask for in a game. I wouldn't buy it for $59.99 but I would have paid more than I did...say in the $15.00 range. The ONLY thing they definitely should have changed was the single save game...a bit risky and a strange design decision...but I haven't had an issue with it yet. But for $5.00, it's a steal. If you like the Deus Ex milieu, BUY IT.			"

Product received for free
Summary/Overview  Deus Ex Machina is a term in Latin that means part man, part machine. However, in normal English narrative a literal translation of it reads in Greek as "" a character or thing that suddenly enters the story in a novel, play, movie etc., and solves a problem that had previously seemed impossible to solve"" ( Merriam-Webster). In Deus Ex, Ben Saxton as the main protagonist is ordered to kill a terrorist threat known as the Tyrants. During the beginning of the plot we start to notice that Jaron Namir, our once became ally has been plotting against us this whole time to work for him under the tyrant rule through a secret governmental program called the Killing Floor. The Killing Floor is a program behind the lies and deception that reveal and coerces itself towards concealing the truth of augmented reality. Namir wants you, Ben Saxton to be his protégé as he has trained you from your former mission over in Moscow, Russia wherein you found out you used to be a ruthless tyrant. Will you be able to have the courage to kill Namir for betraying your trust and controlling your mind by giving up the truths you know regarding your anti-terrorist organization, agents and people at stake through peer pressure or will we rather spare his life and go undercover to get all the answers we need?     Ben and Anna are the only survivors remaining out of your organization in which we are led to believe due to most of the soldiers and troops that were assassinated, murdered, lied to, stabbed and betrayed during operation Rainforest, a top secret military-grade black ops mission that went wrong. The key to humanity is in our hands within specific augmentations, future-grade enhancements to uncover corrupt illuminati, the people behind the deception and lies that infiltrate the worldwide embassies. They operate under power, by force, not through justice but through aggression and passive-agressive tendencies. Welcome to the future in 2027 in which America and outside nations, factions have turned against each other in a total war against humanity and the human race. Watch out for conspiracy theorist and uncover the truths behind the prerogative of the extinction of the human race. Deus Ex: The Fall is an action-oriented, stealth role-playing game.Gameplay/ Upgrades/ Inventory Management     Gameplay combines two options, you can either use stealth with timed takedowns and patience or shoot your way through large groups of enemies while being detected, killed very often. One positive about the gameplay is the augmentations you can use such as upgrading your armor, being able to go through  lasers; trip-wire based security, increasing the time and ability to hack accurately on terminals to unlock doors and many more options. You have a nice menu tab that is filled with your items,in it, you can buy items you may need along the way, the ability to equip new weapons in the quick slots that are available to you for easy use, buying new weapons, viewing a larger map than your mini-map that is able to detect many enemies, viewing your upgrades  in which you get by obtaining praxis points and finally viewing, re-reviewing text and media logs that you have picked up. All items you find on the ground simply are picked up much like the system in Resident Evil Revelations 2 worked. Also the weapon and item system also remind me fondly of Resident Evil Revelations 2 in raid mode. You throw grenades by first selecting which grenade from the left-hand corner of your screen you want to throw.     If you choose to use a controller, it is LB just like it works in Resident Evil Revelations 2 similarly. The item system is available through the pause menu only, however, not directly through the game. In order to equip a new weapon, usually when you pick a weapon up it then will automatically equip it for you. However, let's assume you run out of slots when you go past your five quick slot limit, then, you have to pause the game and tab over until you get back to the weapons menu. Also within this menu you can add attachments to your weapons while upgrading them spending your precious in-game credits on more ammo and better weapons. This system is very similar to Resident Evil games in which the game would force you to constantly stock up on more ammo manually instead of automatically.Story     The story is practically the contender for one of the best game stories I have played in any story based personal computer game so far. Every character is unique having their own backstory and accent. If it is a gangster from the slums, they will act hostile and very aggressive in the way gangsters normally act in America. If it is the tyrants from Russia, they will be hard to trust just like many people sadly have a hard time trusting many people living in Russia today because of all the terrorist activities that have occurred there over the years.     However, not every Russian are bad people, many are quite kind and helpful, respectful but it all depends of course on who is in the chain of command and what they choose to do with the individual power in which they hold as a unit of people.  In  Deus Ex: The Fall Russians are depicted as people that are fully untrustworthy and have been plotting schemes to con and overthrow all other groups of people. I contend to a negative connotative opinion on this matter, it is illogical in other words to think one group or race of people are superior than another. You learn about all these themes throughout the course of its short campaign. It is important for adults, families and children to learn from this sterotype and prejudice included by Square Enix in a mature storyline aimed at a more mature, adult based audience. Interacting with the non-playable characters in the city of Panama is a primary example of prejudice. These groups of people never put their trust in aliens, foreign outsiders that they fear are becoming a threat towards their community and culture. Pros & Cons  Pros A riveting and interesting blockbuster movie quality story that starts off very slow but rapidly increases with an incredible plot overview diving into a sea of a massive backstory, climax, point of view, narrative and exposition Immersive story that tailors your decisions based on your morale between aggressive, straight-forward, passive and explosive "" locomotive"" psychological behaviorsCons Control and inventory management could be greatly improved Some character models could use some slight polishing, primarily Anna They force you to turn on v-sync in order for the hacking terminals in the game to become responsive Short story estimate, for a game like this, it would help if it was longer Gameplay Length/ Story Estimate(HLTB)a. main story averages 4.5 hours' totalb. main story and extras averages 5.5 hours' totalc. completionist estimate around 7.5 hours' total  Overall/ Verdict: 8___ A highly underrated AAA game with an immersive, incredible story but suffers from controls that feel clumsy and could be better to fit gamer's needs such as the crosshairs when aiming at enemies  Key1-3 = poor4-5 = ok6-7 = good8-10 = amazing     I received this game for review purposes from Steamified.

												Deus Ex: The Fall is fun in the same way as the other Deus Ex games.At least, it is for me. Deus Ex: The Fall is a short, but good, discrete portion of Deus Ex gameplay. If you have played any of the other Deus Ex games, this one is like an open-world segment of the other ones (e.g. Hong Kong in the original or Cairo in Invisible War.) The area is full of hidden things to find and side-quests to complete, and follows the Deus Ex tradition of allowing you to decide how to proceed from point A to point B. That said, if you are looking for a challenge, you will not find it in this game. Even though it was still very fun, it was ridiculously easy. I had no trouble finishing all of the achievements.I am likely not a great judge of story quality, but it seemed coherent and easy to follow. The quests made sense within the context. Some of the voice acting was great, specifically the roles reprised from other entries in the series. Much of the voice acting was not so great though - I would say about on par with the original game or Invisible War.The pacing is much quicker than the other Deus Ex games, but this is to be expected due to the scope of the game. You can easily unlock almost everything you want in one playthrough, and you can start a new game+ and keep your augs and inventory. Speaking of which, the inventory system is a bit different. Instead of arranging your items on a grid or giving you a limited number of slots, you are simply able to carry everything at once. I never played the mobile version of the game, but I suspect this is influenced by micro-transactions. Thankfully, there are no microtransactions in the PC version. The game must also be applauded for allowing you to skip lengthy cutscenes after your first time.The gameplay and action are very much like Human Revolution, but I found the controls to be much more responsive. There was no input lag that I could detect. I set my mouse sensitivity to the lowest in-game setting and it felt about right (my mouse is 1800 DPI), but it doesn't give you fine control, which may put off those who measure and use the exact same sensitivity in all FPS games. There is no 'jump' button in the game, which feels slightly unsettling, but you are able to hop over certain obstacles. To put it bluntly, it is difficult to perform this maneuver with any consistency. I also do not know of any way to disable the view-bob, but it is not nearly as bad as it was in HR. Aside from those two complaints, the movement was fantastic and the game just works.Oh yeah... except that there is no way to remap any of the controls. I know this is a tablet/smart phone port, but for a PC game this is heinous. I was able to use a utility to change my keyboard key bindings and force my preferred controls, but such a step is fairly technical and should not be necessary in the first place.The game looks rather good for a mobile port. The textures are fairly low-res, the geometry is simple, and the animations are a bit stiff, but everything looks consistent. There were no elements in the game world that stood out as far more or far less detailed than others, which importantly gave everything a cohesive look; it can hardly be overstated how much this improves the look of a game. The Fall supports MSAA, which is far better than the post-process AA you are stuck with for Deus Ex: Human Revolution. I was able to force 16x Anisotropic Filtering and 8x SGSSAA using nVidia Inspector with no glitches, and the game looked much better. I had no framerate issues at these settings on a GTX 460, which never dropped below 75FPS (VSync on).I had a lot of fun playing Deus Ex: The Fall. It was fun in the same way the other games were fun for me - it scratched that Deus Ex 'itch' I guess would be a good way to put it. I definitely got $9.99 of entertainment out of it and I was happy to have more Deus Ex. I highly recommend The Fall to Deus Ex fans.Good:- It feels and plays like Deus Ex- I experienced no bugs or crashes in over 17 hours of play- No microtransactions- MSAA support- Consistent graphics make the game look better than the sum of its partsBad:- It's short, with an unresolved story- Extremely easy- No control remapping- You only get one save file (though you can save as often as you want after the tutorial)- Much of the voice acting is mediocre*EDIT*I did run into a single interface bug in which two screens overlapped.

												I'm a newbie to the Deus Ex franchise, but I will say I love it. I started with Deus Ex: HR, and I'm planning on working my way through all the games. That said, this is kind of a mixed bag of a game. I'll break it down:Length: 3/5. This game is an iOS port, meaning it's shorter than the average game, but in its defense, longer than the average iOS game. I was rather surprised by the sudden ending/cliffhanger, so be forewarned. Overall meh for PC, but understandable.Replay Value: 2/5There is something to be said about the replayability value of an old fashioned skill-tree. This game does a good job of that, and the lethal/nonlethal gameplay adds to it. The story leaves much lacking if you have any skill at this sort of thing because, honestly, it wasn't hard to get everything aced. Overall, for alternate playstyles it might be fun, but I wouldn't invest my time.Story: 4/5This isn't up to the standards I hold for games, which are admittedly very high for a story-driven franchise like Deus Ex. However, this is a great ""episode"" style story that really gets the feel of whats going on in a condensed form. I like it, and I don't have the qualms with it I had about Deus Ex: HR. Over all, above average, and exceptional considering it was intended for iOS.Controls: 1/5Ever play Dark Souls with a keyboard? Absurd right? You'll beg for that when this game is done with you. My mouse would skip around (likely an issue with centering code...) so that I was often turning in massive skips and stutters. This wouldn't happen in menus, but in menus the mouse clicks were subject to motion cancel (in other words a click with a minor drag cancels the click) likely as a result of iOS tap vs swipe code. It seems like they gave the imput code to one intern over a month and took what he had and taped it on there. Its playable (which is why it doesn't get a 0) but be careful in a firefight or you might accidentally shoot a wall to your left instead of an enemy in front of you. That, and you might start bashing your keyboard into your monitor if you have a tendency to swipe your mouse while you click; trying to hack with that.... is frustrating.Gameplay: 4/5Disregarding controls, the gameplay felt much like a simplified HR, something I can respect. The various shops are relatively cheap, and honestly you can get far more than enough credits by the end (I had all the guns I wanted, plenty of ammo/augs, and 20k+ credits, IIRC) likely as a leftover from the microtransactions system. Other than that minor qualm (that actually helps newer players, so I don't complain) I enjoyed it. The only issues with gameplay came from controls, and one annoying AI glitch; the robots tend to ignore enemies that are not directly in front of them. And I mean directly. It didn't hurt all that much, and I only encountered it once, so overall, I'd say a pretty good system.Overall: 3/5Crap controls and a short story combine to make this a frustrating to play (but enthralling none-the-less) addition to the Deus Ex franchise. I liked the story and the gameplay system, so I kept playing, but the controls and replayability, as well as the minor glitches and short storyline, punished me for liking it. All in all, worth $10, but barely.			"

												Anyone who played Deus Ex: Human Revolution will instantly notice that this knock-off is a bad joke. Visually the game sucks in comparison to what was seen in Deus Ex HR. Character animation is rightout cheap, it looks static and lifeless, models and textures of weapons and characters are low resolution and particle effects are crappy to non-existent. Menus work poorly or not at all, the worst part: controls cannot be remapped at all, gamepads don't work for most people, if not for everyone, even though the game explicitly says ""full gamepad support"".Story and general dialog are badly written and don't even come close to what one would have expected from a game bearing this title. The gameplay feels more like a linear scripted shooter, with the option of using a very inconvenient and sadly obsolete active cover system. Enemies move around like sticks, guns don't show any recoil and feel very static (NPC guns included).The only positive thing I can say about it so far is this: The soundtrack isn't too bad ... but that's pretty much it.So, a rather disappointing experience, I heavily suggest not buying the game if you liked Human Revolution. This thing is something completely different and unworthy of your time. I will play it through once, but just because I've already paid for it. It would require some heavy patching to make this thing into anything even remotely ""good"".			"

												Not as great as Deus Ex HR, this game was made for IOS and has now been moved onto PC. The game at the moment is really buggy. The game has a nice story which is enjoyable but as soon as you starting to get into the intresting parts of the story it comes up with the big ""To be Continued"" which really annoyed me.I recommend to just go buy Deus Ex: Human Revolution and if you've already played and completed that, just wait for the new Deus Ex title to come out.To sum it all up, this game is just a huge step back from Deus Ex HR and i'm hoping they don't do the same with Deus Ex: ""Universe"" (Universe is just the name of the project not the actual name of the game)6/10			"

												It's not Deus Ex: Human Revolution, more like Deus Ex HR: Light, but it's not too bad.Keep in mind that it's originally a tablet game, not a PC game, and you'll have an easier time accepting the limitations.The voices aren't bad, though they're not as good as in HR.Currently it's priced at about 10 Euro, which definitely is too much. At most I'd pay 5 for it.It adds a bit to the story of HR, which I like. I've also read the book, which is itself a (partial) prequel to this game, as this game is a prequel to HR (which in turn, is a prequel to the original Deus Ex :-).So, is it bad? No.Is it great? Not really.Is it enjoyable? Yes.			"

												I try my best to be an informed gamer, but this came as a surprise to me. When I saw that DX:HR had some new DLC, I got really excited and pre-purchased The Fall. What I didn't know was that The Fall is not DLC, it's actually a PC port of a spin-off mobile device game (tablets, phones, etc.) which translates poorly to PC.Clunky mechanics, unresponsive controls (with no ability to re-task buttons), sub-par voice acting, and less than exemplary graphics for such a new game makes for a bad excuse for a PC game. It looks to me like this games would be perfect for tablets and the such, its original market,  but it does not seem to me that The Fall can stand on its own as a PC game. I recommend this game to anyone who holds story above gameplay (The Fall chronicles the missions of the aug spec-op team that captured Dr. Reed and attacked Sarif Ind. before DX:HR) but not to anyone who prefers an immersive gameplay experience parallel to the story.

Its also not even a complete game, ends on a cliff hanger. The game is short and laggy, has plenty of model bugs and errors. The only good thing to say is that you can buy a gold pistol........ thats about it. So if thats worth 10 bucks to you then don't let me stop you.

Maybe think twice if you have not played the others since a lot of information and background is from other games.I really hope that they continue to make The Fall games and release them on Steam, ignoring all the other oversensitive reviews.

The other redeeming quality is that it isn't a shame to play it with a gamepad, like HR. It's dumbed down enough to perfectly suited for my Celeron living room PC.			"

												Completed the game, 100%... found out that nothing changes the ending, and well aware that there will be no part 2. possibly as a DLC for mankind divide i hope, however, everything was bland. music was the only thing nice, but something tells me it was riped off from the DX:HR. Bought every single weapon, which take about 8 playthroughts with constant side quests (5), and you can only have a max of 10k credits...overall, I would give the game a 4/10, the animation was worse then Invisble wars, (they talk but they never looked towards each other, on top of it, constant replay of looping animation for key dialogue made me want to skip all of it, (thankfully you can skip dialogue) Voice acting was very...ok. I wish this had better camera shots for these talking parts but none of them realy blinked, or turned there head in the correct way. way to stiff, its as if the animator hadn't animated them at all... or he was the only animator (judging by the fact I could not find a list of animators except senoir animator) I actually beat the game in a speed run in about an hour, thats with all 5 side quest, lets just say, you can easly run threw the whole game, the only thing stoping you is the tutorial. However, if you where to look around and try to find the paths on your own, would probly be worth 6 hours if you took your time. The bugs from porting from mobile are the worse part of this, I could deal (somewhat) with invisble war and the fact it crashes to desktop every hour or so, or the fact that every time invisble war loads a new map I get a breif 5 sec view of my desktop, everytime. but this one takes the cake. first was the gamepad would not go to the menu (which is important) However, Ive found that i need to use the keyboard even if the game pad buttons dont work 10% of the time. another bug was the take down animation bug. (invisble takedown enimies, background turning black, or disappearing) they would register, however, enimies would not land where they get hit, Even whole walls disappear and reappear. I actually got a bug, where the intro cinema audio would not stop while i sped threw it to get to the tutorial. even enemies would disappear as i made my way threw the larger levels.  The game works in story as a introduction, but was not enough to say wow. If this was remade with the Idea of pushing boundries, I could see this part of the deus ex universe being rather good, with better camera working, better animation, pushing the levels to more interesting and combined designs, I would even rehire the actors to give them a second chance as i do think they fit each character.  I do hope this gets a honest to god, remake, not a Port as it has potential, just not as a mobile port.Binge playing deus ex for this whole Month.In order:Deus ex 1 - great if you overcome the graphics.Deus ex invisble wars - small maps, very nostolgic of deus ex 1, but god the bugs.Deus ex the fall - I might of enjoied it a little bit as it has the feeling of DX:HR, but it really does need icurus effect as a backing for this game. now to play DX:HR "

For a moment I thought my silencer was the most effective silencer known to man. Then I reaslised I couldn't hear anything. So great if you want to experience sudden traumatic onset of deafness without the viral infection.Awful script and the graphics seem dreadful compared to my recollection of Human Revolution.

												I will admit that I came into this game thinking it was a small standalone expansion to Human Revolution. It was not until I was about two minutes into the game that I realized that it was originally developed for mobile devices. Now with that tweak I would forgive certain faults, lower graphics, limited menu options, and a user interface that was a bit off for a PC game. All of these were faults the game contained but I can forgive. The reason I cannot recommend this game is because of the sloppy scripts and even worse voice acting. I have read that the game is supposed to have a good storyline. Maybe it does if you can get past the miserable delivery. The characters all sound like they are looking at a piece of paper and reading their scripts line by monotone line as if they were reading a book rather than trying to act. All of the depth that Human Revolution had seems to have been stripped away needlessly in the making of this game. I could go on and on, but I will leave it at this: I am sad to see another Deus Ex game go the way of Invisible War.			"

It lags like old Call of Duty games over a wifi connection blocked by a wall of lead. The forced tutorial: What?? It holds your hand like a parent of a developmentally disabled child being taught to walk on its own. It's ridiculous. I had to restart the game several times because it refuses to respond to my mouse clicks. ""Click here"", oh okay Deus Ex I'll play your little game (pun intended) and click the button to equip the silencer to the rifle. Wait you dont want me to click there? You won't let me? WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? And the graphics, it literally looks like they hired a blind 8 year old to make this game with MS paint. Beyond that the story is so vague and stupid that it doesnt even succesfully expand upon the universe.There is literally nothing good about this game. It feels like they had a bunch of pieces of Human Revolution from the pre-alpha stage left over and stitched them together and decided to release it in the hope that they could trick people like me into buying it out of fandom. Congratulations Square Enix, you got me, you really did. You pulled a fast one on me and its my own fault for being so dumb as to pre-order a game. Complete waste of time and an insult to the series.

												This game really was ""The Fall"" of the franchise.Graphics: 4.5/10- You know, for the release year of this game, I didn't think we were in 2001.Gameplay: 5/10- The only ""Good""(Such as strong word for this) rating. Keeping to the standard Deus Ex Lethal/Stealth kill system, and a relatively simple shop/upgrade interface. as for being Stealthy, Enemies have better vision than they should.Sound: 3/10- Not much to say here, moving on.Story: N/A- I Didn't get far enough to even enjoy it.Final Rating: 4/10- These are my personal rating from what I have experienced with the game itself, I do not recommend buying this, spend it on something better such as HR or The Original.

												It is, with a heavy heart, I do NOT give the recommendation to play this game, despite it having Deus Ex in it's name.  The sloppy nature of the port of the mobile game hampers the playability and enjoyability of this game.  The graphics are unbecoming of a modern PC's cability (or that of one five years ago).  The controls are rigid and unresponsive, and the gunplay is spetacularly poor.  Bullets seem to not register damage with half of the hits, and enemies unwittingly walk to you as easy fodder during battles.  That said, those dedicated to stealth only gameplay will find a variety of options to play through the game without needing to fire a single bullet.  I did find the exploration of the game world satisfying, and hacking enthusiasts will find plenty of opportunities to hone their skills.   The minimal interaction and dialogue options with NPC's ensure a relatively linear story without meaningful choices, and the ending is an abrupt cliffhanger.  Overall, this game cannot be recommended in its current state, one which will likely be its final state.			"

												As can be expected from a mobile port, the game has pretty bad models, animations and textures. 8x MSAA AntiAliasing doesn't help much here, but all in all, that is no the most important aspect of the game.What IS pretty bad here though, is sound. It appears that some lines or sounds do not work, as if there were not enough channels, it doesn't sound right, often it is muffled too much and voice acting is terrible.Like always, you can use non-leathal takedowns, but the game is simplified and so easy that it seems a total waste of time.Locations are smaller and do not offer as many opportunities, and when they do - they do not feel rewarding at all.Game has the cover system and many kinds of weapons, leathal or not, but it is mostly just a simple shooter. Doing anything else with it feels forced and mundane. The core story is pretty weak, especially since voice actors don't even try to act, sometimes reading their without any emotional impact. The littered audi logs and ebooks offer more quality suprisingly and are nice fillers. Overall, the hardcore Deus Ex player could get the game for it's low price and enjoy it. All the others that just want to play a good game? Id's say skip the title or wait for a 75% promo.It's hard to decide whether I should recommend the game or not, but since most people are NOT hardcore Deus Ex players, I will not recommend it, unless you look for some fillers to the whole Deus Ex story. I'd give it a score of 50/100. It would be a decent game. In 1999.			"

												One of the worst console ports I have ever seen.  You can't even customize the controls.  It's a slap in the face to the main game (Human Revolution), which is one of the best titles I've ever played.  Stick with the main version or the director's cut.  This is a waste of cash.			"

												I bought this because I thought it was like an add-on to Deus Ex: Human Revolution and I'm wildly irresponsible with money. This game is so bad that it's not even funny. Your main character is some douchy Adam Jensen knockoff, there's some sort of dumb conspiracy (and I'm sure uncovering it would have no effect on anything this being a prequel and all). Most of my time with this game was spent in some random drug house in panama that is the size of a large shopping mall where I was gunned down repeatedly by the omniscient entity known only as ""shotgun guy."" Wherever I went, shotgun guy never left me. Always ready to kill me in one-hit as soon as I turned a corner. I faced off against shotgun guy repeatedly in his multiple reincarnations but it seems that he has won as this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game is no longer installed on my hard drive.Also the controls are bad, and the graphics look about on par with a Xbox 360 launch game. There's no fun to be had here, this game blows.			"

												Utter s h i t e. I broke the steam rule by not reading the reviews first. Went on the basis of Deus Ex:  Human Revolution and the franchise's success to date. Was lulled into it by the cheap offer of £7.99 for a Deus Ex experience. Soooo wrong.  Glitchy turning and buggy sound that just plain leaves the sound of speech or weapons fire off. For a moment I thought my silencer was the most effective silencer known to man. Then I reaslised I couldn't hear anything. So great if you want to experience sudden traumatic onset of deafness without the viral infection.Awful script and the graphics seem dreadful compared to my recollection of Human Revolution. I wanted to like this but it's impossible. Gone from my hard drive after 2 hours that I'm not getting back. Valuable lesson: Always read the reviews.			"

												I will admit that I came into this game thinking it was a small standalone expansion to Human Revolution. It was not until I was about two minutes into the game that I realized that it was originally developed for mobile devices. Now with that tweak I would forgive certain faults, lower graphics, limited menu options, and a user interface that was a bit off for a PC game. All of these were faults the game contained but I can forgive. The reason I cannot recommend this game is because of the sloppy scripts and even worse voice acting. I have read that the game is supposed to have a good storyline. Maybe it does if you can get past the miserable delivery. The characters all sound like they are looking at a piece of paper and reading their scripts line by monotone line as if they were reading a book rather than trying to act. All of the depth that Human Revolution had seems to have been stripped away needlessly in the making of this game. I could go on and on, but I will leave it at this: I am sad to see another Deus Ex game go the way of Invisible War.			"

												HOLY BUGS! What is this? I pre-ordered (something I NEVER do) simply because I was excited to see any kind of expansion on the Deus Ex universe but what on earth is this? The voice acting sounds like it was done by a bunch of disinterested hobos on heroin chilling in an empty dumpster. It lags like old Call of Duty games over a wifi connection blocked by a wall of lead. The forced tutorial: What?? It holds your hand like a parent of a developmentally disabled child being taught to walk on its own. It's ridiculous. I had to restart the game several times because it refuses to respond to my mouse clicks. ""Click here"", oh okay Deus Ex I'll play your little game (pun intended) and click the button to equip the silencer to the rifle. Wait you dont want me to click there? You won't let me? WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? And the graphics, it literally looks like they hired a blind 8 year old to make this game with MS paint. Beyond that the story is so vague and stupid that it doesnt even succesfully expand upon the universe.There is literally nothing good about this game. It feels like they had a bunch of pieces of Human Revolution from the pre-alpha stage left over and stitched them together and decided to release it in the hope that they could trick people like me into buying it out of fandom. Congratulations Square Enix, you got me, you really did. You pulled a fast one on me and its my own fault for being so dumb as to pre-order a game. Complete waste of time and an insult to the series. It's Deus Ex: Invisible War all over again except so much worse.			"

												It's not Deus Ex: Human Revolution, more like Deus Ex HR: Light, but it's not too bad.Keep in mind that it's originally a tablet game, not a PC game, and you'll have an easier time accepting the limitations.The voices aren't bad, though they're not as good as in HR.Currently it's priced at about 10 Euro, which definitely is too much. At most I'd pay 5 for it.It adds a bit to the story of HR, which I like. I've also read the book, which is itself a (partial) prequel to this game, as this game is a prequel to HR (which in turn, is a prequel to the original Deus Ex :-).So, is it bad? No.Is it great? Not really.Is it enjoyable? Yes.			"

Unlike Deus Human revolution which was randomized creating more dynamic.Panama city is smallDoesn’t make use of all the augmentation packed in the game.The sense of a moral system is almost non-existent in the fallThe aiming with a controller on PC feels stiff.Curator page "

												The game has a good story line, sadly, at this point, it ""leaves you hanging"" because it is a work in progress. The ""to be continued"" ending leaves the player wanting more. Will other installments be forthcoming? In the first two games of this ongoing series, the player had a sense of closure, and whichever course of action a player takes, they get that sense of accomplishment and satisfaction of ""finishing"" the story line. Hopefully there will be at least the two more ""installments""This type of game arcitecture is the corporate machine behind the game milking as much cashflow as possible from gamers.Much like the game ""Defiance"" where you must pay cash for additional content.

												~Please read this in its entirety before you vote~Meh. It feels like a very watered-down version of Human Revolution. The mechanics are actually decent for a mobile game port and the shooting mechanics feel alright. The stealth can get a bit wonky as the AI is not the best (and sometimes even below mediocre). The story is just okay; I was intrigued by the mysterious Tyrants and the backstory behind the main character, but only after about and hour of being exasperated by the at-first cheesy story. You can easily avoid microtransactions of any sort (by which I mean AT ALL) simply by picking up ammo and credits and not blowing all of your in-game money on things you don't need, so I'm not sure why people are complaining about this. Overall, a pretty solid title. It plays like a compact version of Human Revolution. If it goes on sale or you see it in a Humble Bundle, like I did, then I suggest you pick it up if you are interested. Avoid it as long as the price tag is above $5.00 USD though - that's the most I'd recommend spending on this game.			"

												Good: -The environment looks ""good"", and everything is very smooth. Bad:-Character models, especially Civilians are awful. -Cutscenes are awful, characters looks bored being in the game. -Voice acting is terrible. -AI is horrible. Everyone suffers from amnesia. I wreaked havoc in enemy territory. I hid behind a pillar and everyone surrounded the pillar. But after 30 seconds they forgot I was behind the pillar and continued with their lives. I also took down every guard in a hotel lobby, just ran up to them and bang. The girl behind the reception got scared, but after 30 seconds she got back to normal and apologized for not having any rooms for rent. ""My men can kill you anytime I want..."" ""No they cant! They are all dead because I threw mines in ther faces! That is also why your door is missing and theres a hole in the wall!""-Story is poor. I have played all Deus Ex games and read The Icarus Effect, which is the story before The Fall, So I knew what Ben Saxon has been up to. -3 Main Missions. 5 Optional Quests. ""Go here, collect this, return"".-Controls are unresponsive and clunky. -You can buy 3 variants of every weapon for no good reason at all. Also the store is in your pocket. This game is basically Deus Ex Light Demo Edition Beta. It should have been a DLC for Human Revolution for less than 5€.Only buy this on sale if you are REALLY a fan of Deus Ex and more interested in the (poor) story and are aware that you will be let down.

It has it's problems such as awkard combat, and basic graphics which were desgined for phones. But these problemes can be overlooked. It has a great story (Which is really short), great combat even though the combat is awkard (it uses the same combat system as HR), great mood and tone.

												Honestly, this game isn't nearly as good as the other Deus Ex games. Despite that, it's still a pretty solid game for the platform it was initially released on. I bought it at launch, for my iPod Touch 5. On a small screen, it didn't work very well. I obtained an iPad Mini, and Deus Ex: The Fall worked perfectly on it. Don't let my 29 minutes of playtime fool you; I beat it several times on iOS. For tablets, and mobile phones if you're really bored, this is a great game. For other devices, it's merely 'meh'. They promised additional content, but never delivered. The last update was in early 2014, so it's unlikely that they will ever complete this game. Now, for people really dying for Deus Ex content, this is a pretty good game. For everybody else, it's a waste of time and money. If you do want to get it, don't get it for PC or Mac or whatever; get it for Android or iOS. It's cheaper, and feels a lot more natural. Why do I recommend it? Because I spent at least fifty hours playing it on my iPad, and it really isn't a bad game. I even used the in-game store a few times. But anyway, if you like the Deus Ex universe you should get it. If you do want to get it, wait until it's on sale or included in a cheap bundle. If you don't like the Deus Ex universe, or have never played a Deus Ex game, don't bother with it. The mechanics are nothing new, and the plot would probably confuse you.			"

												A very uneventful game with just about no depth at all. I know it's a prelude game to the actual Deus Ex series but this is just one to milk some rich kid when they play this on iphone to spend money buying good guns. Once Ported to PC without the pay feature it just don't have any redeeming quality at all.Graphic is okish, Voice is okish, Quest is simplish, Map is smallish, Story is Crappish, you can probably buzz though this game in less then 2 hours with guns blazing if you don't care about credits and auguments. Do not get this one unless it's under a dollar.			"

												Bad mobile port.  The entire game reeks of some smug marketing ""genius"" exec brow-breating his entire creative team into ritually sacrificing their dignity.  When the first access code was ""0451"" I didn't grin with nostalgia, I grimaced at the appropriation of it for..... this.			"

Buttons have more than one fuction and it's hardly fluid at all.

The only reason I purchased this game on Steam was to experience it one more time with better graphics, AI and controls. However, this release is just an emulation of the mobile platform game on PC.			"

If you want more Deus Ex go back and play the original if you haven't already and if you have, well then I would say that playing this game was about as enjoyable as shooting myself with a nailgun.

												I bought this because I thought it was like an add-on to Deus Ex: Human Revolution and I'm wildly irresponsible with money. This game is so bad that it's not even funny. Your main character is some douchy Adam Jensen knockoff, there's some sort of dumb conspiracy (and I'm sure uncovering it would have no effect on anything this being a prequel and all). Most of my time with this game was spent in some random drug house in panama that is the size of a large shopping mall where I was gunned down repeatedly by the omniscient entity known only as ""shotgun guy."" Wherever I went, shotgun guy never left me. Always ready to kill me in one-hit as soon as I turned a corner. I faced off against shotgun guy repeatedly in his multiple reincarnations but it seems that he has won as this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game is no longer installed on my hard drive.Also the controls are bad, and the graphics look about on par with a Xbox 360 launch game. There's no fun to be had here, this game blows.			"

												Interesting game with Unique features. I had bought this mainly for the story, expecting all the negative reviews to be as bad as I thought, but it wasn't that bad. The Billboards are more vibrant than in DXHR, and the new stealth aug which warps you to nearby areas is pretty cool. It does have flaws and limitations, but not nearly as bad as some users make it out to be. Pros: +New Augmentations+Fast Switching slots (weapon/items) customizable+On Demand Market+able to disarm mines+easy to understand gameplay+Reasonable pricedCons: -Unable to jump-Vaulting doesn't work most the time -Unfinished StoryThe first level is a tutorial, it seems akward at first, as I'm used to American speaking games, or atleast the introductions. However the tutorial does seem to hold your hand when playing, but it's only 1 short level. I had bought this wanting to learn more about the story, but was disapointed to find out it wasn't finished. I hope answers to that will be resolved in the next Deus Ex. I recomend this only to hard core fans. If you expect a 60 dollar game for a fraction of the cost, then you'll probably be disapointed.			"

												Utter s h i t e. I broke the steam rule by not reading the reviews first. Went on the basis of Deus Ex:  Human Revolution and the franchise's success to date. Was lulled into it by the cheap offer of £7.99 for a Deus Ex experience. Soooo wrong.  Glitchy turning and buggy sound that just plain leaves the sound of speech or weapons fire off. For a moment I thought my silencer was the most effective silencer known to man. Then I reaslised I couldn't hear anything. So great if you want to experience sudden traumatic onset of deafness without the viral infection.Awful script and the graphics seem dreadful compared to my recollection of Human Revolution. I wanted to like this but it's impossible. Gone from my hard drive after 2 hours that I'm not getting back. Valuable lesson: Always read the reviews.			"

												HOLY BUGS! What is this? I pre-ordered (something I NEVER do) simply because I was excited to see any kind of expansion on the Deus Ex universe but what on earth is this? The voice acting sounds like it was done by a bunch of disinterested hobos on heroin chilling in an empty dumpster. It lags like old Call of Duty games over a wifi connection blocked by a wall of lead. The forced tutorial: What?? It holds your hand like a parent of a developmentally disabled child being taught to walk on its own. It's ridiculous. I had to restart the game several times because it refuses to respond to my mouse clicks. ""Click here"", oh okay Deus Ex I'll play your little game (pun intended) and click the button to equip the silencer to the rifle. Wait you dont want me to click there? You won't let me? WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? And the graphics, it literally looks like they hired a blind 8 year old to make this game with MS paint. Beyond that the story is so vague and stupid that it doesnt even succesfully expand upon the universe.There is literally nothing good about this game. It feels like they had a bunch of pieces of Human Revolution from the pre-alpha stage left over and stitched them together and decided to release it in the hope that they could trick people like me into buying it out of fandom. Congratulations Square Enix, you got me, you really did. You pulled a fast one on me and its my own fault for being so dumb as to pre-order a game. Complete waste of time and an insult to the series. It's Deus Ex: Invisible War all over again except so much worse.			"

												Is this what you would call an HD Port? That's what the developers of this pile said. I would strongly disagree, with all of the terribly rendered models or how about the four settings for video. You had a complete year after the game came out on mobile to get it ready for PC, what were you doing Eidos? I mean come on, when you shoot the camera completely freaks out and zooms in! How can you release something like this and call it HD? I realize it's a mobile port but if you're going to call the kettle black you better bet it's not stainless steel. Let's go over the basics just to be clear how much of a pile of crap this game truly is. The gameplay overall is god awful and the controls make it pretty difficult to play properly. The story has some tie-ins but overall is extremely poor. I mentioned the graphics before, they're not good and it's certainly not an ""HD"" port. As it is a mobile port, the sounds are, as you can probably image, god awful as well. The game does have some length, it took upwards of 5 hours to complete the game 100% and the first hour was learning how to actually control my character well enough to play the game. If you get this game for free, play it for a laugh. I highly suggest against paying any amount of money for this game. The Fall is definitely not worth your time.☆☆☆☆★ Overall ☆☆☆☆★ Gameplay ☆☆☆★★ Story ☆☆☆☆★ Graphics ☆☆☆☆★ Sounds ☆☆☆☆★ Oddity ☆☆☆★★ Length "

												Deus Ex: The Fall is a game made after the novels Deus Ex: Icarus Effect (which I reccomend reading) with tie-in lore and events taking place shortly after Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Keep in mind that this game was originally intended for iOS platforms made with the Unity Engine, so it doesn't have the graphical qualities most people hunger for. As an iOS platform game it is amazing. It succesfully delivers the much familiar atmosphere and feeling Deus Ex fans know and love. Making a game like this for the iOS platform is impressive.Sadly the PC version has a lot of hic-ups, like glitching in and out of the map and low grade mesh quality and a universal store that is always available anywhere you are that offers all the weapons you need without having to look for a vendor of any kind. Thus giving you an unlimited supply of weapons, ammo, grenades and praxis kits whenever you need them. Personally I believe that the PC version needed a remastered edition. Despite those setbacks I liked the game and the story. I would still reccomend the novel over the game but this game deserves more recognition as an iOS platform game instead of being bullied and downgraded.			"

												All the other reviews speak about the bad things in this game and they're right. But I've found the one redeeming quality. Or one and a half. It runs on a Celeron! See how I haven't said anything about the graphics card as there's no involved. It runs on the IGP of that Celeron and doesn't look any crappier. The other redeeming quality is that it isn't a shame to play it with a gamepad, like HR. It's dumbed down enough to perfectly suited for my Celeron living room PC.			"

On the one hand it's fluid and open to various gameplay styles and mostly enjoyable but on the other I cannot neglect the large scale of bugs I discovered/encountered, some of which impaired my ability to continue (getting ""teleported"" into a wall after a take-down).With all that in mind I do believe this game is still worth playing despite it was designed for mobile platform thus these issues as I'll call them are bound to occur.

												This game is a port of a mobile game, with that comes alot of bugs, glitches, bad graphics.  Plus its real, real, real, short.  Any non-fans of Deus Ex Human revolution should avoid this game like the plague.  DO NOT BUY unless your a die hard Deus Ex HR fan, see the HR thats critical bcause people who are Deus Ex fans but hated HR would hate this too.  All that horrible stuff aside for Deus Ex HR fans its an interesting game.  Be warned the game in parts has real bad graphics with terrible textures.  Many things are PS2 era in the level of graphics, while other things are HD, so its a weird hybrid.  The atmosphere is done perfectly along with the music.  For a mobile port its pretty impressive, there is tons of dialog, and a train that moves, the city really captures that Deus Ex feeling well.  The story ties into Deus Ex, but the letdown is this is short, as in you go to one place in Panama city for missions and thats it, the game ends.  This game was supposed to be episodic but there are currently no plans to make more episodes.  Combat in the game is done only one way right and that is with stealth, the AI seems as bad as Deus EX HR, so if you were ok with that it should work here.  The takedowns are hilarious, you will sometimes not even appear near the person you takedown, for some reason they may warp across the room, showing you taking down a ghost while in the background you may see the enemy going down.  While the bugs are funny, the game does work, it doesnt crash, Deus Ex games were always pretty bad at combat its the story and atmosphere that drive them, this game pulled that part off, but with a cliff hanger at the end of the episode and nor more planned its enjoyable just to play through the golden glory of what is Deus Ex.ONLY play this with a controller, DO NOT BUY even if you are a fan if you are going to use a mouse.  The k/m controls are broken, often the screen will spin in circles, certain augs will make you constantly rubber band, yet  oddly none of that exists with a controller.  The hacking is broken with a controller yet is flawless with a mouse so gotta use both.  Sound difficult?  Then get some augs to handle what it takes to ride the cyber punk express.Rating for Deus EX HR Fans:  10/10  Value:  $2.50Rating for NON Deus Ex Fans:  0/10  Value:  $0.00			"

												This game isn't as bad as everybody is making it seem. Sure if you expect a whole new game with upto 30+ hours of gameplay you are going to be dissapointed. The game isn't perfect and it has it's share of good and bad issues. Which I shall go into.The game runs smoothly at a pretty decent rate. (I have a plebtier PC) and there wasn't any framerates issues throughout the entire game. The game was smooth from start to finish.The HUD is pretty clean. It's got a few obvious touch screen elements that shouldn't really be there. Drop down menu's and a rather unusual ingame store (using ingame money). Overall the HUD is better than I've seen from other ports.The audio, the ingame music is pretty decent. Fairly similiar to Deus Ex:Human Revelution. It's very close to DXHR although it's not exactly the same. It's a very much welcome addition to somebody that enjoyed the soundtrack to Deus EX.The voice acting is so-so. It seems to fluctuate between the characters, depending on how important or the screentime they have, The main protagonist I feel has a decent amount of quality. However the training mission instructor is absoluetly terrible. She's rather dull and boring. Speaking with one tone. Just readling lines off of a script with absolutely no emotion what so ever.  However sometimes the audio in game skips and jumps. Sounds get repeated or the audio mutes itself for two seconds. I also personally found the ambient sounds to be annoying but that's just a niggle I have.The background music was also louder than everything else. I guess they wanted to cover up the bad voice acting. Luckily you can change that in the menu settings. The setting aren't great either to be honest. It's got audio setting and reset your data but there isn't one for brightness and this game really needs that. I was bumbling along for a bit in some places.The levels are split into short sections, this requires a lot of loading, luckily the loading only takes a few seconds but it all adds up. It could've been better but at least it's short.The cutscenes are pausable which I haven't seen too often in games, so it's good that you are able to pause the game and it's slightly difficult to accidentally skip the cutscene if you want to resume the game. The orange glow used for items and 'hints' are still visible in the cutscenes which is really distracting and I personally find it annoying. You maybe able to overlook it though.Unless you turn the Autosave feature off. Due to the fact that there is only one save slot that both you and the autosave is supposed to use. Technical problems.Whilst I was playing I found that the mouse would get stuck in the centre of the screen which then made it impossible to look or aim. Minimizing the game helped fix that issue. The buttons in game for the menu aren't always responsive, sometimes you have to click on it more than once and some times upto 3 times.Whenever I performed a takedown the entire world would flicker and drop out (during the cutscene) this happened mostly in tight places but seemed to be entirely random. Once you kill or knockout an enemy they just fizzle away into orange triangles and then vanish. Which makes stealthing this game so easy that it's a joke. If you are used to playing MGS on the hardest whilst going for a complete stealth run. This is going to be like 'Baby's first stealth game'This isn't really an issue but it's pretty damn lazy, all of the animations have been recycled from DX:HR. The game also ends on a cliffhanging telling you that more is coming. Which I highly doubt by now.Overal, it's a nice little package. It's not great and it definetly has it's fair share of issues, However if you can get it cheap during a sale and you like Deus Ex, I'd suggest picking it up.			"

												Completed the game, 100%... found out that nothing changes the ending, and well aware that there will be no part 2. possibly as a DLC for mankind divide i hope, however, everything was bland. music was the only thing nice, but something tells me it was riped off from the DX:HR. Bought every single weapon, which take about 8 playthroughts with constant side quests (5), and you can only have a max of 10k credits...overall, I would give the game a 4/10, the animation was worse then Invisble wars, (they talk but they never looked towards each other, on top of it, constant replay of looping animation for key dialogue made me want to skip all of it, (thankfully you can skip dialogue) Voice acting was very...ok. I wish this had better camera shots for these talking parts but none of them realy blinked, or turned there head in the correct way. way to stiff, its as if the animator hadn't animated them at all... or he was the only animator (judging by the fact I could not find a list of animators except senoir animator) I actually beat the game in a speed run in about an hour, thats with all 5 side quest, lets just say, you can easly run threw the whole game, the only thing stoping you is the tutorial. However, if you where to look around and try to find the paths on your own, would probly be worth 6 hours if you took your time. The bugs from porting from mobile are the worse part of this, I could deal (somewhat) with invisble war and the fact it crashes to desktop every hour or so, or the fact that every time invisble war loads a new map I get a breif 5 sec view of my desktop, everytime. but this one takes the cake. first was the gamepad would not go to the menu (which is important) However, Ive found that i need to use the keyboard even if the game pad buttons dont work 10% of the time. another bug was the take down animation bug. (invisble takedown enimies, background turning black, or disappearing) they would register, however, enimies would not land where they get hit, Even whole walls disappear and reappear. I actually got a bug, where the intro cinema audio would not stop while i sped threw it to get to the tutorial. even enemies would disappear as i made my way threw the larger levels.  The game works in story as a introduction, but was not enough to say wow. If this was remade with the Idea of pushing boundries, I could see this part of the deus ex universe being rather good, with better camera working, better animation, pushing the levels to more interesting and combined designs, I would even rehire the actors to give them a second chance as i do think they fit each character.  I do hope this gets a honest to god, remake, not a Port as it has potential, just not as a mobile port.Binge playing deus ex for this whole Month.In order:Deus ex 1 - great if you overcome the graphics.Deus ex invisble wars - small maps, very nostolgic of deus ex 1, but god the bugs.Deus ex the fall - I might of enjoied it a little bit as it has the feeling of DX:HR, but it really does need icurus effect as a backing for this game. now to play DX:HR "

												Lot of bad press for this one. I had fun with it though.The good: - Look, feel, atmosphere of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The yellowish tints, the music, and ambient sounds are all really good.- Stealth gameplay is competent- Hacking is lifted straight from Deus Ex: Human Revolution. It worked well there and it works well here.- The game didn't crash on me, not once. - Lighting effects are very good.- Though the levels are small, there are still multiple ways to complete the objective- Augmentations are back, and greatly varied- Once you arrive in Panama City (where most of the game occurs), the story really improves and develops a great sense of urgency. After you get to know him a little bit, Ben Saxon is less stoic and more relatable than Adam Jensen. The bad:- Unfortunately, the game is too short to really explore Ben Saxon's character. If you skip side missions and non-essential hacking, you can complete the game in 4 hours or less.- Stealth works well, but if you like to shoot your way out of trouble, good luck. The shooting mechanics work for occasional use, but if you like extended gunplay, you'll be frustrated quickly.- Levels are small. Panama City has a number of places to explore, but be prepared for lots of loading screens.- Lighting effects may be good, but facial animations are just awful, some of the worst I've seen. We're talking levels of animation from 10 years ago (except for Saxon). Anna Kelso in-game does not even appear close to the way she is depicted on the game banner.- Textures are hit and miss. Overall, the game looks good, but if you get too close to anything, well, you won't be fooled.- My Biggest Gripe: THIS IS ONE-THIRD OF A GAME!!! The plan was to release the story in three parts. The Fall is Part One. This is not advertised on the store page, but should be. When you reach the end (cliffhanger), you'll expect the next level to start, but instead you'll get a ""To Be Continued"" message. At time of writing, there is no indication that a follow-up is forth-coming.For what we have, is The Fall a bad game though? No, not at all. It definitely felt like it belongs in the Human Revolution universe. If you want more of the Human Revolution story (this is a prequel), Deus Ex: The Fall suffices. But it's only one-third of a game. Skip it for the list price of $10; skip it at 50% off; get it when it goes to 75% off ($2.50).			"

												WTF??? Just finished Panama chapter and game comes to an end?? NOWHERE on Steam is there any mention that this is just a partial game. What gives Steam? No truth in advertising? Each aditional chapter gonna cost $9.95? And for such a crummy game. I loved Human Revolution. This doesnt come close.			"

												Played Deus X: HR - not bad. Purchased this thinking it was an expansion type thing built on the same engine. Nope, this is a horrible piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ The AI is dismal, almost non existent. After looking into it this is a port from mobile platform and a very poorly done one at that. Save your money. Don't buy.			"

I played this for story (it's prelude to Human Revolution) and don't regret it.Just to warn you - it takes a while to get used to controls and they don't work well in menus.			"

												All the other reviews speak about the bad things in this game and they're right. But I've found the one redeeming quality. Or one and a half. It runs on a Celeron! See how I haven't said anything about the graphics card as there's no involved. It runs on the IGP of that Celeron and doesn't look any crappier. The other redeeming quality is that it isn't a shame to play it with a gamepad, like HR. It's dumbed down enough to perfectly suited for my Celeron living room PC.			"

												This ""game"" has given me mixed feelings. On the one hand it's fluid and open to various gameplay styles and mostly enjoyable but on the other I cannot neglect the large scale of bugs I discovered/encountered, some of which impaired my ability to continue (getting ""teleported"" into a wall after a take-down).With all that in mind I do believe this game is still worth playing despite it was designed for mobile platform thus these issues as I'll call them are bound to occur. Overall I consider this a great, if not short game.			"

												I tought Deus Ex the Fall was a nice game, the plot is good and the graphics are kind of weak for a PC game but this is a mobile port. The worst of the game is the gameplay, bad controls and some stuttering even when the game is at 60fps. If you can buy it cheap it deserves taking a look.			"

												This game is a port of a mobile game, with that comes alot of bugs, glitches, bad graphics.  Plus its real, real, real, short.  Any non-fans of Deus Ex Human revolution should avoid this game like the plague.  DO NOT BUY unless your a die hard Deus Ex HR fan, see the HR thats critical bcause people who are Deus Ex fans but hated HR would hate this too.  All that horrible stuff aside for Deus Ex HR fans its an interesting game.  Be warned the game in parts has real bad graphics with terrible textures.  Many things are PS2 era in the level of graphics, while other things are HD, so its a weird hybrid.  The atmosphere is done perfectly along with the music.  For a mobile port its pretty impressive, there is tons of dialog, and a train that moves, the city really captures that Deus Ex feeling well.  The story ties into Deus Ex, but the letdown is this is short, as in you go to one place in Panama city for missions and thats it, the game ends.  This game was supposed to be episodic but there are currently no plans to make more episodes.  Combat in the game is done only one way right and that is with stealth, the AI seems as bad as Deus EX HR, so if you were ok with that it should work here.  The takedowns are hilarious, you will sometimes not even appear near the person you takedown, for some reason they may warp across the room, showing you taking down a ghost while in the background you may see the enemy going down.  While the bugs are funny, the game does work, it doesnt crash, Deus Ex games were always pretty bad at combat its the story and atmosphere that drive them, this game pulled that part off, but with a cliff hanger at the end of the episode and nor more planned its enjoyable just to play through the golden glory of what is Deus Ex.ONLY play this with a controller, DO NOT BUY even if you are a fan if you are going to use a mouse.  The k/m controls are broken, often the screen will spin in circles, certain augs will make you constantly rubber band, yet  oddly none of that exists with a controller.  The hacking is broken with a controller yet is flawless with a mouse so gotta use both.  Sound difficult?  Then get some augs to handle what it takes to ride the cyber punk express.Rating for Deus EX HR Fans:  10/10  Value:  $2.50Rating for NON Deus Ex Fans:  0/10  Value:  $0.00			"

												This game isn't as bad as everybody is making it seem. Sure if you expect a whole new game with upto 30+ hours of gameplay you are going to be dissapointed. The game isn't perfect and it has it's share of good and bad issues. Which I shall go into.The game runs smoothly at a pretty decent rate. (I have a plebtier PC) and there wasn't any framerates issues throughout the entire game. The game was smooth from start to finish.The HUD is pretty clean. It's got a few obvious touch screen elements that shouldn't really be there. Drop down menu's and a rather unusual ingame store (using ingame money). Overall the HUD is better than I've seen from other ports.The audio, the ingame music is pretty decent. Fairly similiar to Deus Ex:Human Revelution. It's very close to DXHR although it's not exactly the same. It's a very much welcome addition to somebody that enjoyed the soundtrack to Deus EX.The voice acting is so-so. It seems to fluctuate between the characters, depending on how important or the screentime they have, The main protagonist I feel has a decent amount of quality. However the training mission instructor is absoluetly terrible. She's rather dull and boring. Speaking with one tone. Just readling lines off of a script with absolutely no emotion what so ever.  However sometimes the audio in game skips and jumps. Sounds get repeated or the audio mutes itself for two seconds. I also personally found the ambient sounds to be annoying but that's just a niggle I have.The background music was also louder than everything else. I guess they wanted to cover up the bad voice acting. Luckily you can change that in the menu settings. The setting aren't great either to be honest. It's got audio setting and reset your data but there isn't one for brightness and this game really needs that. I was bumbling along for a bit in some places.The levels are split into short sections, this requires a lot of loading, luckily the loading only takes a few seconds but it all adds up. It could've been better but at least it's short.The cutscenes are pausable which I haven't seen too often in games, so it's good that you are able to pause the game and it's slightly difficult to accidentally skip the cutscene if you want to resume the game. The orange glow used for items and 'hints' are still visible in the cutscenes which is really distracting and I personally find it annoying. You maybe able to overlook it though.Unless you turn the Autosave feature off. Due to the fact that there is only one save slot that both you and the autosave is supposed to use. Technical problems.Whilst I was playing I found that the mouse would get stuck in the centre of the screen which then made it impossible to look or aim. Minimizing the game helped fix that issue. The buttons in game for the menu aren't always responsive, sometimes you have to click on it more than once and some times upto 3 times.Whenever I performed a takedown the entire world would flicker and drop out (during the cutscene) this happened mostly in tight places but seemed to be entirely random. Once you kill or knockout an enemy they just fizzle away into orange triangles and then vanish. Which makes stealthing this game so easy that it's a joke. If you are used to playing MGS on the hardest whilst going for a complete stealth run. This is going to be like 'Baby's first stealth game'This isn't really an issue but it's pretty damn lazy, all of the animations have been recycled from DX:HR. The game also ends on a cliffhanging telling you that more is coming. Which I highly doubt by now.Overal, it's a nice little package. It's not great and it definetly has it's fair share of issues, However if you can get it cheap during a sale and you like Deus Ex, I'd suggest picking it up.			"

												This is a delicious Deus Ex morsel. It has all the stealth, exploration, choices, and combat from Human Revolution but in a tiny package. There's only one main location with a handful of quests, but what is here is absolutely quintessential Deus Ex. The huge caveat is that the game only includes Part 1, which ends on a huge cliffhanger. Part 2 was supposed to be made, but at this point it will never happen. Hence, the abrupt ending is very sad, but I enjoyed using my imagination as to what would have happened next.On the tech side, I had zero issues. The game looks very nice despite the mobile origins, and the controls are great with rebindable keys and hotkeys.Overall, this is a must-play for any serious Deus Ex fan. It's a nice 5-hour experience, with 3 to 4 more hours if you want to do multiple playthroughs on New Game Plus to unlock all Achievements.			"

												While the game is very good on its original platform (iOS), this version is a pretty atrocious port. The controls are very wonky and unintuitive when compared to any other Deus Ex title on PC. There are also some significant issues navigating menus with a mouse - sometimes a menu entry has to be clicked multiple times to even register. Overall just a pain to play on PC.

												I wish Steam had "" maybe "" option. You may even like it. I do and don't like it at the same. It's just not Deus Ex. There are some interesting things here. Experienced no technical problems ( heard it was a bad port at the beginning ), but now it is fixed. Get it on big discount. Get it on sale. It isn't worth it's full price. - story can keep a player till the end, but the game is short and has that episodic ending and shows that there would be another game if this one didn't get so much negative reviews- gameplay, well, you have some RPG elements, a little bit of everything that first Deus Ex and Deus Ex: Human Revolution had, it has Deus Ex elements, but it's just not the same game and it surely is not as good as first Deus Ex or DE:HR- voice acting is good, but lip sync, character models and graphics are terrible ( I can understand it because it's a mobile port, but I am really having a hard time reviewing this )- animations are just okay, nothing special- AI is not so dumb as somebody would expect, sure not the smartest AI, but I did get noticed many times when sneaking so it is not that easy to sneak by a guard, especially two guards, you really have to use your brain to make things easier in the game- 6 hours longBuy it on a sale, but if you want to try the real Deus Ex, I would rather recommend playing Deus Ex: Human Revolution ( fantastic game ).Buy it on sale if you're a great fan and need that Deus Ex fix, but rather replay first Deus Ex or DE:HR.All in all, 6/10, slightly above average, all in all, as a game, it is okay. :DWait for a sale or rather save money for the upcoming Deus Ex: Mankind Divided "

												I wish there would be something between ""Recommended"" and ""Not Recommended"" for this.In all honesty, Deus Ex: The Fall didn't deserve all the hate it received. Yes, it certainly has obvious flaws and it's riddled with questionable to outright laughable design decisions. But even after that, it did not fail to deliver the Deus Ex feeling to me personally, and especially its story is quite enjoyable.I picked it up on a sale for less than two bucks, and I felt that it was worth it for a few hours of fun (50% having fun with the actual gameplay, 50% laughing about how bad some of its aspects were). I can perfectly comprehend why many (non-trash-loving) people would be angry about The Fall; the graphics are somewhere around Quake 3-level (yes, that's a game from 1999), the level design makes absolutely no sense, the AI is as intelligent as a piece of burnt toast, the quality of the voice actors ranges somewhere between okay-ish and awful, and you can just feel that it is a half-hearted port of a mobile game - to name just a few points. Yes, that sounds god awful if you list it up like this, and it probably is, but if you are a fan of the Deus Ex universe and you want to have a few hours of trashy fun (that hopefully isn't destroyed by a game-breaking bug), you may as well pick this one up on a sale for a few bucks. You might say that Deus Ex: The Fall belongs in the ""so bad, it's good"" category in this regard.			"

Graphics are practically the same as on mobile devices - main differences are (apart from higher resolution, better framerate and MSAAx8):- some textures are more detailed and in higher resolution (especially on characters' suits - skip to 00:50 in the video above to see it clearly) - lightning is yellowish (just like Deus Ex Human Revolution) whereas on mobile devices it was more or less orange- some objects receieved better animations/physics - like flags, which are now moving on the wind instead of just hanging like a piece of woodI don't like the HUD - it's not comfortable to use (especially binding weapons to slots and drawing them). In options menu you can still find options related to in-app purchases(!!!)It requires some patching, you also shouldn't have high expectations - it's a mobile game and it feels like one.			"

												Do Not buy this game. ONLY get it, If you get it bundled with  Deus Ex games. Only Play it, If you liked Deus Ex: Human Revolution.  Don't expect much from this.  Play it for the Steam badge and forget it.This is a port of a mobile IOS / Android game to PC.   PROS: Has the similar game UI and artwork as Deus Ex: Human Revolution, but minus a lot of the DE:HR detailed functions.  Has objects to read and collect. Has different paths to take to reach objective.  Has different characters, locations, story from DE: HR, consider it a prequel to DE:HR.  Has voiceovers and choices of conversations answers. Does have steam acheivements and badge trading cards.  But it does has a cash shop for instant purchases of the gear you want to use to win the game. CONS:The Story is not finished at the end of game, It was going to be episodic.  Not a good game compared to Deus Ex: Human Revolution.  Handles shooting terrible, lag from shooting from cover, cannot jump, vault don't work well.  The people models and textures don't look as good as DE:HR. Buggy.For more info:

												If you came to this game expecting something like Human Revolution, you may find yourself dissapointed. However, I think this game is still recomendable for those of us die-hard Deus Ex fans. Although a much shorter (and simpler) game, it's still, in my opinion, a good game.The graphics are inferior to those of Human Revolution, but that should be obvious, considering that this game originated as a mobile game. Even then, they managed to capture the aesthetic of HR, with all its golden glory. As far as the environment goes, the city of Panama is an interesting location to explore, although it's much smaller in scale than the hubs of DEHR.The gameplay is also simplified. You don't need to search around for people to buy guns and/or Praxis kits from; you can do it whenever you please from the pause menu, and you also can't sell your weapons (but it doesn't matter, as money and bought weapons carry over to new playthroughs). The AI feels a bit dumb, as they'll quickly lose interest in you if you stay under cover for a short time; add to that the fact that bodies dissappear, and it makes for a much more ""casual"" Deus Ex experience. Even then, it's enjoyable.Finally, the story, in my opinion, is worthy of a Deus Ex game. It already starts with the main character trying to uncover a conspiracy, only to find about an even bigger conspiracy, and getting involved in it. The only downside, though, is that it ends on a cliffhanger. It seems that they intended to make this game episodic, but they abandoned that idea (probably due to the bad reception it got).Still, it's worth a shot in my opinion, I recommend it.			"

												I guess you can call this a chapter since there is supposed to be more content as it leaves you with a cliffhanger, this game you have to play it with an open mind and only if you want to know more about the Deus Ex universe, why? Because this is a pretty simple port from mobile devices, meaning you will get pretty low graphics and content. For the $2 it was it's good for what it offers. One thing's for sure, just like Human Revolutions, it's got a pretty good soundtrack.			"

												The game is a good time killer, when you have nothing else to do and when you are bored of you ""usual games"", that's the time to try this game out. It's not worth paying the full price tho, if you want this then you better trade for it or buy it when it's on sale.It looks and feels semi-oldschool however with a somewhat ""fresh"" textures. There's loads of invisible walls, the AIs are tarded and you can't jump...			"

Not BadI bought this when it first came to PC but the tutorial turned me off. Dusted it off to prepare for Mankind Divided and am glad I played it. Yes, it is a mobile port. Yes, it leaves off with ""to be continued"" and never will be. But after you get to the city the game opens up and starts to feel like a Deus Ex game.As a fan of the book I also really enjoyed the story as well.			"

												Deus Ex : The Fall successfully continues the atmosphere found in the Deus Ex universe with this mobile game, ported to the PC. If you loved Deus Ex : Human Revolution, you will surely enjoy the simpler version of it, expending on its origins, Deus Ex : The Fall.			"

												Even if this game is like 2.49, don't buy it. Human Revolution Director's Cut goes to 5 bucks or lower. Way more value. It's a bad mobile port with a cliffhanger story that will never be resolved.This game is at tops 1-2 hours long, 3-4 depending on if you like exploring places or not. Even then, the maps are extremely small and the mechanics are half-baked imitations of Deux Ex: Human Revolution.The story ties into the fantastic novel ""Icarus Effect"" by James Swallow. In fact, the tutorial section is pulled straight from the book. This game was supposed to be a continuation but it was so poorly received a sequel was probably canned. Therefore, this game has practically no ties to the Deus Ex Universe except to a prequel novel.Avoid.			"

It is not a patch on Human Revolution which is to be expected, but from someone who was hanging out for more Deus Ex goodness this kept me sated for a good 6 hours.

												Deus Ex: The Fall is a port from ios systems. Im going to compare sometimes this game and Deus Ex 3. While the graphics are terrible, its actually pretty fine for ios games. If you can overlook that it seems as a nice addition to the Deux Ex universe. The game tough is a little downgraded version of the Deus Ex 3 game. You have ""almost"" all of the augmentations . Taifun system isnt there anymore(wouldnt make sense tough since its a secret thing from sarif industries) and some smaller things have been removed. You cant pick up anything anymore tough and jumping isnt possible aswell.The map is just like in Deus Ex 3, you have a small ""hub"" where you run around, can find secrets and do side quests/run to your main quest. Mostly there are only 2 ways to solve a level, but sometimes you can go even a third or fourth way by using your augmentations. I didnt saw any way to really use your icarus landing system, but often you needed the arms upgrade for stealth in order to get into vents, destoying walls wasnt that often used but it wasnt in Deus Ex 3 either tough.The game has an ingame item shop which functions just as a shortcut to buy items. The thing is that its kinda unbalanced. While i never bought anything in the entire game, always saved money and did all side missions and almost went to every secret place, i just had about 9800 credits when i finished the game. Well the most expensive thing in the store is an praxis kit pack that costs 10.000 credits. But i never needed the shop anyways, i played trough the whole game and never bought anything and had almost all of the augmentations upgraded, enough ammo(i stealthed tough) and food bars.The soundtrack is directly taken out of Deus Ex 3. So its pretty good.The story is about some guy who is called Ben, working for the terrorist group you know from Deus Ex 3 , who attacked the sarif building. You are on a kind of revenge/escape trip story . While it starts out well, the voice acting from the main characters really annoys me, because it just sounds so bad. The story ends in a cliffhanger . I was pretty angry about that one tough. It took me about 5 hours to beat the game and i was slowly stealthing, doing all of the side quests and was searching for secrets. But i enjoyed that time. Overall i can recommend it if you like the Deus Ex formula and want more of the game. Otherwise, just leave this one aside.Hard to rate, would give it a 5/10 due the bad graphics, clunky port but somewhat fun gameplay.			"

												If there had been a follow up to the Fall, it would have been a more easy recommendation. As it stands, the game is for those who are curious or are fans of Deus Ex as it stands already. The story is incomplete, which is disappointing, but what is there is serviceable. Obviously the graphics aren't super great but if you enjoyed the gameplay of Human Revolution and wouldn't mind playing another couple of hours of something new with a slightly downgraded feel, this is available. I did quite enjoy it and I will most likely replay it once more.			"

												TL;DR: Three (3) hours of gameplay time.I was initially confused about why the game had so many negative reviews. To start with it didn't seem as good as Deus Ex Human Revolutions, but it was interesting. After three hours there was a nice dramatic scene and I was looking forward to moving on from what I assumed was the prologue. And then it said ""To Be Continued"" and played the end credits.That 3 hours was including the side quests.			"

												The leading reviews for this game are so negative! I appreciate that I have it. Many of the harshest critics claiming to be true lovers of the Deus ex series! If they were so faithful to the series they would appreciate it for what it is! The upgrading on this PC edition of The Fall to make it compatible for PC is truly admirable. The criticism is distasteful, rather than enjoying the larger ""VIEW"" on the games' sequence of events, the critics treat their PC's like an overblown mobile device...criticizing on and on, MAN; MY eyes need a rest from that small/little ""VIEW"" on my mobile screen! What about yours? The possibilities experienced here translated from a mobile-phone/android size screen impressed me so...making it the worthy mobile companion for Deus ex-Human Revolution. Having played and completing Deus ex-Human Revolution, The Fall is shorter in comparison by far, almost the duration of the previous Deus ex-Human Revolution, DLC; The Missing Link. A story I got engrossed in.			"

												I was really afraid of how much the game is going to be bad thanks to many negative reviews. But after finishing it I have to say that the game is great! It has the Deus Ex atmosphere, story is perfect, locations are well designed and I really enjoyed playing it. Yes, thanks to the conversion from another platform, the graphic is not as good as we are used to, but still sufficiently nice. One thing that people are missing is that this IS the conversion so you cannot expect miracles, but you also have to take into consideration, that the price is not as high as for standard games. I haven't also encountered any bugs during gameplay and everything went smoothly. If you love deus ex universe, good story, cyberpunk or stealth action this is the right choice. Games are about fun, not the lower graphics or the necessary simplifiations thanks to the conversion.			"

												Every series always has a down end, even Deus Ex. There are reasons why this game is not recommend for everyone, one reason is that if this is going to be your first Deus Ex game, please play one of the other ones first.. You will be clueless, and unsure if the rest of the series is worth it. I understand this game was not meant for PC, but I avoided thinking that I am playing a fully verse ""PC"" game since that  is what this game originated from. For the story, the story done well keeping things rolling fast enough to keep up with but never fully slow down which is a great thing. For the voice acting it was pretty well done, even though the graphics are not the greatest thing in the world for IOS style. The interface was also quite brilliant, even though at times the knock downs were not really pretty (and quite glitchy usually, but funny to watch). I hope you find this review great (for those going to get it for IOS wise but for PC wise not so recommended).			"

												The other day, in preparation for the eventual release of Deus Ex: Mankind Divide, I completed my fifth playthrough of Human Revolution. Once I was finished, I noticed that, amidst various other unplayed games in my Steam library, there sat my copy of Deus Ex: The Fall which I realized I had not played. I quickly Googled the title and on the Wikipedia page, found a few choice comments from reviewers:Don’t be fooled by the black-andgold screenshots and the familiar interface: this is not the Deus Ex you know and love. It’s a bad cover version, and truly one of the worst PC ports I’ve played in some time, and I’ve played Deadly Premonition. I definitely didn’t ask for this. -Andy Kelly (PC Gamer)The controls are another culprit here; they are clunky and unresponsive in ways that a keyboard and mouse never should be. Menu buttons routinely fail to respond to repeated mouse clicks. -Daniel Hindes (Gamespot)-----------------------------Read online at http://www.petersaysstuff.com/2015/06/why-everyone-is-wrong-about-deus-ex-the-fall/-----------------------------After reading the comments, I decided to play it. After completing the game (yes, I did search every nook and crany) I’m here to tell you one thing: all those negative reviews are wrong. While not Human Revolution quality, Deus Ex: The Fall was, for a game ported from mobile devices in a short time-span, very solid.PlotDeus Ex: The Fall tells the story of Ben Saxon, a British soldier who’s squad died in a sabotaged mission and who was recruited into the Tyrants (Jaron Namir‘s gang of baddies that you end up fighting in Human Revolution), and Anna Kelso, an enigmatic former US Secret Service agent who survives a massacre and, in searching for the killers, loses her job and is on the run from the Tyrants. Saxon and Kelso, on the run from the Tyrants, are hiding out in a safehouse when the effects of the 2027 neuropozyne (Nu-Poz) shortage become too much and Saxon must find more Nu-Poz for him and Kelso. Along the way, Saxon finds that there is an alternative to Nu-Poz: Riezene. Riezene appears to function just as well, but hasn’t been approved yet. During Saxon’s investigation, he is required to complete various quests from a doctor at a local LIMB clinic to find out how the Riezene is getting on the streets. Saxon finds out that the company developing Riezene, Zaaphire Biotech, is leaking the drug an the victims from overdoses and “street trials” are sold to Belltower. After witnessing the assassination of a WHO investigator by Saxon’s supposedly dead squadmate, Sam Duarte, he bugs out and meets up with rouge Belltower VTOL pilot Alex Vega. After clearing her takeoff, they leave Panama City and head to Zaaphire Biotech’s headquarters in Australia while Kelso hides and helps from afar.The game ends with Duarte and Jaron Namir apologizing to Bob Page for failing to kill Saxon and Kelso. Duarte vows to kill the rogue Tyrant before he can cause any more trouble. The screen then cuts to a “To be continued” card, hinting at another game starring the couple. (x)Pros and ConsI played the game for a solid 5 hours; not as much as some, but more than others. After my game play, I have compiled the following list of pros and cons…we’ll start with cons first.Cons:Sub-par combat mechanics — can’t aim down sights, limited weapon choice, when in cover can’t draw weapon without firing, etc.Not optimized for PC — terrible character models, can’t jump, taking cover is a pain, no difficulty setting, reload animations are laughable, etc.Glitches — falling through the floor into the abyss, takedowns place NPCs in walls where they can’t be accessed, etc.Most of the mechanics — hacking is terrible, AI is predictable, etc.Pros:Story line parallels Human Revolution’s, story stays engaging, questions remain and compartmentalization of knowledge stays true to DX’s history, etc. (More on this later)Character development and interaction is nuanced and waiting to be fleshed out in a sequelAtmosphereI’m sure there are others, but I wanted to make a relatively short list because, let’s all agree, the mechanics are very sub-par and I won’t dispute that. I, however, want to focus on the mechanics being solid for a quick port as well as the engaging storyline.Why I Can Deal With The MechanicsDeus Ex: The Fall was originally released for iOS and Android before making its way to the PC. This meant that the controls were programmed for the god-awful “console” that is the iPhone. After that, they were slightly tweaked for Android, but could largely remain unchanged. Following that, the game was rush-released for the PC giving very little time for extensive overhaul. How can I tell this? The iOS release was on 7/11/13. The Android release was 6 months later on 1/22/14…and the PC release was not even 2 months later when it became available on 3/18/14! The developers had half a year to optimize the game for Android and then less than 2 months to change everything for the PC release.The timeframe alone doesn’t excuse the mechanics, but it does make me sympathetic and with the strong story, I am confident in saying that the quick port was solid for what it was. It was never meant to be a Human Revolution; most likely it was a side project by the developers that turned into a fun game.StoryThis is where I think the game really excels and where I am willing to say that I want a sequel. The story leaves us with questions that need answers. Why is Zaaphire leaking the drug? What is Belltower doing with the victims? How did Sam survive the ambush? Was Sam a part of the Tyrants before the ambush? Why do the Tyrants report to Bob Page? How does the Nu-Poz shortage and Saxon’s rampage affect the canon of Human Revolution? What happens to Kelso? Where does Vega go? I could keep going, but I’m sure you get the idea.The point is, The Fall is akin to the first Detroit visit in Human Revolution — the player is left with questions that are slowly answered in coming levels — the issue, however, is where Human Revolution continued, The Fall has died.I say, make a sequel to The Fall and release it between now and when Mankind Divided comes out! That will satisfy fans and keep the buzz alive. Remember, you #cantkillprogress! "

												Wow is this game bad or what. Where to begin..The menu system is awful and confusing, there are so many bad UI choices here it boggles the mind.The voice acting is pitiful, did they grab random people off the street and drain all emotion from them somehow? Its painfully bad, but thankfully mostly skippable.The graphics, oh man the graphics. This game came out last year! How is it this bad? No amount of AA can stop this trainwreck, it reminds me of the original, not sure that was intentional.I must have got this in some Humble Bundle, but its really not worth the SSD space it takes up. I can't see myself playing this to completion as it makes my eyes bleed and brain hurt.Lastly the plot seems paper thin and transparent as anything. It might surprise me but I heavily doubt it.TL:DR?

												I went into The Fall expecting a shallow mobile spin-off, what I got was worse than what I could have ever fathomedThe game unlovingly mocks Deus Ex: Human Revolution by making its hud and environment urine yellow. No choices because lethal or not enemies vanish with NPCs acting like you killed them, and all dialogue leads the same route.The environments are completely exploitable with poor design decisions and the AI is nonsensical.Giving a pass of the hilariously awful models due to it being a port of mobile game, the game still has an odd aliasing effect even with 8XAA.The port is awful and won't even let you rebind any of the controls, which is hilarious because the default one the game uses is putrid.As to be expected it is also filled with so much bugs you could swear the game was unfinished, which oddly enough is how it plays.You only have one save slot though so use it well. To make it all worse is that the story and characters are a bore and aren't even worth a read on the Deus Ex wiki, let alone to playthrough this game.   I give credit were it is due though, just when I thought the game couldn't possibly♥♥♥♥♥♥on the Deus Ex name any further it goes all out completely drops the ball at the end.I wish it could be erased from history and I really wish I could get my $2.99 plus tax back.

												Deus Ex franchise is like OS Windows from MS - every second is good. After legendary Deus Ex (2000) received fans of the IP average sequel Invisible War (2003). Their broken hearts were for a while healed with well crafted Human Revolution (2011). Unfortunately The Fall (2013) is another step into the void. Please don´t get me wrong, as mobile game the title have some notable qualitites (especially when I compare it with other mobile games on market) but as full-valued sequel one of the most iconic PC games I must say the gameplay experience was unpolished & heavy mediocre (not to mention the forcibly cut storyline).Let´s hope that with the good game/bad game cycle which accompanied Deus Ex series from beginning we will receive this year from developers a game (Mankind Divided) with high level of gameplay quality to which we have become accustomed (Deus Ex, Human Revolution).

												Since this is port from mobile, one have to forgive a lot of technical and graphical limitations this game has in comparison to DX: HR. But, it's not hard to forgive and after while you forget that you play 2006 looking game in 2014... And if we take that a side, The Fall is in a lot of areas, decent DX game.... And here is big ""BUT""... It's to short... It took me 4h to finish it, and I played it stealthy and without killing anybody, while exploring every single part of maps. If one would play it more head-on and with less exploration, it would take even less then 4h to finish it. So, this is by scope of gameplay, barely in realm od DLC... Overall, game is decently fun, has OK-ish story, but story and game stop to early with text ""to be continued"".So, I recommend it, but only for fans of DX universe and ONLY on some decent discount.Score: 5 / 10			"

This game feels like a more cluttered mess then Human Revolution.The menus are extremely annoying, the controls are changed and can no longer have aim/iron sights. THe gameplay feels like you're in a forced linear path with no exploration.You're a different character, who worked with the same group/team that infiltrated the compound and shot you in the intro of Human Revolution.The graphics are blurry and isn't very pleasing.5/10 "

												Bought this even after the (mostly) terrible reviews it's had. Human revolution it definatly isn't a lot of the graphic rendering is to a much lower standard, although the enviroment is much the same, as is the way the game plays some nice side quests to keep you interested. The controls however (I'm playing this on a pc) are a sack of ♥♥♥♥, to say it's clunky would be an understatement. It feels very much like this was rushed out of the door to cash in on the sucess of HR, which is a crying shame, as the game has potential.  I hope to see more of this, it will be a shame if all the bad reviews make the devs drop the fall altogether. It definatly needs to better developed, polished like HR was. If you're a Deus Ex addict like me and you don't mind swearing at the lame controls once in a while, buy it, at the stupidly low price it is now, it's a nice way to fill  4or 5 hours and feed the addiction ;)Edit. like so many people have said already, why no jump button? ok so you can sail though the game without, but i got stuck more than once in places that the freaky vault function bugged out on me.

												It's like someone else made this .... the graphics and animations are not polished. when you do take downs you're doing wrestling moves with ghosts while the enemies are really a dozen feet away. from the very first cutscene where you jump out of a plane it looks like the animators just didnt care. doesn't look fluid. I love the world and DE 1 and revolution are amazing games. I do look forward to the new one coming out and will of course buy it. This game though is only for the hardcore Deus ex fans that need another 4 hours of story right now.			"

												The graphics... let's be nice and call them ""retro"".  Texture quality and model complexity are extremely crude for a 2014 release.  This isn't a problem on a mobile device's tiny screen, but on PC you get a clear view of just how crappy everything looks.Animations are very stiff.  Everyone looks like they crawled out of the deepest abyss of the uncanny valley.  Lips do not sync with dialogue.  At one point you visit a nightclub (because, by law, every work of cyberpunk must have a nightclub), where you can see dancers whose moves make Commander Shepard look like Fred Astair.Dialogue is full of cheese and cliches.  Voice acting is a mixed bag of terrible.  Main characters have this flat, dramatic voice to emphasize how serious everything is.  Panamanian NPC's, meanwhile, take it the opposite direction and talk like Speedy Gonzales.  I don't mean to say that's racist, but it is kinda silly given the game's intended tone.I think most of the major bugs were patched out by the time I played the game, but takedowns have some occasional animation errors.  Sometimes all surfaces will disappear and the animation will play out in an endless sky, as if the game briefly genre shifted to shonen anime.  Once I beat up a guy's floating gun while he stood back looking bewildered.There are no shops in this game.  Rather, for a modest fee, you can instantly teleport any weapons, health packs, and other supplies you may need to your location through the inventory menu!  Who knew hiding from bloodthirsty mercenaries would be so convenient?  Unfortunately, the inventory screen does not stock the cyborg drug you're looking to score.  Too bad.I think the achievement for non-lethal runs is bugged.  I tried not to kill security guards, but I did gun down several mercenaries and gang members.  Look, achievement, I know those aren't very nice people, but they're still people.  You should acknowledge when I murder them.In conclusion, I would not recommend paying full price for Deus Ex: The Fall.  However, if you can get it cheap, this game is a laugh and a half.  I enjoyed my time playing it, and if you like so-bad-it's-good games, I think you will too.			"

												I dont normally write reviews but this game is bad enough that id like to warn people off. If you liked the past deux ex games you will probably hate this one. The game is short in comparison, and the story line is both lacking and very linear. There are very few side quests and they arent that interesting. The voice acting is fine except when its on an pad that takes an hour to play out, with long pauses so you keep walking away from it thinking its done. The sound for it also doesnt follow you and it gets quieter as you walk away from it.There is NO jump funtion, and the cover function is terrible. It bugs out, flips your mouse around when you get close to walls, and is both unresponsive at times and not satisfying in the best of times.While there was not a ton of extra ways to go and choices to make the ones that were in game were fine.No zoom function, no sniper rifle. The differences in the weapons werent very good. I did like the upgrading.I did not like the UI for buying stuff although I did like being able to buy things from anywhere. Even though I would have preffered not to have that.I did not like active skills. But I could see how some people would.The story line didnt even feel half done, there was not even a single ""boss"" fight in game.The city was terrible, the zoning was terrible, the graphics were terrible.I loved the other games, sadly yet another line of good games screwing up enough to stop me from buying anymore.

												It's a rare chance for me to review an actual new game so I am very excited to take it. The thing is - I usually get games on super sales or in bundles and I cannot even remember how I got this one. I do remember I had it before it was available for actual download and play on Steam and that I had to wait for a certain date to ""unlock"" it.Those who know me will tell you boring I can be with all the talk of Deus Ex. The original Deus Ex that came out in 2000. I remember how amazed I was with that game back then, it just blew me off right from the start. Even today I claim it's one of the best games ever made, seriously! Its sequel was a big disappointment, while Human Revolution was a nice surprise. Now, based on my experience with Human Revolution I really expected a lot from The Fall. What I didn't know up until recently is that The Fall was originally made for mobiles - I just don't really care for mobile games. If I did, I certainly wouldn't be so excited about the new Deus Ex game since most of the mobile conversions end up being a pile of crap. Unfortunately, I was right.Deus Ex: The Fall tells a story of Ben Saxon, a former mercenary who used to work for Tyrants (the bad guys from Human Revolution) and the problem with Neuropozyne shortage. Neuropozyne is a drug that all augmented humans use to fight the body's rejection of augmentations and without it bad things may happen. Long story short, Ben goes on a mission to find a replacement drug in Panama City.The game itself weird right from the start. After the usual tutorial mission where you learn how to move, shoot etc... you learn that you cannot jump. No jumping in 2014? In a FPS game? Seriously? You cannot even reconfigure the controls in the game at all. At all. I personally never reconfigure the controls (unless they are reeeeally awkward, which is rare and most usually ends up in me giving up such a game whose controls problem is the least of the problems it has) but such an option should be mandatory. Even shooting the enemies can be a problem, I am not even sure if the available crosshair is accurate. It seems to work fine if you zoom in on the enemy, but nothing happens if you just fire at them! Not always, but a lot of time. If you do manage to hit someone and they die - prepare for a surprise: 5 seconds later their bodies evaporate. This is a perfect spot for a smiley with big, surprised eyes, isn't it?However, there is a way to actually enjoy this game. Sneaking. If you decide to go into stealth mode and avoid enemies, hack consoles and hide from cameras, you are in for a much better experience. It will even earn you an achievement if you complete the game without killing anyone. It is as if the game creators are aware of how much they screwed up with the combat so they are giving you a hint on how to have more fun with their game.The graphics are simplified from Human Revolution, which is kind of expected from a mobile game port. If you think HR had too much yellow and amber - prepare for MUCH MORE. I had a feeling I was playing a game on my Hercules Monochrome monitor I used to have in 1992 (it was one of those weird monitors that had orange and black instead of white and black). NPC models are recycled versions of each other but it's not too bad, at least for me.There's also a plenty of bugs all over the game. I saved a game before entering combat with 2 enemy soldiers, died and reloaded. They were gone. The controls are sometimes unresponsive, especially in game menus - you click on OK or BACK or whatever, but nothing happens until you try it again. A harder mouse button push might help, no matter how illogical it may sound. What else... Ah! Hacking. In case you didn't play Human Revolution - to hack a door you need to play a mini game (shown on a screenshot) to reach a certain module before the enemy anti-hack reaches you. However, sometimes you cannot zoom out enough to actually click on the next module. I haven't found a way to fix that and I even tried changing resolutions and using a window mode.Overall, The Fall is a big disappointment for any true Deus Ex fan. It just feels cheap and not worthy of Square Enix and the games we are used to get from these guys. I know it's a conversion, but with a little effort (and less amber!) it could have been an amazing game. This way... well, I told you, it is possible to enjoy it if you play it in a very specific game, but that's not it. You should be able to pick your way through, as what we are used from Deus Ex.Oh, and there is only ONE save game slot. You are warned!			"

												It's, unfortunately, quite an obvious port and a shoddy one at that.I was eager to get back into the world of Deus Ex, but this isn't the way. I personally don't care much for graphics and understandably, the user interface is somewhat different.But the parts that really ruin it for me are where a port is noticable in gameplay.The most awful part was the mouse sensitivity randomly changing in-game. It would be fine in the menus, but in-game it would be almost impossible to play. Not framerate issues: actual sensitivity.A minor but still very annoying part was that, having played Deus Ex: Human Revolution, I knew how to play the game. And there are a variety of tutorials you can't skip.Overall, it's a bad port. If you're looking another experience like Deus Ex: Human Revolution, you'd best look elsewhere.			"

												Dues Ex: The Fall takes the form of a single hub from Deus Ex: Human Revolution. In theory, a bite-sized Deus Ex story mimicking the form of Human Revolution sounds great. In practice however, The Fall is deficient in too many areas to recommend. The production values are low in terms of visuals and controls feel clunky, although I played with a controller. The story leaves much to be desired in that it is a prequel to Human Revolution. The villains are the same ones present in Human Revolution, robbing the game of any mystery because you already know what's going to happen and you aren't going to be able to pacify these same people that Adam Jensen takes care of in Human Revolution. Furthermore, the game ends on a cliffhanger and will likely never be resolved in any case. Not recommended.			"

If this is going to be a trend with the Deus Ex games, good game, poor excuse for a follow up 4 years later, then an exceptional re-boot seven years later, then I guess we've got at least another 6 years before we get another good one...hope things look up again for this series.

												Its hard to believe all the hate this game is receiving (although the latest patch fixed a lot I hear, like saving.) Let me start by saying that this isnt a fully fledged Deus Ex game, the design solely considered use on tablets and phones. Why bother coding advanced features (as seen in HR) when iOS devices of 2013 cant run them? This port is just to expand the audience slightly. Its not the greatest port as there are still some slight control issues and not being able to jump feels wierd but given its orignal design intentions there is nothing too obtrusive, think of it as Deus Ex: Lite. The art style is the same as HR but the graphics quality is rather poor. The world certainly has the same feel as HR but its not nearly as detailed. Combat is a wee bit clunky too. The story is standard Deus Ex affair (meaning good), it focuses on the aug mercenaries that made up the boss fights in HR. Its not a perfect story though as I sometimes felt the characters had no motive to do what they were doing and the game is actually only the first part of an episodic series (no word on future installments though). Voice acting and music is very much up to par (minus the robot woman in the tutorial.) . Ultimately what Im saying is that you shouldnt be expecting a game of the same standards as HR. Its Deus Ex: Lite and that is also reflected in the price. I got it on sale and I dont regret it.			"

Mostly copied from Deus Ex Human Revolution but with few enhancements there is NO game actually which can top the futuristic, postapocaliptic ambient music from Deus Ex Line!Even superior PC Games are♥♥♥♥♥♥ Only some special games can be a good competitor (like Final Fantasy, Halo, OCARINA of TIme) but those seem to be also very old ;)And everyone who dares to compare THIS fantastic short sequel to FULL-AAA games, is just a consume-♥♥♥♥♥ and has no brain because those guys are not able to COMPARE with several conditions.For me, this game is really awesome. I never thought that an IOS/ANDROID game can be so complex and so great. Even on the pc its quiet nice. Since I am also a huge Deus EX Fan, this is a MUST have and a really nice game to have since it has some intersections with Human Revolution!			"

												I don't really know what I was expecting when I pre-ordered this game, but the price-tag should have been a big warning for me. First of all, I am NOT one of those haters who slam all other Deus Ex games but the first one just because they don't use the same game mechanics, plot depth or what so ever. So SquareEnix's ""reboot"" was, in my opinion a very well produced and orchestrated Blade Runnerish type of game with a solid story and some heated ammo-wasting moments. The only downfall was the constant loading between city districts which broke the pace.Now I do not know who or why or when this aweful piece of software was bred, but if there is ONE Deus Ex franchised game you should NOT play, it's THIS garbage. Be it the graphics which look like they were created 5 years ago and only ""shine"" because of a recent game engine, the stereotype dialogs, the horrid level design, the pestering bugs, the gameplay mechanics which were apparently made for alien hands... I could go on and on. This game should simply NOT exist. And you do not need to own it. Just forget it play a real Deus Ex game, which ever you want, but seriously, if you value your life, do not get this... thing.			"

												I suppose I can't expect too much from a game that was designed for a mobile device, but the thing is it should have never been designed for phones and/or tablets to begin with. I dare say this one is so dummed down and ""touch screen friendly"" that the let-down factor is enough to give Deus Ex: Invisible War a run for it's money. If this is going to be a trend with the Deus Ex games, good game, poor excuse for a follow up 4 years later, then an exceptional re-boot seven years later, then I guess we've got at least another 6 years before we get another good one...hope things look up again for this series.

												This game would better be named ""The Fail"", as it has definitely fallen.  The porting of this game to PC is poorly done and nothing about it is complete.  The lack of customizable keybinds and sloppy mouse control are, as a pair, a deal breaker and extremely shameful for a game release.  I won't even elaborate on the terrible combat system or the broken audio that disupts the storyline enough to cause you to just....quit.   This game lacks polish and, honestly, it doesn't look like much effort was put into making this a finished product.  I would say that this is Invisible War revisited, yet at least IW was playable.

												This game is truly amazing. They really kept the open levels of HR, with very few loading screens, and I love the way that you can move the bodies around, in fact I love that they stay in place and don't just disappear. The game is so responsive: it does exactly what you tell it to, allowing for some complex jumping physics. The gunplay feels so great as well. The recoil is very realistic. The game also does a good job with rebindable keys and an FOV slider, as well as colourblind options, and it even has reasonable mouse sensitivity options. The tutorial blows my mind: it does a really good job of explaining what to do and never gets in the way of gameplay, and I love the way that it is possible to buy stuff during missions away from any shops: it really helps to keep me immersed in the game's interesting and fleshed-out world, with good-looking environments that are fully 3D rendered. A stunning return to form from Eidos Montreal and a real contender for the best Deus Ex game, in fact it may even be my favourite game of this year, thanks to the interesting combat system, good AI, and varied environments.In all seriousness though, the game is broken. You should be paid to play this. Even free is too much.			"

												I preordered this and got the Steam edition of DX:GOTY free. I got my money's worth.If you're paying full price, you will not get your money's worth.Let's start with the bad. The game is glitchy. You can't change the keyboard or mouse layout, your inventory is a terrible mix of game mechanics, you've only got about half the augmentations out of Human Revolution, the graphical design reminds one of Invisible War's summer home in the uncanny valley, and the voice acting...it's a Deus Ex game. The voice acting is no surprise.Is there any good left to be had? Of course. This is the runt of the Deus Ex franchise, but that still gives it a solid pedigree. The core gameplay is there. The vibrant world is there. The story is a lightweight, but it's there. If you're a fan of the series, there's enough here to be worth your time.Treat The Fall as a glorified DLC for Human Revolution, but don't put it on the same tier as The Missing Link. Put it on your wishlist and wait for the price to crash.			"

												Deus Ex: The Fall is a flawed game.There is no getting around the fact that this game was built for mobile first. The game takes what made Deus Ex: Human Revolution great and butchers it, however Deus Ex: HR is an amazing game, so even the butchered remains of it manage to provide some fun.There is nothing that this game does better than Deus Ex: HR, I still managed to enjoy it because I took it for what it is. A simplistic, short mobile port with a barely passable story.It is hard to recommend this game, but I still will, simply because if you go past the comparison with Deus Ex: HR, then you just might find an average game capable of generating enough interest to keep you playing thorugh its 3-4 hour long campaign.6 / 10			"

Do not ever buy this game ever if you choose to do so use steam actual to get it so u can refund this♥♥♥♥♥♥the second you realize what a horrible mistake you have made. BUGGED! I cannot complete any % of this game. Just after the beginning cinematic it shows you how to look and how to move. Seconds later at the first obsticle you are supposed to take cover by using the left trigger, I use a 360 controller as the KB/MOUSE control is LOCKED and cannot be changed. THE COVER SYSTEM IS BUGGED! I cannot enter cover whatever I do and as such I can't even START this game. The graphics PALE is comparrison to Human Revolution and the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor and laughably BAD port of this game to the PC makes it fully unplayable. This was origenally Made as an iOS and Android game but the PC porting job is so bad I can only actively warn against it with all I can muster. DO NOT BUY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!EDIT: You cant have a second controller attached to your computer or the triggers wont work... to fix it just unplug the second one. STUPID ♥♥♥♥ing game coded by MONKEYS!Edit 9/22: Man, I still am TRYING to play this cuz the story is so intertwined with DE3 but its so hard to play for more than 10 minutes when I find something else I hate about it... The controls really are not meant for PC. Cover is a TOGGLE, a ♥♥♥♥ing toggle! U can change it to hold for cover but jesus who would play it like that! It's one of the only controls you can do anything with because we sure as hell can't rebind.... I'll let you know when I finally finish this travesty.			"

												Its hard to believe all the hate this game is receiving (although the latest patch fixed a lot I hear, like saving.) Let me start by saying that this isnt a fully fledged Deus Ex game, the design solely considered use on tablets and phones. Why bother coding advanced features (as seen in HR) when iOS devices of 2013 cant run them? This port is just to expand the audience slightly. Its not the greatest port as there are still some slight control issues and not being able to jump feels wierd but given its orignal design intentions there is nothing too obtrusive, think of it as Deus Ex: Lite. The art style is the same as HR but the graphics quality is rather poor. The world certainly has the same feel as HR but its not nearly as detailed. Combat is a wee bit clunky too. The story is standard Deus Ex affair (meaning good), it focuses on the aug mercenaries that made up the boss fights in HR. Its not a perfect story though as I sometimes felt the characters had no motive to do what they were doing and the game is actually only the first part of an episodic series (no word on future installments though). Voice acting and music is very much up to par (minus the robot woman in the tutorial.) . Ultimately what Im saying is that you shouldnt be expecting a game of the same standards as HR. Its Deus Ex: Lite and that is also reflected in the price. I got it on sale and I dont regret it.			"

												Has the visuals of the Deus Ex released in 2000 with the mechanics (sorta) of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. If Human Revolution was a fine aged Whiskey, this game is... an O'Douls.No, but really. Just like in HR, this game has: a high-rise level, a massive ship level, a night club, a slum area with frag mines, helicopter guarded by robots, female helicopter pilot, conspiracies. Reused animations and music but super low-res textures. This is very much like a slice of HR, but at lower production value.All quests in 90min, or up to 6 hours if you want to search every trash bin.			"

												The first thing I should let you know is that I only recommend that you buy this in a sale. It certainly isn't worth the full price.  Now that that has been said, I will review the game. Many people complain about the low-res textures and low polygon count visible in the graphics, as well as the lack of any sort of jumping mechanic and the awful evaporating corpses. The reason that these problems are present is because this game was designed to run on much less powerful systems, so complaining about this is redundant. As you can see, I clocked in at around 5 hours for a first time playthrough, and I did all of the side missions as well as the main story. The game is very small, but somehow conveys a sense of scale, for example the view you get of Panama from the hotel window is stunning. There are only about 4 side missions to go with the main quest, and all of them involve going to exactly the same place and retrieving different items, which is only slightly more fun than it sounds. In Human Revolution, there were at least 15 separate takedown sequences, but in The Fall there are only about 6 and they are all poorly rendered. The game is full of annoying bugs, some of which are worse than others. For example, when I was infiltrating a gang hideout in Panama, I literally fell through the floor of the map and continued to fall until I reloaded the save file. Yes. THE save file. This game only has one save slot, which can be potentially game-breaking if you save in the wrong place. Basically what this means is that every time you save, you have to overwrite the previous save. This is definitely the worst game in the series, but it's still a fun way to spend a few hours.			"

												Ehhhhh...It's alright. It's a quick and dirty port of a mobile game, and it's actually quite amazing for being that.The only real issue is the terrible control scheme. Or, maybe ""terrible"" isn't the right word. It's just not right for a PC game.You have to hold down the mouse button for a couple of seconds before what's-his-face will start actually shooting, due to the touchscreen-oriented nature of the game.I'd still recommend picking it up only on sale if you want an hour or two of fun, though. While I haven't finished it yet, I've heard it's short.I'm putting that I got it free, because I may as well have. I paid like $2 for it through the Humble Store and threw it in with Deus Ex GOTY and Human Revolution (which I had already intended to buy).			"

If Human Revolution died and came back as a zombie, this game would be its twitching severed toe after you blew its brains out.On PC, and after playing Human Revolution. I was really looking forward to more Deus Ex. Instead I got a poor quality tablet port which was not properly adapted to PC gameplay standards.If they had ported the content into the HR engine, I might have been able to overlook the slow scripting and the feel that the voice actors are on their first read-through.List of things which annoyed me in the first moments:Low texture quality, poor models enemies de-res (I thought this was a plot point at first, but no, the bodies just turn to polygons)can buy ammo and weapons ANYWHERE (in the middle of combat, surounded by enemies) from the inventory screenno jumpingclunky controlsunresponsive controls (ignores clicks)unarmoured cannon-fodder enemies who take multiple headshots and still fight on...this was just the first few MINUTES of play.so, no.

												Deus Ex : Human Revolution was an awesome game.I started playing Deus Ex on the very firt Deus Ex title when I was 8 or 9 years old. I didn't get all of it, but I still enjoyed it.I enjoyed it even more several years later, maturity kicking in and all.There was a sequel, unfortunately... Something named Deus Ex 2. Something that should never have come between any gamer's hands. But hey, nobody is perfect.Deux Ex : Human Revolution went back to the basics, when you had to actually make a choice about where to spend those skill points and you couldn't get everything up. The kind of choices that dramatically impact your gameplay experience, and you feel the need to take the right decision.Plus the graphics were good, the storytelling was great... A great game, what else can I say ?Then there is Deus Ex : The Fall, coming after Human Revolution.At first I was like ""Hey, the last one was awesome, and this is supposed to be linked with it... Can't be anything but good"".I had never been so wrong.- NEW HERO, with the charisma of a cow- OLD GRAPHICS, way below Human Revolution- SHORT, like 2-3 hours long gameplay, ended by a ""to be continued"" that kicks you in the stomach at the VERY moment you think ""Finally, things are getting serious""- POOR STORYLINE, with a new drug problem on top of Neuropozyn from Human Revolution, which is... the only good part, actually.My advice, wait for a GOOD Steam sale to buy it... If you REALLY want it. I had it at -75%, it already felt too expensive for the experience provided. And I played like 9 hours, so I REALLY got around it all... mostly.			"

												Absolutely hold off spending a penny on this game until they post a patch fixing this awful sound bug.  The sound and speech vanishes making it impossible to hear what's going on around you,  and the subtitles appear for a microsecond, making it impossible to listen to NPC chatter that way.Also1) Vertical mouse is so much slower than horizontal mouse.  Gives me carpel trying to look up and down almost2) Nothing like HR.  Inventory is gone.  A magic store that follows you that you can buy stuff from at any moment.3) Can't throw objects at people as a weapon4) Bodys vanish into a pile of pixel dust a few seconds after they fall.5) Unable to customise the keyboard hotkeys. You must play it THEIR way.6) When firing a weapon, the game does this weird zoom/in zoom/out silliness. Almost like your sniper scope is kicking in for a moment when each shot fired.7) One miserable universal saveslot.  I did a quicksave and goofed around to try out some mechanics. I didnt realise autosave was on in the settings and it overwrote my quicksave.8) Gigantic consolitis style UI elements you cant change.You MIGHT get some enjoyment from it if you can get past all that, as even a watered down Deus Ex HR type DLC is better than half the games out there, but the sound bug is a complete game stopper.

												Sure, after DXHR this comes as a bit of a disappointment, but does that make it a bad game? IMHO: no!The price for this game is the price you would expect for a DLC, the same goes for the length of the game. It is still a pretty nice story in the Deus Ex universe. The fact that the game was designed for iCrap at first sure brings a lot of drawbacks. Mainly technical and graphically. There are some glitches and some downsides but the game still plays along nicely. Sure the cam goes outside of the level sometimes and takedown-movies don't match what actually happens (body end up somewhere else etc.) but usually these glitches are just a bit annoying at worst but don't destroy the game for me. Surely not for the few bucks it cost. They actually made the augmentation-tree better.For me the biggest negative point is that the game ends in a Cliffhanger ""to be continued"" but they never continued it. I actually would like a sequel to this game very much, but corrected for the flaws in this version. (ie: not developed for mobile in the first place). I hope they still find a satisfying end to this story in DXMD which looks as awesome as DXHR was.			"

												For starters, go in knowing that it's a port of a mobile game and you'll be much better off. I'm not sure how more touched up it is (if at all) compared to that version but still keep that in mind. Anyway, this game feels very much like diet Human Revolution; it's not as big, pretty, or challenging, but it still retains the spirit of that game in a compact package. The graphics are decent and capture the HR style well. There's quite a bit of dialogue, a good number of augmentations, and the controls for a 360 controller are well-done. (I haven't played with M+KB so I'm not sure how that is)My only real gripe with the game is that it's fairly short and feels like it ends somewhat abruptly. Again, since it's a mobile game, I'm not too surprised on the length, but the execution could've been better or more climactic. With all that said, I recommend this game for fans of the series who are looking for a fun spin-off title with a different protagonist. To everyone else, I would say play this after playing the other games so you can (hopefully) become a Deus Ex fan and look at this with a different viewpoint.			"

												Well, I wanterd to give it a positive review, I really did. But when you can't go through the game objectives in a logical manner what's the point? I can't go on missions, because I need more money. Then, I have to do pointless fetch quests to get money, such as shooting thru an army of mopbsters to rescue somebody. Of course, you have only a pistol and no ammo and if u get weapons they are taken away after the level. Refund time.			"

												I'm not going to pretend DX:TF is a great game. It has very cheap production values, at times cringeworthy voice acting that rivals the original Deus Ex and pretty bad models. But taken into consideration this is essentially a mobile game, it's actually pretty impressive.Gameplay-wise I would say it plays a lot like DXHR though you can access the weapon store anywhere which makes the gameplay a bit more interesting as you don't need to visit hubs to buy new weapons. There are also more variations available. There's still a ton of options available for each mission.Worst issue might be the controls, specifically the way the game emulates touchscreen control. You have to be very precise with your clicks for them to register, cause if you move your mouse even slightly while clicking it counts as if you swipe the screen. But once you get used to this, it's not that big of a deal.The main reason I recommend this game is the story and just the chance to play as a protagonist who isn't a superhuman man-machine, you're just a regular augmented soldier who still needs Neuropazyne for your augmentations and it adds a more relatable human aspect to him. I also love exploring the backstory behind the Tyrant group and some of the things leading up to Human Revolution.All in all, DX:TF is not by far the worst Deus Ex game and if you get used to the controls and lower your expectations a bit, I find it very enjoyable. Shame it seems they canned the sequels.STORY: 8/10Very well written and there's tons of stuff to read and explore for fans of the lore.GRAPHICS: 7/10For a mobile game very nice graphics, though some of the models are pretty cheap-looking.SOUND: 7/10No original music, and at times very cringe-worthy voice acting, but otherwise the sound works fine.GAMEPLAY: 8/10The typical Deus Ex style gameplay is here in spades. Whether you wanna go in guns blazing, sneak around and maybe not even kill anyone, or just hack everything, the game gives you tons of options.SCORE: 7/10			"

												I acutally really like this game! Its really good, but it does have some major problems!It is a mobile port, so the graphics aren't completely up to par, but its about gameplay, not graphics. (IMO)The gameplay is fun, I enjoyed it, but it does get a bit repetitive... usually you get a mission. Go to Point A kill some AI, come back to Point B. But, you may like that as I did. It has some VERY GOOD easter eggs for the hunters out there! I completed this game and was very satisfied that I got the original Deus Ex GOTY Edition as well! So, if you want to give the Deus Ex series a try, this is a great experience. This feels more like a DLC, rather then a game, but time to get to the glitches...GLITCHES: Sometimes my mouse would disappear, which made me reload saves MULTIPLE times, but it also is clearly made for touch control, sometimes it took like 5 clicks to respond to the on-screen menus.VERDICT: This is a very good, DLC-like demo for the people who want to give the series a try.

												I bought the game on pre-release and I didn't play it after several days from its release. I read some reviews before playing and I was expecting something horrible before even starting it, but actually I am enjoying it. It is a tablet port so don't expect too much about the action, but the history and the ambient are very good. In my opinion, for that amount of money is not that bad game.			"

												Wow. Lots of people hate this game. It is a very mediocre Deus Ex game. However, it is still a Deus Ex game. My biggest complaint about this - you can't aim down the sights of weapons, forcing you to rely strictly on the reticle. Could it be better? Sure. Will they release updates to improve the game based on feedback? Hopefully.Should you buy this? Depends on two things: how much you like Deus Ex, and, quite frankly, just how pissy are you? Personally for me this game is a worthy addition to the fiction, it just could be better executed. The problems with the game are not so great in my mind that they sour the legacy of one of the best series of games ever made.			"

												I'm going to be blunt.  This game was made to be a mobile game, unfortunately the mobile version sucked due to crashing all the time so the PC port is great.  The graphics aren't amazing, but they aren't awful by a longshot.  The best thing I can suggest is plug yourself a 360 controller, or PS3 as the case may be, in and play it like a console game.  With an actual controller it's a good game, the controls are simple due to it being a mobile game originally... but once you get used to it, it's a pretty decent addition to the Deus Ex franchise.

												To be (dis)continued...We are dealing with stripped-down and simplified Deus Ex experience, that was astonishing on mobile device and works out pretty decent on PC. If you're not expecting it to be a DE:HR DLC, just some Deus Ex gimmick that could satisfy your hunger for the universum if you've finished every other game in the series then go for it. But wait for a serious discount, this is a 1/6 of a game (1/2 of gameply value, 1/3 of story). There is sneaking, hacking, cloaking and takedowns, but maps are simplified, there is no jump option, objects cannot be moved around and bodies disappear several seconds after hitting the ground.... Ok, I can deal with that... One most prominent thing I cannot deal with is that the game ends just as the story starts to unravel. Continuation was in plans, but I suppose we'll never know how things went in Australia and New York...			"

												The game is actually pretty good once you get past some flaws and weird controls. I just played through all my Deus Ex games again except mankind divided. Tje game has plenty of memorable fire fights. Just get past the clunky controls. Get used to them and you will find yourself enjoying the game. No, you cannot really compare this title with the others. Deus Ex Invisible War was kind of similar. Great fun once you got used to those controls as well.			"

												Let me start with this. Ignore the majority of the unhelpful negative reviews!This game seems like it was an incredible game for Mobile, and it is still a good game on PC.The gameplay is so close to Deus Ex: Human Revolution that it felt like I was playing some kind of DLC or expansion to DX:HR(which is a good thing)! There was some changes to the gameplay, as you would expect as it was originally a mobile game, but overall the gameplay was entertaining. The most disappointing part, however, was the fact that bodies disappear, so you can not hide them to stop enemies finding them. Instead, guards have about 5 seconds to have a chance at noticing body and after that they are unable to.The story was quite interesting and entertaining. I am however disappointed in the game as it ends with a ""To be continued..."" and yet it seems the devs thought, ""Ah, you know what? Screw it!"". Perhaps the game didn't take off very well (the ridiculous amount of over the top criticizing reviews seem to back that up), or/and the devs just cancelled it. Or, maybe we are going to have to wait a ridiculous amount of years to continue it (which is very unlikely. It has most likely been cancelled, which is a shame as it was great fun while it lasted).The graphics are decent. If they were like this on mobile, then they did a fantastic job. The game seems to run incredibly well on high settings, so I thinks it safe to assume that most modern PC and perhaps even Laptops could run it (yet to try my old laptop yet, but I may).The sound and voice acting is fairly good. The sounds are mostly recycled from DX:HR, any new ones aren't fantastic. However, the voice acting on the other hand, is fairly good. The majority of named characters are voiced at a good standard, however the un-named character are mostly voiced poorly. Ben Saxons voice actor sounds quite bad at the very beggining, however, he soon sounds better.Oh, and there is only one save file... Yeah... Only one... That's pretty much the only negative thing I have to say about this though, and it's not that much of an issue.Overall, I give this a 7/10.Pros:Almost completely mirrors the gameplay of Human Revolution, and therefore feels like an expansion rather than a new game (which is a good thing!).Awesome main character (like every other Deus Ex game).Interesting story.Decent Graphics.Mostly, good quality voice acting.Stays true to the Deus Ex franchise.Cons:Not much new. Now I know it was a mobile game, but they could have got some slightly new stuff.New sounds are quite naff.Unfinished story/disappointing cliff hanger. And it doesn't look like it's going to continue anytime soon.One save file. Now that is just annoying!!! D:< xDAnyway, like me, you should ignore all the bad reviews and give it a shot yourself! I bought the entire Deus Ex collection and this was the first one I played (I have of course played some of the other Deus Ex games in the past (DX1 and DX:HR)), because I wanted to try it for myself. Give it a shot! You, hopefully, won't regret it. (Although, I'd get it on sale if I were you, it's definitely not worth £8.00. Mainly because the story is unfinished.)			"

												What a piece of crap.    They took Deus Ex: HR, made the inventory and augment interface clunkier, made the controls less responsive, removed the ability to jump, and made the game about as linear as you can get (while telling you that it's not).   The voice acting even sucks.   Not worthy of the Deus Ex name -- heck it's not even worth the $10 price.On top of all that?   It ends as a ""to be continued"" with no plans to actually do it.    Would have been nice if they'd mentioned that you were buying an incomplete game in the description.			"

												I'd seen a lot of posts saying it's the worst game in exisistance, but I figured, 'haters gonna hate.' I was right. It's not terrible, but it's not great either. If you're a fan of the franchise and you like the world they've created, get it cheap. Just keep in mind it's not Human Revolution. I actually enjoyed it for what it was and my only issue is that it's ""to be continued..."" 2 years ago. I doubt they'll finish it as it's received nothing but hate, but if it's on sale it's a nice little way to tide you over until you get Mankind Divided. It's graphically underwhelming and the story starts weak in my opinion, but it caught my interest and I actually enjoyed playing the game.			"

												You might notice all the people giving this game a thumbs down also haven't played the game for more than 20-30 minutes. Give this game a chance and you'll find it to be a watered down version of Human Revolution and aside from a few control problems it's not a bad game and great value for the price.Full video review:

												I feel like this game would be awesome if I were playing it on a phone or tablet, but it doesn't hold up as well on a PC. It captures a lot of the experience of Human Revolution, but what would be entirely justified and minor compromises on mobile become glaring flaws on PC. It's playable, the story is solid, and I haven't encountered any of the game-breaking bugs described by other reviews, but when compared to the last entry it just feels watered down. It's deffinitely worth playing if you get it as part of a package, especially if you enjoy the storytelling of it's predecessors or have a lower-end computer you play some steam games on, but I wouldn't buy it on it's own, at least not on this platform.

												I'm in the extreme minority here, but I actually enjoyed this game for what it is.  I find playing with a touch screen unbearable so I was happy to see this show up on Steam.  It's basically a stripped down HR originally made for portable devices and as such has some notable sacrifices compared to HR.  The AI is bad, the controls can be clunky and the visuals are below average.  That said, the visuals are very similar in art style to HR and IMO get the job done just fine.  The game includes a single hub roughly the size of one from HR.  If you enjoyed the hacking, stealth and story telling from HR then you may very well enjoy this too.  The combat is mediocre at best but I found the story surprisingly good.  The voice acting is adequate although not top tier by any stretch.  The game took me approximately 4.5 hours to play through which includes some but not all side quests.  My biggest complaints don't really have to deal with the core game itself and more its port to PC.  There's really no excuse for no key rebinding, regardless of being a mobile port.  The most annoying thing is the how unresponsive mouse clicks can be for the UI.  I'd be nice if you could adjust the FOV, but the default is resonable in 16:9.  Since I never played the mobile release I was happy just to see it available on PC.  Considering its origins, I think it's pretty decent.  I don't know what some people expected out of a $10 mobile port (that comes with a free $7 game).  If you're a DX fan and don't have ridiculous expectations you might have some fun with this.  For $10 I think it was easily worth it for 5 or so hours of game time.  I'd give it a 6/10 as a DX fan.			"

Not 10 out of 10 for todays standards of games but it is about a 7. It has room for improvement. I want to see this story continued. I certainly enjoyed it even with its flaws.			"

												If you are a true Deus Ex fan you should play this game. It has its faults certainly and I shall get the negative parts out of the way first before stating why I believe this game should be played. For starters it is clearly a port from a phone. The controls feel a bit off and it doesn't look any where near as good as a game relelased on PC in 2014 should look. There are jarring glitches such as when you do a melee takedown on someone whilst you are in cover and suddenly you are two metres from the corner to perform the cinematic takedown. The uncertainity of whether the AI will spot you, sometines you walk right in front without them noticing yet other times you are across the room with them facing in the other direction and they swing around shooting at you. There are optional micro transactions but they are certainly not required to play at all (I built my character exactly as I wanted to no problem) so I don't see them as an issue.Now to list the redeeming qualities: it feels like a Deus Ex game. What I mean is the story, setting and protaganist all certainly feel like they are part of that universe. It's dialogue and the story itself are well written, the characters are engaging. *Slight spoiler alert* I wanted to know what happens next when the game finished to see where the story went next as well as as the next location was being heavily hinted at being Australia, a place I haven't explored in video game form (even though it would be a futuristic one of course).All in all I believe you should play this game if you enjoy the world of Deus Ex and want to explore another part of it. Just make sure you get it when it's on sale.			"

												I've played through Deus Ex: Human Revolution when it came out. I enjoyed that game. Going through this game. It felt very much the same. It has the same feel and the amount of places you can go and the stuff you can do. I really enjoyed the amount of work put into this. I highly recommend it if you enjoyed the Deus Ex series. It felt like a homage to the older games. It's a bit short but its one of the few games I really liked playing through. It was quite fun. There is definitely a lot of story in it as well. I'd buy more if they came out with the DLC to extend the story a bit. If they could make the game as long as the first portion of it is. I'd be very much happy. Anywho, that's all I can say. The controls take time getting used to but they don't really hinder the game that much. So all those reviews are from hardcore gamers who complain about all those really small things. I noticed some bugs but before you stop playing. Just wait and fiddle around with the controls and you'll eventually unstuck. That only happened to me during the prologue right before the laser beam thing that you gotta walk through. You have to set your ability to the quickslot via holding Right Bumper and setting it and then using it. (It took me time since it doesnt' mention how to slot it in quickslot). Great game, It was worth my money. Oh, the game overall took me roughly 8 hours (just by walking around and exploring amongst doing the missions and side quests). I might also add, only do one side quest at a time. I'm honestly certain if you take on a new mission. It cancels out the first side quest you've started.			"

												Be warned, incomplete story line of the game.  It was intended to be a longer run, but it seems they never bothered to add more content.  So the game leaves you hanging only part way through your ""life quest"".Graphics are sub-par.  Half the voices if not more are computer generated and sound it ""badly"".If you can get past that and the poor shooting desing (no ability to actually raise your xross hairs always just a point a shoot).Maybe play it if it's free and your are bored.

I just want to know what Eidos bigwig was like: ""Hm, how could we the Deus Ex license justice? You know, that game that defines the FPS/stealth genera? I know! That would be GREAT for iOS!

												This game is absolutely awful. Ok, allow me to elaborate. It is awful IN COMPARISON TO WHAT A DEUS EX GAME SHOULD BE. I played Deus Ex: Human Revolution for the Xbox 360 quite a while ago, and so I have returned to the Deus Ex franchise now on PC, and wanted to play this game (and likely Human Revolution right after) before the release of the new game. It was going fairly well...the plot isn't half bad, I was somewhat engrossed in what was going on...then you get to a transition and...BAM!The game ends. That's it. It's over. Honestly, I've never been so disappointed in a game's ending. It's the laziest game I've ever played, I can't believed I paid even a cent for a game that was not finished. And, as far as I can tell, there was never any DLC released to complete Ben Saxon's tale. I would not recommend this to anyone under any circumstance. Just skip it and play Human Revolution, which is a great game.			"

												Positives first.The game is very familiar with DX:HR which means if you like that game you'll like the playstyle in this one too, I love when subs are turned on by default like here and the music is again top notch. Spotted only three really not important bugs two mobs disappeared on reload, sometimes you can't loot a hostile after takedown when he is dropped inside a wall or whatnot, you won't get an questing achievement if you warn Alvarez since it counts as quest failed while it shouldn't since after you get a reward from him you can still grab his datapad.And that's… It.Negatives?1. Bloody Facebook integration. If I wanted to play Candy Crush on Facebook, I'd play Candy Crush on Facebook. Or Pet Society. Do you hear Square Enix? If you want to sell Facebook games, sell them on Facebook, not on Steam!2. Main menu option of More content. Hello SquareE, I'm not buying DLC! Sell it to your mother. Besides I got almost every skill unlocked, what could I possibly do in DLC?3. While I'm not graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, Icarus animation is a dissapointment and since you can't climblike in DX:HR, that skill is practically useless and you see it only in two cutscenes. Lame! Yes, this means level design also got hurt and is not nearly as good as in DX:HR.4. The game on me was 9 hours long - explored everything, killed nothing and left no stone unturned. No, it's not I'm complaining on the total playtime, for only 10€ it's okay. However, once you finish it, instead of THE END, it says: TO BE CONTINUED. And not a single thing open in the story got resolved. Did I mention I'm not buying DLC?Can't put 1 because it's polished and there is some fun to have with here, but can't be generous either:2/10ME3 perhaps didn't have a ""satisfying"" ending but at least it had one. This game doesn't have anything even close to an ending but is an intro to another milking DLC:The Game and as such is a scam.Guys, don't buy this even on sale.			"

												--------------------ADDENDUM-----------------I have since amended the rating and I do *not* recommend purchasing it. When I wrote this I wholeheartedly meant every word, but the sad truth is.. I also hoped the developers wouldn't abandon it, but they did, and worse than just abandoning is the fact that they've categorically made a point of ignoring and avoiding any questions relating to Episode 2.I don't care who is to blame, the end result is; do not purchase this game. Do not. Neither the developers nor the publishers deserve a penny from this and I sure as hell won't trust them again in the future either.--------------------ADDENDUM-----------------People complaining that it ""didn't perform well""; utter nonsense. It ran a flawless 60 with max AA on my 570 SLi and it only used ONE of them, never going over 60% usage -- if you want to see a terrible Unity game, go play Might & Magic X. The Fall was far from great, but for a Unity engine Android/iOS port? I've seen and played worse. The failings of this game were mostly engine and platform based, it came from mobile devices which are famous for having less complex and involved games *for the most part* (there are exceptions, to be sure) as well as being hamstrung by low specification hardware. Performance was perfect, as is to be expected, and the controls were absolutely fine with the exception of the missing jump command (really devs?) Vanishing bodies can easily be blamed on the low memory of mobile devices, so perhaps that should have been tweaked for the desktop version to keep bodies around.The models were low quality, the animations were low quality and the overall feel of the game felt like it was low budget .. but they still managed to nail the DXHR atmosphere and the visuals, models/animations notwithstanding, were very impressive considering it's a mobile game. Plot was engaging and the game still managed to pack in all the DXHR standard gameplay elements. It was just too short and didn't offer any challenge whatsoever, being incredibly easy and forcing all the ""aids"" to be permanently enabled, the removal of the inventory and addition of a cash-shop (albeit using ingame credits and not foisting a real money cash shop as they do on the mobile game) does it no favours either. All in all, I'd say TB's video (and a lot of public opinion) has been overly critical and slightly unfair, but I do understand that this had a high pedigree to live up to and simply failed to do so. I really do hope the developers don't decide to give up on the game as I'm certainly wanting to finish the story with the follow up parts.Do I recommend this game? Yes, actually, though keep in mind that it's a hollow and substantial step down from the ""big boy"" original, so adjust your expectations accordingly. Good story, great atmosphere, just too easy and far too short - seeing as how it's episodic. Let's just hope the developers don't abandon the game.			"

Sure it was a port from a mobile, but i didnt have any chance till steams release to experience it. It feels like a deus ex, with the city hubs, the side questing and leveling. Even for having a short run time and having some clipping errors, it is what it is. And i could see past the little things to still feel immersed in this world. Continuing to ask more questions, this stand-alone deserves a look if you, like myself, is deep into the deus ex series. Quite cheap at the time i got it. Would go another round.

												I just finished the game (first chapter) and on the second playthrough, I enjoyed it with the content I got from just a moblie port and was also happy that I got Deus Ex GOTY for free.I've seen the harsh reveiws this has been getting with people being disappointed of what the game looks like, its story and gameplay, yet these people do not know that it was for moblies (I'm surprised that all that content can be in a device like that)I also am enjoying the story so far and can't wait for it to expand into Australia in Canberra uncovering more of Ben's past.Another addition I've also enjoyed is the weapon skins you can buy, a spetnaz rilfe from the Deus Ex HR gives it uniqe variety along with the other attachments and features.The maps were not disappointing for me, I enjoyed looking around finding hidden areas and secrets, hacking safes and rooms to loot, making your own choice with what you say to others.Again, it's just a port from a moblie but is pretty detailed for what it is, if you're a Deus Ex fan then by all means; get this game and by also where it all started by getting Deus Ex 1 game of the year.

												I think Deus Ex: The Fall is one of those cases when some people were expecting way too much of the game, almost like the next big thing,  than it was realistically makable, especially from an android/IOS game. Now obviously it could hardly be taken on the same page with the first Deus Ex and Deus Ex: Human Revolution but for what it is, its relatively stable. The recoil seem to be have fixed since then, graphics are tolerable (and lets not get into some ""Oh, but its possible to make even better, even on Unity .."" kind of arguments), and the story is correct on its own right. Its short, thats true, it may take you about 5-6 hours to beat the game, probably even less if you are not a huge fan of exploration. Only thing that im really missing and is a painful downside for me: the game is awfully linear, it really feels like you are forced to go at one fixed way.Now would I recommend it at full price? probably not, the price can hardly be justified for the content it offers. However if you are curious about the game and you are willing to look past the mobile port defaults, you are very likely to have some hours of fun with this .			"

												Originally designed for tablets, the transistion to PC is reletively seamless. the first mission is a little dry, but after the training mission it plays similar to Deus Ex: Human Revolution. One partial to the story line, it is still fun and exciting, and in my opinion offered me everything I loved about DXHR. One of my favorite things about this series is the emersion, which this game offers, just not nearly as in depth as DXHR. I love the cities, building, and the interior designs of the rooms you are in. The character clothing is amazing too.Ment to follow the graphic novel of DX, A quick playthrough of the game can be done ina bout 4-6 hours, witht he promise of a continuation. I enjoyed it very much, as a huge loyal fan of the DX series. You probally get the best experience of the game on a tablet, but your not losing much via PC.			"

												Firstly, before you buy this game , be aware that it is a port from a mobile device , so do not expect the graphics, models and animations at Deus Ex: Human Revolution . If you come a little bit of distance to this product, you should not be disappointed . Beginning of the game along with the tutorial , does not encourage , but then in Panama is just better .The game features gameplay mechanics almost identical to its older brother , or sneaking with guards , system hacking , punching through walls , etc. Levels can go just like the original in many ways including the fact that the entire game can be completed without killing even one person . The biggest differences in the game , it is primarily a mobile shop available everywhere and at any time , making it easier gameplay too much for my taste . General simplification.Graphics although poorer compared to his older brother is pleasing to the eye and keeps the climate. Overall I would recommend , especially to fans of the universe , provided that it will approach the game from a distance .The price is to high for one episode, buy only on sales.Known issues that occur with me :- Sometimes the screen does not display hacking the whole map and you have to toil hard to move the screen so that we can make a successful hack .- Problems with the mouse sensitivity- The game despite the fact that theoretically supports standard Xbox controllers , you can see on my computer did an exception and the controller does not work.- Only one episode , I feel unsatisfied .Rating 6/10In Polish:Po pierwsze zanim zakupisz tą grę, bądź świadom, że jest to port z urządzeń mobilnych, nie oczekuj więc  grafiki, modeli i animacji na poziomie Deus Ex: Bunt Ludzkości. Jak już to przetrawisz i podejdziesz trochę z dystansem do tego produktu, to nie powinieneś się zawieść. Początek gry wraz z samouczkiem, nie zachęca, ale potem w Panamie jest już tylko lepiej.Gra posiada mechanikę rozgrywki niemal identyczną jak jej starszy brat, czyli skradanie z użyciem osłon,  system hackingu, przebijanie przez ściany itd. Poziomy można przejść podobnie jak w oryginale na wiele sposobów łącznie z tym, że całą grę da się ukończyć bez zabijania nawet jednej osoby. Największe różnice w rozgrywce, to przede wszystkim mobilny sklep dostępny wszędzie i w każdej chwili, co ułatwia rozgrywkę zbyt mocno jak na mój gust. Ogólne uproszczenia.Grafika pomimo, że uboższa w stosunku do swojego starszego brata jest przyjemna dla oka i trzyma klimat. Ogólnie polecam, zwłaszcza fanom tego uniwersum, pod warunkiem, że podejdą do gry z dystansem.Znane problemy które wystąpiły u mnie:- Czasami ekran hakowania nie wyświetla całej mapy i trzeba się mocno namęczyć, aby przesunąć ekran tak abyśmy mogli dokonać skutecznego hakowania.- Problemy z czułością myszy- Gra pomimo tego, że teoretycznie obsługuje kontrolery w standardzie Xbox, na moim komputerze widać zrobiła wyjątek i kontroler nie działa.- Tylko jeden epizod, czuję niedosyt.Ocena 6/10			"

												Let me be frank. This is not a PC game, this is a port of a mobile game to the desktop, a fact that is very easy to miss.Do not expect much. It's good for a mobile game, but for a desktop one... let's just say it passes the time. It has a story, which is an achievement in itself, mobile games being what they are. This story is actually worth some mention, as it goes in parallel to the main DEHR plot and is pretty interesting< covering topics missing from the original game.But it is UNFINISHED. What you get is actually episode 1. And I don't suppose we'll be getting the whole story anytime soon, if at all. Still, the graphics are OK if you are not picky (I discovered that I am not), the combat system is OK if somewhat unbalanced (top-tier weapons do not pack enough punch), and it can give you some OK hours of gameplay (around 8 if you are thorough).Bottom line? If you played DEHR and liked its storyline - wait for a sale and buy The Fall. You'll like it.			"

												I bought this game knowing what it is: a port from tablets. Graphics and animation are not on par with modern PC games, but they are acceptable. Controls are clumsy in the fight, but since I play stealth, it does not matter. Quests and storyline are engaging, slowly revealing conspiracy around the new drug. Panama city serves as a hub with optional sidequests and some room for exploration. Unfortunately this is only the first act of the story and therefore it ends with ""To be continued..."".All in all I enjoyed the game and I hope the second part will be published in the future. Recommended only for die-hard fans who want to delve deeper into DE:HR world.			"

												This game seems to be getting a lot of flak, mostly because I think people have lost focus on what it’s supposed to be. It’s a port of a mobile game that continues the story from the Deus Ex novel, Icarus Effect. I don’t say all that as an excuse for it’s flaws, merely as a reference point.The question I really want to pose to everyone is this, what made Deus Ex great? Was it the top-of-the-line Graphics?  The innovative control scheme? The Stellar Voice-acting? No, One need only play the original again to conclude that none of that is the case. Then what was it?In my humble opinion, it is the uniqueness of the well-built world and story, coupled with the brilliant level design that are at the core of what make Deus Ex legendary, and those principles are what this game delivers on, albeit in a shorter and abruptly (though not unfitting) ending chunk.Bugs and glitches are an different matter and I’ll cede that point, though I never really had any problems on either of my play-throughs.Also, keep in mind that they could have just forgotten about us PC gamers, they didn’t have to port this game (Which, sadly enough, I have heard people in the PC world advocating for). But they did, and I for one relished the opportunity for another foray into a grim and dark world that I just can’t seem to get enough of.			"

												""Not quite Deus Ex: The Fail, but still leaves a lot to be desired""This game has received a lot of hate from fans of the Deus Ex series, as it was originally a game made only for mobile devices, and when it did finally get a PC port from the developers, it has not gotten much praise from the fans, for both the quality of the port and the core game. While I don't hate it, it still has a number of problems that make it the worst in the series.StoryAs a follow up to the book, this could already lead to some confusion for players, but it can be played without reading that first. The game starts off with you on a mission as part of a Black Ops team sent to assassinate one of the people responsible for the deaths of your previous squad mates. Not long after though, you find the circumstances resulting in their deaths were not what you have been told, and result in you going into hiding. The rest of the game has you doing various missions in order to get medication to help deal with your augmentations. The story itself doesn't really hook the player unfortunately, and has little of interest other than showing characters you might recognize from previous games. PresentationGraphics could be better. While not awful, and almost certainly better than what would have been used for the smaller mobile device screens, textures still aren't great, and even the fact that it was a port isn't an excuse, after seeing how nice some of the HD ports for 3DS and Vita games can look. Going in to the characters themselves, while they don't look great, most are at least okay. But then you have a few which I'll call goblins with their poorly constructed bodies and hideous faces. It was quite surprising considering the rest were at least decent. Audio is alright. All of the music and sound effects seem to have been taken Human Revolution, so chances are you will notice familiar tunes. Voice acting is also of decent quality. Your ears won't be bleeding while you play through this game at least. ControlsThese have been considered a major flaw of the game. While the gamepad mapping is fine, anyone who has a problem with the default keyboard and mouse layout is out of luck, as there is no options for changing how it is set up. So if you are the kind of player who likes to set up custom layouts for your fancy keyboards, feel free to avoid this game. I played through the game on a gamepad, which uses an almost identical layout as the previous game, with only a couple of changes. However, even with a gamepad, things were not all perfect, as controls during the hacking minigame are fiddly, resulting in me moving to my mouse during those parts. GameplayNow onto the meat of the review, and where more of the flaws shall be revealed. At heart, this plays very much like Human Revolution. You can talk, sneak, shoot and hack just like you did while playing as Adam Jensen, but now that you are Ben Saxon, a few things had to change, some of them minor while others are major changes to how the game works. For one, Ben can't jump at all. This limits some of your options, and levels reflect this lack. You won't ever see a hard to reach vent that might just need a few stacked boxes, not in this game. Not that you have the option to stack boxes at all. Yeah, you have very few chances to manipulate the locations in this game. You can break down a few walls and move a few heavy crates out of the way but little else. No more being really inventive in your choices as a sneaky character. Not that it matters much. The locations are small in scope anyway, most of the game consisting of a single hub of maps. You can do a bit of exploration, but there just isn't that much do look around. Just a few vents to sneak through, a few locks to hack open and a few crates and walls standing in the way. The next change is a big one, this being the inventory. In The Fall, there is no limit what so ever to what you can carry. You can carry more weapons than there are enemies in the area. No more having to make a hard choice about which weapon to take with you, just bring them all. Your inventory in this game also acts as an in game shop, allowing you to purchase whatever item you might need as long as you have the credits. While I get annoyed at being forced to leave behind loot in the older games, this ruins any need for planning out your gear to maximize your chances or ensure you can carry the best selling items out of a level. Anything you need is yours with the push of a button and is sitting in your pouch of holding when you need it. On the bright side, at least the PC port doesn't include the option to pay for in game currency to make this even easier. We really don't need micro transactions here. Now onto the AI and interaction with them. Yes, I have bad news here as well. Most NPCs are brain dead idiots who will mostly ignore you. Unless an NPC is marked as an enemy on your map, they will did very little other than panic if a fight happens near by, only to forget it seconds later. After how great the previous games were with their AI from friendly and neutral NPCs, this is what I'd consider the biggest failing of this game. It used to be that walking into the women's toilets would get them to yell for security. Here, they will calmly talk to you. Hostile AI will still react to you in a matter of ways, depending on your current actions and location, but this will never be the match of any other game in the series. Even the hostile AI are easy to deal with, and the fact that non combatants won't even warn them really tones down the difficulty. LifespanAfter all of the problems I dropped on you during the previous section of my review, I have one more to mention. This game is short as it is currently incomplete. It seems the mobile game was designed to have episodic content, and nothing beyond the opening mission and first city at this time. You will beat it in a matter of hours, and unless you want to do New Game Plus to further power up your character and earn any missing achievements. Not really much incentive to play a second time unfortunately. ClosingSo there you have it. While it is most certainly a Deus Ex game, much of what made the series great just didn't make it to the game, resulting in a title with little challenge and little reward, though still playable in the end. My recommendation is to wait for a heavy discount, and perhaps some news on an (unlikely to happen) update to the campaign. It certainly doesn't offer enough to be worth your money at this point. I paid $3 and still feel it could have been better for what I've spent, given that Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut can be had on Steam for as low as $5 itself. 6 / 10			"

												Deus EX the fall was originally designed for a touch-screen device, and in order to make a game of this style work for such a platform, it had to be dumbed down. Last time a Deus-Ex game got dumbed down (e.g. Invisible War) people complained... and that's even if the story was half passable and had some memorable scenes. No really, fans of Deus Ex don't like the game to be dumbed down an inch. We liked Deus-Ex for it's complexity.The problem is that The Fall goes one step further in the dumbing down department, and aside from making the controls all but unplayable for the mouse and keyboard PC players (thank you quick-and-dirty porting department), there are aspects of the gameplay that are no longer present. Bodies now disappear in a yellow triangular matrix (no need to hide them), and my character simply doesn't seem to be able to jump. Either that, or I haven't discovered how to jump yet (thanks to the aforementioned terrible controls). Also I can't seem to scroll the node map in the hacking subgame. Seriously... what the...?Really, it is that bad. If you liked Deus Ex Human Revolution, prepare to relearn how to play the game again. If you're a fan you'll get this anyway, but you'll feel that the game is second rate even if the story fixes some of the character development that Human Revolution skipped in it's storytelling. The game is passable only because they aren't charging much for it, and thank goodness for that. Despite it's flaws the game is passable, but only just.			"

												Wow, I really don't understand all the hate. Granted, yes, the graphics are subpar but it's only a port from a mobile game. Keeping that in mind, I feel like they put a lot of effort into it. The environments are awesomely designed, there's a lot of places to explore and ways to do it.  There are dozens of files and funny emails to read. McMann composed a couple of new, cool songs for it. At first, I thought it was an adaptation of the book Icarus Effect, but it actually continues the story and I found myself enjoying it a whole lot! I can only hope we'll get to play as Kelso in part 2. The only complaint I have is that the fact that bodies disappear make the game a little too easy (less ways to be discovered). All in all, I loved it.I too would've preferred a reworked version for PC, but for what it is (and the reasonable price), it's fantastic.			"

												Wow. I'm surprised by the negative reviews prevalent on the store page (as I write this). I am a long-time gamer who has played all of the Deus Ex games when they were originally released. I personally found this to be a very enjoyable game, although I always play very steathily. I am not sure how this game would hold up if you took a more aggressive approach.Stuff I liked - Great environments - Multiple pathways and solutions - No crashes, solid framerate - I actually enjoyed having the store present with you at all times. It kept you playing the fun parts of the game.Stuff that could have been better - Sticky buttons in the menu - The UI is a bit strange - Few animation frames for NPC'sWhen I am actually in the game playing, I am having a really good time. It definitely has the Deus Ex vibe, style, and gameplay from the HR version of the franchise.If you like stealth, go for it. I've found it to be a good purchase.			"

												Going by a purely gameplay point of view of the game the game is pretty good once you get past the tutorial levels where you have a lot more freedom. As for graphics I wasn't expecting a whole lot there, as this is a handheld port, and handheld devices don't have a whole lot of processing power compared to desktops. Most technical issues other than key binding can be worked around, eg, vsync for mouse sensitivity, and stereo sound for the sound bugs.As I value gameplay over graphics in games, and the technical issues weren't extreme for me, I'd recommend the game.

												A decent if not stellar mobile port, the controls are a bit laggy and the graphics are low res but the gameplay is good and felt like more Deus Ex HR to me. Returning to this world was nice and made me nostalgic for more of the full game, seeing skills like stealth takedowns and the stun gun brought it back to me and I found myself crouching in corners watching green triangles for the right moment to pop out again.It is a port though, so it is short and designed for touch screens not KB/mouse. Auto aim is in full effect, if you miss with this one you are not trying at all and the 'click to use, hold to change' on the keys often had me wasting resources. A new game plus mode afterwards makes achievement hunting easy as you can easily max out on the second run through and literaly walk in and do takedowns on whole rooms of enemies.Go in expecting a chance to play the mobile game and get a short burst of Deus Ex gaming in, and we can only hope the release on PC isn't the sign that the 'to be continued...' is now just another gaming lie.

												  Considering this is an App port they did a great job with it. Its not without its issues though. There is a sound glitch that was pervasive throughout. Sounds in dialogue, combat etc cut out every now and again so I did miss some plot (even with the subtitles on). Graphics glitches are rare but happen, worst being clipping through the world and dying while the map is floating above you. The keyboard controls are not configurable but the gamepad controls are solid.  Despite all that its a fun little diversion back into an awesome game world. Even though its a downgrade the graphics are good. The combat is ok and it stays true to the Deus Ex world overall. Though my recommendation would be to wait for a sale before buying it.			"

												I liked the game.I just played ""Deus Ex Human Revolution"" a second time and thougt it might be nice to play ""The Fall"" too before I start ""Mankind Divided"". And I did not regret it.It was much easier to play then HR: I did not have to worry where to put the bodies, they just vanished, and I never had to evalute what to take with me or not. After HR I did find that really liberating.The grafik is not as detailed as HR (because it was actually a mobil game, I think), and why I now can not jump remained a mystery to me, but so what, it was not needed. All in all it was a nice pastime. What really is a pity is that the game is relativly short - the story breaks and ist not continued so far. I find that is a shame. As far as I'm concerned I whould like to resume the game if there ever will be a continuation.Hopefully my English was not that bad. Whish you a nice day and a good hunt ;-)			"

												Despite the general consensus, I had a blast during my time in Deus Ex: The Fall, so much so that I 100% it.This is coming from a huge fan of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. When you take this game for what it is; a game originally made for mobile devices, later ported over to PC. That doesn't necessarily harm the end product.I see the game as an extension of the universe they created during Deus Ex: HR, if that's what you're wanting then go for it, just go in mutual. Low expectations = higher satisfactory rate.			"

												Actually really enjoyed this. Being a mobile port it's not as good as Human Revolution: It's reduced and simplified in a lot of areas. Inventory management is gone and replaced with a strange in-game shop-inventory hybrid and many gameplay mechanics have been altered to try and remove elements of physics from them: Dead bodies disappear instead of the player having to hide them; objects like crates can not be picked up, instead they slide out of the way when interacted with, behaving like doors (special doors that require the heavy lifting); jumping has been removed and replaced with a vaulting-over-cover-system (which in my experience was the most buggy feature of the game).The interface and controls bear the mark of the mobile platform in many places but it has largely been converted to work fluidly with a keyboard and mouse. The F1-F4 keys still activate augmentations, the number keys can still be assigned to hotkey inventory items (and augs as well actually), G still quickthrows grenades, etc. All that is obviously missing is (as said already) the jump button and the ability to aim down the sites (which makes the process of firing a scoped weapon a strange one and stands out as the one big issue of the controls for me). Menus are easily navigated with the mouse and all ""click and drag"" elements from the mobile UI are easily navigated with the mousewheel. Even things like the ability to use keypads with the numpad and backspace key are intact in this game. The controls are unfortunately not rebindable though, which is a shame, though I don't think I would have changed any of them if I had the option.Controls are not as fluid as Human Revolution though after half an hour I can safely say I stopped really noticing any initial clunkiness and found the game quite mechanically enjoyable. I played mostly stealth but the few firefights I engaged in were quite fun even if, again, a bit clumsier than Human Revolution in both player control and enemy AI.As for the story: It provides more conspiracies and betrayals as you would expect from a Deus Ex game. It's fairly typical of the series though with some rather over-exposition-y dialogue in many parts. This is also intended to be an episodic title and so this is only part of a storyline (a storyline that actually started in the Icarus Effect novel) so don't expect a conclusion here. Quite the opposite: it ends on a cliffhanger.In almost all instances this game is basically Human Revolution in miniature with reduced functionality. It's quite sort too: It basically has the content of one hub area from Human Revolution and a similar length. How long it takes you to get through it will depend hugely on your playstyle but if you go straight from objective to objective shooting your way through you could easily finish it in one sitting. It's intended to be an episode game so hopefully more levels will be forthcoming.			"

												I'd first off like to start by saying this game BARELY made it into my recommended side of things, but anyway onto the review.Deus Ex the Fall was a phone game that DX fans whined and clamored to be on PC, and Square Enix granted their wish. The Fall is very ambitious for a phone game, boasting voice acting, decently sized areas and ok graphics on a phone. When ported the graphics didn't get upgraded much at all but to me this is fine as I've never been one to be a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ and even consider most modern graphics more than we need these days in leu of putting the funding more towards gameplay and features. The area will of course feel small for a PC gamer but this reminds me a lot of Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker when it got ported from PSP to consoles, the areas are about equal in size. Voice acting at times gets very cheesy.As far as gameplay goes, its very solid Deus Ex HR gameplay which is a good 95% what saves this game. All Human Revolution features are there and it has a solid system that lets one play stealth or action. Hacking apparently got on some peoples nerves in HR because they added a new item called an auto hacker, also present in HR Director's Cut, this will automatically succeed on any hack you perform though you still need a high enough hack level to initiate the hack on any given terminal. While I didn't use them myself its nice to see more options for people who really didn't care hacking to still be allowed to have fun. Take downs still feel good in this game but now the bodies just disintegrate instead of being require to stash them, which for stealth fans like me is a little lame but not enough to really be up in arms about. Even in a tiny mobile title like this they attempted to have several nooks and crannies for one to explore giving that feeling of exploration that any DX game needs to be successful.Now onto some of the major problems which pretty much all come down to ""porting woes"". Many people have reported problems with the game most I have not personally experienced but I did run into one or two.  The Hacking UI scrolling and mouse sensitivity do not work unless one enables vsync, which for many doing so makes the game run very sluggish, I was one of the few that didn't have the entire game crap out on me doing this but even I noticed a performance hit once it was on and it would get worse over extended playing periods. I also had extended playing periods due to the fact I didn't want to have a currently existing save bug that occurs near the end of the game where it'll load you up into a non-interactible world every single time, and due to the game having a single save file (another flaw with the game) will force one to format and start the game over. My last complaint but one I should have foreseen was the fact the game ends on a ""To be continued"" making it episodic, I've always had things against episodic games, its splitting a game up needlessly in an attempt to make more money. Now The fall offers more gameplay at $9 than Missing Link did at its launch price of $15, most didn't get Missing until it went on sale, and that is exactly what I recommend with The Fall, its a fun game by all rights, but its problems do not warrant a full price purchase.

												While it has some audio desync issues, a few graphical glitches, and besides the fact that the game looks like Deus Ex: Human Revolution if you turned down the game to the lowest possible settings with a bucket of ugly thrown on top of that, Deus Ex: The Fall captures the feeling of the Deus Ex universe well. The story is intriuging and the soundtrack is amazing as usual.They still managed to capture the atmosphere well and if you can get past all the meddling issues with the game it is indeed enjoyable.The game levels are A LOT smaller, with lots of quick loading screens. The game is also a lot more linear. However there's still plenty of nook and crannies to explore and find tidbits of lore.			"

												Tablet port to PC. Don't expect more than that. Although the game may be simpler it does not look that bad. It is a Deus Ex world game so I am not sure what the complaints are about. It is something to nibble on until the next main game comes out. Plus, why would we complain about an episodic game if we want the next part to come out which may not now since there are so many negative reviews. That just seems idiotic to me. Let us encourage the continuance of the Deus Ex genre. I wish they would redo the original game in the new engine or a new engine. I would definately buy it. That was such a great game. So let us support this game series and with tact and friendliness submit our complaints in a professional manner so as not to discourage the company to spend money to make another. Remember this is about money not just us but we can influence them to keep going or not by how we react. Happy gaming.			"

												First up, don't be completely turned off by the negative reviews. Yes this is a port of a mobile game, so it's been stripped down a fair bit. Lower resolution textures, some awful character animations during conversations, simplified interface, etc. It does manage to stay true to the overall feel of the superb Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Every once in a while the artwork makes up for the lower resolutions though.  It's pretty short, again probably a concession to the fact that mobile devices have very limited system resources.  The levels are smaller and while every area has at least two routes through, it's not nearly the sandbox of the other game. If you've read the tie-in book, Deus Ex: Icarus Effect you'll recognize the main characters in this story. I recommend the book. Once you accept the technical limitations of a mobile port it's actually a decent continuation of the story that lets you explore the world of Deus Ex and all the conspiracies. Is it a great game? No. But it isn't nearly as bad as people are saying either. I would recommend waiting for the next price drop during a steam sale, just because the shortness doesn't really seem to justify spending a full $10 on it.			"

												This game should have a big label saying: ""PORT OF A MOBILE GAME""....with the $9.99 price tag I guess I should have expected it.Once the shock of that realisation is gone, it's a pretty good game. Close enough to the original experience albeit with lower quality graphics. The story, voice acting and feel of the game is on par with Human Revolution and Missing link.  Controls are....okay.However there is for now a big problem, this game is buggy as hell. Feels beta to me. Sudden changes of direction and audio clipping are common. The menus are annoying as well, it seems that the buttons are bigger then they actually should be, and the actual detection area never seem to be at the same spot on buttons. Some are easy to click some damn near impossible.TL;DR : Good game, dragged down by iPad graphics and a swirling inferno of bugs. If all the bugs were removed it would be a solid game even as a port from a mobile game.			"

												This is an HONEST, no nitpicking, everything covered review.  Graphics are what you would expect from a mobile phone app turned PC port. If you go into the game expecting mind-numbingly good graphics, you'll be disappointed within the first few minutes of gameplay.  Combat is fine using mouse and keyboard, I had no issues whatsoever, aside from the occasional headshot not taking out an enemy.  About the bugs people have been experiencing...I didn't encounter any at all, so I can't really comment on them, though I almost wonder how many of those people who claimed to have extraordinairily bad bugs actually bought the game, or bought the game but used a NO CD exe so they can play without Steam.  Legitimately playing the game on your chosen platform usually will make your game play like mine did.  Smoothly with no bugs to speak of.Music was fine for what it was, as well as the sound effects.  I rather thought that they re used some of the sound effects from DXHR, as I swear I could recognize a lot of the sounds from it.Comparing this to DXHR and basing your opinion solely on that is dishonest and in my opinion, just plain wrong.  It is clear from most of the reviews that I read, that 90% of the reviews, compare the game to it's predecessor, most of their complaints centered around the graphical content, which in my opinion as stated above, are nice for what they are, not the best but still fine.The ONLY gripe I had with the game as it is, was the fact that when in ""invisible"" mode, you could literally stand in front of an enemy and they would never know you were there.  Perhaps I am being a bit overexxagerated on this, but to be invisible and the enemy not hearing you breathing after running 50 yards in 3 seconds is just....meh.  Again, not really a complaint, I suppose it's by design that invisibility also masks your breathing *shrugs*Overall gameplay was decent, was rather surprised that the game is episodic based, and more episodes will be released in the future.  I personally thought that was a nice touch, as it keeps us wanting more and more, and wanting to know more about the characters themselves, what caused them to get in the situation they are in, etc.  I think more games should do this, release in episodes, with huge cliffhangers.  In my opinion that is where game designers can really flourish and make the story truly unique because you'll never know what happens next, until the next episode.  Also, the choices you make in game can affect end game scenarios as well.  All in all I say well done.  Looking forward to the next chapter!			"

												Having just finished the tutorial sections and story exposition parts of the first hour, I cannot speak for the whole game, but I felt it necessary to present my views after browsing the mostly negative Steam reviews on this game.Yes, Deus Ex: The Fall is a mobile port. As such, it suffers from simplified gameplay, controls and mechanics, as well as voice acting and animations that cannot live up to the standards of the high-budget release that Human Revolution was.However, it is definitely not as bad as people make it out to be. I can understand their disappointment, but this was never going to be a fully overhauled experience, but a port of the mobile version - and as such, it works.Firstly, the game runs smoothly, and while the graphics options are limited to resolution, fullscreen/windowed mode and various degrees of Anti-Aliasing, lacking a Field of View setting, it does not look awful. Yes, you will recognize it for being a port, but it looks well enough.What it struggles with are animations - especially during the many early cutscenes and dialogues. Characters look rather static, almost more so than in the original Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Gestures are rare, and overall the lack of life in the character models underlines the, in my opinion, biggest issue with the game: The mediocre voice acting.Deus Ex: HR, outside of the main cast, ranged from acceptable to poor voice acting, but in The Fall, even the main characters have taken an obvious hit. Their lines are often delivered mechanically, or overdone, and don't match up with poses or expressions. What might not seem like a big issue on a smaller mobile screen quickly becomes disappointing on the bigger PC monitor and a proper sound system.During the first few areas, you will find a bunch of audiologs, which are actually reasonably well done, however. This makes it especially odd that the story-dialogue between Ben Saxon, Jaron Namir, Anna Kelso and co feels flat.Most sound effects I came across are directly copied from Human Revolution, so they are of reasonable quality. I have read about certain issues with sound effects or voices cutting out for some users, but have not experienced anything of the sort on my machine so far.As for the music, I liked what I listened to up until now, with common themes from HR mixed with new tracks I might even prefer over the bigger title's soundtrack.Now for the Gameplay; It suffers from its touchscreen origins, and there is nothing to be said otherwise. There is no jumping in the game, only contextual vaulting. No merry hopping around in The Fall. However, you get used to it easily, and the rest of the mechanics are fairly similar, if not the same, as in Human Revolution. There have been a few changes to the interface, though, which may need some getting used to.The augmentations are pretty much the same as in the other game, as you might expect. I think Praxis Point requirements have been adjusted slightly, and the trees trimmed.The dialogue system is still in, including the analyzer-augment - which I didn't get to use just yet, since all conversations so far were linear. Again, this is about an hour in, past the prologue sections.The biggest change to the game would be the inventory / market. You can buy weapons, ammo, items, etc from wherever you are, provided you have the funds. This means you can stock up on cash, and then just pick and choose gear for the situation you are currently facing - got no EMP grenades to disable a robot? Spend 200 credits and you're ready to throw!Personally, I think the idea is alright, but I would have liked to see limits to this system, or at least have it be more expensive than merchants found in the game.For all its simplifications in the gameplay department, however, the world still feels like Deus Ex. The environment design seems quite alright, despite middle of the road textures for props. The atmosphere of HR is captured nicely, and ebooks, datalogs and emails are still all there, adding more lore to locations, characters and technology.The game does follow up on the Deus Ex: Icarus Effect novel, but does a good enough job introducing non-readers to the characters and their motivations - though for obvious reasons, reading the novel first is recommended.Please also be aware that The Fall was released as part one of the story, but so far, there hasn't been any word on a continuation. As far as I heard, the ending might disappoint due to a cliffhanger. Considering Square Enix/Eidos's plans for the franchise, though, this should get addressed fairly soon, with a new PC game in the works already, and James Swallow writing more stories based in the universe.It should also encourage that a screen accessible from the main menu also made it from Mobile to PC, proclaiming that a continuation is supposedly happening, and the Pacifist achievement refers to the game as ""Part 1"". I am hopeful for a continuation.Should you expect a big blockbuster like Human Revolution? No, not at all. This neither had the budget nor the time to become as impressive. For what it is, however, it is a fine Spin-off to the franchise, which fans should appreciate, once they lower their expectations and demands to a reasonable level, in accordance to the game's price and scope. It is a slice of Human Revolution, for a fifth of the launch price of said tripe A release. Considering that, I can't be too mad at the game.			"

												Recomendation: Yes, with reservations.First, this is NOT anything like the gameplay of DX:HR.  DO NOT get this game thinking that it will be anything like DX:HR.  Most of the negative reviews I have read for this seem to not be able to understand that this is a direct port from tablet to PC.Because this is a port, there are a few pieces that are missing that most PC gamers have gotten used to.  There is no manageable inventory.  Instead, you have a ""Store"" screen where you can purchase weapons, mods, ammo, and other items at any time.  Immersion breaking, yes, but it fits with the ""merc style"" storyline that the devs have gone with.  Having to find a ""dropspot"" for those items might have been more immersive, but would have upset some players who don't like ""micromanagement""...A few of the downfalls of The Fall:This is easily described as a ""Lite"" version of DX:HR.The controls are pre-determined and cannot be changed.There are some audio and graphical bugs. (My crosshair disappeared in a New Game+)The buttons are ""touchy"". (They work on the first click about 60% of the time)Conversation choices are ""double tap"". (Select first, then confirm.  Suffers from above)AI is predictable and almost oblivious.  (Some enemies seem to see you through cover, however.""Heavy"" NPCs don't drop heavy weapons (yet).Hacking is decent, but there is no feedback on detection chances.The Augmentations are much the same as HR, but the system is much less open.  It's mostly a simplified HR scheme, but there are some real differences, mostly in what augs you start out with.The inventory is EXTREMELY simplified.  You buy individual weapons (or find them in the world).  You then ""Equip"" them into quickslots, and you can use them in the world.  From what I've seen, this means that you are carrying the entire arsenal in your pocket at all times, as long as you have the weapon available (bought or found).  Bundles are decent, but not really worthwhile once you actually get the weapon in the pack.  Everything you buy is immediately available in game, so there is no ""shipping delay"".  Buy ammo as you need it, rather than stocking up.And now the highlights of The Fall:A ""Behind the Scenes"" glimpse of the mercs you fought in DX:HR. (Barret Achievement ;D)Nice foreshadowing of both DX:HR and DX from in game texts. (One Tyrant wants a Skul-gun)The UI and controls make using health and energy boosts much easier than in DX:HR, especially while in the middle of the action. (Try doing multiple takedowns while cloaked.)Enemies ""evaporate"", eliminating the need to hide evidence of your actions.There is an interesting ""Reset Story Progress"" feature.  It resets you to the beginning of the game, except you keep anything unlocked in the store (supposedly).  Does delete the savegame, so turntable is reset, possibly achievements as well.  Use if you want to start from ""Factory Zero"".There is a ""New Game+"" feature which unlocks at the end of the current content (Panama).  You keep all your Augs and Inventory, and the story starts over from the beginning.This is a nice ""easy access"" DX title, especially if you are a DX lore lover.  The title boasts ""The story will continue"", so this could be a very interesting story if the devs keep on it.  It'd be really funny if this game is directly connected to DX:HR through Quinn. (Missing Link)To summarize, buy this game if you are a DX fan and like the storylines.  The controls take a little getting used to, but overall it's a decent buy even at $10 USD.  A little polish by the dev team, as well as advancing the storyline, and this little gem will shine.			"

												Basically a mini-chunk of Deus Ex. If you love the series, and Human Revolution in particular, you will probably want to play it. It's amazing how much of a full Deus Ex experience it is despite being from a mobile platform originally. Town hub, sneaking and shooting, finding hidden items, upgrading your cybernetics, talking people into things, etc. It's all here.That said if you're not super into the series, or if you're very sensitive to ports, you might hate this. It's obviously a tablet game ported to PC, and it plays like it. Menus are weird, there are little cut corners here and there like no jumping and some missing powers, and the whole thing just feels like a reduced version of Human Revolution. It's probably on par with Invisible War in the size of levels, but shorter.How much you want this depends on how much you crave Deus Ex. It's not a full-fledged PC game, but it is close to a full-fledged Deus Game. Judge your time and dollars accordingly.			"

												I was expecting way more of this game than I'm ready to admit.I bought it because, hey, it's an DX game and it comes with Deus Ex GOTYE, but upon playing, everything felt really really compressed. I understand it comes from a mobile plaform, but there isn't quite the same punch walking through hubs as it had in both Deus Ex and Deus Ex: HR, the maps are too small and there are frequent load screens where there could be more seamless gameplay. The gameplay (as in, combat and sneaking) is buggy as hell too - I really miss the tension of having to hide an unconscious body before an incoming guard could spot it.However, the lore found in PDAs, emails, ebooks and TV reports is fantastic - There's even space for strong references to characters such as Gunther Hermann and Bob Page, as well small mentions about the Sarif Industries attack and other events. Being part of the tyrants (albeit for a small part of the game) also makes for an interesting experience, and Namir remains a huge♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in this game.Worth a shot if you're a Deus Ex fan. Skip it if you aren't familiarized with the series and buy Deus Ex: Human Revolution as an introduction.			"

												I only recommend this to the most lore die-hard of fans. Yes, it's a phone game and there are terrible textures and poor mechanics, but I felt a blinding nostalgia for the story and honestly had fun that also brought up a second wind to play the original. Is it worth ten dollars for a cliff hanger? Maybe, maybe not. But I've eaten terrible subway sandwiches that costed more, and those lasted less than my experience. I put in four hours and I really enjoyed the setting and characters, albeit everything was small. There are definitely going to be people who will boycott it, because it's not a sequel to Human Revolution or a perfect homage to the original, but considering how garbage Thief is, and the lack of cyberpunk games to look forward to, I'd say buy it on sale. Buy it on sale.edit: all of those buttblasted babies downvoting a review, lmao.			"

I recommend this game, bugs and all. (Which will be patched)			"

												Looking at the negative reviews I'm seeing from people about this port, I felt it was fair for me to provide my opinion of the game. It's a port, so the lack of graphic detail is understandable, I'm a console gamer, so graphics don't bother me at all. What most concerns me is the gameplay and if the story is great. As of right now, the story seems to be pretty good, and the gameplay could use some work, but it's far from terrible. What people seem to be doing is comparing Deus Ex: HR to this game, which I don't find quite fair considering that game was designed for mobile gaming. I enjoy Deus Ex series for it's story, and it hasn't failed me so far. I say give this game a shot if you're a fan of Deus Ex.			"

												This game is a difficult case, a mobile game ported to the PC. Actually everything that can have bugs they all have them in this game. Sometimes... actually many times the sounds are missing, sometimes when you are doing takedowns close to walls the texture are disappearing and the controls are sometimes frustrating. With a controller my biggest concerne is the hacking, I find it way too difficult to lock on the nodes, which is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥when you have to hurry. The mouse aiming sometimes forgets common sense and makes a whole circle or I don't even know what that actually was. As a mobile port the layout is ""interesting"" and they could have make it better.But the story is recommended for any Deus Ex fans. It's a nice touch to see the world from a different perspective, to see what happened while Adam Jensen was fighting his war. Sometimes the plot fails to have any strict logic - specially at the end - but it is an enjoyable expansion. If you handle this game with a healthy expectation it can be a nice detour from the main game, but if you want a flawless experience, then place look elsewhere.			"

												I haven't encountered any of the sound bugs yet other people are complaining about.  The graphics are at the top end of iPad ports, but that's nothing to write home about.  I play it @ 1440p, at that resolution it's not too bad on the eye.  Don't expect it to play exactly like Human Revolution, it is not the same engine, not even designed for a PC.  What it IS is a decent story told in the Deus Ex universe.  The combat is a little sluggish but forgivable going from touch controls to full mouse look and keyboard controlls.  Instead of single slicks you will need to double click on the majority of options in the interface.  Don't go in with high expectations - it is not DLC or a standalone mini of the Deus Ex PC game series.  It's a pretty good Ipad game ported fairly well to PC.  Only pick this up if you're a fan or the world and the lore, it is Deus Ex ""lite"" gameplay. Look at it this way - it's better than another painful playthrough of Deus Ex Invisible War, amirite?

												Ok here it goes.So this was a mobile game. A  MOBILE PHONE GAME. And now its here.Yes there are issues, yes there are bugs, but hey guys IT WAS A MOBILE PHONE GAME PORTED TO PC.At first I was like WHAT you CANT JUMP?~! But oh yeah it was a mobile game.I think that it is an impressive port. It has a great atmosphere about it that reminds me much of Deus Ex more so than HR.I look down and all I see are people whining about how its no HR or its buggy and laggy. Thats too be expected with any game; look at TW: ROME 2.The more I play this the more I like it. Tried break-necking it all the way through, but to no avail. But I am enjoying it thus far. Any more insight to the universe of Deus Ex is fine by me no matter how buggy, I just love this universe, plus did not ANYONE notice who's voice it is in the beginning....hmmm just like Deus Ex....*sigh of comfort* So yes I would recommend this game, but at the same time I would give a warning/forward at the beginning of my recommendation...oh wait should I have done that?AS FOLLOWS: This was a mobile game ported to PC, it has meh meh graphics, it can be buggy, it makes up for that with the story and dialogue/music. If you're a hardcore fan of the Deus Ex universe and not just HR please check this out. Let the developers see we're fiending for me GIVE US MOAR.7.5/10			"

												I'll go a bit against what most people said about this game... I actually enjoyed it. Sure, it looks and plays like a poorly made mobile port, the ingame store is just silly, the voice acting is probably one of the worse I've seen since the first unpatched version of Mars: War Logs, and there are quite a few bugs here and there as well, and so on and so forth...Still, for some awkward reason, I actually enjoyed my gaming experience besides all that... If I had to say something that really bothered me, I would complain about it been too short. Maybe I`m too big of a fan of the Deus Ex franchise, but I actually enjoyed the game and thought, for the price I actually paid for it, it was well worth it. Though, truth be told, I can completely understand why people are trashing this game so much.All in all, I actually enjoyed playing Deus Ex: The Fall			"

												I was quite fond of Human revolution and because of that I did get and play The fall before on iOS and quickly binned it because the controls were not for me.The controls on pc were, in my opinion, way better, and increased playability a lot, even though there are a few things that just felt a bit weird, especially if you're used to Human revolution and it's controls. It didn't make it unplayable, just a bit more getting used to, which brings me to the followingThe downside of the game was that it was quite short. I played about 4 hours and that was all there was. Granted, it's a mobile game, but... 4 hours? I was hardly on my way to settle in with the Deus ex universe again. I might go for new game+. That's a nice feature to put in there, even if it's just for collecting and achievement purposes.I did encounter a few weird glitches though they didn't bother me too much to distract from the fun I had playing it.10 euro felt a bit on the high side, in hindsight after finishing it, though since I got Deus ex GOTY with it I can't really complain that much. 10 for just The fall might be too much for some unless you want all of the Deus ex lore. If it's on sale for half price (or less) it's pretty fairly priced. "

												While it has its quirks it is still a good game in th series.  The complaints are mostly due to it being a mobile port and what people want would not be a port but a re-do of the game entirely.  Adding basic keyboard commands in simplistic forms was fine and I never once had a single issue with the layout provided by the game.  Sure some of the buttons were a little odd but nothing game breaking or prevents you from playing.  My only complaint in the whole game was the fact it is not mentioned on the store front page that this is in fact not a whole game but a series.  Whether additional parts will be DLC charged based or free is another matter altogether.			"

												The Fall is more Deus Ex.  It offers a few innovations, like freedom from the archaic old inventory system, but by and large all the other frustrations remain.  Controls are still a bit wonky: as an example, in some places you use the right stick to scroll text, in some places you use the left stick, and in some places you must use the d-pad.  And for some reason, it's not possible to jump at all in this game.   The modest asking price does however mostly succeed in excusing the game's flaws, especially since most of the problems existed in the last game.  I haven't played enough yet to speak on the length of the game, but it's pretty safe to say that anyone who enjoyed the old game will enjoy this standalone expansion.			"

												Mobile-to-PC port seem quite the trend, and it is a trend loaded with mild or deep failures. Do The Fall escapes this fate ?While I choosed the ""recommend"" option, my judgement is more mitigated than that.First, the game is not as instable as it is commonly said. Yes, they are some bugs- rarely the sound of a dialogue is skipped, sometimes doing a takedown can send an enemy through the environment, or (and there it's unnerving) the games seem to go forward or backward in space without any reason every now and then. It's far from being technically ideal, but it's not unplayable.That said, like everyone else, I would have appreciated the option of remapping the keys - when you do not have an american keyboard, it's really awkward, but I got over it.So yeah, even if with the graphics it's quite okay, there's ground for resentment against the game. But the most important is : you still get the Deus Ex vibe. The story is not anything as compelling as Human Revolution's one, Ben Saxon, the ex-Tyrant you play as, is far from being as charismatic as Jensen, but you can have the feeling of this dysfunctional world, and the conspiracy atmosphere. Of course, it wouldn't be enough without the gameplay, and The Fall manages to keep the core of it : lethal, non-lethal or a mix of both, the pleasure to grow in power with the praxis points, the multiple possibilites to get through an area, the dialog options, the sidequests with several possible outcomes, etc. Honestly, of all it is a bit watered down. Well, that's what you get when you can purchase weapons, items and ammo anytime you want, and the bodies all disappear even if you took them down without killing them. The alternative paths are easier to find than in Human Revolution, and well...It lacks challenge. Hacking still rules, and at one point I was sitting on 9 Praxis points ; even without buying you get too much ammo (I was hauling more than 70 shotgun cartridges), having no inventory limitation really ease up the whole thing. So why recommend it ? Part of it is because I'm quite fed up with the reviews displaying less than an hour played and just a handful of lines bashing the game. No, the Fall is far from being excellent. But considering it was on mobile platforms, it's doing an honest job and can deliver some fun. The port could be very, very worse, and the pricing is fair... Well, IF the continuation comes for free. The first part lasts roughly 4-5 hours and 10€ would be a tad bit excessive just for that.As silly as it sounds, in the end, I'd be more in favor of a 'neutral' review. See those facts for yourself, if like me you were looking forward to some more human revolution-like experience, you might appreciate The Fall, with an open mind. I reckon some tolerance is in order to savor it. If you have Android or Ios, there's not much point buying it- but the same can be said about Plague Inc. Evolved or many other ports.			"

The story is pretty compelling, and is at least as interesting as Human Revolution's.

												I'm only just recommending this game so far.The graphics are rather appauling for a Square Enix related title, and are no way near on par with Human Revolution. No longer are the old TAB and ESC menu's separate but now all under ESC and split into separate menu's, one of these includes an endless shop so as long as you have the money you can buy something anything anywhere. This for me takes away the thought of should I use my energy bar now or save for later. I had to toggle the cover system to get it to how i liked, and i find that it's hard to access your inventory items that are not quick key bound. The AI is so unlike HR and doesn't make me fear for my life like HR did it's so easy to kill them and take so little damage. I did once snipe a guard right in the path of another and he didn't even blink. Bodies also dissapear once killed or knocked uncouncious.The one thing at the moment that is going for it is the story which is currently split into parts. The game is a prequal to HR as it involves the main group (The Tyrants) led by Jaron Namir. You start off as part of his terrorist organisation and then go freelance. The world is running out of Neuropozyne and a replacement is needed for your character and his accomplace.I'd say only get this game if it's on the cheap and you're interested in the HR prequal.			"

												Being a mobile port, it does suffer from some lower resolution textures and graphics that seem limited compared to most PC releases, and the controls do seem janky when compared to its older brother, DH:HR. But at its core remains a DX game - the exploration, interaction and involving, twisting plotlines remain. The book this title stems from, ""Icarus Effect"", lent depth to some parts of DH:HR that went unexplored and unexplained. This title, and its subsequent episodes, will further explore these things. I'm looking forward to seeing how this series plays out, and I am willing to overlook its few technical flaws to enjoy going deeper into the world.			"

												Graphics and controls are iPhone quality, but the story is decent and the gameplay is definitely Deus Ex.  It's only about 5 hours long if you do everything though.  I highly recommend it for fans of DE:HR, but non-fans will want to pass.  Even fans will probably want to wait until it's on sale.Right now you get the original for free with this game, the original is worth the $10 in itself.			"

												While not perfect, this is still very much a solid Deus Ex experience.Yes, the keys are not rebindable, and that may be a problem for some people. I personally didn't have any issue adapting as it's largely WASD centric and the mouse implementation is good.The ""neverending help prompts"" that some reviewers mention only last through the pre-credits tutorial mission; that may tell you how long they played before forming an opinion. I have not encountered any since that point, and I'm over 5 hours in now. Remember, DXHR also has a lengthy pre-title linear tutorial.Actual gameplay is very similar to DXHR, and the game largely recaptures the atmosphere of its predecessor. There are some notable changes due to its mobile origin, namely the lack of a jump button and the fact that bodies disappear after a few moments. While obviously not ideal, I didn't find either of these significantly took away from the experience, at least so far. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for more Deus Ex.Update:I've now completed the game, and I stand by the review - it took about 7 hours to complete, and that was doing a pacifist run. I didn't experience any major technical glitches during that time, and again, the game really does feel like DXHR once it gets going. Sans the annoying boss fights, so...yeah.			"

												Clunky. Poorly layed out controls. No jumping. Meh-grade graphics. It is obvious to tell that this is ported from the mobile version to the PC. However, the story is interesting. Takes place before Deus Ex: Human Revolution and lets you get to learn some more about 'The Tyrants'. I can only hope they release an upgrade to optimise it for Deus Ex's true market though, since who the ♥♥♥♥ plays an FPS from the Deus Ex franchise on a ♥♥♥♥ing iPad? Seriously, who the ♥♥♥♥ does? Hipsters? ♥♥♥♥ them, they aren't real fans. Recommend it only if you like the series enough to bare through this♥♥♥♥♥♥ At least it is more functional than Invisible War.			"

												as the game stands now it is a buggy mess sound cutting out within random scenes and the music overiding voice and sound effects. although all of that i am excited once those bits get fixed to play it as the book that the charachter was taken from was really good. i am hoping that the story is as good as human revolution. i will wait to play more of it till some patches have been put up. what i played was good apart from the pad support doesn't really work either though playing on mouse and keyboard works.

												It's a horrible port from a great mobile game.  If you wanted to play that (or replay it) on your PC with gamepad support and no IAP's this time, then it's the way to go.  You'll constantly be aware it's a game made for mobile and not PC, but it's more Deus Ex at a budget price so, in my opinion, you can't complain that much.			"

I am not a die hard fan at all either, I just discovered Dues Ex this year. Happy gaming!			"

												I find myself very conflicted when reviewing this game. On the one hand the core design is pretty good, but there isn’t a single category in this review where I can not see lazy corner-cutting that just does not have to be… and most of that is BEFORE the game got ported! I don’t understand how the iPad version got the high reviews it did considering this, and as a result, I do not believe I can recommend this game for anyone but the hard core Deus Ex fans who is absolutely craving something from the franchise while they wait for the next entry. Everyone else should probably steer clear of this one.You can see the full review at http://redsectorshutdown.blogspot.com/2014/04/deus-ex-fall-pc-review.html "

												This game is not as horrible as people make it out to be yet it's origins as a tablet game are obvious. I was expecting this game to be as bad as Invisible Wars and it is not. However, it doesn't hold a candle to Human Revolution. Yes 98% of the NPCs, weapons, textures, objects, sound effects and items are ripped from Human Revolution. Unsurprisingly they are all lower quality and a lot less of them. This is due to the performance constraints of iPads and Android devices. This means the levels feel empty, underpopulated and lack that living world feel that made the original Deus Ex and Human Revolution so great. This becomes apparent in Panama which just feels dead and empty especially in the last mission. You are told to expect a massive fight yet are greeted by less then a half dozen guards and a single bot. In fact in no place are you ever confronted by more then six or eight NPCs at a time be they hostile or friendly. I guess the tablets couldn’t handle any more.Another thing that carried over from the tablets is the inventory system. There are no stores or NPCs selling non quest items like ammunition or energy bars. These items are also rare in game with guards only dropping a handful of bullets. This was done to force tablet players to spend money through micro-transactions. Fortunately in the PC version we only spend credits found in game on these items. I was doing a stealthy non lethal play though which meant I was going through energy cells and bars very quickly so I had to keep buying the bars. Expect to spend a lot of in game currency on these or ammo if you do a lethal play through. The AI is not as good as Human Revolution and is extremely scripted. Yet it's not as horrible as people make it seem. The AI is not horrible but not good either. Like Human Revolution they walk on fixed patrol routes. Yet they vanish instant you kill or knock them out. This removes a key part of the strategy of Human revolution which was not only planning how to knock out an enemy but how to hide their body. Now you just have to sneak up on them which given how few enemies make up the world isn't that hard. Should you get this game? I clicked yes but have one key caveat. I bought it for $2.99 USD on sale and after beating it in under 8 hours feel like I got my moneys worth. I don't believe that buying it for $9.99 USD I would have felt the same. I'd say wait until you can get it for around $2 to $4 USD. There is still a fair amount of that famous Deus Ex to be had story and some atmosphere too. I'd say that alone would make this game a good buy at a reduced price.			"

												Deus Ex: The Fall is a good follow up for Deus Ex fans considering it was originally released as a mobile game for tablets. It has been ported to PC to mixed reviews. I had a problem with mouse input but it was fixed within the settings. It faithfully gives you the Deus Ex experience and for fans of Icarus Effect will add more depths to the Saxon/Kelso story. While short for a PC game it is was again, originally released for mobile devices and wasn't priced as highly as many new releases are.3/5 Set back from the start being a mobile port, still plays well enough to earn a decent rating, the story tries to be interesting and the flow of the game never slows down. Don't expect a boss battle because there aren't any (Playing it safe?)			"

												 After playing every game on the series, I can honestly say, that this one let me down. Many gamers complaing about Deus Ex Invisible Wars, but that is nothing compare to The Fall. The game fails in what matters the most about Deux Ex, the story, is just not good. Gameplay wise,  you can tell right away that the controls were not created for a M/K configuration. However is not an excuse, but that is not what makes the game so bland. The stealth is there, the great soundtrack is there. Is the  lack of great dialogue, the need for more sidequest, what makes this game fell like a cheap dlc. If you want to play this game, do it on an iPad, for that kine of system, yeah it works. But if you want to try it on your pc, please do yourself a favor and save your money. Play any of the past games, yes, even Invisible Wars is more fun than this one.			"

												It's got frustratingly bad keyboard controls, and the quality of the game is so much lower than its parent game. It turns out that this was a mobile game that got ported back to PC, though. This goes a long way towards explaining the weaknesses of it. Consider it a weakened version of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and you've got a pretty good idea of what it is.It has two things that save it: first is that it is cheap! It's comfortably under the $10 mark. Secondly, it delves into more of the DE mythology -- especially that from the novel. I'm a sucker for a prequel, I guess.If it isn't cheap, and you didn't like the parent game, then you would probably be better staying away.			"

												 I played Human Revolution and I loved it. i beat that game 3 times in the pursuit of the pacifist achiement which never wanted to trigger (appently a crossbolt to the head was considered lethal :p) Okay lets talk Deus ex: Fall.  pro:  1.new aug that allows for two bars to be recharged that something the first lacked ( i have gotten the chanse to see directors cut difference either) 2. the quickslot tabs were really nice make swtiching for what i need so much easiernow I am going to start to nit pick some of these complains might not be to major but they are things that were revomed and I misscons: 1. Length 2.5 hours for $10? Yeah relly short for being the the first part I recommend wating till it goes on sale I still feel a little shortchanged paying $5 ther e is not much to do and belive you me I the kind of person who goes away from the objective to find the loot first. 2. odd take downs. Human Revolution had a great system when it comes to take downs in that where you took out your enemy made sense. In the fall I frecquntly find my self being launched 5 to 10 feet from where i initiated it and alerting other guards speaking of which.... 3. the AI and NPC: in human revolution mass panic took place the moment you took a guard in puplic in the fall these people Really could'nt give a ****. One NPC evwen said to me she was'nt paid enough for this crap. It really suspends the disbelief. 4. Disappering guards : I get this is supped to make thing easier guys but when I take a guard it seems really odd just having him vanish without a trace. In human reolution it make sense you had to hid ethe bodyies. ALso I had nurerous occurences of guards just going though walls  when I killed them. 5. Dialogue drops: at random points I have the voice acting just drop out, really odd but a simple bugs fix if they can find it. 6; infinite inventory and on hand store: i get these were mostly implemented to make things easier but I kinda of enjoyed managing my inventory in human revolution it felt real ansd seniblr that i couldnt cary 10 weapons at once. 7: minimizing of non leathals: I was saddened not to see the tranc rifle, gas crossbow ( the one they had was supernerfed), gas mines I loved those things. Also it semed that the stun gun range was nerfed by a about 5 ft as well for no good reason. 8: trckng aug removal: I loved that aug make stealing so much easier plus the ability to track invisble targets who would't miss it. 9: meh graphic. Now I may be crazy but I felt like the fall was a little less preety than human revolution. not enought to detract me but still it felt odd. Like I siad earlier this game is not worht the full price. If you were a fan of human revolutiion it a decent pickup, but wait for a sale. If you never played human revolution play that first then decide on this .			"

												I decided to recommend this game because there are already so many negative reviews out there, and I feel like the game is being underrated. But the fact is I wouldn't recommend this game to everyone, only if you fulfil the following criteria:1.	You liked Deus Ex: Human Revolution2.	The above made you go out and buy the book Deus Ex: Icarus effect3.	You liked the bookThe reason for this is that the game focuses on Benjamin Saxon, one of the main characters in the book, and it’s really cool to play him. The story takes place right after the end of the Icarus effect and it’s quite true to the events that take place there, there are even some recreations of the events in the book (I won’t get into details so there are no spoilers), and the dialogs are pretty much untouched from what you’ve read in the book. All of this makes for a good overall experience when playing the game, because you get to know what happens after the end of the book, and the story is very solid.The thing is that that’s pretty much it… The graphics are indeed horrible, the mouse look doesn’t work at 100% (the vertical axis his way less sensitive than the horizontal axis), you can’t change the controls (although for me that wasn’t really a problem). As for the audio issues, I didn’t come across anything. If you play the game with a headset, you should be fine.This being said, I’ll go on the L.I.M.B here and dare to say that gameplay wise, there are even some small improvements compared to HR. There are some cool new augs like the stealth dash and the body armor is no longer a passive aug. In HR this made the body armor a must get upgrade, because the result was that it made the game easier without any management. In The Fall, you have to manage when to activate it (which consumes energy) and when it activates it creates a glow around Saxon and you see a meter that tells you how much armor you have left and it drops when you take damage.There’s been some talk about the game ending in a cliff hanger but I don’t think that’s the case. The story isn’t finished, that’s obvious, but it wraps things up in that specific mission scenario. If part 2 ever comes out (which looks very unlikely, considering how things are going in Square Enix), I’ll want to play it, even if it’s flawed like the first one because for me the story is worth it and the flaws don’t make the game unplayable.

												I hate to have to say it, but I agree with most of the reviews and the meta score on this one. Being a huge fan of the Deus Ex game series, especially Human Revolution, I was underwhelmed when I started and completed this game. Upon purchase I saw that the game had terrible reviews and scores however since it was on sale, I decided to buy it and play it without prejudice. With that said I was extremely disappointed and I will explain why. At this stage of the game, patches have clearly fixed many of the problems that people have talked about. I had no issue with bugs in the short duration the game lasted. That if course is always a good thing.Obviously coming from playing Human Revolution, I had high expectations for this game on many levels. Upon entering the start up screen, I immediately went into check graphics settings and control settings. The options were poor to say the least. I was able to change anistrophic filtering and that was about it. There really was no other say when it came to the graphics of the game. On that note, the graphics were not that big of an issue for me. I was pleased with them. Although not as good as Human Revolution, it was perfectly fine for its purposes. Once starting the game I was interested by the story. I like were the story picked up from and how a good amount of the information could be found from in game play. Just like Human Revolution your Augs can greatly help you evaluate conversations. Unfortunately there were not many coversations to be had. Even for the short duration, there are only three or four side missions that you come across without trying extremely hard. The missions are easy and just simply involve a lot of travel between the few small levels of the small map. That is my next issue. Travel in this game is boring! There are only five or six trully distinct locations that you must travel to in order to complete the game. An hour into the game, I felt like I was just going back and forth constantly and I was already bored enough to put the game down. The duration of the game however is my ultimate issue. Not having read any of the comments for this game, i really was expecting another full on Deus Ex game. By the game description and the story that starts to unfold, you would expect so much more, rather than a To Be Continued. I love Deus Ex to the point where I search every single room, air duct and storage unit. Even thouroughly searching through the game, It only took me four hours to complete. i was just messing around looking around and only took that long! Overall the Deus Ex series is amazing but this game, at this point at least, is honestly not worth it. I was extremely disappointed that I bothered with it. The only real reason to have it is to say you at least own every game in the series. Thats all it's really good for. If you do choose to buy this game, do not get your hopes up and set any expectations you have extremely low. I really don't enjoy having to right a poor review for a game especially such as this series, but such a horrible game warrants such a review. Best of luck to anyone who does decide to play. At least you can play the game again with all your current augs and purchases but on an increased difficulty.			"

												Expanding the in game universe of Human Revolution, this had the potential to be a good game. However the controls can't be edited to your liking, which is a real nuisance if you had recently played HR as it is a port from a touch screen game, some of the controls don't match HR's controls. The game cuts off at a cliff hanger where there is no indication that more will be released, if they do hopefully it'll be free to people who have purchased the game instead of making you for each part of the story. People who are fans of the series might enjoy the game but I only purchased as it came with the original Deus Ex on pre-order and didn't have the game on steam.			"

												As a huge fan of Deus Ex I found this game to be an insult. Poor mobile graphics and horrible controls. At times you need to right click in menu's and other times nothing works till out alt-tab in and out of the game a few times. Sound bugs out all the time so all you hear is music. The animation at times to not run and a static model wil just move across the screen. This at best feels and plays like a low budget fan made game. I can honestly say i haven't ever hated a game this much before for being so bad.			"

												Small levels more reminicent of Deus Ex 2, a proliferation of ventilation ducts whenever they want to give you the option to avoid a fight (or simply a locked door) and somehow making the models and scenery seem lower resolution than HR to which it presumes to be a prequle. Sometimes it seems like just going from one room to another demands a loading screen additionally and the quest itself and side quests present litte variety.They have removed jumping or being able to toggle your aim and along with the previously mentioned complaints it gives the feeling of being dumbed down for console, though I have to ask, what console? I'd expect this level from later PS2 games and not current gen systems. Perhaps the only thing I liked, and perhaps thats just a matter of personal taste, is the change in the inventory system, even if being able to just 'buy' more ammo in the middle of a fight isn't at all necissary and breaks whatever suspension of disbelief one might of accumulated.Perhaps the most galling thing is it seems they have moved to a episodal format so I am looking forwards to another $15 'addon' in a few months time to let you actually finnish the campaign (or more likely just get to another cliffhanger)			"

												Deus Ex: The Fall scores 2 out of 10.Poor graphics, rambling dialogs, buggy controls, and horrible NPC skins ruin this game.I cant stress enough just how much the developers ruined this add on.It almost seems as though they have never actually played any version of Deus ex, System Shock, or Thief.If they had spent one tenth of the time on game play as they did on changing the original interface from Deus Ex HR, the game would have at least had a chance.But really, YOU CANT JUMP !!!????, what idiot removed the ability to jump ??Lets all just revert back to doom 1 type gameplay, its ohh so fun to come to a tiny obstical and have to run 200 feet to get around it.Also, the hud has been revamped for the worse, and apparently you now have a store jammed inside of yourself.Thats right , you can buy weapons/ammo from yourself, for yourself, really wierd...The quests are clunky , the gameplay is thin on fun, and the graphics look like DX8.The only good thing about this add on is that it came with the Original Deus EX GOY edition, so money wasnt completely wasted...I would NOT recommend this game to anyone, even if it was free !

Had issues using the gamepad on first load. Tuturial messages spoke of Keybord and Mouse Controls till I restarted the game then It worked giving the correct messagse for the Controller.

												I wont get into troubles, issues and bugs; yes, Deus Ex: The Fall has plenty of bugs and some annoying issues.... my personal favorite is the lack of audio from some npcs, then the hero, then music, then magical return of audio. But no i wont tell you is buggy, because, nowadays is a miracle if a game isnt buggy at all.... maybe i just gave up on this issue.About the storyline and gameplay, which in my opinion is what makes Deus Ex... well Deus Ex. Let me tell you, the gameplay resembles the original Deus Ex, combat is fair, the game requires you to use both sides of your brain, the hack mini game is really fun. Overall I liked its gameplay. At first I was annoyed about the weapon-praxis store inside the game, seems out of place somehow, but i guess it is because you want the player focus on the story and have fun blasting things around...But here is the real issue... i can understand bugs, i do not care about the overpowering store and easy achievable augs, the game could be in 2D-8bit for all i care.... BUT ""TO BE CONTINUED!?!""  only after one fragging chapter!!! now that is something i cannot abide, specially after such a beautiful initial movie. It shows absolutely mediocrity and a huge lack of respect for players, which like me, play for the storyline. If you like a cliffhanger short story, buggy as hell, with a beautiful setting in a dystopian Panama city... go ahead, DE: ""The Fall"" is your game.			"

												Stay far far away from this game if you ask me.I really regret wasting money on this title.So far there is two reasons that makes me dislike this game vehemently.Reason one, the inability to customize my controls is a big big downer.I even got me an Xbox gamepad but still didn't save the game.Reason two, I got to the mandatory emp grenade purchase before I quit in disgust.The controls are confusing, and the tutorials didn't really make a good job telling mewhat actions did what. Not to mention the crude way you fire the gun, sorry thanks but no thanks.The feeling I get when I play is it's a rushed halfassed made game that could really have been good.I mean Deus Ex: HR was a good game which I like quite a lot. But this is a very pale and crappy madegame. Can't understand how Square Enix can release such garbage, Sleeping dogs and Deus Ex: HR iswell made games.			"

												A nice tie-in with Deus Ex: Human Revolution which expands on the Tyrants and gives the player a bit of an insight into how they work. Visuals are good and the controls and overall feel are virtually identical to those of Human Revolution. We're also introduced to two very relatable characters named Ben Saxon and Anna Kelso who both have their own pasts and difficulties. I cannot wait for part 2 whenever that comes out. A great game.

												Deus Ex: The Fall is a good follow up for Deus Ex fans considering it was originally released as a mobile game for tablets. It has been ported to PC to mixed reviews. I had a problem with mouse input but it was fixed within the settings. It faithfully gives you the Deus Ex experience and for fans of Icarus Effect will add more depths to the Saxon/Kelso story. While short for a PC game it is was again, originally released for mobile devices and wasn't priced as highly as many new releases are.3/5 Set back from the start being a mobile port, still plays well enough to earn a decent rating, the story tries to be interesting and the flow of the game never slows down.

Story and voice over is stunted and makes little sense. They trashed the whole exploration reward system by having a 'press H for in-game store' anywhere.This isn't Deus Ex, it is a cheap shooter port to PC which looks like Deux Ex as they have used the same designs/textures and Golden filter.Don't buy it.

												Being a fan of the series I just bought the game without any research into it, and I regret that. The game is really a misguided attempt to make a Deus Ex title for the tablet market. Current tablets just don't have the ability to give the Deus Ex experience. The owners decided to port it to the PC. This might have been a good idea if they did a complete overhaul of the game instead of a simple port. You can't remap the keys, there is no jump, the graphics and design are subpar when compard to Human Revolution, the voice acting isn't spectacular, the pacing and story aren't great. Basically I made a mistake in purchasing it. It does come with the GOTY edition of the original Deus Ex. This is good except I already owned the game through Good old Games. In the end I wish I had not bothered buying this game. Support of this game sends the wrong message to the owners of the franchise.			"

												The price is about 63% of the ""Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut"".But ""The Fall"" campaign can be breezed less over 5 hours, while ""Human Revolution"" lasts longer.Considering this facts it is the rip off, unless one buy this with a discount.Lots of components were used from ""Human Revolution"" (i.e. enemy models, engine etc.), this leaves impressionthat it was done only to make fast money without efforts.Overall, gameplay was simplified, locations are short which results in much less demands for PC, GPU and human brain.But there is no option to increase graphics quality or changer difficulty.I did not encounter sound issues (desyncronization) like in other reviews.Only once the footsteps sound got stuck but it disappeared after level change.BTW, I've come through game 2 times, just to get all augs and check out other weapons.Second time was much more easy.Conclusion: buy this only with the discount, overwise it is rip-off.

The story and setting are very intresting and the mechanics stealth or action have not changed very much.  Action has become a little bit more difficult, so stealth is probably favorable. It is the first chapter of a series, that is why it is with less than 3 hours short.

Problem is, that the game is fundamentally broken: music over rides all other sound at times and the controls, which aren't particularly responsive, often give out completely.			"

												Deus Ex: The Fall scores 2 out of 10.Poor graphics, rambling dialogs, buggy controls, and horrible NPC skins ruin this game.I cant stress enough just how much the developers ruined this add on.It almost seems as though they have never actually played any version of Deus ex, System Shock, or Thief.If they had spent one tenth of the time on game play as they did on changing the original interface from Deus Ex HR, the game would have at least had a chance.But really, YOU CANT JUMP !!!????, what idiot removed the ability to jump ??Lets all just revert back to doom 1 type gameplay, its ohh so fun to come to a tiny obstical and have to run 200 feet to get around it.Also, the hud has been revamped for the worse, and apparently you now have a store jammed inside of yourself.Thats right , you can buy weapons/ammo from yourself, for yourself, really wierd...The quests are clunky , the gameplay is thin on fun, and the graphics look like DX8.The only good thing about this add on is that it came with the Original Deus EX GOY edition, so money wasnt completely wasted...I would NOT recommend this game to anyone, even if it was free !

												Its a little rough on PC from the port over. Nothing game breaking, just slightly annoying because your cursor rarely actually works the first 2 or 3 tries to activate dialog in a speech and click on ""OK"" buttons and those kinds of things. Not as smooth as Dues Ex: HR. However very similar in style. **Major drawback is this is only like 1 chapter of a storyline... and it just says ""to be continued""**Since multiple newer titles have been released, I feel like they probably are not going to continue this game. It is extremely short. maybe 3 hours if you explore every inch of every corner of each level.The limited story we are exposed to is not as interesting as HR was either. I would certainly never pay full price for this, but if you catch it on sale, it can be worthwhile.			"

												I haven't played video games in a very long time and lost interest in them completely until I decided to download the Steam platform and become a part of the PC gaming crowd (which is a hell of a lot more fun, interesting, and less alienating than the console platform, IMO).For someone who isn't well acquainted with the Deus Ex franchise, I saw this game as a bit of a fun primer that will help me get through the meat of the main franchise (Deus Ex, Invisible War, Human Revolution, and eventually Mankind Divided). And even if I was a veteran of the franchise, I would enjoy Deus Ex: The Fall for what it is: another story in the Deus Ex Universe.With that said, Deus Ex: The Fall doesn't deserve the shade everyone is giving it. I played it, beat the initial campaign on a no-kill playthrough, and enjoyed it. Especially since I am a big fan of stealth games like Metal Gear Solid, and of the cyberpunk genre.			"

												I have thoroghly enjoyed all the Deus Ex games so I was super pumped seeing this title for its price... and let me tell you you get what you pay for. While this isn't a flat out terrible game, to me, I get the sense that its like a cheap knockoff. It has the look and feel of Deus Ex game, story seems okay, and the graphics are sub-par (but only because I was used to/expecting Human Revo detail). OOnce I started the mechanics were kind of weird such as no aiming down sights, you just kind of shoot them from the hip (this maybe untrue further in the game but so far) as well as the cover system, just doesn't have the same... 'smoothness' i suppose you could say, sometimes you just can't shoot from cover or pop up above it or round corners.I'd give it a 2/5, if you want to play this game... just play Human Revolution [again] and go buy yourself something nice with that $10.

												Not worth the price.It's a port from mobile devices so you expect to see some flaws. Visuals and controls leave a lot to be desired. It can, however, be overlooked and still gives a good feel as HR did.My issue is that it isn't the full story. At the end you get what everyone hates to see, a big insulting ""To be continued"" just before the credits roll. If I'm paying this much for what is essentially 'added content' in the Deus Ex universe I at least expect them to finish it.Some of you may be ok with that and, like me, can overlook the not so smooth porting issues. I'm sure in time we will see more of how this ties in with HR and not just cameo character appearances. Unfortunately we also run the risk of this falling into that catagory of ""Games the developers forgot"" and never see how it pans out. All that being said, we are paying too much money for so many unknowns.			"

												I am a big Deus Ex fan from the very first game.  First I will say the story is pretty decent -- Character development, plot twists, unknown are present.  However, this being a port from a mobile game makes everything else seem childish.  The development was done backwards, in other words, they should have developed a ""real"" game first, then dumbed it down rather than the other way around.  All those limitations of a tablet are present in the PC version.  However, my biggest complaint is that about 4 hours into the game (including side quests), you are hit with ""to be continued.""  Now, I would not mind this except nowhere in any description before/during/after purchase was it mentioned that this is only ""part 1"".  DLC is fine, but normally it augments an already complete game (such as Deus Ex: Missing Link), and not a requirment for completing.  I will not recommend until a complete game is available.			"

												I'm going to keep this short, since it appears that I share the views of many who have played this sad excuse for a game.I went into this not expecting much and was STILL disappointed. For those of you that don't already know, it's only the first 'part' of the game, though nowhere does it say this on the store page. Since it was a port for tablets, some of the control conversions were wonky and there is NO way to change them. Sometimes I would be stuck in cover when I wanted to move (Causing me to die multiple times), and during hacking the STOP! Worm software wouldn't always take effect. It wasn't just a once or twice thing, it happened consistently throughtout the game. Also, you only have one save slot. I repeat: ONE. Other things that bothered me was the lack of depth in the gameplay, and felt like a bad attempt at being able to do what you could in DE:HR. For example, it made absolutely NO difference if the camera saw you. Alarms didn't sound. It wouldn't call guards or robots. Once you realize this you stop worrying about cameras at all.  It didn't even stop me from getting the 'smooth operator' experience at the end of a quest. So, what is the point? There were a few things that I liked, such as the ability to buy 'bundles' at a cheaper price and being able to disarm proximity mines. The story itself was intruiging, and the main characters were interesting. I WANTED to care about them, but we got so little interactions with them that it became difficult after the first few scenes. It was frustrating to see a game with so much potential to flop so miserably, especially after how much I loved Human Revolution.All-in-all, I wouldn't bother with it. If you REALLY want to ignore my advice (and the advice of almost everyone else as far as I can tell) at least wait to get it when it's on sale for extremely cheap, so that way you don't feel so ripped off.

It's Human Revolution just... less.  It looks like a third party came in and just made every aspect of the game worse: buttons often have to be clicked multiple times to work, cover works differently, the inventory/shop systems are completely different, and even hacking, which was super minimalistic to begin with, is now quite a lot worse.I put in two hours and I just can't keep going.  If you're hardcore enough to push through for the sake of the story, good on you, but I simply can't say that this game is *fun* in any way.

												For those not familiar with the Deus Ex series, I would suggest playing this game to gain a better understanding of the surroundings and era. But be warned- as those who are familiar with the series- this game did bring disappointment with the development.- You lack the same fluid movement as in DEX3 so it makes for some really awkward character movement and camera jumpyness. It makes combat exceptionally difficult.- The AI of the NPC's is 'dodgy'. Clipping through supposedly solid surfaces just to get at you or even spot you. Makes stealth and passive gameplay a lot harder.- I'm not a person that goes on about graphics, but I'll just throw in this; it could have been done much better for being such a short game. Instead of a rushed, half-pie piece.I am intrigued by the characters and the history of the Mercs before Human Revolution, and it backs up how much more there is in the world of Deus Ex. I take my hat off to the creativity. "

Which makes it a short, buggy experience.   If all the missions worked and the sound issues were eliminated, this would be awesome game. Reccomendation:  WAIT FOR A BUG-FIX PATCH!			"

												I love Deus Ex as a series. I think that it is a great series of games. Game length is about 7 hours or so... your mileage may vary. Seems right for the price.That said, I can not as of the time of this writing give this episode a positive review. I feel that this is completely fix able on the part of the publisher with a patch.More than half the dialog in this game is broken. Infact I would guesstimate that 80% of the spoken dialog in this release is not working. In my professional opinion (I am an A+ tech IRL) there is absolutely NO excuse for a game to be released unfinished... especially an episodic release. There were a few other minor issues that I noted... Frame rates were a little on the low side (not too bad but not butter smooth either) and there was 1 instance that I fell through the world. The last one is forgiveable ♥♥♥♥♥♥happens) but the first one (audio issues) is not.So here is my take... IF the publisher/developer releases a patch to fix the audio issues then I will update my review and contenue to purchese the series. IF the publisher/developer chooses to abandon this title and move on to the next episode then I will abandon the publisher/developer and not buy their product. I have already done this to UBISOFT.Shame on the jerk that thinks it is a good business practice to release a game that is VERY obviously broken.			"

												I loved the novel from which the game takes its inspiration, but the graphics and animation of the game is not up to par to Deus Ex: Human Revolution and that really takes away from enjoying the game. Seeing Namir walking around like an awkard sack of meat really stole the moment of enjoyment i was looking forward to.			"

												i love Deus Ex, however i can't recommed this, i could not get the controls to be responsive with either the mouse or xbox 360 controller. I found the controls just killed the game for me, i didn't get past 30 minutes. If the controls were fixed it would be ok (mouse acceleration) and something weird with the gamepad aiming. As it's been out for so long unlikely to ever be fixed. do not buy even at discount, you won't get anything out of it. Better to watch on youtube if you want the story.			"

												This game is pretty damn awful. I played it because I'm a big fan of the series and wanted that little bit of extra story with a new character. Turns out even that was a mistake as well because they decided to stop the story on a giant cliffhanger halfway through, and as this ""Part 1"" game was such a flop, it'll never be resolved. As for the gameplay, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mobile port, need I say more? Not *quite* as bad as I was expecting, but still awful. Aesthetics? Horrible.Even fans of the series, avoid this one.			"

												I can't recommend this game, but I'm having trouble condemning it as well. The story is interesting, adding a bit more to the DX prequel universe, and we get to see a little more of the Tyrants from Human Revolution, but thats about it for pros. Honestly the only way I made it through the measly 4 hours it took to complete the game was the thought that this just plays like an average PS2 gen FPS. I really feel like this should have been some type of DLC campaign to HR and fully utilize the tools from it rather than being a shoddy PC port of a mobile game.			"

												If you loved to play Deus Ex: Human Revolution, you will like The Fall. New main characters with new stories, which a little bit linking with somebodies we know from Human Revolution. But mainly the game style is the same - go there, find this, help him to receive that... And, of course, you can choose the way, how to solve problem - talking way or stealth way or fighting way or mix of all:)What is different - a little bit strange, that main character cant jump - it walks, talks, hides, crouches, but don't jump... Strange. Why???One more thing - if previously there was special characters and places for buying things (like, guns, mods etc), now you can do it in your inventory - just need credits. For me this is also a strange solution...And third thing - The Fall is too short. Maybe, only for me...? :)In few words - definitely suggesting - good choice for good price :)			"

												This 'game' is truly a fall from grace for this franchise. Human revolution was a visual thrill ride, a game i repeatedly completed in various manners. Yet this mobile port really hurts the Deus Ex timeline. The controls are lacking, the story is hard to get into and the graphics are below average. I might be comparing this to its Human Revolution counterpart but what other benchmark am I meant to compare it to when it is from the same story line.This came with the Deus Ex directors cut bundle. Truthfully... I'm not happy its even in my library. I want to 100% this game, but I cannot bring myself to play it 1 second longer.			"

												While going through the tutorial I really felt like this was a god aweful game... but only until I finished the tutorial and got into the actual game.I have played Deus Ex: Human Revolution so I knew what to expect and had high expectations, even though I knew this was a port of a mobile game. While it isn't as realized or complex as Human Revolution, I had fun the 5-6 hours it took me to get through it.While there are no micro transactions in the PC version of the game, you can still feel how the item shop was designed to give people the opportunity to spend real money on the game whenever they found themselves in a sticky situation - you can buy anything, ANYTHING that is available in the game on the fly, but it costs in-game currency in the PC port so you obviously can't be loaded with gear from the get-go.I give Deus Ex: The Fall 6/10 and I find the 2 Euro I spent on it was worth it (got it at reduced price - I probably won't recommend it at its full price).

												What a fabulous little game! From all the reviews I expected this to be terrible, but I really enjoyed it. The protagonist is perhaps the most likeable of the Deus Ex protagonists yet, and the story has all the hallmarks of the series. Conspiracy! Hacking! Helicopters! In addition it plays perfectly on my tablet in 1080p - I wish there were more game developers out there who realized a lot of us who grew up on and love proper FPS gameplay do not want to drop thousands on hot and heavy gaming rigs any more. On the downside, the purchasing of weapons and ammo anywhere really kills the difficulty, and the lack of a jump button does make it feel a bit Wolfenstein 3D. Still, an admirable addition to the canon, and definitely worth a quick playthrough for anyone into sci-fi adventure games. I hope they make a sequel.			"

Of course the graphics, level design, AI, crowd dynamics, mission variety, combat mechanics, etc. are all subpar compared to Human Evolution, but if you are a fan of the Deus Ex lore and storytelling, The Fall should provide some, albeit short, entertainment. Hell if this game is named The Fall Episode 1 then people will realize why it's so short. It's essentially just one level of a large game.I personally would like to see how the story goes.

												The Fall isn't a game that I would recommend for a Deus Ex experience.Pros:For a mobile game it does have some good backgroundsSaxon who is the player character has some potential in terms of story and character building.I actually liked the plane level and the turntable was a nice feature.Cons:Gameplay tries but fails to emulate Deus Ex HRThe story didn't really catch my attention and I often skipped quite a bit of the dialogue. I do think that think that there is a story there but it’s just presented in such a bland way that you just switch offOh and the weapon animations are horribleThe first (tutorial) mission felt really quite bland which is a shame considering the venue was Moscow which could have been interesting.It's unfinished. To be frank there's a whole list of other things that have gone wrong with this game which has already been pointed out.And if I was asked to develop a game for mobile platforms and PC then I would not have chosen an FPS format.In short: Do not purchase this game and definitely not at full price although I purchased this as part of a bundle.Recommendations:I would turn this into a top down RPG instead although this may have to sacrifice some Deus Ex features but you could end up with much better gameplay and graphics which doesn't look quite so wanting and still be able to have acceptable looking custcenes.Get rid of the purchase menu; I don't know what they were thinking by including that.Also the environments need to be better developed. The Panama level just felt like a copy and paste of the Detroit levels in DXHR with a few minor differences and with a spinoff such as this it pays to give customers a new aspect of the franchise and activities not seen in its parent game (DXHR)I do think that there is potential in this game but if the developers really want it to sell then they're going to have a serious change of direction.

												This is a seriously dumbed-down version of the ""Deus ex experience"" in every aspect: gameplay, maps, characters, shop system, controls, 4-dummy-tutorials... - and even story and dialogue are mostly not very inspired, but not entirely uninteresting either...However, it gets better after the tutorial-heavy intro and, for me, it turned out to be much better than expected after all the negative reviews. Design and music are ok at least and produce a good Deus ex feeling despite all the flaws of the game. Recommended if you want more Deus ex atmosphere and dont mind everything being dumbed-down quite a bit. In other words: keep your expectations in check and dont hope for it being DX: HR2. Also, get it on sale, not for the full price...EDIT: I cannot recommend this game anymore - even on sale - after playing through it, since it is really very very very short... the normal price is a joke.

												I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this game. It certainly isn't even worth the money I paid for it! Now, where to begin....the graphics are horrid, and the dialogue is only slightly better. The fact that I can't jump is really frustrating as it took me a few minutes to figure out how to get over a low wall. Also, the game forces you to put a silencer on a combat rifle, which is horrid in itself. I'm much more of a pistol person myself, so it was extremely frustrating to be forced to use the combat rifle to stay at least somewhat hidden. However, the worst part of it all is that the silencer doesn't even work - the enemies responded the same!The controls themselves are extremely confusing. Instead of using the numbers to change weapons like pretty much every other game in the world does, you're stuck holding down buttons on the keyboard and then scrolling through the options. If you want to change a weapon quickly in battle, tough luck.Also, for some reason, I can't get headshots, even though I have no trouble getting them in DX:HR. It's frustrating to use up so much ammo on such a simple guard. Granted, there is an in-game store to replenish you ammo, but I feel that really doesn't fit - after all, there's no challenge if you can pull up the store in the middle of a fight and buy a grenade.Anyway, save your money. Buy Deus Ex: Human Revolution instead.			"

												I find myself in a bizarre situation. On the one hand, Deus Ex: The Fall isn't all too terrible. On the other hand, there is no mention anywhere of this being an episodic game. You simply play for a little bit and then reach a ""To Be Continued..."" screen. It feels a bit cheap.Cheap is easily the best word to describe this. Don't bother wasting $5 on this. I got it for around $2 and feel a little cheated. Graphics don't make a game, but holy crap is this a bit of a mess. Character models barely animate, there is clipping abound and performing takedowns almost always results in the world disappearing around you before forming back. I also got stuck in a box very early into the game.As for the actual mechanics, there are a bunch of differences compared to Human Revolution, but the iOS origin of the game makes that understandable. What isn't so forgivable is that none of your keybindings show up on the screen. Everything is left as if you were still playing on an iPad. At least the tutorial voice recognizes your keyboard and mouse.The level design is also entirely forgettable. This is pretty much a greatest hits of what the Deus Ex series has to offer. Nothing new ever happens. You hack terminals and computers, you stealth takedown enemies or blast them away and you crawl through vents. There is even a requisite nightclub, as if the first game made a permanent blueprint that can't be escaped.I don't necessarily mind the chopped down areas, but there isn't much in the way of freedom. You definitely have choices in how you tackle the objectives at hand, but the AI is so shockingly stupid that you often wonder if stealth even matters. I often just ran straight at people and attacked them, barely taking a scratch.The music is the standout feature here. The voice acting is hit and miss, but you can easily forget the characters are even talking when you hear the music. It may be a bit too short (the samples loop quite a bit), but it sounds far better than Human Revolutions did. It fits the tone of the game very well.I also have a love/hate relationship with the store system. Instead of having to go to a merchant or even terminal, you simply buy what you want at any given moment. This turns moments where you get outnumbered or cornered by a robot into trivial affairs. I suppose trying to aim sucks on iPad, but it's flawless on PC.So I could take the bad if there were at least a complete game here. As it stands, I feel like I only got half an experience. It wasn't devoid of fun, but you could spend your money a lot better. Human Revolution routinely goes on sale for $5 and you could even get the first two Deus Ex games in a pack for $5. Doing either option would be a much better investment then dealing with this drek.3/10			"

												When playing this one must acknowledge the fact that this is a mobile port. Of course the graphics, level design, AI, crowd dynamics, mission variety, combat mechanics, etc. are all subpar compared to Human Evolution, but if you are a fan of the Deus Ex lore and storytelling, The Fall should provide some, albeit short, entertainment. Hell if this game is named The Fall Episode 1 then people will realize why it's so short. It's essentially just one level of a large game.I personally would like to see how the story goes. This has the potential to become an interesting sidestory in the Deus Ex universe.			"

												While going through the tutorial I really felt like this was a god aweful game... but only until I finished the tutorial and got into the actual game.I have played Deus Ex: Human Revolution so I knew what to expect and had high expectations, even though I knew this was a port of a mobile game. While it isn't as realized or complex as Human Revolution, I had fun the 5-6 hours it took me to get through it.While there are no micro transactions in the PC version of the game, you can still feel how the item shop was designed to give people the opportunity to spend real money on the game whenever they found themselves in a sticky situation - you can buy anything, ANYTHING that is available in the game on the fly, but it costs in-game currency in the PC port so you obviously can't be loaded with gear from the get-go.I give Deus Ex: The Fall 6/10 and I find the 2 Euro I spent on it was worth it (got it at reduced price - I probably won't recommend it at its full price).

												Do not buy this, do not play this. It's a PC port of a game made for Android / iOS which sounds like a pretty bad idea in itself. So expect graphics and AI designed to run on a smartphone, not to mention absolutely HUGE UI made for touch, pretty straightforward objectives and short gameplay (afterall, the game must fit on a smartphone). Do not worry about gapes in storyline as it takes place before Human Revolution events an is rather disconnected from it. It also leaves an open ending with ""to be continued"" pomise, which I don't believe. If you're coming from HR and expect a sequel, this is not it. Mankind Divided is.			"

												I cannot really recommend this game only becuase: 1. It is highly unfinished and  plays out like its still in Beta Version 2. Its too short 3. The way everything works is sloppy,  aim system is nonsense,  sluggish movement.  4. Looks like a 90's vintage shooter5.  Its unfortunate that this carries the Edios brand - this is no where near the quality and exceptional  creation as  D. E  Human Evolution.  I'm guessing this was a teaser for a more polished game later?  The only redeeming quality I saw was the faithful  cyber-future art with the amber colors,  digital advertisement signs, and  cyber-punk enviorment along with the ambiance music that these line of games are known for... Otherwise...I'd say if somoene gives this to you as a gift, then play it.  If you want to play it --- use a trainer  to help skip through the nonense just you can say you followed the story.  Did I mention the voice acting is also bad?			"

												For the price of $2 during a sale, this is probably one of the better games you'll be able to buy.The amount of time I've played for is the amount of time it took me to get through the entire core campaign, neglecting all side missions (and there are a few of those). So, just take that into account. But for what it is, Deus Ex: HR Lite Edition, it's okay. Not phenomenal, but I had an itch for more Deus Ex: HR and didn't want to reinstall that game, so this little diversion did the job just fine. Something funny worth mentioning is that graphically, this game is on par with Human Revolution. That's a testament to both the evolution of mobile gaming graphics and how underbaked HR was. Not to mention that 300+ fps with maxed anti-aliasing is always nice. So, to reiterate, if you can snag it for $2 during a Square Enix sale like I did and are CRAVING more HR gameplay, get it. For any other situation, disregard The Fall.			"

												This an admirable game. Yes, it has it's flaws, but it was not originally meant for PC. Ports are not easy to revamp for other systems, especially for side projects. This game has a great story, has all the features from the original game, and is a great experience. You cannot jump, or remap buttons, but that's not a big deal. The only problem I had was scrolling through the weapons list with my mouse wheel, but that's really it. The graphics are not up to date. This is a great buy at any price you buy it at. The only thing that bugs me is that it is half a story, and the dlc is no where in sight.3/5. I reccomend for all Deus Ex fans.			"

												I wish I could say this game was another fine Deus Ex experience that upheld the reputation built by the games that preceded it, but I cannot.  While it does have a sort of similar flavor to Deus Ex: Human Revolution in terms of aesthetics and story, it is badly hampered by the limitations kept from the iOS it was originally designed for.  Also, in just under two hours, I've experienced two game-breaking bugs, one of which involved falling through the floor for several thousand meters and dying.  I know it's called Deus Ex: The Fall, but come on now.  I had to do that whole level over because of some debugging that was not only sub-par, but outright bad.  At least the amount of content that exists in a level is small enough that this didn't set me back all that much.Overall, a neat story wrapped in a bug-laden, ugly, poorly-adapted package.  If they fixed the bugs, I could almost look past the mediocre graphics, lack of a jump mechanic, and somewhat sluggish menu response, and call it worth five bucks, but as it is, I'm going to go ahead and advise you to stay away.

												 I played Human Revolution and I loved it. i beat that game 3 times in the pursuit of the pacifist achiement which never wanted to trigger (appently a crossbolt to the head was considered lethal :p) Okay lets talk Deus ex: Fall.  pro:  1.new aug that allows for two bars to be recharged that something the first lacked ( i have gotten the chanse to see directors cut difference either) 2. the quickslot tabs were really nice make swtiching for what i need so much easiernow I am going to start to nit pick some of these complains might not be to major but they are things that were revomed and I misscons: 1. Length 2.5 hours for $10? Yeah relly short for being the the first part I recommend wating till it goes on sale I still feel a little shortchanged paying $5 ther e is not much to do and belive you me I the kind of person who goes away from the objective to find the loot first. 2. odd take downs. Human Revolution had a great system when it comes to take downs in that where you took out your enemy made sense. In the fall I frecquntly find my self being launched 5 to 10 feet from where i initiated it and alerting other guards speaking of which.... 3. the AI and NPC: in human revolution mass panic took place the moment you took a guard in puplic in the fall these people Really could'nt give a ****. One NPC evwen said to me she was'nt paid enough for this crap. It really suspends the disbelief. 4. Disappering guards : I get this is supped to make thing easier guys but when I take a guard it seems really odd just having him vanish without a trace. In human reolution it make sense you had to hid ethe bodyies. ALso I had nurerous occurences of guards just going though walls  when I killed them. 5. Dialogue drops: at random points I have the voice acting just drop out, really odd but a simple bugs fix if they can find it. 6; infinite inventory and on hand store: i get these were mostly implemented to make things easier but I kinda of enjoyed managing my inventory in human revolution it felt real ansd seniblr that i couldnt cary 10 weapons at once. 7: minimizing of non leathals: I was saddened not to see the tranc rifle, gas crossbow ( the one they had was supernerfed), gas mines I loved those things. Also it semed that the stun gun range was nerfed by a about 5 ft as well for no good reason. 8: trckng aug removal: I loved that aug make stealing so much easier plus the ability to track invisble targets who would't miss it. 9: meh graphic. Now I may be crazy but I felt like the fall was a little less preety than human revolution. not enought to detract me but still it felt odd. Like I siad earlier this game is not worht the full price. If you were a fan of human revolutiion it a decent pickup, but wait for a sale. If you never played human revolution play that first then decide on this .			"

												I decided to recommend this game because there are already so many negative reviews out there, and I feel like the game is being underrated. But the fact is I wouldn't recommend this game to everyone, only if you fulfil the following criteria:1.	You liked Deus Ex: Human Revolution2.	The above made you go out and buy the book Deus Ex: Icarus effect3.	You liked the bookThe reason for this is that the game focuses on Benjamin Saxon, one of the main characters in the book, and it’s really cool to play him. The story takes place right after the end of the Icarus effect and it’s quite true to the events that take place there, there are even some recreations of the events in the book (I won’t get into details so there are no spoilers), and the dialogs are pretty much untouched from what you’ve read in the book. All of this makes for a good overall experience when playing the game, because you get to know what happens after the end of the book, and the story is very solid.The thing is that that’s pretty much it… The graphics are indeed horrible, the mouse look doesn’t work at 100% (the vertical axis his way less sensitive than the horizontal axis), you can’t change the controls (although for me that wasn’t really a problem). As for the audio issues, I didn’t come across anything. If you play the game with a headset, you should be fine.This being said, I’ll go on the L.I.M.B here and dare to say that gameplay wise, there are even some small improvements compared to HR. There are some cool new augs like the stealth dash and the body armor is no longer a passive aug. In HR this made the body armor a must get upgrade, because the result was that it made the game easier without any management. In The Fall, you have to manage when to activate it (which consumes energy) and when it activates it creates a glow around Saxon and you see a meter that tells you how much armor you have left and it drops when you take damage.There’s been some talk about the game ending in a cliff hanger but I don’t think that’s the case. The story isn’t finished, that’s obvious, but it wraps things up in that specific mission scenario. If part 2 ever comes out (which looks very unlikely, considering how things are going in Square Enix), I’ll want to play it, even if it’s flawed like the first one because for me the story is worth it and the flaws don’t make the game unplayable.

												This is not a great game, im very glad i got this in the sale, if id paid full price i would have been quite annoyed.Personally i do like the story and the voice acting, and the general ""feel"" of the game, but thats as far as it goes. I understand that yes this has come from a mobile platform and it is painfully obvious on this port. Its full of bugs and im sure it could have been better if they had spent a bit more time ironing them out. The UI is clunky and unintuitive, there are   clipping errors, motion errors, the hacking is abismal. Its not fun in this respect which is unfortunatly the game,This had proimise to be a good port for the PC but it failed quite well in its attempt.			"

It is just that, a mobile game, so don't get your hopes up to much. It does have the style of human Revolution which is nice. Spoiler alert, there is a cliffhanger and thus doesn't feel like a full game. Don't pay full price for this, wait for this to come on sale. I recommend if you are a big fan of Deus Ex and just need a small Deus Ex fix until Mankind Divided.			"

												The game is better than it's reputation. Yes, the game is developed for ios tablet and yes the game is not very good PC port at all. However most of the time the game manages to be entertaining if you do not expect Human Revolution kind of quality.Do not buy this game at its current full price, this is too expensive to be bad PC version of tablet game.  If you find this game at a reduced price go for it!A nice trip for a Deus Ex -fan between two main titles (HR and MD).			"

												I recommend it with some conditions. It's not a very good game, but I still found enough fun to be worth my time. If you consider this a higher quality fan mod (which is about the level of quality to expect here, not that it is an actual fan mod), there is some fun to be had here. Obviously, expecting this to be comparable to Human Revolutions or even the original Deus Ex will only result in dissapointment. VOICE ACTINGThe voice acting is pretty bad, but a lot better than I've seen from some fan mods that have tried to do voice acting.  The dialogue options are extremely limited, with very few opportunities for it to make a difference.STORYIt's ok and it keeps the pace going. GAMEPLAYA lot of areas are streamlined, probably primarily to do it being originally a mobile game. No jumping, which I disliked, but I can see why one might cut that here. It gives the designers a lot more control over where a player can go in the game without having to design additional ways to block player movement to account for jumping. This also focuses the type of gameplay they are offering, allowing multiple ways through environments. STEALTHI liked that full stealth options were available, as well as guns ablazing. HACKINGMuch easier than in Human Revolutions, but plenty of things to hack and a few good opportunities to turn robots and turrets against your enemies. GOODSI noticed a ton of weapons available for purchase... though I never bought any. The store might be too easy to access, but it gave a lot more options than typically can be found. Everything is probably too plentiful in the game. LEVELINGLeveling up was really quick, which was good since the game was short.ONE SAVE + BUGSI hate single save options. Just make sure when you save, nothing screwy is happening, though I found only a couple bugs during my playthrough.FINAL THOUGHTSIf anything, the game is too easy, but I still found it fun and I'm interested in seeing where things might go next, if they still planned on making another one. It's a nice diversion, as long as you don't expect much from it. Buy it on sale, if interested, and you should be good.			"

												I wont get into troubles, issues and bugs; yes, Deus Ex: The Fall has plenty of bugs and some annoying issues.... my personal favorite is the lack of audio from some npcs, then the hero, then music, then magical return of audio. But no i wont tell you is buggy, because, nowadays is a miracle if a game isnt buggy at all.... maybe i just gave up on this issue.About the storyline and gameplay, which in my opinion is what makes Deus Ex... well Deus Ex. Let me tell you, the gameplay resembles the original Deus Ex, combat is fair, the game requires you to use both sides of your brain, the hack mini game is really fun. Overall I liked its gameplay. At first I was annoyed about the weapon-praxis store inside the game, seems out of place somehow, but i guess it is because you want the player focus on the story and have fun blasting things around...But here is the real issue... i can understand bugs, i do not care about the overpowering store and easy achievable augs, the game could be in 2D-8bit for all i care.... BUT ""TO BE CONTINUED!?!""  only after one fragging chapter!!! now that is something i cannot abide, specially after such a beautiful initial movie. It shows absolutely mediocrity and a huge lack of respect for players, which like me, play for the storyline. If you like a cliffhanger short story, buggy as hell, with a beautiful setting in a dystopian Panama city... go ahead, DE: ""The Fall"" is your game.			"

												I ended up paying 3€ for this through a deal that came with the original Deus Ex. I got my money's worth of entertainment for those 3€. It's still Deus Ex and it ran very smoothly on my mid-range laptop from 2.5 years ago and it led to me getting Human Revolution. That's about all the praise I have for this game though.Controls are very buggy and my character would often spin around randomly, completely disorientating me. The inability to jump, along with a buggy vaulting mechanic to replace it, can lead to annoying situations. A complete lack of an inventory system and the ability to purchase anything you want at any given time trivialize a lot of the game. There is no way to keep multiple saves and last but not least, it's very short. Far too short to warrant the 10€ price tag, even if the gameplay itself was top notch.			"

												What the hell did they do to Deus Ex? I really don't know where to begin. The game is incredibly streamlined- to the point where you can't even re-bind your keys. The characters look... off. Like, wrong side of the uncanny vally off. The diolouge, story, and pacing are terrible. There are other neuances as well- no iron sights or dedicated scope zoom button (Hold down the fire button with a scoped weapon and it zooms. Hope you're ready to fire!), clunky weapon switching (grenades in particular. Hold down your scroll wheel and then use it to scroll through your grenades.) and a huge departure from the inventory system present in the good Deus Ex's just to name a few. I decided to google this, and found out that this was a tablet game. Not a big surprise.If you're a fan of the series, skip this one. Nothing but disapointment awaits you. I seriously regret paying for this trainwreck of a game.			"

												I am a fan of Deus Ex ever since the first one came out. The second version Invisible War was awful, Human Revolution took back the lost ground. Now we have The Fall and on the first run it's look easily as good as HR. However I am experiencing a bug that make the game unplayable. It starts out just fine, but if you Quit and Reload the Sound Effects disappear, as well as speech - so you NEED to have the captions show up or you won't know what's going on, then other times the caption window fly by so fast you can't read them, and if there is a character speaking when this happens their speech is cut off. While the music is playing you don't get any sound effects, they return after the music loop finishes, and disappear again when it restarts. You cannot turn the music off, you can only turn it all the way down. That means it is still looping and causing the sound effects to stop. There's obviously some channel overlap going on as my Sound Card is easily able to put out multiple channels over multiple devices - through Dolby 5.1 speakers as well as a Dolby 7.1 surround headphones at the same time. That said there is a work around for the sound problem all you have to do is set your sound card to Stereo and the problem is solved. It doesn't look like Square Enix is interested in providing a fix. So if you can handle that, you can play the game just fine.			"

												...Yeah it's a port.But that's not what makes this game terrible. It shows I have less than an hour, but with very good reason why. The first part of the game is so restrictive in trying to tell you how to play the game that it's ridiculous. You literallycan't pass through a door way without equipping an EMP first, it actually FREEZES your movement so you can do so. With Deus Ex Revolution, it teaches you on the go, it doesn't make you feel stupid where as this game has to stop you.Also the pistol in this game is stupid, it zooms in everytime you shoot, and one gun you have to zoom in and shoot with M1; which is absolutely terrible design. It wasn't worth the $2.50 I spent on it, let alone anyone who actually paid $10 for this.			"

												The biggest thing that gets this game is that: The user interface is far less user-friendly and far more obstructive of gameplay as compared to its' predecessor Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The rest of this review is rambling into why and then a snobby joshing remark.After playing Deus Ex: Human Revolution and its' expansion, this game is disgustingly bad gameplay wise... they force a clunky tutorial upon you that utilizesa  robotic voice and provides a clubky interface... you now buy weapons and ammo on the fly... and it forces you to silence your assult rifle...You have to scroll through slots to drink beer, use painkillers... and even your abilities (such as stealth). This game is a huge disappointment visually as well... I got used to the beautiful game of Deus Ex: Human Revolution...There are many holes in walls that 1 can just simply stand up within too... I did not give the game long, but there are way better things to play, such as Deus Ex: Human Revolution again.If you love this series you’ll probably enjoy this game, and I probably will get around to playing it eventually… but it has no need to be expedited to the top of ones play list and is probably worth the $2.50 I paid for it… although if I had to do it over again I’d wait for it to be $10… although I am a cheap gamer (I wait for decent sales).I usually do not review a game if I am indifferent towards it or dislike it... and even then I at times rate up a game and state it's shortcomings etc. but this game simply had too many downfalls that it is indeed properly named Deus Ex: THE FALL (well below ones expectations). In short this game was a considerable step back in gameplay quality in all reguards from a game that came sooner in the series.			"

												Ignore the metascore.  This game is no 46.  It is no 80, either, though.The biggest issue with The Fall is that it is a bad port, not necessarily a bad GAME.  You have no options to customise controls, menu clicking is annoyingly unresponsive, and leaving cover will sometimes go back to first person looking up at the sky for no reason as a default as a few gameplay flaws which were not issues on mobile.  Issues one and two did not exist because of the nature of touchscreens, and issue three never happened to me on mobile, either.  This game was not designed with PC in mind, and being hastily ported to it during Square-Enix's ♥♥♥♥♥torm politics and restructuring which began in 2012 and persists to this day was just a cash grab when it should have been delayed until it played like Deus Ex:  Human Revolution when on PC.With that being said, ten years ago this game would have been called by many players as fantastic because games were more mediocre in general (please do not bother to name rare, specific games from that era which you like as a retort since it probably not represent the shovelware climate).  In 2014, however, better quality overall is increasingly demanded by players when back then gamers were not as vocal as a whole--thank both the Internet and gaming becoming far more mainstream since the early 2000s in the west--and this is just NOT a great game by today's standards.It is, however, a definitive DE:HR sidestory experience, and it is very good in that right.  It looks, sounds, and feels like a gaiden of DE:HR and the story is great.  If you really enjoyed DE:HR or the DE series since the first like I did what with this being my favourite game series, you WILL enjoy this for about 10 or so hours.  Then, it ends, because SE decided to make it episodic content where it can charge you piecemeal for subsequent chapters.  The caveat to its piecemeal design is because the game's reception was so poor, I am largely certain that no new chapters will ever be released.  If they are, it will be more hurried content with much cut for time and budget constraints, à la the Xenosaga trilogy.The problem is not the game as much as it is how SE handled it, although the game does have its problems.  This review is simply to state that it is NOT deserving of the low 46 metascore just as sooooo many 90+ games are not even close to as deserving those high numbers...this is something that you can blame on the pay-for-scores game ""journalism"" paradigm of today.  Buy it on sale for $5 or less; this game sat on my Steam wishlist from its PC release date until it was $5, and I cannot recommend paying more for it even though I DO recommend playing it if you enjoy DE games.Oh, and for god's sake, if the PS2-era character models for this mobile game is the defining flaw in what makes this a ""bad"" game to you, you have no business critiquing any game whatsoever, let alone attempting to appreciate the DE series' level of depth and subtext beneath what are not-awful visuals.

												I'm not opposed to the idea behind it, a mini-series that focuses on side-characters from the novel; a sort of microcosm of Deus Ex HR's gameplay in an episodic format. The execution of this idea in The Fall leaves much to be desired, partially due to problems with the game itself, but mostly due to the pains of being an obviously rushed port.To the devs' credit, it does hit some HR beats. You have a hub location (Panama City Slums/Boardwalk/Downtown), with plenty of storage units and gates to hack, a few side-quests (though they are gated by story progress), buildings with hackable doors and safes, man-sized vent systems to serve as alternate paths, upgrade points and PRAXIS kits, stealth takedowns, tons of goodies lying around in or on trashcans/desks/safes, and the persuasion system returns at certain points (and thankfully, the CASIE mod is not an insta-win button this time, just a way to score some extra items/info).And that leads us to the rub. Imagine, for a moment, if there was a painting you enjoyed so much that you commissioned a different artist to make a painting with a similar style and feeling, with one stipulation: the artist can never look at the original painting, they can only use your written description. Even if the finished painting resembles the original painting's style from a distance, when placed upon closer inspection, several flaws will surface.There are a variety of upgradable weapons, but the balance feels weird (e.g. headshots from the base pistol are not one-hit kills, which means that the silenced pistol isn't a useful stealth weapon until you apply a damage upgrade). You can still choose to go in stealthily or burst in guns blazing, but the small area sizes with few enemies makes the faster Rambo option much more viable (the Pacifist achievement is bugged, as it unlocks even if you kill people in the campaign). Plus, the AI is as dumb as a doorstop; civilians don't react if you takedown a guard right in front of them; in a firefight, guards will either stay in place or walk towards your position. There are computers to hack, but almost all of them are unlock codes for doors and safes; outside of two memorable e-mails (one being from a certain person in the novel, and another referencing FF27), it's a wasted opportunity for world-building.The story starts off somewhat interesting (Ben's flashback to his last mission with the Tyrants), then it devolves into what's essentially busywork, as Ben Saxon puts the conspiracy-fighting on hold to go to Panama City and try to find a source of Neuropozyne for himself and Anna Kelso. Naturally, he stumbles onto a conspiracy (because conspiracies are as common as Starbucks in the world of Deus Ex). Things do get somewhat interesting again due to a twist. Unfortunately, the game doesn't go into much effort to build the characters of Ben/Anna/Janus, nor does it provide much of a look at the Tyrants, with the exception of Jaron Namir. It also doesn't give much background on these characters outside of a rough outline established by a few audio logs; leaving much of their origins in the novel.If it were just those problems, I'd probably excuse it, but as I said before, a bevy of porting problems indicate that this was a rushed port. The UI is largely the same as the mobile version, and while I can see how it would have worked on a touchscreen, it's clunky and unintuitive with a mouse and keyboard. Switching items/grenades/weapons are mainly accomplished by holding their designated key and picking the desired item with the mouse. It pauses the game, but it feels like an unnecessary step. I guess you can use the number bar, but, unlike HR, there's no constant reminder of what each number activates. That's a problem throughout the whole UI: It doesn't generally show key or button prompts, just action prompts. You might end up checking the key bindings infographic quite often. Then there's the graphics, which weren't scaled up for the PC release, so you'll frequently notice blurry textures, simple geometry, and many low-res character models. The only character models that are detailed decently enough are the Belltower guards, the Riot Cops, and the characters that are important to the storyline (though Ben has a dead-eyed stare when his shades aren't on). Despite the low-res graphics, I still experienced some framerate drops at random times.There are a few other notable problems with the port; a few bugs (there's a bundle of four barrels in the drug den with a Pocket Secretary on it, I'd fall through the floor and die if I took cover on it and grabbed the PS), only one save slot (saved at area changes and quick saves; I could feasibly see someone saving in an unwinnable position), the single-mouse-button shooting controls (on the crossbow, holding LMB will aim down the scope; on other weapons, it'll just fire multiple times). Perhaps the most annoying thing is when two objects are very close to each other (e.g. credits in a netphone slot); you have your crosshair on one object (the credits) and the game activates the other object (the netphone) when you hit the use key, until you find the correct position/angle to stand at.Oh, and as for that buggered-up recoil that you've probably seen in gifs, they've fixed that problem. Now the recoil is just a slight screen shake; the difference is immediately obvious as soon as you fire a gun.It's a sideways-thumb kind of game (leaning heavily towards thumbs down due to the rushed-port problems); not that good, but not so terrible that I'd want to actively warn people off of it. If you got into the Humble Bundle early (back when the BTA was $5-6), then it might be worth upgrading to check it out. Not so much at the current BTA price unless HB adds some big bonuses on Tuesday.			"

												What a piece of garbage, I LOVED Deus Ex: Human Revolution.  This having the deus ex name on it is just a disgrace.  Worst voice acting I have heard in a game in years, bodies just vanish when you kill enemies and the visuals made me physically sick(nauseated).  I havn't felt this ripped off since I bought Homefront(atleast this was only a $10 waste of money though)			"

												As an avid fan of DX:HR, quite honestly one of my favorite games ever played, I had high hopes for DX: The Fall. Profound disappointment cannot even begin to sum up my reaction. Every element of immersion, control, and user based choices from HR has been stripped down to an embarassing minimum.  Plot elements, instead of verging on that of a thriller, more resemble the Time Crisis games at aracades (Look bad guy! Bad guy is bad! Shoot bad guy!)Created for tablets, the controls lack that of a true gaming experience.  Point and click objectives, useless aiming (or lack there of) mechanics, and choppy cover mechanics are just a slap in the face.For a tablet, the graphics are great.  For a PC game, the graphics resemble a PS2 shooter; no details, slapped together polys, and generic scenary.  The sounds were entertaining at least.You'll see some familiar faces here, but not really any you will develop a connection to.If this was a $0.99 tablet game, I'd be fine with it. But for $10.00, save your money and put it towards the Director's cut of DX:HR.tl;dr - If it's free, go ahead. If not, just play DX:HR and pretend this doesn't exist.			"

												This game is very buggy. Lockups, falling through the scenery. Even caused BSOD in Windows 7. The game mechanics of hacking are almost impossible with a controller. And there is a lot of hacking required to play the game properly. Unlike Deus Ex Human Revolution this game feels half finished and has poor game mechanics that get in the way of the story. The sound cuts in and out and subtitles flash on and off too fast to read spoiling your ability to follow the story.			"

												Despite the amount of invisible walls that block bullets, the stilted voice acting and character models (there's even a nice part where a character shifts from a normal state animation to a seizure animation like it's the '90s), the headshots which seem to do random damage and the fact that the game constantly does something else than it promises to, it's a nice little scavanger hunt for picking up all of the beer in Panama City. It's a fun game to play on a Saturday morning if you've nothing better to do. And no beer. But you would like beer. And the game lets you pick beer up. Beer makes you dizzy for 5 seconds and improves your health, just like in real life.			"

												Although the game claims ""full controller support,"" my official wire Xbox 360 controller doesn't work with it. Other people on the forums have had the same problem.Also, I expected the graphics to be worse, because it's a mobile port. What I hadn't realised is that the writing and voice acting are also a big step down. Looks like production values all-around are worse - just play Deus Ex: HR again if you need more of the world.

												I decided to recommend this game because there are already so many negative reviews out there, and I feel like the game is being underrated. But the fact is I wouldn't recommend this game to everyone, only if you fulfil the following criteria:1.	You liked Deus Ex: Human Revolution2.	The above made you go out and buy the book Deus Ex: Icarus effect3.	You liked the bookThe reason for this is that the game focuses on Benjamin Saxon, one of the main characters in the book, and it’s really cool to play him. The story takes place right after the end of the Icarus effect and it’s quite true to the events that take place there, there are even some recreations of the events in the book (I won’t get into details so there are no spoilers), and the dialogs are pretty much untouched from what you’ve read in the book. All of this makes for a good overall experience when playing the game, because you get to know what happens after the end of the book, and the story is very solid.The thing is that that’s pretty much it… The graphics are indeed horrible, the mouse look doesn’t work at 100% (the vertical axis his way less sensitive than the horizontal axis), you can’t change the controls (although for me that wasn’t really a problem). As for the audio issues, I didn’t come across anything. If you play the game with a headset, you should be fine.This being said, I’ll go on the L.I.M.B here and dare to say that gameplay wise, there are even some small improvements compared to HR. There are some cool new augs like the stealth dash and the body armor is no longer a passive aug. In HR this made the body armor a must get upgrade, because the result was that it made the game easier without any management. In The Fall, you have to manage when to activate it (which consumes energy) and when it activates it creates a glow around Saxon and you see a meter that tells you how much armor you have left and it drops when you take damage.There’s been some talk about the game ending in a cliff hanger but I don’t think that’s the case. The story isn’t finished, that’s obvious, but it wraps things up in that specific mission scenario. If part 2 ever comes out (which looks very unlikely, considering how things are going in Square Enix), I’ll want to play it, even if it’s flawed like the first one because for me the story is worth it and the flaws don’t make the game unplayable.

												A Decent Deus Ex Game Held Back by a Terrible PC PortDeus Ex: The Fall is a decent Deus Ex game, if you can look beyond the terribel PC port, poor graphics and and abysmal shooting mechanics, then you'll find an enjoyable but short singleplayer campaign. I clocked in around 6.8 hours for my first run, but I was looking for loot and doing sidequests, so if you rush its probably more like 3 hours. It's clear that the developers didn't bother to adapt the Ipad game to PC.What the Game Does WrongThe biggest problem with the game is the shooting, its terrible, if you're shooting something apart from the assault rifle your FOV will move up and down, creating a disorienting screen shake effect, this is most noticeable with the shotgun which could make someone nautious  with repeated use. Scoped weapons are incredibly awkard to use too, instead of holding right mouse or mousewheel to look down your scope and  pressing left mouse to shoot, you hold left mouse to look down scope and release to shoot, its so akward that I never used a scoped weapon outside of the tutorial. There is no aim down sights, the gunplay feels flacid and unsatisfying.Also in gunfights the AI is terrible, if they aren't standing in the open shooting at you, they are taking cover at the wrong wall leaving them exposed to you. All these issues means make  you want to avoid gunplay because of the screen effect and the akwardness of the scoped weapons, and poor AI. Aside from the gunplay, gameplay dumbed down for Ipad is left unchanged, smaller leves, there is no jump buttion, only jumping over predetermined locations, no sprint, you cannot move objects around, bodies dissapear into particles so you can't move bodies, there is no inventory screen instead there is a shop/inventory screen where you can buy anything at any time  so you can buy items in the middle of a firefight.The graphics and PC port are also terrible, there is limited pc options and the port lacks many important essentials. For example there are no save slots, only one save slot that is used for autosave, thankfully there is quicksave which works just fine. The graphics are poor to, textures are very poor quality for 2014, animations are awkward, especially the taking cover animation.What the Game Does WellWhile the game's levels are alot smaller compared to Human Revolution, they are open-ended enough to be fun to sneak around, the hub area is also good theres quite a bit of loot hidded, althought the lack of jump means its not as fun as Human Revolution's hubs. There's about 6 sidequests to do, all of them add some secondary objectives to your main missions.Overall the sneaking is well executed too, I never noticed moments where I felt I should have been seen but wasn't or vice versa, and the routes you go to avoid guards a fun to find. I played through the game ghost style and there wasn't any area outside the tutorial where I felt the game was pushing me towards combat. Augmentations are largely unscathed, they basically got all the useful augmentations from Human Revolution and put them in there's a new augmentation called 'stealth run' but it feels akward using it on PC, its something was clearly designed for Ipad.Story is interesting, the presmise is that there's a new alternative to Neuropozine, however it looks like there's something suspicious with the drug. Unfortunately there's no real resolution to this plot as it ends on a cliffhanger, as there's meant to be an episode 2, but I won't hold my breath for episode 2. The voice acting is not great, it ranges from horrendous to okay. ReccomendationIf you play Deus Ex for its shooting, then you should avoid this game, however if you play for the stealth gameplay then the you will probably enjoy the game, the stealth is well executed and there's always a way to complete the ojectives stealthily.If you do play Deus Ex for the stealth, I would reccomend picking up the game during a sale, I got my copy for $3 and I felt I got my money's worth.  If you're new to the Deus Ex series I'd reccomend you get the original or Human Revolution Director's Cut instead of this, they have much better mechanics and depth compared to this game. I think only hardcore Deus Ex  fans will be willing to overlook the poor PC port, graphics and design decisions in this game.			"

												This game is absolute garbage. I had expected them to polish it by loading the content into the PC engine to make it less clunky than the tablet version, but they did not. It's a straight port and it's absolutely terrible piece of garbage that's not even worth buying at 75% off.The story and content are fine, they just need to be repackaged into the full Deus Ex: Human Revolution engine for the PC.

												The Fall isn't a game that I would recommend for a Deus Ex experience.Pros:For a mobile game it does have some good backgroundsSaxon who is the player character has some potential in terms of story and character building.I actually liked the plane level and the turntable was a nice feature.Cons:Gameplay tries but fails to emulate Deus Ex HRThe story didn't really catch my attention and I often skipped quite a bit of the dialogue. I do think that think that there is a story there but it’s just presented in such a bland way that you just switch offOh and the weapon animations are horribleThe first (tutorial) mission felt really quite bland which is a shame considering the venue was Moscow which could have been interesting.It's unfinished. To be frank there's a whole list of other things that have gone wrong with this game which has already been pointed out.And if I was asked to develop a game for mobile platforms and PC then I would not have chosen an FPS format.In short: Do not purchase this game and definitely not at full price although I purchased this as part of a bundle.Recommendations:I would turn this into a top down RPG instead although this may have to sacrifice some Deus Ex features but you could end up with much better gameplay and graphics which doesn't look quite so wanting and still be able to have acceptable looking custcenes.Get rid of the purchase menu; I don't know what they were thinking by including that.Also the environments need to be better developed. The Panama level just felt like a copy and paste of the Detroit levels in DXHR with a few minor differences and with a spinoff such as this it pays to give customers a new aspect of the franchise and activities not seen in its parent game (DXHR)I do think that there is potential in this game but if the developers really want it to sell then they're going to have a serious change of direction.

But I doubt that monteral is going to be coming out with any more content for this game considering user reception(I seriously don't know what else people expected from a mobile port, people judge this game way to harshly).

												This an admirable game. Yes, it has it's flaws, but it was not originally meant for PC. Ports are not easy to revamp for other systems, especially for side projects. This game has a great story, has all the features from the original game, and is a great experience. You cannot jump, or remap buttons, but that's not a big deal. The only problem I had was scrolling through the weapons list with my mouse wheel, but that's really it. The graphics are not up to date. This is a great buy at any price you buy it at. The only thing that bugs me is that it is half a story, and the dlc is no where in sight.3/5. I reccomend for all Deus Ex fans.			"

												This is a straight port from the game designed for iOS. It is not a ""remaster"", nor does it claim to be. It is not a badly done port of that game, but anyone expecting a full-featured PC game is going to be unhappy with this. A lot of functionality from Deus Ex: Human Revolution isn't present in this game, and the graphics were obviously meant for a smaller screen. I did not play enough to comment on the story, apart from to say that the beginning is formulaic, and non-compelling. What voice acting I heard was noticably more robotic and self-conscious than the acting in Human Revolution. Oddly enough this is what sealed it for me. I expected the game mechanics and graphics to be less impressive than those of Human Revolution, but I expected the story and voice acting to make up for it. I didn't give it much of a chance, only playing for about 30 minutes, but the game didn't really put it's best foot forward, even with my lowered expectations.			"

Yes, I know how to look around with a mouse... yes, I know how WSAD works.... yes I know how crouch works... yes, I know that it's a beer.  Most games would give you a little tooltip saying ""Press CTRL to crouch"", but this game holds your hand like you're completely new to the concept of thinking.  If that wasn't bad enough, each time it pops up, it's a bloody paragraph, and having it force read to you by 'Microsoft Sam: The Next Generation'.			"

Curse you, inflation!Women's restrooms have urinals inside. I wonder what kind of augmentations those girls have.Sometimes this game was very weird. Then again, it was much better then I had expected.It feels like an addon for Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Of course it doesn't reach its quality but you have the same skills, the same weapons, the same ways of approaching your goals.Basically, it's the same gameplay.There are few things I don't like about the game. First, you can't jump. Benches are your worst enemies. Second, it's way too easy. More difficulty levels would have been nice. Last but not least, it's very short. Finishing the game took me no more than 3 hours. I don't want to spoil anything except one sentence: ""To be continued.""I don't understand where all those bad reviews come from. ""Bad graphics""? Seriously, what do you expect? It's a PC port of an iOS-game. ""Bad gameplay""? It's more or less exactly the gameplay of Human Revolution. ""Bad story""? It's good enough to keep me playing the game for 3 hours.If you like Deus Ex: Human Revolution and you can't get enough, take a look at The Fall. You can't expect the same quality, but if you can get it for little money it will be worth playing. I am definitely going to play it again because I want to try a different playing style and because I want to get all the achievements and side quests I missed during my first playthrough.			"

												this game feels like it was developed for a mobile device/tablet. the graphics are distinctly last generation (reminds me of invisible war...which actually gave the game  a nostalgic feel ) the gamepad controls are unaleterable (which is not cool) and it is very short. (i beat it in 5 hours). that being said it is obviously ment to be part of a series of dlc games which never happened. Stor y wise its pretty compelling, and the combat/hacking/gameplay etc, is actually enteretaining. that being said it has little to no replay value. if your looking for a short and quick cyberpunk game, and dont mind last generation graphics, this is the game for you.

												I cannot really recommend this game only becuase: 1. It is highly unfinished and  plays out like its still in Beta Version 2. Its too short 3. The way everything works is sloppy,  aim system is nonsense,  sluggish movement.  4. Looks like a 90's vintage shooter5.  Its unfortunate that this carries the Edios brand - this is no where near the quality and exceptional  creation as  D. E  Human Evolution.  I'm guessing this was a teaser for a more polished game later?  The only redeeming quality I saw was the faithful  cyber-future art with the amber colors,  digital advertisement signs, and  cyber-punk enviorment along with the ambiance music that these line of games are known for... Otherwise...I'd say if somoene gives this to you as a gift, then play it.  If you want to play it --- use a trainer  to help skip through the nonense just you can say you followed the story.  Did I mention the voice acting is also bad?			"

												At first this game showed some promise, then I went through the menus and enabled controller support, and my controller still didn't work, then I tried to play it anyway, mouse and keyboard, the controls are worse than anything i've ever seen, and there is no immediately apparent way to change them, voice acting was done by the homeless, graphics quality is ok for an early 2000's title like oblivion, dogshit for this decade, the plot reminds me that eidos has been underfunded since Square Enix bought them, and lastly we have the x factor, how fun a game is, this has a factor of -1 in that it actually made me sad that they put deus ex in the title here, Invisible War was bad, this game, is so much worse.

Visuals are good and the controls and overall feel are virtually identical to those of Human Revolution. We're also introduced to two very relatable characters named Ben Saxon and Anna Kelso who both have their own pasts and difficulties. I cannot wait for part 2 whenever that comes out. A great game.

All I wanted was a freaking story. I wanted to know what happened to Anna Kelso and Ben Saxon after reading ""Icarus Effect"", so I had to go through all the drawbacks of a typical mobile game for... One chapter. One freaking chapter. Such price for at least 1\7th of full possible story. You know, I'm a big DX fan, Square Enix. This is a huge disappointment, and not even gameplay-wise - I was OK with all the bad stuff you implemented by making this game a phone app. All I asked for was a story. I never asked for this.			"

												This an admirable game. Yes, it has it's flaws, but it was not originally meant for PC. Ports are not easy to revamp for other systems, especially for side projects. This game has a great story, has all the features from the original game, and is a great experience. You cannot jump, or remap buttons, but that's not a big deal. The only problem I had was scrolling through the weapons list with my mouse wheel, but that's really it. The graphics are not up to date. This is a great buy at any price you buy it at. The only thing that bugs me is that it is half a story, and the dlc is no where in sight.3/5. I reccomend for all Deus Ex fans.			"

												Ignore the metascore.  This game is no 46.  It is no 80, either, though.The biggest issue with The Fall is that it is a bad port, not necessarily a bad GAME.  You have no options to customise controls, menu clicking is annoyingly unresponsive, and leaving cover will sometimes go back to first person looking up at the sky for no reason as a default as a few gameplay flaws which were not issues on mobile.  Issues one and two did not exist because of the nature of touchscreens, and issue three never happened to me on mobile, either.  This game was not designed with PC in mind, and being hastily ported to it during Square-Enix's ♥♥♥♥♥torm politics and restructuring which began in 2012 and persists to this day was just a cash grab when it should have been delayed until it played like Deus Ex:  Human Revolution when on PC.With that being said, ten years ago this game would have been called by many players as fantastic because games were more mediocre in general (please do not bother to name rare, specific games from that era which you like as a retort since it probably not represent the shovelware climate).  In 2014, however, better quality overall is increasingly demanded by players when back then gamers were not as vocal as a whole--thank both the Internet and gaming becoming far more mainstream since the early 2000s in the west--and this is just NOT a great game by today's standards.It is, however, a definitive DE:HR sidestory experience, and it is very good in that right.  It looks, sounds, and feels like a gaiden of DE:HR and the story is great.  If you really enjoyed DE:HR or the DE series since the first like I did what with this being my favourite game series, you WILL enjoy this for about 10 or so hours.  Then, it ends, because SE decided to make it episodic content where it can charge you piecemeal for subsequent chapters.  The caveat to its piecemeal design is because the game's reception was so poor, I am largely certain that no new chapters will ever be released.  If they are, it will be more hurried content with much cut for time and budget constraints, à la the Xenosaga trilogy.The problem is not the game as much as it is how SE handled it, although the game does have its problems.  This review is simply to state that it is NOT deserving of the low 46 metascore just as sooooo many 90+ games are not even close to as deserving those high numbers...this is something that you can blame on the pay-for-scores game ""journalism"" paradigm of today.  Buy it on sale for $5 or less; this game sat on my Steam wishlist from its PC release date until it was $5, and I cannot recommend paying more for it even though I DO recommend playing it if you enjoy DE games.Oh, and for god's sake, if the PS2-era character models for this mobile game is the defining flaw in what makes this a ""bad"" game to you, you have no business critiquing any game whatsoever, let alone attempting to appreciate the DE series' level of depth and subtext beneath what are not-awful visuals.

												This was a nice game that certainly shows promise, the acting is a little bit..erm...""B""...grade, but if you look past it, the storyline is definately there. This game is too short and leaves a massive cliff hanger at the ""end"" telling you there will be more to come (when, what, why???). follows the Human revolution skill tree style for your augmentations, but seems limited in comparison. this may only be because of the length of the game (its a $10 or less game). If your looking for a taste of the Deus Ex franchise this game is certainly a nice but subtle taste of the world. You will find the morals and ethics of Augmentation described very well, with more insight into the ""human"" aspect of augmentation.I would like to rave on about how this would give insight into what the future could be like, but there is just not enough meat on the bone of this game (not like Human Revolution) but with some more ""episodes"" this should turn out well. The combat is okay, but slams it home that regardless of your Characters ""skills"" and background, going in guns blazing is almost never a good idea, you can manage fairly well if you have cover and the right gun, but stealth and non-lethal measure seem to be the key to getting things done. You aim is terrible until you get the Augmentation for both aim and recoil, but upping your cloke and silent running seems to be more effective, and as long as you have the energy, a takedown is more effective anyway. I will not harp on too much more, as the rest can be decided by yourself. I do recommend this game, but take it with an open mind and do not expect AAA game dev, but this is a nice little look into the world of Deus Ex as it currently stands.6/10			"

												Expanding the in game universe of Human Revolution, this had the potential to be a good game. However the controls can't be edited to your liking, which is a real nuisance if you had recently played HR as it is a port from a touch screen game, some of the controls don't match HR's controls. The game cuts off at a cliff hanger where there is no indication that more will be released, if they do hopefully it'll be free to people who have purchased the game instead of making you for each part of the story. People who are fans of the series might enjoy the game but I only purchased as it came with the original Deus Ex on pre-order and didn't have the game on steam.			"

												Remember how cool the other Deus Ex games were? Dont expect that for this one. They did improove a few things Human Revolution had. First of all you can buy Any weapon or item you want and at any time. They added a hop over obsticle action when you hid behind things (however it doesnt always work and they removed the ability to jump.) However a lot of things are screwed up compared to the last game. The game models look so mechanical. Many of the characters you meet have a dead glassy stare and their bodys sometimes have badly textured looks compared to the first game. The hacking challenge is messed up. I hacked a level 5 panel without setting off anything. I hacked a level three and set it off every time. The AI is terrible and the fact bodies evaporate 5 seconds after they are knocked out or dead robs you of a little challenge in the game. The enviroments are either really nice or really bad and they use most of the old music from the last game so it feels less original. they have also got a Game chapter that Walking dead and Wolf among us has going. Ultimately this is a fun game to play for the story, not as a deus ex game. Buy it on sale but if your paying full price your going to regret it.			"

												good god what a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port. the keyboard and gamepad configuration was in no way the standard so upon starting the game, there was about 20 seconds worth of trying to figure out which key and button on the gamepad to go through the menu alone. Then when having difficulty with the controls layout during gameplay, it was very sad and there was ALWAYS[and i mean AAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYSSSSSSSSS] the annoying tutorials as how to do literally everything. When having to sneak around the first turret in the game, they literally had a short in-game cutscene where the camera moved where you should go to sneak around the turret rather than let you use your own damn brain to come to that conclusion, another one is that when it comes to new weapons like grenades or the possible use of a new augment, you are not allowed to move unless you go through the tutorial AND it pretty much forces you to purchase whatever it is that it wants you to buy ugh, graphics suck [granted, it was poorly ported from the mobile platform so no real surprise], dialogue is poor, even the AI is extremely crappy! You have to almost unload on an enemy with your rifle at a range of less than 5 meters just to kill them, and their patrol paths are extremely basic and so predictable that you might even feel that you're just too good for this game that would be difficult only to a newborn.Oh and one thing to make note about the graphics.... while I did say that they are crappy and thats to be given since its ported from the mobile platform, the recommended specs are a complete joke. a quad core with a gtx 500 series? seriously? My laptop with an i7-4810mq and SLI 880m's with everything maxed out had the fps at 700+, now I HIGHLY doubt to run this game at a minimum of 60fps, would you even need a gtx 500 series graphics card! A hyperthreaded single core pentium 4 with a geforce 8800 series probably could do the job! [haha]So, poor AI, crappy control layout for both keyboard/mouse and gamepad, poor dialogue, overqualified hardware specs, and very annoying tutorials make this a terrible terrible game that is not worth the purchase even if they gave you money.

												Such a disappointing game. I wanted to like this game.  I really did.  The Deus Ex series usually delivers. The characters were flat and the voice acting charicaturized. The game was glitchy as all getout and a constant source of frustration. The game mechanics however were laughably simple, and there was no sense of challenge to the game. One could breeze through the entire game with little adaptation or ingenuity. The plot seemed pretty railroaded too.  This is quite possibly one of the worst modern computer games I've ever played. Never buy this game at full price. In fact, don't buy it all unless you really like Deus Ex or you love to complain.Also, as of Oct. 3, 2014, this game refuses to load past Downloading Assets... 0%.Not a functional game.			"

												I hate to have to say it, but I agree with most of the reviews and the meta score on this one. Being a huge fan of the Deus Ex game series, especially Human Revolution, I was underwhelmed when I started and completed this game. Upon purchase I saw that the game had terrible reviews and scores however since it was on sale, I decided to buy it and play it without prejudice. With that said I was extremely disappointed and I will explain why. At this stage of the game, patches have clearly fixed many of the problems that people have talked about. I had no issue with bugs in the short duration the game lasted. That if course is always a good thing.Obviously coming from playing Human Revolution, I had high expectations for this game on many levels. Upon entering the start up screen, I immediately went into check graphics settings and control settings. The options were poor to say the least. I was able to change anistrophic filtering and that was about it. There really was no other say when it came to the graphics of the game. On that note, the graphics were not that big of an issue for me. I was pleased with them. Although not as good as Human Revolution, it was perfectly fine for its purposes. Once starting the game I was interested by the story. I like were the story picked up from and how a good amount of the information could be found from in game play. Just like Human Revolution your Augs can greatly help you evaluate conversations. Unfortunately there were not many coversations to be had. Even for the short duration, there are only three or four side missions that you come across without trying extremely hard. The missions are easy and just simply involve a lot of travel between the few small levels of the small map. That is my next issue. Travel in this game is boring! There are only five or six trully distinct locations that you must travel to in order to complete the game. An hour into the game, I felt like I was just going back and forth constantly and I was already bored enough to put the game down. The duration of the game however is my ultimate issue. Not having read any of the comments for this game, i really was expecting another full on Deus Ex game. By the game description and the story that starts to unfold, you would expect so much more, rather than a To Be Continued. I love Deus Ex to the point where I search every single room, air duct and storage unit. Even thouroughly searching through the game, It only took me four hours to complete. i was just messing around looking around and only took that long! Overall the Deus Ex series is amazing but this game, at this point at least, is honestly not worth it. I was extremely disappointed that I bothered with it. The only real reason to have it is to say you at least own every game in the series. Thats all it's really good for. If you do choose to buy this game, do not get your hopes up and set any expectations you have extremely low. I really don't enjoy having to right a poor review for a game especially such as this series, but such a horrible game warrants such a review. Best of luck to anyone who does decide to play. At least you can play the game again with all your current augs and purchases but on an increased difficulty.			"

												Unfortunately, a tiny game combined with many niggling issues - like level backgrounds disappearing during a takedown sequence, enemies not registering shots, and an awful interface that takes too many clicks to do anything - means that I cannot recommend this game.			"

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!I only got this because I love the DX series and wanted to play it for the story (bad) and to see how close to other DX games it is (not at all).			"

On my pc most of the time there is no sound. combat sound is off and on during battle. original deus ex game ran fine. jumping is disabled, the vault sometimes works. very choppy!! I like the gun and ammo selection screen. your gun is not sighted in, take's a while to adjust. talking to npc sometimes does nothing. this is running on a intel I-7 pc. hope this helps.			"

												I recommend it with some conditions. It's not a very good game, but I still found enough fun to be worth my time. If you consider this a higher quality fan mod (which is about the level of quality to expect here, not that it is an actual fan mod), there is some fun to be had here. Obviously, expecting this to be comparable to Human Revolutions or even the original Deus Ex will only result in dissapointment. VOICE ACTINGThe voice acting is pretty bad, but a lot better than I've seen from some fan mods that have tried to do voice acting.  The dialogue options are extremely limited, with very few opportunities for it to make a difference.STORYIt's ok and it keeps the pace going. GAMEPLAYA lot of areas are streamlined, probably primarily to do it being originally a mobile game. No jumping, which I disliked, but I can see why one might cut that here. It gives the designers a lot more control over where a player can go in the game without having to design additional ways to block player movement to account for jumping. This also focuses the type of gameplay they are offering, allowing multiple ways through environments. STEALTHI liked that full stealth options were available, as well as guns ablazing. HACKINGMuch easier than in Human Revolutions, but plenty of things to hack and a few good opportunities to turn robots and turrets against your enemies. GOODSI noticed a ton of weapons available for purchase... though I never bought any. The store might be too easy to access, but it gave a lot more options than typically can be found. Everything is probably too plentiful in the game. LEVELINGLeveling up was really quick, which was good since the game was short.ONE SAVE + BUGSI hate single save options. Just make sure when you save, nothing screwy is happening, though I found only a couple bugs during my playthrough.FINAL THOUGHTSIf anything, the game is too easy, but I still found it fun and I'm interested in seeing where things might go next, if they still planned on making another one. It's a nice diversion, as long as you don't expect much from it. Buy it on sale, if interested, and you should be good.			"

												Started poorly when I noticed the More Content talked about how I should stay tuned because more is on its way!!! Of course with no additional content having been released in over a year, one can only assume it's never coming - which seems to indicate that even the publisher sees it as a lost cause.I got the game as part of some bundle, so luckily I didn't pay full price. I put off playing it until just recently, and now I'll be uninstalling and shelving it in my library.I know it was a port and I've played a few other mobile to PC ports. What I found though was something that just wasn't enjoyable.Deus Ex: The Fall is the ""Highlander 2"" of the Deus Ex franchise. It may have been okay on its own, but as part of the larger franchise, it's disappointing.			"

												I'll save you the effort of playing this.... just go to YouTube and watch ""If Quake was done today"", because it's like the developers of this game watched the first 3/4 of that video and said ""I want to make THAT!"".Any review isn't complete without mentioning the completely toxic and mandatory tutorial system.  It CONSTANTLY pops up with flow breaking (mostly unskippable) message boxes... Yes, I know how to look around with a mouse... yes, I know how WSAD works.... yes I know how crouch works... yes, I know that it's a beer.  Most games would give you a little tooltip saying ""Press CTRL to crouch"", but this game holds your hand like you're completely new to the concept of thinking.  If that wasn't bad enough, each time it pops up, it's a bloody paragraph, and having it force read to you by 'Microsoft Sam: The Next Generation'.			"

												This is a seriously dumbed-down version of the ""Deus ex experience"" in every aspect: gameplay, maps, characters, shop system, controls, 4-dummy-tutorials... - and even story and dialogue are mostly not very inspired, but not entirely uninteresting either...However, it gets better after the tutorial-heavy intro and, for me, it turned out to be much better than expected after all the negative reviews. Design and music are ok at least and produce a good Deus ex feeling despite all the flaws of the game. Recommended if you want more Deus ex atmosphere and dont mind everything being dumbed-down quite a bit. In other words: keep your expectations in check and dont hope for it being DX: HR2. Also, get it on sale, not for the full price...EDIT: I cannot recommend this game anymore - even on sale - after playing through it, since it is really very very very short... the normal price is a joke.

												You can visit a strip club, go on the stage with the girls and steal the money people threw there. 10/10 would play againPeople leave their money on the ground or even throw it into garbage cans. Curse you, inflation!Women's restrooms have urinals inside. I wonder what kind of augmentations those girls have.Sometimes this game was very weird. Then again, it was much better then I had expected.It feels like an addon for Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Of course it doesn't reach its quality but you have the same skills, the same weapons, the same ways of approaching your goals.Basically, it's the same gameplay.There are few things I don't like about the game. First, you can't jump. Benches are your worst enemies. Second, it's way too easy. More difficulty levels would have been nice. Last but not least, it's very short. Finishing the game took me no more than 3 hours. I don't want to spoil anything except one sentence: ""To be continued.""I don't understand where all those bad reviews come from. ""Bad graphics""? Seriously, what do you expect? It's a PC port of an iOS-game. ""Bad gameplay""? It's more or less exactly the gameplay of Human Revolution. ""Bad story""? It's good enough to keep me playing the game for 3 hours.If you like Deus Ex: Human Revolution and you can't get enough, take a look at The Fall. You can't expect the same quality, but if you can get it for little money it will be worth playing. I am definitely going to play it again because I want to try a different playing style and because I want to get all the achievements and side quests I missed during my first playthrough.			"

												Gentlemen, the secret passage is in the ladies' lavatory.So I played the game through, and just when it was about to get interesting, there was a TO BE CONTINUED.  Bear in mind that it took 5.8 hours to get interesting (I'm pretty sure at least one of those hours was preparing a soup from scratch and then eating it).  I expect the TO BE CONTINUED will be another equal waste of cash.So the gameplay is largely the same as Deus Ex, except you start with the Icarus Wings falling system.  Not that there are any heights to fall from, so that's useless.  There's no jump button, so anything you're looking for -- such air vents (!) -- is at floor level.  The ""numerous"" side-quests the overview boasts is about 5.  The levels are claustrophobic and tiny, which I understand to be a hold-over from being a mobile game.  You get just enough cash through the game to buy maybe one of the ""bundles"" (!), or one of the advanced weapons, just before the game is over.  There don't appear to be many meaningful decisions to make with dialogs, in-game choices, in the way that other games in the series have.  The story *could* be interesting, but it isn't yet.In short, this game is a Deus Ex game, but with far less Deus Ex than a Deus Ex game should have.  It's a thorough ""meh.""  As such, even though it provided a vaguely entertaining Sunday afternoon, I can't really recommend it.			"

												When playing this one must acknowledge the fact that this is a mobile port. Of course the graphics, level design, AI, crowd dynamics, mission variety, combat mechanics, etc. are all subpar compared to Human Evolution, but if you are a fan of the Deus Ex lore and storytelling, The Fall should provide some, albeit short, entertainment. Hell if this game is named The Fall Episode 1 then people will realize why it's so short. It's essentially just one level of a large game.I personally would like to see how the story goes. This has the potential to become an interesting sidestory in the Deus Ex universe.			"

												Oh, boy, this game.Upon completion of this game after roughly 7 hours and watching a very scathing review by TotalBiscuit, I have some thoughts. This game, unlike many iOS franchise ports, is very true to Deus Ex (and it better be, if it's canon). Now, I'm not a fanboy of the series (yet), after putting a good deal of time into both Human Revolution and the original Deus Ex, I'd say this upholds the atmosphere and mechanics very well.The game has a NewGame+ mode, a necessity for its expensive weapon upgrades and miniscule size. Again, judging it on the basis of an iOS game, it is a GREAT game. However, as TotalBiscuit pointed out, it's not an iOS game anymore - it's on PC, and we need to rate it like that.I know I'll get a lot of ire for saying this, but the gameplay is very alike to Half-Life; open spaces and cramped corridors and a huge sandbox for tackling such spaces. The augmentations in the game provide the most variability in encounters. And that's where it gets admittedly strange. The augmentations (20 in total) are super easy to get. In HR, it takes a metric ton of experience to unlock a point, and finding one in the levels were few and far between, and were ludicrously expensive to get in stores. But The Fall doesn't have lengthy campaign levels to trek through and rank XP, and most oddly, there are no stores in Fall - your pause menu is your store. This really does seem like laziness on the developer end and feels cheaty - it's basically a currency-based devmode, and I assume this is where the iOS version made use of microtransactions, which are thankfully absent from the PC. A basic shotgun can put you back a couple thousand credits (and you usually pick up credits in the world in valus around 30), but an augment that lets you punch through walls is a mere 20 headshots away, and the of the few levels present, I'd say about 80% of them have a praxis kit in them somewhere.Where we depart from Half-Life are the RPG mechanics. Conversations here are lackluster, though voice acting on actual characters is well done (on the random NPCs it is just terrible) very little information other than necessary to the plot is given, and don't really require investment to understand. The conversation augment makes this basically null and void, allowing you to just press a button to automatically give you everything you need to complete a quest. HR's version of the same augment still required you to pay attention to on-screen cues and dialogue from the character you're speaking with, the augment just nudges you in the right direction when the clues get too subtle.Onto the thing that made TotalBiscuit destroy this game; the controls are horrible. Seriously, very little effort seemed to be put into making this a good PC port. Controls cannot be re-assigned, their given slots are awkward and not reflexive in any way. TotalBiscuit complained about his mouse acting up and keys being ignored at random, and he criticized the ""recoil"" system of zooming out every time you fire. I found the key: xbox controller! The controls for the 360 link work perfectly. I had no problems with button presses or controls, though there was still no button reassigning and it insisted on using X for ""enter"" instead of A.Combat is also affected by its iOS roots. I think most gamers are used to cover based combat like Mass Effect, where you click into cover, peek out, and fire, all separate motions. In The Fall, firstly, you hold the cover button (like you do in HR as well), which can get a little wonky where the game can't tell if you want to shimmy backwards or turn around. Though annoying, it's easily fixed by simply dropping out of cover and going again - it's annoying, but not as punishing compared to doing the same thing in Mass Effect. Once in cover, you aim and fire a bullet. That isn't two steps, it's one. You sortof have to aim from cover (which changes when you physically move out to shoot), then press the fire button. You end up with a very snappy pointshootcover dynamic, but it's disorienting if you're not expecting it. Basically, there was no reason for me to bother with anything else than the pistol, especially once I had a laser sight, because I would be only squeezing off a round at a time anyways, and worse came to worse, I could cover the classic way and just crouch behind chest-high walls, peeking around a corner manually.It's by no means a difficult game. This is good because it has a horrible property of only having one save slot, which autosaves every time you enter a new area. One the bright side, your quicksave key makes an actual save, so you don't have to sit through a saving wheel. However, you have to be a lot more careful with what you do, because you only have one save to fall back on.Getting nitpicky, there's no real difference between lethal and nonlethal combat. Whether you KO them or kill them, the body evaporates after a second or so on the ground, leaving a gun and a wallet behind. In HR, there was an actual choice between the two, because a KO'd enemy can be woken up over time or by a conscious goon. In Fall, you only have to choose between a wider variety of weapons to kill with, or a quieter takedown.PROS-+It's a neat story, true to the Deus Ex universe+an interesting graphic style (I'm running on Intel graphics, guys, I'm not big on the graphics, but it looks cool and runs smoothly)+entertaining gameplay+NewGame+ solves many of its currency shenangans, allows you to enjoy the sandbox moreCONS--you NEED a 360 controller to play it, and no key reassigning to fix this-awkward currency choices an implementation-Microscopic campaign, under 10 side quests-Not a challenge by any stretch of the imaginationIf you want a snappy shooter you can blow through in a day and be a cyborg in, or if you are a fan of thre Deus Ex franchise, this is a good game worthy of the time. That being said, the pricetag is way too high for a tiny game with not really much replay value. It could be better, but it didn't measure up to the horror stories. If you're going to get it, get it on sale and keep an open mind, and I'd bet you'll have fun with it.			"

												I'm not sure why this game has such a bad reputation. For an iOS port the graphics aren't abysmal,  which was one knock I kept seeing throughout reviews. People have complained of ""unresponsive controls;"" this is only the case in menus where you're not in a time crunch and simply have to click a second time for it to work...not a big deal.  The gameplay was fun, coming from somebody that has played the entire Deus Ex franchise from beginning to end. For $9.99 I've been very satisfied with the game so far (I got it for $4.99 on sale so even better). The only real thing I didn't like was the voice acting felt very subpar but I worry about gameplay not voice acting.tl;dr: get this game on sale if you're skeptical and you'll get your money's worth.  The ""issues"" aren't really that big of a deal and its a good Deus Ex game at its core.Overall I'd give it a 7/10.			"

												While going through the tutorial I really felt like this was a god aweful game... but only until I finished the tutorial and got into the actual game.I have played Deus Ex: Human Revolution so I knew what to expect and had high expectations, even though I knew this was a port of a mobile game. While it isn't as realized or complex as Human Revolution, I had fun the 5-6 hours it took me to get through it.While there are no micro transactions in the PC version of the game, you can still feel how the item shop was designed to give people the opportunity to spend real money on the game whenever they found themselves in a sticky situation - you can buy anything, ANYTHING that is available in the game on the fly, but it costs in-game currency in the PC port so you obviously can't be loaded with gear from the get-go.I give Deus Ex: The Fall 6/10 and I find the 2 Euro I spent on it was worth it (got it at reduced price - I probably won't recommend it at its full price).

												This 'game' is truly a fall from grace for this franchise. Human revolution was a visual thrill ride, a game i repeatedly completed in various manners. Yet this mobile port really hurts the Deus Ex timeline. The controls are lacking, the story is hard to get into and the graphics are below average. I might be comparing this to its Human Revolution counterpart but what other benchmark am I meant to compare it to when it is from the same story line.This came with the Deus Ex directors cut bundle. Truthfully... I'm not happy its even in my library. I want to 100% this game, but I cannot bring myself to play it 1 second longer.			"

												If you loved to play Deus Ex: Human Revolution, you will like The Fall. New main characters with new stories, which a little bit linking with somebodies we know from Human Revolution. But mainly the game style is the same - go there, find this, help him to receive that... And, of course, you can choose the way, how to solve problem - talking way or stealth way or fighting way or mix of all:)What is different - a little bit strange, that main character cant jump - it walks, talks, hides, crouches, but don't jump... Strange. Why???One more thing - if previously there was special characters and places for buying things (like, guns, mods etc), now you can do it in your inventory - just need credits. For me this is also a strange solution...And third thing - The Fall is too short. Maybe, only for me...? :)In few words - definitely suggesting - good choice for good price :)			"

Be in no hurry...get your man(s)..even without useing fancy augs!used no augs in whole game (on medium toughness) and came out smelling like a Red Rosa. Off to aussie land.Where the heck is the next installment, says I. Left me hanging...off to australia and ""that's it?""If you must have all Deus Ex progs. by all means get this one. Be forwarned though, not up to par even with the older games out there.Anyone know if there's a 'next'; 'to be continued' episode to this game????? "

												This is a straight port from the game designed for iOS. It is not a ""remaster"", nor does it claim to be. It is not a badly done port of that game, but anyone expecting a full-featured PC game is going to be unhappy with this. A lot of functionality from Deus Ex: Human Revolution isn't present in this game, and the graphics were obviously meant for a smaller screen. I did not play enough to comment on the story, apart from to say that the beginning is formulaic, and non-compelling. What voice acting I heard was noticably more robotic and self-conscious than the acting in Human Revolution. Oddly enough this is what sealed it for me. I expected the game mechanics and graphics to be less impressive than those of Human Revolution, but I expected the story and voice acting to make up for it. I didn't give it much of a chance, only playing for about 30 minutes, but the game didn't really put it's best foot forward, even with my lowered expectations.			"

												This an admirable game. Yes, it has it's flaws, but it was not originally meant for PC. Ports are not easy to revamp for other systems, especially for side projects. This game has a great story, has all the features from the original game, and is a great experience. You cannot jump, or remap buttons, but that's not a big deal. The only problem I had was scrolling through the weapons list with my mouse wheel, but that's really it. The graphics are not up to date. This is a great buy at any price you buy it at. The only thing that bugs me is that it is half a story, and the dlc is no where in sight.3/5. I reccomend for all Deus Ex fans.			"

												Voice acting was lacking, Facial animation was lacking.Controls are easy to get the hang of for both controllers and KB&M unless you suffer from some type of mental illness. Graphics are surprisingly decent, Plays just like Deus Ex HR. In my opinion has a well written captivating story(I beat it in a little over 4hrs, not killing anyone), It left me wanting more. But I doubt that monteral is going to be coming out with any more content for this game considering user reception(I seriously don't know what else people expected from a mobile port, people judge this game way to harshly). Is it a good port? Yes. Overall. Would I recomend this game to someone who is not a major fan of deus ex at its original price? No. Would I recommend it if it was on sale? Absolutely.A very generous 6.5/10			"

												this game feels like it was developed for a mobile device/tablet. the graphics are distinctly last generation (reminds me of invisible war...which actually gave the game  a nostalgic feel ) the gamepad controls are unaleterable (which is not cool) and it is very short. (i beat it in 5 hours). that being said it is obviously ment to be part of a series of dlc games which never happened. Stor y wise its pretty compelling, and the combat/hacking/gameplay etc, is actually enteretaining. that being said it has little to no replay value. if your looking for a short and quick cyberpunk game, and dont mind last generation graphics, this is the game for you.

												This is not what I was expecting; it is a mobile game ported to PC.  ""Controller support"" means ONLY Microsoft X-Box 360 controllers, not even Microsoft certified controllers, so my Razer Sabertooth doesn't work, at all.  (It is a third party 360 controller.  I have never had compatibility issues before.)If the obvious needs to be pointed out, because this was a mobile game before they sloppily ported it to PC with minimal graphics and controller options (no rebinding keys, terrible controller support), it looks and sounds dated.Not happy with this purchase; hopefully it will be patched so that I can play it with my controller.

The buttons are slow on the uptake when you press buttons corresponding to what is needed. And movement is slow as well, from the start.I have played other games, and never have any problems with these sort of issues with those games, even after changing the settings in options.In hacking a keypad, before you even get to hack, it takes at least 5 presses of the button 'E' for it to do anything. Graphics the same as previous title, but still superb. The movement and action keys lack response when pressing the buttons you need to progress and use items.And what makes matters worse? The fact the game is so short, my hair looks long!!!			"

												I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this game. It certainly isn't even worth the money I paid for it! Now, where to begin....the graphics are horrid, and the dialogue is only slightly better. The fact that I can't jump is really frustrating as it took me a few minutes to figure out how to get over a low wall. Also, the game forces you to put a silencer on a combat rifle, which is horrid in itself. I'm much more of a pistol person myself, so it was extremely frustrating to be forced to use the combat rifle to stay at least somewhat hidden. However, the worst part of it all is that the silencer doesn't even work - the enemies responded the same!The controls themselves are extremely confusing. Instead of using the numbers to change weapons like pretty much every other game in the world does, you're stuck holding down buttons on the keyboard and then scrolling through the options. If you want to change a weapon quickly in battle, tough luck.Also, for some reason, I can't get headshots, even though I have no trouble getting them in DX:HR. It's frustrating to use up so much ammo on such a simple guard. Granted, there is an in-game store to replenish you ammo, but I feel that really doesn't fit - after all, there's no challenge if you can pull up the store in the middle of a fight and buy a grenade.Anyway, save your money. Buy Deus Ex: Human Revolution instead.			"

												Deus ex the fall destroys anything than made deus ex human revolution great, invisible walls, boring storyline, dull voice acting, a campaign than lasts 2-3 hours at most and they have the audacity of leaving a cliffhanger ending saying this is just part 1 they even charge a total of 10$ for a ios port game, i highly doubt they will ever make the sequel so don't bother buying the game at full price, nor during discounts, if you really want to play this wait for a  bundle, it has been already been in one.The graphics and animations are notably worse than the previous human revolution even though this game came out after.There's a obviously intended micro transaction system where you can buy stuff like 10 praxis kits for 10k bundle, in the pc version you don't have to pay a dime but they didn't fix the prices either.The story is about Ben Saxon an ex soldier who's squad been wiped and got recruited into the tyrants, he's probably the most gullible hero ever in a sci fi game, trying to expose the tyrants.Even tho this game is a prequel there's no relation to the human revolution at all except the tyrants, and only two of them are voiced, but one of the only barely says 2 lines in the entire game.

I'll echo TotalBiscuit's thoughts that they should definitely have used the HR engine for this. But they just couldn't be arsed.The potential in the story and characters, at least for me, comes from the fact we're not dealing with a 'chosen one' protagonist such as JC or Jensen, it's a rather fresh take on the universe and it's why I enjoyed the prequel novel, ""Icarus Effect"", as well.Oh well, I'd only recommend playing this if you're a hardcore DX Universe fan and want to go through everything that's available.

												Way too short.  If you skip the dialogue, you could probably plow through the game in about an hour.  Animations look like a tablet game from four years ago.Dialogue is poorly written and all the voice actors except the lead are terrible (and borderline offensive).  Is clearly supposed to be Episode 1 of several, but the story just ends when you leave Panama.The AI is terrible, and guards don't notice anything other you walking across their field of vision or dead bodies (which disappear after about five seconds anyway).I got it for $2.50, and I'm not sure I got my money's worth.  The story seemed like it might have potential, but we ends before we even really find out what's going on beyond, ""corps are greedy and mercs are bad"".  If they ever release the rest of the game, I might pick it back up just in case the story becomes interesting.  Until then, don't bother.			"

												This game is basically a demo. You get a ""To be continued"" after you finish the first hub area and that's it. Nothing is resolved in any way. I suggest waiting until the rest of it gets released, if that will ever happen.I think that this is enough of a reason not to get it, but I should probably mention that it has watered down graphics and gameplay because it's a port of an iOS game, doesn't allow you to remap your keys.The plot seemed to have some potential but the game was over before it could take off.

												They pushed an update August 1, 2014 that corrected many issues. I'll change my rating to a 'thumbs up' but do notice that it took them that long to make the patch. My original review is below. 


Announcement: Deus Ex The Fall Patch 1.0.1 Update 
Deus Ex: The Fall, Aug 1, 2014

			Hey folks, Firstly, thanks for all your constructive feedback. I’d also like to thank you all for your patience. I know it’s been a while since release, but we’ve been working hard in implementing...		


==================While I like this game for it's low budget cyberpunk feel, I can't honestly recommend it until they correct some issues.- The audio is broken on surround sound systems. Set your audio device to stereo to fix that problem.- Sometimes there is a slow-down that is apparently due to memory management.- The game environment sometimes disappears and you just see the background image.- I've teleported places after jumping over objects or climbing ladders.Last time I was teleported into a wall, I got the bright idea to save the game and reload... nope, still stuck in a wall.You have one save slot so my game is ruined unless maybe I find a trainer that will let me no-clip out.It's not a terrible game (I'm easy to please) because I like the feel of it and it has some story info that supports Human Revolution, but it is a poor port and due to the issues this game has I don't recommend buying it unless you pay less than $1.UPDATE 1:I started a new game, it played fine, and I completed it. The only change I made was that I set my video card (GTX 780) to adaptive power management (NVIDIA CP, 3D settings). Not sure if that mattered, but that was the only change; no more teleporting. The game is still a buggy mess but I enjoyed the story. I actually liked the audio but it's too bad that it doesn't work in surround mode.I won't change my recommendation because the game needs work.UPDATE 2:Getting all achievements in this game is fairly easy so I played through a total of 2.5 times to get the achievements. On my second playthrough I got stuck in a wall again; actually I was just stuck against a wall, I guess. Same way, climbed a ladder or maybe I tried to move a heavy box.I found that by using the Stealth Dash that you could then move around. Stealth Dash yourself to the nearest ladder and climb it, this will let you freely move again but some things may still be broken (I couldn't open a grate or move some boxes). Use a trainer if you don't have the resources to buy Stealth Dash but be careful that the trainer doesn't load you up with money/praxis kits and ruin any challenge.			"

												This was a nice game that certainly shows promise, the acting is a little bit..erm...""B""...grade, but if you look past it, the storyline is definately there. This game is too short and leaves a massive cliff hanger at the ""end"" telling you there will be more to come (when, what, why???). follows the Human revolution skill tree style for your augmentations, but seems limited in comparison. this may only be because of the length of the game (its a $10 or less game). If your looking for a taste of the Deus Ex franchise this game is certainly a nice but subtle taste of the world. You will find the morals and ethics of Augmentation described very well, with more insight into the ""human"" aspect of augmentation.I would like to rave on about how this would give insight into what the future could be like, but there is just not enough meat on the bone of this game (not like Human Revolution) but with some more ""episodes"" this should turn out well. The combat is okay, but slams it home that regardless of your Characters ""skills"" and background, going in guns blazing is almost never a good idea, you can manage fairly well if you have cover and the right gun, but stealth and non-lethal measure seem to be the key to getting things done. You aim is terrible until you get the Augmentation for both aim and recoil, but upping your cloke and silent running seems to be more effective, and as long as you have the energy, a takedown is more effective anyway. I will not harp on too much more, as the rest can be decided by yourself. I do recommend this game, but take it with an open mind and do not expect AAA game dev, but this is a nice little look into the world of Deus Ex as it currently stands.6/10			"

												Just incredibly free in the tactical sense, perfect atmospheric and absorbing plot, it is just like Human Revolution, but shorter, with lower graphics and gameplay. As every iOS game imported to PC, its controlls are unchangable, but pretty similar to the rest of PC games, although a bit anoying.Not a specially good game since it is released after Human Revolution. If you liked it (much), and played its expansion The Missing Link, you should play this game (expect low quality adaptation to PC).Stay sick.			"

												good god what a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port. the keyboard and gamepad configuration was in no way the standard so upon starting the game, there was about 20 seconds worth of trying to figure out which key and button on the gamepad to go through the menu alone. Then when having difficulty with the controls layout during gameplay, it was very sad and there was ALWAYS[and i mean AAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYSSSSSSSSS] the annoying tutorials as how to do literally everything. When having to sneak around the first turret in the game, they literally had a short in-game cutscene where the camera moved where you should go to sneak around the turret rather than let you use your own damn brain to come to that conclusion, another one is that when it comes to new weapons like grenades or the possible use of a new augment, you are not allowed to move unless you go through the tutorial AND it pretty much forces you to purchase whatever it is that it wants you to buy ugh, graphics suck [granted, it was poorly ported from the mobile platform so no real surprise], dialogue is poor, even the AI is extremely crappy! You have to almost unload on an enemy with your rifle at a range of less than 5 meters just to kill them, and their patrol paths are extremely basic and so predictable that you might even feel that you're just too good for this game that would be difficult only to a newborn.Oh and one thing to make note about the graphics.... while I did say that they are crappy and thats to be given since its ported from the mobile platform, the recommended specs are a complete joke. a quad core with a gtx 500 series? seriously? My laptop with an i7-4810mq and SLI 880m's with everything maxed out had the fps at 700+, now I HIGHLY doubt to run this game at a minimum of 60fps, would you even need a gtx 500 series graphics card! A hyperthreaded single core pentium 4 with a geforce 8800 series probably could do the job! [haha]So, poor AI, crappy control layout for both keyboard/mouse and gamepad, poor dialogue, overqualified hardware specs, and very annoying tutorials make this a terrible terrible game that is not worth the purchase even if they gave you money.

												Gentlemen, the secret passage is in the ladies' lavatory.So I played the game through, and just when it was about to get interesting, there was a TO BE CONTINUED.  Bear in mind that it took 5.8 hours to get interesting (I'm pretty sure at least one of those hours was preparing a soup from scratch and then eating it).  I expect the TO BE CONTINUED will be another equal waste of cash.So the gameplay is largely the same as Deus Ex, except you start with the Icarus Wings falling system.  Not that there are any heights to fall from, so that's useless.  There's no jump button, so anything you're looking for -- such air vents (!) -- is at floor level.  The ""numerous"" side-quests the overview boasts is about 5.  The levels are claustrophobic and tiny, which I understand to be a hold-over from being a mobile game.  You get just enough cash through the game to buy maybe one of the ""bundles"" (!), or one of the advanced weapons, just before the game is over.  There don't appear to be many meaningful decisions to make with dialogs, in-game choices, in the way that other games in the series have.  The story *could* be interesting, but it isn't yet.In short, this game is a Deus Ex game, but with far less Deus Ex than a Deus Ex game should have.  It's a thorough ""meh.""  As such, even though it provided a vaguely entertaining Sunday afternoon, I can't really recommend it.			"

												Expanding the in game universe of Human Revolution, this had the potential to be a good game. However the controls can't be edited to your liking, which is a real nuisance if you had recently played HR as it is a port from a touch screen game, some of the controls don't match HR's controls. The game cuts off at a cliff hanger where there is no indication that more will be released, if they do hopefully it'll be free to people who have purchased the game instead of making you for each part of the story. People who are fans of the series might enjoy the game but I only purchased as it came with the original Deus Ex on pre-order and didn't have the game on steam.			"

												Ignore the metascore.  This game is no 46.  It is no 80, either, though.The biggest issue with The Fall is that it is a bad port, not necessarily a bad GAME.  You have no options to customise controls, menu clicking is annoyingly unresponsive, and leaving cover will sometimes go back to first person looking up at the sky for no reason as a default as a few gameplay flaws which were not issues on mobile.  Issues one and two did not exist because of the nature of touchscreens, and issue three never happened to me on mobile, either.  This game was not designed with PC in mind, and being hastily ported to it during Square-Enix's ♥♥♥♥♥torm politics and restructuring which began in 2012 and persists to this day was just a cash grab when it should have been delayed until it played like Deus Ex:  Human Revolution when on PC.With that being said, ten years ago this game would have been called by many players as fantastic because games were more mediocre in general (please do not bother to name rare, specific games from that era which you like as a retort since it probably not represent the shovelware climate).  In 2014, however, better quality overall is increasingly demanded by players when back then gamers were not as vocal as a whole--thank both the Internet and gaming becoming far more mainstream since the early 2000s in the west--and this is just NOT a great game by today's standards.It is, however, a definitive DE:HR sidestory experience, and it is very good in that right.  It looks, sounds, and feels like a gaiden of DE:HR and the story is great.  If you really enjoyed DE:HR or the DE series since the first like I did what with this being my favourite game series, you WILL enjoy this for about 10 or so hours.  Then, it ends, because SE decided to make it episodic content where it can charge you piecemeal for subsequent chapters.  The caveat to its piecemeal design is because the game's reception was so poor, I am largely certain that no new chapters will ever be released.  If they are, it will be more hurried content with much cut for time and budget constraints, à la the Xenosaga trilogy.The problem is not the game as much as it is how SE handled it, although the game does have its problems.  This review is simply to state that it is NOT deserving of the low 46 metascore just as sooooo many 90+ games are not even close to as deserving those high numbers...this is something that you can blame on the pay-for-scores game ""journalism"" paradigm of today.  Buy it on sale for $5 or less; this game sat on my Steam wishlist from its PC release date until it was $5, and I cannot recommend paying more for it even though I DO recommend playing it if you enjoy DE games.Oh, and for god's sake, if the PS2-era character models for this mobile game is the defining flaw in what makes this a ""bad"" game to you, you have no business critiquing any game whatsoever, let alone attempting to appreciate the DE series' level of depth and subtext beneath what are not-awful visuals.

												An occasionally interesting tidbit of Deus Ex lore, which ultimately feels rather inconsequential and, since it seems the Ben Saxon saga is now abandoned, will remain so.

												Nearly everything about this game is terrible - the voice acting, the dialogues, the facial animations from end of 90s, the combat, the tedious voice recordings in the first part of the game (which kinda felt like they were just reciting the book, which I read long ago so I'm not sure about that). the annoying lack of jumping. Also, disappearing walls and objects during takedown animation. And yes, I'm pretty sure I've only seen a one single takedown animation throughout the whole game.The only thing they didn't break is stealth, although level design is over 9000 percent worse than in DX:HR.Also, I'm usually not the person to complain about graphics (I still play some games from late 80s from time to time), but I'm pretty sure I've seen better graphics in games on my iPhone.One the bright side, it only took me 5 hours to complete the game, finishing some side quests and exploring a little bit.In conclusion, if you are desperate for some more Deus Ex, better replay the original and/or HR once more, or read the book, which is, although not exactly a masterpiece, still way better than this game.

												Its a little rough on PC from the port over. Nothing game breaking, just slightly annoying because your cursor rarely actually works the first 2 or 3 tries to activate dialog in a speech and click on ""OK"" buttons and those kinds of things. Not as smooth as Dues Ex: HR. However very similar in style. **Major drawback is this is only like 1 chapter of a storyline... and it just says ""to be continued""**Since multiple newer titles have been released, I feel like they probably are not going to continue this game. It is extremely short. maybe 3 hours if you explore every inch of every corner of each level.The limited story we are exposed to is not as interesting as HR was either. I would certainly never pay full price for this, but if you catch it on sale, it can be worthwhile.			"

												Deus Ex: The Fall is the prequel to Deus Ex: Human Revolution. I found the original Deus Ex and Invisible War to be out dated in their mechanics, while Human Revolution made everything smoother and more enjoyable. Deus Ex: The Fall tries to be Human Revolution, but fails miserably:- The AI is just bad. I am talking Stormtrooper level of bad. Their aiming is very poor and standing behind a hip-height cover or being on the opposite side of the room will win you a fire fight. Also, their spotting is completely off. Sneaking isn't fun in this game because you have next to no challenge. The enemies are lined up to be taken out undetected and even otherwise, the enemies seem to just have forgotten that they should be on alert.- The shooting.. Holy mother of god. I know this is a mobile port but man.. they screwed up big times here. The weapons are lame and after firing your gun the screen shakes like it just started a rave party. After ever shot of the pistole and the shotgun it massivly zooms in and out.. not sure if I should call this recoil or ravecoil since there is no real weapon spread when spraying. Additionally, the guns are unresponsive and ignore certain actions from time to time.- There is no inventory managment. You can just buy any item you need right on the battlefield and they are teleported into your inventory. Probably a leftover from micro-transactions of the mobile version.- The options are ridiculous. No real PC options. Even indie game with Unity have better optimisation. The mouse control is awful and seems to have problems all over the place.- The graphics aren't terrible. They remind of Human Revolution and I like the overall aesthetic better than in Deus Ex 1 or Invisible War. Unfortunatly, the textures and models are muddy, lifeless and low resolution. To sum it up.. old. No improvment to the mobile version. The animations are clunky and take too long for rapid responsives and are sluggish as hell.- The gameplay is like an old demo of Human Revolution. Cover system, sneaking, hacking.. all good when looking at it but it just feels clunky. The cover system is also plagued with issues like clipping into textures, seeing the skybox, ignoring a wall, refusing to go in or out of cover or even just sticking to the air and act like its a wall. At least it has the basic elements of Human Revolution: Takedown, sneaking, hacking key pads...- The missions. The game in general is very short but you have at least a few side missions and different approaches (leathal, non-leathal, range..). The levels are in response to that also fairly small. I played it through in two hours and idled the rest for cards.To sum it up: Blind AI, bad resource managment, few settings, outdated graphics, poor gameplay and short gamelength.I found it rather to be enjoyable as a joke since I got it for free but paying 10€ for it is more than a rip-off.

												Did a full Deus Ex series playthrough so this was the last game to be played.You get to experience the world from a different view. You could say from the bad guys view in Deus Ex: Human Revolution and what happens there. (Can't say to much or I will spoil it.Go google if you're interested)I will give you a BIG WARNING to begin with as when you finish this game there is more to the story but as there isn't a follow up game you kinda get hanging with questions and not getting closure. If you can't handle that then do not bother getting the game.The game was made in mind for IOS and Android which you can tell and later for Windows.You have small areas where you do the missions. I didn't find it as bad as many are saying except with the ending part which was ... ok so I will never know what happened.The story was just interesting from another view but it wasn't one that caught me.Didn't feel like the augmentations did much here except with the hacking. Otherwise the rest felt pointless.The game is very short and with sidemissions and such it took me around 4 hours to finish.It is a very easy game to play.I really can't recommend this game.Short gameplay, you can never finish the story as no followup game was released, very easy, no real interesting characters and so on.

												I haven't played video games in a very long time and lost interest in them completely until I decided to download the Steam platform and become a part of the PC gaming crowd (which is a hell of a lot more fun, interesting, and less alienating than the console platform, IMO).For someone who isn't well acquainted with the Deus Ex franchise, I saw this game as a bit of a fun primer that will help me get through the meat of the main franchise (Deus Ex, Invisible War, Human Revolution, and eventually Mankind Divided). And even if I was a veteran of the franchise, I would enjoy Deus Ex: The Fall for what it is: another story in the Deus Ex Universe.With that said, Deus Ex: The Fall doesn't deserve the shade everyone is giving it. I played it, beat the initial campaign on a no-kill playthrough, and enjoyed it. Especially since I am a big fan of stealth games like Metal Gear Solid, and of the cyberpunk genre.			"

												When a new Deus Ex game comes out, fans of the series gobble it up like baby ducks.  You can bet gamers were salivating behind their monitors when they saw there was a new installment in the series.  Unfortunately, they will have to endure the never ending wait till Mankind Divided, because the Fall just does not carry the banner.  With the exception of some decent shading and lighting effects, graphics that might look halfway decent on a mobile device barely look better than the 2003 graphics of Invisible War.  Although The Fall has a faux version of the signature look of Human Revolution, it is simplified, and scaled down so far in detail that the level designs suffer.  It feels more like you're running through mazes than playing a modern FPS/RPG hybrid.  The salt wouldn't sting so bad if it had the same signature stealth system we knew from Deus Ex Classic.  In The Fall, enemies are so sensitive they practically have eyes in the backs of their heads.  Also, the movement is pretty clunky, so running around shooting everyone isn't always the best solution either.  There is some good writing along the way, but the overall plot is fairly simple, with much fewer side missions than there are in the mainstay Deus Ex titles.I would bet that absolute diehard fans of the series might be able to force themselves to play this for the sake of completion.  Then again, we don't get much of a sense who these characters are within the scope of the Jensen, Denton, and Denton team.  Those who are not familiar with the series but looking for a fun stealth shooter with  RPG elements would be far better just to start with Deus Ex Classic, then work their way up through the Invisible War and Human Revolution.________________________________________________________________Above was my original review in which I gave The Fall a thumbs down.  However, after playing the game more, I actually decided to revisit my assessment of the game.  While all of the things I said at first still apply.  There are a few really annoying things, like the addition of a persistant market instead of having NPC vendors located around the world.  It is designed for mobiles devices, and I think it would look better on a tablet than on a PC.  Was Eidos lazy in pushing out a game that could have been quite a bit better if they were willing to invest a little more into it?  Yes!  But in the end, if you can get past the dated graphics and bugs the game does feel like a Deus Ex game at heart.  Because of that, I would have to say it's worth playing for any fans of the series.

												It's a shame everyone hated so much this game. Give it a chance on any steam sale. Get it cheap and you'll enjoy somthing with Deus Ex spirit... falling a little bit short on somthings like controlls and diversity. But you'll get a solid story, same cool augs as HR, a big map with a lot of places to go and people to talk to. Keep in mind that it is a game designed for mobile devices so the graphics arn't like HR, but the enviroments are neat tho the characters are a little bit blocky. I had a lot of fun with it, and finishied it in two short sittings.			"

												I re-played Human Revolution after a few years, and when I finished, I decided to give The Fall a shot.It pains me to say that Deus Ex: The Fall is so disappointing as to be nearly unplayable.  It's Human Revolution just... less.  It looks like a third party came in and just made every aspect of the game worse: buttons often have to be clicked multiple times to work, cover works differently, the inventory/shop systems are completely different, and even hacking, which was super minimalistic to begin with, is now quite a lot worse.I put in two hours and I just can't keep going.  If you're hardcore enough to push through for the sake of the story, good on you, but I simply can't say that this game is *fun* in any way.  The graphics are similar to the original, but the voice acting is poor, and even the storyline is shoddy.  If you're looking for a good gaming experience, don't touch this with a ten-foot pole.			"

												Nearly everything about this game is terrible - the voice acting, the dialogues, the facial animations from end of 90s, the combat, the tedious voice recordings in the first part of the game (which kinda felt like they were just reciting the book, which I read long ago so I'm not sure about that). the annoying lack of jumping. Also, disappearing walls and objects during takedown animation. And yes, I'm pretty sure I've only seen a one single takedown animation throughout the whole game.The only thing they didn't break is stealth, although level design is over 9000 percent worse than in DX:HR.Also, I'm usually not the person to complain about graphics (I still play some games from late 80s from time to time), but I'm pretty sure I've seen better graphics in games on my iPhone.One the bright side, it only took me 5 hours to complete the game, finishing some side quests and exploring a little bit.In conclusion, if you are desperate for some more Deus Ex, better replay the original and/or HR once more, or read the book, which is, although not exactly a masterpiece, still way better than this game.

												Its a little rough on PC from the port over. Nothing game breaking, just slightly annoying because your cursor rarely actually works the first 2 or 3 tries to activate dialog in a speech and click on ""OK"" buttons and those kinds of things. Not as smooth as Dues Ex: HR. However very similar in style. **Major drawback is this is only like 1 chapter of a storyline... and it just says ""to be continued""**Since multiple newer titles have been released, I feel like they probably are not going to continue this game. It is extremely short. maybe 3 hours if you explore every inch of every corner of each level.The limited story we are exposed to is not as interesting as HR was either. I would certainly never pay full price for this, but if you catch it on sale, it can be worthwhile.			"

												Game mechanics take awhile to get used to.  This type of game should have a jump option but this one doesn't making me miss JC Denton's 4"" vertical leap...  In standard Deus Ex style you can always find a duct to move through, the AI is pretty stupid -- all you have to do is wait out their hostility and/or alarm rating for a minute in a safe place.  I found a bunch of credits but only needed to purchase maybe 2 EMP grenades.  Apparently this is only the first piece of Saxon's story.  The game isn't horrible but also isn't as good as its predicessors.  I give it a solid ""meh"" and worth it if you get it cheap.Tangent:  I was able to play this using my old Core i5-2500K's integrated graphics, nothing overclocked.  Playing this way allowed me to save ~100KWH compared to using my Radeon HD 7950.  Will continue to find ways to save the planet by finding other games where good-enough-graphics will work.			"

												An occasionally interesting tidbit of Deus Ex lore, which ultimately feels rather inconsequential and, since it seems the Ben Saxon saga is now abandoned, will remain so. As with Invisible War, there's some entertainment to be had in exploring the wider DX universe for fans willing to tolerate a stripped-down facsimile of a much stronger entry in the franchise - for everyone else, it's hard to give the thumbs-up.

												Deus Ex: The Fall is the prequel to Deus Ex: Human Revolution. I found the original Deus Ex and Invisible War to be out dated in their mechanics, while Human Revolution made everything smoother and more enjoyable. Deus Ex: The Fall tries to be Human Revolution, but fails miserably:- The AI is just bad. I am talking Stormtrooper level of bad. Their aiming is very poor and standing behind a hip-height cover or being on the opposite side of the room will win you a fire fight. Also, their spotting is completely off. Sneaking isn't fun in this game because you have next to no challenge. The enemies are lined up to be taken out undetected and even otherwise, the enemies seem to just have forgotten that they should be on alert.- The shooting.. Holy mother of god. I know this is a mobile port but man.. they screwed up big times here. The weapons are lame and after firing your gun the screen shakes like it just started a rave party. After ever shot of the pistole and the shotgun it massivly zooms in and out.. not sure if I should call this recoil or ravecoil since there is no real weapon spread when spraying. Additionally, the guns are unresponsive and ignore certain actions from time to time.- There is no inventory managment. You can just buy any item you need right on the battlefield and they are teleported into your inventory. Probably a leftover from micro-transactions of the mobile version.- The options are ridiculous. No real PC options. Even indie game with Unity have better optimisation. The mouse control is awful and seems to have problems all over the place.- The graphics aren't terrible. They remind of Human Revolution and I like the overall aesthetic better than in Deus Ex 1 or Invisible War. Unfortunatly, the textures and models are muddy, lifeless and low resolution. To sum it up.. old. No improvment to the mobile version. The animations are clunky and take too long for rapid responsives and are sluggish as hell.- The gameplay is like an old demo of Human Revolution. Cover system, sneaking, hacking.. all good when looking at it but it just feels clunky. The cover system is also plagued with issues like clipping into textures, seeing the skybox, ignoring a wall, refusing to go in or out of cover or even just sticking to the air and act like its a wall. At least it has the basic elements of Human Revolution: Takedown, sneaking, hacking key pads...- The missions. The game in general is very short but you have at least a few side missions and different approaches (leathal, non-leathal, range..). The levels are in response to that also fairly small. I played it through in two hours and idled the rest for cards.To sum it up: Blind AI, bad resource managment, few settings, outdated graphics, poor gameplay and short gamelength.I found it rather to be enjoyable as a joke since I got it for free but paying 10€ for it is more than a rip-off.

												Did a full Deus Ex series playthrough so this was the last game to be played.You get to experience the world from a different view. You could say from the bad guys view in Deus Ex: Human Revolution and what happens there. (Can't say to much or I will spoil it.Go google if you're interested)I will give you a BIG WARNING to begin with as when you finish this game there is more to the story but as there isn't a follow up game you kinda get hanging with questions and not getting closure. If you can't handle that then do not bother getting the game.The game was made in mind for IOS and Android which you can tell and later for Windows.You have small areas where you do the missions. I didn't find it as bad as many are saying except with the ending part which was ... ok so I will never know what happened.The story was just interesting from another view but it wasn't one that caught me.Didn't feel like the augmentations did much here except with the hacking. Otherwise the rest felt pointless.The game is very short and with sidemissions and such it took me around 4 hours to finish.It is a very easy game to play.I really can't recommend this game.Short gameplay, you can never finish the story as no followup game was released, very easy, no real interesting characters and so on.

It's also very short.However, if you got nostalgic over DX:HR but want some new missions, get this game. The gameplay is very similar to HR, so I actualy, in a way, enjoyed it. Not worth it for this price though, on sale for a couple of dollars it's actually not a waste of money in my opinion.			"

												The Fall isn't a game that I would recommend for a Deus Ex experience.Pros:For a mobile game it does have some good backgroundsSaxon who is the player character has some potential in terms of story and character building.I actually liked the plane level and the turntable was a nice feature.Cons:Gameplay tries but fails to emulate Deus Ex HRThe story didn't really catch my attention and I often skipped quite a bit of the dialogue. I do think that think that there is a story there but it’s just presented in such a bland way that you just switch offOh and the weapon animations are horribleThe first (tutorial) mission felt really quite bland which is a shame considering the venue was Moscow which could have been interesting.It's unfinished. To be frank there's a whole list of other things that have gone wrong with this game which has already been pointed out.And if I was asked to develop a game for mobile platforms and PC then I would not have chosen an FPS format.In short: Do not purchase this game and definitely not at full price although I purchased this as part of a bundle.Recommendations:I would turn this into a top down RPG instead although this may have to sacrifice some Deus Ex features but you could end up with much better gameplay and graphics which doesn't look quite so wanting and still be able to have acceptable looking custcenes.Get rid of the purchase menu; I don't know what they were thinking by including that.Also the environments need to be better developed. The Panama level just felt like a copy and paste of the Detroit levels in DXHR with a few minor differences and with a spinoff such as this it pays to give customers a new aspect of the franchise and activities not seen in its parent game (DXHR)I do think that there is potential in this game but if the developers really want it to sell then they're going to have a serious change of direction.

												This is a straight port from the game designed for iOS. It is not a ""remaster"", nor does it claim to be. It is not a badly done port of that game, but anyone expecting a full-featured PC game is going to be unhappy with this. A lot of functionality from Deus Ex: Human Revolution isn't present in this game, and the graphics were obviously meant for a smaller screen. I did not play enough to comment on the story, apart from to say that the beginning is formulaic, and non-compelling. What voice acting I heard was noticably more robotic and self-conscious than the acting in Human Revolution. Oddly enough this is what sealed it for me. I expected the game mechanics and graphics to be less impressive than those of Human Revolution, but I expected the story and voice acting to make up for it. I didn't give it much of a chance, only playing for about 30 minutes, but the game didn't really put it's best foot forward, even with my lowered expectations.			"

												QA is somewhat lacking, the GUI is a little less useful than in the previous DE:HR, and they've nerfed autohacks.  That said, for the price, its got a lot of content, and while this title isnt as polished as HR, if you liked that, you'll probably like this.			"

												The game isn't so bad for its price.The dialoges are ok but not so good dubbed.Gameplay is sometimes a littlebit odd and glitchy.Graphic is realy bad compared to Deus Ex - HR.Animation is ridiculous - whats the head shake in the dialoges?! And overall the animations look so wooden - not even Pinoccio would move like this.Overall this is compared to DE:HR a piece made by amateurs.But the price is ok for such a game. And I comfort myself with the fact that DE1 was realy good, Invisible War was crap, HR was realy good and The Fall is bad... so statistics says that the next Deus Ex could be awsome again!			"

It does no justice to the genre.If you do know DX and think you need it just so you have played them all, don't want to miss any story or have any other reasons, don't get it.

												This game I will have to say is best left on the I pad. The game surpasses well for an ipod game, but it doesn't mean the same for a PC port. graphic's: 5/10 I think the graphic is laughable when it hits pc, to think they would have cleaned up the thing and made it perhaps a bit more Deus Ex HR. Sad to say It felt gimped. gameplay: 3/10 the game play was not only too easy due to the store at the touch of a button, enemy AI being dull, and how the mechanic's work, but it also felt too darn short to be considered a game.  Makes all the higher end weapon in the shop worthless and more like a must buy this because it's pretty. story: 1/10 I can't say this enough it was too weak. The story wasn't compelling, though it does fill up a bit I guess if you want to call it that with the shortage of Nu-po and to how it works with organic material not rejecting mechanical limbs. But, the story for the DUEX: the fall felt forgotten and non cannon.			"

												I now understand why mobile ports are bad.tl:dr : Don't play, terrible game. (I played the game on controller, not sure if it'd be different on keyboard.)The only way that Eidos could've made this game better was to not bring it out at all. From the constant terrible narration to the over-the-top sensitivity (seriously, even on 0 the main character will spin around like he's high and happy), to the odd controls.I'm not sure if when I played DE:HR the controls to interact with something was ""X"", rather than the basic, and most used button, ""A"". Not sure if ""A"" even did anything; I couldn't jump at all, even when I thought I could at the starting section. This is why we shouldn't port things from mobile. Ever.			"

												You know, I actually went to the trouble of playing this, broken as it is, and found myself sort of enjoying it.The story and characters definitely had potential and deserved more than just the horrible PC port that this game is. I'll echo TotalBiscuit's thoughts that they should definitely have used the HR engine for this. But they just couldn't be arsed.The potential in the story and characters, at least for me, comes from the fact we're not dealing with a 'chosen one' protagonist such as JC or Jensen, it's a rather fresh take on the universe and it's why I enjoyed the prequel novel, ""Icarus Effect"", as well.Oh well, I'd only recommend playing this if you're a hardcore DX Universe fan and want to go through everything that's available.

												Way too short.  If you skip the dialogue, you could probably plow through the game in about an hour.  Animations look like a tablet game from four years ago.Dialogue is poorly written and all the voice actors except the lead are terrible (and borderline offensive).  Is clearly supposed to be Episode 1 of several, but the story just ends when you leave Panama.The AI is terrible, and guards don't notice anything other you walking across their field of vision or dead bodies (which disappear after about five seconds anyway).I got it for $2.50, and I'm not sure I got my money's worth.  The story seemed like it might have potential, but we ends before we even really find out what's going on beyond, ""corps are greedy and mercs are bad"".  If they ever release the rest of the game, I might pick it back up just in case the story becomes interesting.  Until then, don't bother.			"

												I'm a fan of the DX games, but I cannot recommend this one except to hardcore fans.It takes about 6 hours to complete all quests. After that it's possible to carry over all equipment & augs into the ""New Game+"" mode.What's positive about this game: a few new compositions by Michael McCann more insight into the DX world in 2027 by watching Picus News and reading e-books if you have read the book ""Deus Ex: Icarus Effect"" then it's cool to hear from Saxon & Kelso againWhat's negative: pretty much all that's left most annoying for me was that whenever I pressed a mouse button the game minimized => I had to play it in windowed mode it's a very poor port from tablet to PC, therefore graphics, audio, controls, AI & atmosphere are like a very stripped down version of DX:HRThe game is designed as the first part of a prolonged story. I hope for a sequel that will be much better than ""Deus Ex: The Fail""!			"

Still no where near  the standard I expected, however I captured an airport and got to take a plane ride, but still only had a few enhancements so was thinking this had to get better, then Boom! The game ended with TO BE CONTINUED. I was speechless and what eventually came from my mouth cannot be repeated here. If you get it for a pound, it might be worth it.

												The music is quite nice, and that is the only positive thing I can say about this game.This is a very low effort port of a mobile game. At a glance it looks like Deus Ex: Human Revolution, but the textures, shaders, models and animations are nowhere near that quality. Everything looks flat, and shadows is just a circle under people.The story and dialog is terrible, it is forced and blunt, with ""quality"" lines such as ""I want you to tell me the truth about Operation Rainbird"" while pointing with an outstretched arm.It includes fun bugs as your gun starts shooting until it is empty, which is great when you are trying to sneak up on an enemy.If you paid more for this game than you can sell the trading cards for, you are in danger of punching yourself in the face (which somehow is also more entertaining than this game).

												One Line Review: ""I never asked for this"" Detailed Review: The game is boring at best. The dialogue is horrible! Which was rather upsetting, since Deus Ex is known for having a stellar story line. The game is very easy even for a mobile game. You don't even really need to upgrade any of your weapons. I finished the game using only the weapons that I picked up. Also, alcohol is basically a substitute for painkillers (yes, your vision becomes a bit blurry for a while, but not for too long). The music is annoying and noticeably repetitive. I enjoyed the game much more when I turned the music off. Basically, the sound of my footsteps was more atmospheric than the music score.However, as games go, Deus Ex: The Fall isn't the worst. I still got to experience the world of Deus Ex...kind of. And all of those glitches sure kept me amused.If you're going to get this game, please play at least one other Deus Ex game before playing The Fall.			"

												Considering that this game originally released on mobile devices in 2013 and that there's no signs of the ""to be continued"" ending to actually, you know, have a continuation (unless it's going to be Mankind Divided DLC), I'm willing to just finally admit this game being on PC is utterly worthless. It doesn't help that this PC port is clumbsy, nor does it help that you probably already have Human Revolution installed on the exact same computer and could be playing that instead...If you can deal with awkward touchscreen controls, get it on iOS / Android. Because at least then it's portable Deus Ex. That is literally its only redeeming factor if there is never a part two to this ""episodic series.""			"

												Despite the many critics, this game doesn't play much different compared to the highly praised Human Revolution. Its major drawback is that it is ultra short. Graphically it is moderate, the shooting is simple and the story is a bit confusing but but so was Human Revolution. Luckily this time cut scenes are fast forwardable.			"

												Square Enix once again create something beautiful and then suffocate it.Despite being a good game and an alluring concept in regards to the plotline, this game is massively let down by the cliffhanger that will never be resolved!At the time of writing, version 1.0.6 of the original iOS iteration is live and still has no mention of resolving this but this port is listed as v1.0.1A bitter ending to an otherwise sweet experience.

												This game is horrifically bad. I just finished Deus Ex: Human Revolution and was excited for more. Deus Ex: The Fall, extremely poorly, to mimic the interface of DE:HR, but everything looks terrible. The interface does not respond to clicks properly, enemy AI doesn't exist. It's a tragically lazy port of a mobile game, and it's barely playable at all. No amount of desperation or love for Deus Ex makes this game enjoyable.			"

												Alright, so this is my first review ever, but I wanted to jump in since the game is getting a lot of hate and I aim to justify the existence of this entry and to tell you how not everything is as bad as many people say. If you are unsure about this game let me tell you this: this game will only please a select few hardcore fans, so if you are one, this could be a gamble. If you are not a big a fan, save your money and time, and play the big titles instead. Prepare for a wall of text.Before anything else, I need you to know that the book ""Deus Ex: Icarus Effect"" written by James Swallow (main writer for the modern DX games) is canon and takes places before the events of this game and not only introduces all of the characters mentioned in The Fall, but also talks about many events that impact the game and Human Revolution as well. For you to maximize the enjoyment of the game, read the book (if you have the patience) or the summary  here [deusex.wikia.com]. Doing so will give you a deeper sense of the narrative and perhaps a different perspective when you play this game, seeing as the novel basically sets up this game. The game takes place after the events of the book, and follows the story of Ben Saxon and the Tyrants, the group of mercenaries that attack Sarif Industries on DX Human Revolution.Let me start with the bad things about the game: Deus Ex: The Fall is simply a PC port for a mobile game that came out in 2013, so do not get you hopes up about nice features, big areas and details like in DXHR or DXMD. That being said, the port is simply a copy paste from the mobile versions with graphic upscaling and Anti Aliasing and added keyboard support, everything else is the same and it feels really limited. The game is very short, bodies disappear, enemy AI is bound to a specific area and they do not go past said area, the controls feel clunky and many other limitations exist (and it makes sense for a mobile game), there is no inventory management and there are no physical shops in the game. You can simply pause the game, go into the different parts of the menus and purchase anything at any moment using in-game currency, and you can carry everything that is available to use by the player without consequence. It is practical, but not challenging to use this system. You also only have one save slot and this is terrible for a PC port, this should be unaccpetable, but here we are. Finally, the story starts off slowly and it's not very interesting at the beginning. Some characters are oversimplified and feel bland, but the story is still somewhat interesting for those who aren't hardcore fans. The game is supposedly episodic, but only part 1 has been released so far and you will be left in a cliffhanger. No talk about part 2 is making people angry and uneasy about this game's future, and rightfully so.Now, the good things! The story, characters and lore all tie in with the main series and this is a rich addition to the world of Deus Ex as far as narrative is concerned, so from the get-go many characters already seen in other games are more likeable. The locations in Panama are very interesting, and is a nice refresher from the locations from Human Revolution. The music is mostly borrowed from Human Revolution, so it is very nice. All characters that have appeared in other games are still using the same voice actors and most main characters have solid performances, but are limited by the engine. If you enjoyed the weapons from Human Revolution, most are in the game and new variations are presented in the game, with different stats and skins, the Belltower Shotgun is my favorite, being fully automatic with a press of the trigger. A new augmentation, the stealth dash, is fun and serves as a balancing measure since the Typhoon is still experimental. There is a good replay value with the New Game +, and the economy of the game presents a challenge for those seeking to get all items or augmentations.Bottom line: The game deserves a better treatment. If the story was to be all finsihed up, and was given the AAA treatment, with big city hubs and more sidequests, nicer, updated graphics and better AI, I am sure it would become a fan favorite. There is potential, and it is a shame to see it wasted in a mobile version ported to PC. But the game is good in it's core, only limited by the parameters of a mobile game. If you are interested in the Deus Ex universe, this is a nice side story with more to be told. Give it a shot.			"

												So the general consensus about this is game, is that its terrible. Well, I don't agree with this. I think it's a pretty decent Deus Ex game, keeping in mind this was made for mobile phones. Of course the graphics aren't as good (they aren't bad though, and it runs quite smoothly), the controls are a little iffy (they are made with controllers in mind, so maybe get one of those), the story a little less deep (the cliffhanger ending is so bad, really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that they didn't develop anything else after this) and the overal package just, less. But for the low pricepoint (I got it on sale for 2,49) you can buy much worse. I wouldn't recommend this to newcomers, as this is one of the worst points to start with Deus Ex. But to seasoned Deus Ex players (or people who really ♥♥♥♥ing loved Deus Ex: Human Revolution aka me) this is a really fun little experience with some nice backstory to add to the Deus Ex lore. Oh yeah, the music is also ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. (some tracks are recycled from DE:HR, but there are a couple of new tracks that are really good!)			"
