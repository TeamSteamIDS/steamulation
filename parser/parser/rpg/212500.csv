												From a player that's played this game since release back in 2007, playing across 3 servers, founder account, over 15,000 hours logged over the years. I can tell you that my feelings for this game are very genuine and it's taken me a good two months to write this review after leaving the game. I'll be honest, the game truly has fallen from what it used to be, it's become, let's say, easy from what I remember years ago. Angmar content is probably on par with what vanilla WoW was for me, The massive amount of meticulousness that had to go into every single character that you had. From the start of character creation, you were in danger of getting absolutely smacked by landscape mobs if you were a certain class and pulled mobs badly (I'm looking at you hunter). The way you had to play a class was very different from launch than it is now, and I'm not saying that's a bad thing at all, things change, just me reminiscing over times long past. This is just the tip of the iceberg so to say.Now, on to the content. The developing team behind LOTRO has put out content consistently that appealed to the audiences up to Rise of Isengard, which in my opinion, was one of the best expansions I've ever played in any MMO. The content before and including Isengard (Angmar, Mines of Moria, Seige of Mirkwood) are incredible, everything from the instances, zones, questing, down to the ambient sounds, it was amazing. Now this basically talking about the expansions as a whole, (I consider Angmar an expansion in this list, but it was vanilla content more or less) but the zones in between the major content areas were amazing as well, North Downs, Lothlorien, Evendim, Enedwraith, If you have never experienced the night in Forochel, you are missing on one of the most amazing game sceneries ever. Great instance designs in all of this content, from forging into Carn Dum with your friends and overcoming the managerie of bosses and Mordirith, to conquering places like Barad Guldur and the Tower of Isen along with toppling Saruman in an incredible battle atop the tower itself. Many many memories will never be forgotten that pertain to such events that took place in the game. Alas, many new players will never get to experience this content simply because the game has progressed far beyond all of this. Most of the players that I met during my final year and a half or so were players that were there to rush to level cap and do ""end-game"", that's the joke kids, there is no end-game. All it is at level cap is a daily grind for your daily reputation factions for that ""highest tier raiding set"" that you will never put to serious use because most of the players that play the game now will NOT run content that will challenge them. It's that simple, I led pug tier 2 challenge runs on my main server of Windfola for years for players not in raiding guilds, and people would rather run Sambrog 6 man spams for crap rewards than spending a little more time in a bigger, more challenging instance for big reward. It pained me to see that the game populace had declined to such a lazy group of ""give it to me without the challenge"" group of people, because let's be honest, anyone that played in vanilla LOTRO can tell you how bloody hard it was, JUST to get your resistances right to actually stand a chance in Carn Dum, let alone actually fighting the bosses. But don't be let down, there are groups of players on many servers on both EU and NA that play around the level of that old content when it was released so they can specifically run that content and have it challenge them, they are great people and they organize themselves in server world chats and forums still.Now on to the ""current"" content. After Isengard, the game started to decline, Rohan was a let down for most players, the introduction of mounted combat looked fun on paper, it was ok, but it was buggy, and it never really fit in with most players. The landscape was pretty for a bit, but you got used to the rolling plains. The instances were sadly a joke in terms of difficulty, aside from the raids in that cluster for the expansion, the three raids that were introduced were pretty fun and challenging at the highest difficulty of tier 2 challenge, Fires of Smaug and Battle for Erebor were great fun, but the third, Flight to the Lonely Mountain was pretty much impossible at release because it was buggy, it got fixed, but far to late for such a simple problem. Then you had the the most outrageous rep grind in the form of Hytbold reconstruction, something that would take around a solid month to complete if you were very diligent about your dailies, something that had to be done to aquire your level 85 class set pieces. It wasn't the worst thing ever, but the real knife in the back really came with the area expansion of Wildemore with the atrocious rep grind at the end of finishing every quest in the zone, it was terrible, an everyone that I knew hated it, and it was all for a shiny epic accessory piece that didn't mean a whole lot. After this Helms Deep released, Big Battles came with it, I won't go into detail about it, but it was something to see, especially as a player from the beginning. All the classes were redone, traits were completely overhauled into tree progression, basically the game was stripped and redone in most aspects. No new instances were included, no raids, nothing except the battles that most hated, I did my progression through them, did A LOT of bug report testing for them over the months, some say to this day that they are still buggy. When they released update 14 I called it quits, said my goodbyes to many, and uninstalled.As for players that really enjoy playing PvP, I STRONGLY recommend you watch videos and visit the official LOTRO forums and read through the PvMP threads. Personally, I think the community for PvP is toxic and players are simply looking for who has the bigger E-Peen at any given time. On any server you will find flavor of the month players that jump from class to class every update so they can destroy you with minimal effort, it's just terrible habits that a fair amount of them have and it's nasty, one of the main reasons that led to me leaving the game, considering there really is no PvE endgame anymore.Now, don't get me wrong I will recommend this game to anyone that every asks me about it, it's very good looking, classes play pretty well, questing isn't a total bore, crafting can be ok, there is amazing RP opportunity. Just remember that this game has been around for a good while and is going through it's decline because of recent content release, but there are still servers with 200+ player login, people still play this game, I leave it up to you to decide whether to drop subscription money to do a large amount of things that this game has to offer in terms of content. I've made many dear friends because of this game, maybe you will as well.As for the players that have never progressed anywhere near the end of a character's leveling path and experienced a large amount of this game, they truly have no opinion of the game. They haven't gone through anything that would give them any right to judge the game in any way shape or form, it hurts greatly when I read a review from someone that hasn't even logged an hour and down votes this game.Aa' lasser en lle coia orn n' omenta gurtha (May the leaves of your life tree never turn brown) :)			"

												I played this game from the time when Evendim was first introduced up to when they released the Helm's Deep 'expansion'. In that time, it was my primary game. It was great. Kins, raiding, PvP. It was all I wanted in a MMO, with a Lord of the Rings theme. Unfortunately, the game went down hill.The first expansion was Moria and was a good expansion. Probably the height of the game. We got loads of instances, a lair raid, a legendary weapons system and two new classes. They even gave us a few more updates with some instances and a couple of raids.The second expansion was Mirkwood. It was marketed as a 'mini-expansion', and though it was smaller than Moria was, it was still much larger than anything we had later. We got a new instance system called 'Skirmishes', where we got soldiers and about a dozen instances to fight with them in. It was good, it filled it out. Mirkwood also came with 3 x 3 man instances, 1 x 6 man instance and a 3 boss raid with a gauntlet at the start. It wasn't as good as Moria but it was cheaper, so we accepted it.Then came the biggest issue: Turbine was bought by Warner Brothers. Only a couple of months after this, the game went 'free to play' (you can play for free, but it's heavily restricted and you need to pay to unlock things). The community was a little concerned, thinking that it would mean the reduction in quality of the game or finding lots of 'pay to win' items. Turbine assured us it would be alright.They released a large update with about 4 or 5 instances and a raid. It was a good instance cluster, but it didn't come with any level cap increase so loot wasn't that desirable. It also came about 6 months before the release of another expansion.Rise of Isengard was our first expansion since F2P. And cracks were beginning to show more and more. They released it without any instance cluster initially. Only a single buggy lair raid that was originally promised as a free update and later tacked on to the expansion to fill it out. Then, slowly, we got the instance cluster and raid. It was an alright raid but it felt hollow. We'd waited a long time and then got nothing more than a mini-expansion had provided before, especially when it cost twice as much as Mirkwood did.After that, we got Riders of Rohan. This 'expansion' was the biggest joke of all. Originally, they didn't tell us what was in it when they released pre-purchases. Then, after people bought it, they revealed it wouldn't have any instance cluster. No raids. The only end-game would be a daily grind to rebuild a town. That was it. The community kicked off. Eventually, they gave in and said they'd include an instance cluster. But the instance cluster was about Erebor (the mountain in the Hobbit) and not anything to do with Rohan. It was clear it was intended as a cash grab for people who watched the Hobbit films. We got the first half of the instance cluster a few months after the expansion first released. Then we got the second half. Both times they gave us these instance cluster halves, they called them 'updates'. Usually, updates had new content in. This time, it was just delayed content that was supposed to be part of the expansion. The downside being all of the instances were terrible, the raids were 2 lair bosses and a gauntlet (so less than the Mirkwood raid), and people gave up.By this point, Turbine had also gone out of their way to monetise what they could. They ignored complaints about lag, grinds, and broken old content. Instead, they began selling more store-only items. They milked what they could from the playerbase without caring what sort of content to deliver. It got to the point where the community was so divided between fanboys and people hostile to Turbine that the forums became a propaganda-fest. The CM banned dissenters left and right.With customer trust erroded, Turbine finally announced their next (and my last) expansion. Helm's Deep. They didn't have any instances, only these things called 'Big Battles', which took away any importance of class and relied on generic big battle upgrades. They also did the thing that killed the game for many people: Trait Trees.Before, you could trait your character how you wanted. It made hybrid builds viable and widely varied. You could make a class built for survival, or DPS, or whatever you wanted. But Trait Trees took all of that away. They gave generic builds to everyone. Now, you couldn't run a hybrid build because you could only choose one line and the skills it came with. They literally locked our skills behind 3 different lines. Where a person might have a few healing abilities in their DPS build, they were now locked behind the healing line only. Sure, you could put points in other lines, but it didn't give you the skills you wanted like before. In effect, they took everyone's characters and made them generic, cookie-cutter builds.After this, they said they had no plans for another expansion. A few small updates here and there, but it's basically maintenance mode now until Mordor. A cash cow to squeeze, not a game to please.And now we're at the point where they've driven so many people away that they're having to merge servers to save cost and to make the population look busy again. 29 servers cut down to just 10; 5 US servers, 5 EU servers. It says a lot when a game is forced to make such drastic changes, while pretending it's doing fine. Not only that, they've been unsuccessful with actually transferring characters between servers, so in true Turbine form they've got no clue what they're doing.TL;DR: Do not play this game. It's no longer what it once was. It's a broken, hollow, generic shadow of its former self, and Turbine are only using it now to milk the few remaining loyalists for all they're worth.Edit: To clarify, I have a Lifetime account. I get full VIP perks forever because I paid a large amount when I first started playing. So my complaints are from the perspective of someone who doesn't even need to pay for it, yet still can't bring themselves to play it.			"

												I've done nothing but farm work, help hobbits set up a festival, chase animals and beat up brigands for two hours, and I loved every minute of it.It's strange really, I've played practically every major MMO at this point, and the only one to grip me alongside WoW is LOTRO. Personally, I'm tired of being treated as the SAVIOUR OF THE UNIVERSE as soon as I hit level 2. Hell even by level 20 in LOTRO I still often help ordinary folk with ordinary things, and I enjoy that. If I want over the top epicness there's a million and one games that do that, but LOTRO keeps things level headed for the most part (Excluding a dream sequence that was hamfisted in at level 5 where YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE or some crap, but that's generally disregarded by the community and even  the devs as it has yet to be brought up again). This is greatly aided by the fact the MMO is based on the -books- and not the films, which is a great relief as Radaghast for example isn't an insane lunatic and there's no mention of a rabbit sleigh just yet.That said, when the drums of war sound, and orcs and goblins march, the game isn't afraid to take a turn into the dark and foreboding. The sky goes from a clear blue to a grim dark grey or even red as I approach Angmar, the woods and wildlife growing more desolate. I can't help but feel I've only made a small scratch in the surface of the adventures that await me yet. The mundane quests are gradually being set aside in favour of ""Oh god, ♥♥♥♥'s going down, halp pls"" from townsfolk, which suits me fine.Having sunk money into the expansions and quest bundles as they were on sale (Fairly frequently), I have all but negated any -need- to subscribe. A subscription at this point would only give me a few more character slots (Which I don't need, already have five), access to PvP (Which I have no interest in), a daily XP bonus (Which doesn't last very long) and an allotment of premium currency (Which I don't really need either).I subscribed for a single month a while ago, and that has removed currency limits, given me more character slots, and even removed the lock on my class, race and virtue trait slots on all characters I played back then.A lot of people are put off by the in-game store, yes it does pop up now and again, especially after level 30 or so if you haven't bought any zone quest packs, but really at the point I'm at I don't really see it all that much. Additionally, you can grind out premium currency in a fairly adequate amount, hell last time the expansions were on sale I managed to get one -purely- by grinding. It was a bit boring, but it was helped by a lovely bunch of max level players offering to help newer players like myself farm out the currency. There's even guides on getting said currency in a quick, efficient manner, if a little repetitive as it involves making characters and doing specific tasks over and over.Is the game perfect? No, it shows some signs of age, namely in the graphics (The Beoring race/class is a fair grade higher quality than the other race models), some could argue the combat was clunky. But it's otherwise well-preserved, namely with exquisite attention to detail. Weapons make different sounds on hitting enemies based on what the enemy is or what they wear, rather than the same generic SFX being heard for hours on end, to name just one example.As a frequent role-player, LOTRO holds the crown as the most RP friendly MMO I can think of, cut down only by it's rather archaic housing system, which is very restrictive in terms of decor (Seriously, you have to place furniture in fixed locations, meaning my bed has to be in the middle of a room...). Which is a shame, as the RP community has shrunk significantly, to the point where the only prominent RP takes place in the prancing pony inn. And obviously the quality there can often be... lacking. A great shame, but the game is niche so a tiny RP community is expected.tl;dr: The game is good, try it. Premium currency can gradually be gained for free. Wait for zone quests and expansions to go on sale before buying them. if you like the game, considor subbing just for one month to remove the worst of the limitations on your account and characters (Remember to login to each character to unlock their traits etc while you're a VIP).

												So I have played this game a lot (even more than Steam says I have) it was the first MMO I played but I have played others since I started playing LOTRO I have always been Vip and have all expansion packs also I play on the Withywindle (EU) server.There is a lot to love about this game even if you know nothing of Tolkien' work and just want to try out something a bit different or try an mmo for the first time.I personally know people who are lvl100 with all expansions and quest packs and they have never had to spend a penny of there own money but it truly is an epic grind to do that I personally recommend buying the quad pack of expansions to get you up to date and help you in speed of lvling.Pros  One of the best PvE experiences I've ever had in any game. The world is massive with thousands of quests and thousands of hours of game play with plenty of instances/raids/epic battles to get involved in+ Great community.+ There's always something to do.+ A good wardrobe system allowing almost endless cosmetic options.+ Great crafting system with the ability to make epic weapons clothing etc.+ Festivals in which you can unlock items such as mounts, clothing/gear, pets and more.+ Almost endless exploration if your into finding new stuff in game you won't be disapointed.Cons+ PVMP needs a bit of a reboot you can have some epic RVR action but varies by server.+ Can feel daunting sometimes due to size of the world.+ Virtues can be a massive grind .+ Crafting needs an update.They are my pros and cons I really love this game infact I have loads of games in my steam libary unplayed due to my love of this game try it out you never know you may love it.

So, Lord of the Rings Online is fairly good MMORPG here with a couple of nuances:1. This is a game about the lore for the Tolkien's writing. Tolkiens fans can start with it all fine, all others would need some time to understand what is, actually, up in here. Let's say you didn't read the books, but you do want to start your sinking in it with a game? Then LotRO is definitely your bet.2. This isn't a game about PvP. While there are friendly duels and PMvP (Player-controlled Monsters versus Player) raids this isn't a focus for the project, neither it's really entertaining. Enjoyed being a ravaging orc for a change though.3. This game isn't about wiggling breasts, like, at all (notably other games on the market are, like TERA or Black Desert Online). Personally I like this aspect of the game second to lore, so if you're after storytelling and not the boobs you'll do fine.4. This game has a ton of cooperational group content to do from the very start of the game (lvls 20+), both very interesting and entertaining. Consider to make friends in kinship (local name for clans) or invite your own friends!5. This game requires some reading skills. I mean, quest texts are really good, and some of the side quest stories are awesome to the marvelous point.6. This game is great for exploring. The more areas you explore 'to the last tree out there', the more stories to hear/read you uncover, the more rewarding the deed system goes on you (deeds are in-game achievements you get tons of premium currency for). 7. Payment system isn't that unfriendly to free players if you ask me. Yes, grinding premium currency with deeds can be tiresome if you buy nothing, but hey!.. Get Steam packs available for the game and you'll do just fine. 15 USD (when on sale) and you won't need to buy anything else in months.These developers deserve support with our hard-earned cash.8. While some point out that the graphics of the game are outdated I can't call those 'ugly'. I'd say older locations look like the Gothic II ones (which isn't bad, you know) while new ones can be stunningly beatiful. Visit Evendim peaks and Forochel coasts to see what I mean.9. Music puts Peter Jackson to shame, really. Definitely a strong side for the game.10. And the last, but not the least thing about the game is the Community. People come and go, but old players always return to LotRO, so you can find all types of people in. Seasoned veterans, who played the game for 8 years, new lads and lasses, some experienced folk to group with... Roleplayers, that enjoy the very social aspects for the game. You'll certainly fit in our bunch :)Total score would be 9\10 points for the people that share the same things to love with me and 3/10 for the people that just want running around a half-naked curvy girl with a sword larger than the girl.

												As a huge huge Tolkien fan, I must say this game is extremely appealing. First off I want to explain what's fantastic about MMO's and that people have forgotten they're for: They're not just for rushing to endgame, they're not just for PvP. They're for fully enjoying a well-fleshed world and essentially living a second life in said game, and having a variety of experiences. Something alot of MMO players have forgotten in their impatient rush to end-game and gear. The best MMO's make a rich, versatile, alive world for you to explore and experience.Let me explain and tell you a very recent scenario that actually happened:In preparation for the 3rd Hobbit installment, my girlfriend and I travelled to the Shire to enjoy the sights and sounds. We ventured up to Bilbo's house, and explored it a bit. We saw a humorous painting of Smaug, and a few other notable things. Another traveller walks in as we were staring at the painting, he bows to both of us and tells us he is from Dale, and came to thank Bilbo for his assistance so long ago. He informs me they've rebuilt well, and he will travel back soon after attending to some business. We tell him we were simply exploring, adventurers who wanted to visit the unlikely Hobbit Bilbo Baggins. He invites us for a round of ale. We walk down to the Green Dragon, discussing the dire business going on South. He buys us a couple pints and we have a smoke and talk more (more real life things at this time.) He adds us as friends, gives some gold (at the time we weren't very rich, so it was very helpful), invites us to go fishing (of which we had to decline for we had other matters to attend) and is away on his own journey.There was no combat, no hobbies, no crafting, no end-game, no raids, just good ol player community and interaction. Add in heroic combat, interesting and fun crafting and hobbies, raids, and you have a fantastic MMO. That is essentially what you're getting with this. A tight-knit VERY friendly and awesome community. LotRO does a fantastic job of letting you experience Tolkiens world in a wonderful setting. The music, the graphics/areas, the overall feeling is very immersive. Countless times I have stopped and enjoyed the wonderfully presented and created zones. Yes the graphics are a bit dated, but it is a somewhat older MMO. The graphics are still decent and even in some spots beautiful enough to not be unenjoyable.Yes, the F2P pricing model is very bad. But does that remove it's pros? No. Most MMO's have subs,  can you *really* mark off this game so much for it's new pricing model? Just sub, and buy expansions for the most enjoyment and unhindered experience.  You can't really expect them to not want money, they need it, and you need support.The combat is normal and decent. The story is great for fans of Middle-Earth.  The music system is truly innovative and new, even to this day. Overall, I highly recommend this game, ESPECIALLY if you're a huge fan of Middle-Earth. Enjoy the experience, live in the rich setting.. Stop rushing. Enjoy it.			"

												It has a slightly different view on the genre than WoW, more story-orientated, and slow paced, but still a very fun game. I can only recommend it to LotR fans, because it features faithful renditions of the original locations, characters and monsters of the books/movies. The skills, talents ('traits') and upgradable legendary weapons give more depth to the already satisfying combat.			"

												A well-balanced mmorpg based on the works of Tolkien. You'll recognise many places and people from the novels (or movies).Until recently I played, very happily, as F2P. There are several regions which have their quests unlocked and other quest packs and services can be unlocked using Turbine Points which can be easily gained ingame by completing deeds.A lot of people pay for 1 months VIP subscription for the permanent unlocks it gives, but I love the game so much I decided to go VIP to put some money back into a game that satisfies all my mmo needs. Awesome cosmetic/wardrobe options, great crafting system, beautiful places to explore and I love achievements & titles!  I haven't covered the raiding/endgame or PVM (player vs monster) as I haven't been involved with those. But the PVM, where you can create a monster race player & fight other players in the Ettenmoors sounds like a lot of fun.			"

												Where do I start with this game? Once upon a time, it was a thriving title with a fantastic future. Somewhere along the line, the Riders of Rohan pulled away, Gondor's Men retreated back to Minas Tirith, The Hobbits holed up in the Green Dragon and the Elves left for the West. To put it honestly, the change to free to play is what started the death toll for Lord of the Rings Online. Instead of being able to be a part of Middle-earth, you are met with ""BUY THINGS FROM OUR STORE"" every chance Turbine can get. This is not a ""free to play"" title. Quest packs are required in order to progress and with the new expansion you are also required to pay for the epic quest line - something Turbine once promised would never be part of the pay to play experience. It's a shadow of what it once was. The engine is in desperate need of upgrading and the feeling of being a part of Tolkien's Middle-earth is gone. Even the cosmetic, housing and music system feels old and outdated. Give LotRO a skip and hang your head for a moment of silence for the game it was.			"

												This review is for the Steam Awards Nomination. I am nominating this game for the Test of Time Award. In April, LOTRO will be celebrating 10 years and players will be preparing to journey to Mordor alongside The Fellowship to destroy The One Ring. While such a declaration may make give the impression that things are drawing to a close, that is hardly the case. The fan base for LOTRO remains one of the most dedicated in terms of an MMORPG's popularity, right up there with World of Warcraft. LOTRO has been featured in Atlas Obscura, a college course in Tennessee has featured and been inspired by it, and new players are joining the game everyday. With the tenth anniversary coming up, this is the absolute best time to either start playing LOTRO or return to it. In no other game can you so througly immerse yourself in the world of Middle Earth. No matter what games I play in my Steam library or consoles, I still login everyday to chat and play with my kinmates and lose myself in this beautiful world for an hour or two or five. These reasons and many more are why Lord of The Rings Online deserves the Steam Award for The Test of Time.			"

												DISCLAIMER: Due to the evolving nature of MMO's, the described content may have changed by the time you, the reader, see this.LotRO... well.To start of, I've spent more time on this game than I ever thought I would spend on a single game, be it MMO or not.(I started playing LotRO through the confines of Steam only recently, the game hours I speak of can be found on my Raptr Profile[raptr.com] under ""Most Played"")What is LotRO? It's a ""Hotkey-MMO"" similar to Everquest 2, RIFT and World of Warcraft. Focusing more on a player storyline that goes through-out your leveling experience. Don't be fooled by that last bit. It's not a 100% in-a-line story RPG experience in a Massively Multiplayer world, there will be level gaps where you'll take time off from the story and do the good ol' MMO questing. That's the short description I can think of.Aside the basic questing and the Story-line, known as the ""Epic"", we also have instances (some scalable with your level with a minimum level and some with a set level), skirmishes(scalable to your level starting from the level you unlock them at), raids(same as instances) and PvMP(Starts around lvl 10ish. Scales to cap.) among some here-and-there lore, references and the like.The F2P model. Well this is something that rubs a lot of people the wrong way. To be frank, no one likes that a game, advertised as free, has the cash-shop surprise. However one should keep in mind that there's a difference between Free to Play and Freeware games.Is it bad?It's better than most, but then again, all F2P games should be taken with caution.What exactly is available to you from the start?The flat out free content includes the majority of the classes (with the exception of Rune Keeper, Warden and Beorning), all the starting zones (The Shire, Ered Luin and Bree Land) and 1 post-start zone, Lone Lands, which ends around level 32.Account limitations:No level limitations. (Aside the level cap, of course)3 bags out of 6. (Static 15 slot bags)All crafting tiers are available, but you only have access to the first 2 reputation tiers in a crafting guild. (Or something like that.)Gold (100c = 1s, 1000s=1g) is capped at 2.You have 2 character slots on each server.Each character has 2 free virtue and race trait slots out of 7 and access to the Class Specialization tree, but not the specialization bonuses (an extra bonus per 5 points in the chosen ""main"" specialization tree).Main Story/Epic is unlocked/free up untill the start of Helms Deep (Roughly around lvl 90).Is this really it for a Free player? Just this?Well, yes and no. You are able to gather the cash-shop currency through gameplay. There are deeds, which are the equivalent to achievements. Majority of the deeds reward the player with the cash-shop currency known as TP (Turbine Points) allowing players to unlock further content for just playing the game. In my time on LotRO I have ran into more than a few players who have been unlocking their way through the game via just that. At times it does feel like a grind, but it is a viable way for a Free player to expand their experience.Where's the, you know, PvMP talk/stuff/review/whatnot?I have no interest in PvP.Is Lord of The Rings Online Pay to Win?Well, LotRO focuses mainly (but not only) on PvE and the Epic questline. In that regard, I have not seen a single thing on the VIP features list, nor the cash-shop that would indicate that this is a P2Win game. It really isn't. Yes, it has PvMP (Player versus Monster Player) meaning PvP is in the game which in its essence is endgame Raid PvP and not your standard Arena PvP. Even there I don't see it being P2Win in any way. This is my point of view on this, opinions may vary.What is my stance on the F2P model?It feels like an extended trial, infact it has enough content to be considered as something more than just a trial. I haven't seen a lot of games with a F2P model as fair as LotRO has. Which is partly why I've stuck with the game.My experience so far:Why such a long time?I started playing a few weeks after LotRO went F2P.What have I achieved in the game with that time?To be entirely honest. Not as much as one would expect. I've never been a fast leveler. I like to explore a lot and alt-oholism takes its toll. Which is why I generally prefer to work on deeds for TP, instead of throwing money at Turbine. My highest level character is capped at 100 (provided there hasn't been a sneaky cap increase I'm unaware of), I have a total of 10 character slots and various convenience upgrades, most of which I've unlocked via Deeds rather than real money.So, am I a VIP or?Premium. The status between VIP and Free. The player who has spent some money on the game, but isn't sitting on a subscription.Do I love it?Yes, a lot. I'm a LotR fan and so far I have not been disappointed in this presentation of Middle-Earth.Is it possible that this form of gameplay will tire me and result in me leaving the game?It's possible. I am quite surprised I've been with it for so long. However I do believe that this is highly unlikely and if I recall correctly the Epic questlines goal is to reach Mordor which is something I would love to personally witness.Final verdict if such a thing is possible with an ever growing MMO (it really isn't in my honest opinion):It's F2P, try it. If you don't like it then at least you have experienced something different and are that much wiser.EDIT(s): Grammar and section arrangements for a more sensible format.EDIT(s)2:Updated information. Increased the amount of sense made and such.			"

TL;DR is at the bottom of the review for all of you who didn't want to read the whole thing!It's been 350 hours as of this writing and my main character has hit the level cap of 100, quested through almost all levelling zones, participated in raids, instances, big battles, is a guilded tailor, and has been a long-standing member of a kinship (known as a guild in other MMOs), in addition to a whole host of other things. So, needless to say, I think I'm finally qualified to write a proper review of this game.Even though this review will get buried under the hundreds of other reviews listed for The Lord of the Rings Online (or LOTRO, from here on out), I still felt like it was important to write a review for this game because I feel as though it is a vastly underrated MMORPG. There is so much to love about this amazing game but people often dismiss it in their early minutes of playing because of its appearance or other factors, and I think that this game deserves so much more than that.I want to try to keep this review short (which will be difficult because LOTRO is an enormous game, so there is a LOT to cover if I really wanted to touch on everything), but do keep in mind that from hundreds of hours of playing I have a lot to say and am strongly opinionated on some things, so I won't shy away from going in-depth when I need to.PROS:(+) - GAME WORLD: This point, right here, is what really makes this game so magnificent for me. I've got to hand it to the devs at Turbine, because you can tell right away from your first moments in Middle Earth that there was some SERIOUS time and effort put into studying and implementing Tolkien's visions from the famous Lord of the Rings series into a vibrant game world. The scale of the game itself is incorrect (if it were correct then the game would be terrible, because crossing the map would take forever), but what IS mostly correct is the geography and topography of Middle Earth in video game form. From the icy peaks of Wildermore to the lush and colorful forests of Lothlorien; every zone is intricately crafted to match the descriptions found in Tolkien's masterworks, not only so that the areas are accurate, but also so that they are absolutely beautiful and lively to play in.(+) - SIZE AND SCOPE: I mentioned earlier that LOTRO's scale is largely inaccurate, but Middle Earth is still ENORMOUS. Seriously, it's hard to understate this. I've played open-world games like Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and LOTRO puts their game world sizes to shame. This, in turn, makes the game so much more immersive and memorable because there are just so many areas in the game, each with their own unique aspects and characteristics.(+) - ART STYLE: The devs at Turbine decided to adapt a more realistic graphical and artistic style, and in my opinion it really paid off. I will touch more on graphics in the ""cons"", but one thing that newer players to the game have to realize when playing LOTRO is that much of Middle Earth's charm isn't found in the textures and pretty effects, but rather in the creative and artistic direction that it aims to portray. LOTRO is such a beautiful game, and you can really tell throughout all of its scenery. It's difficult to talk about art direction for very long because everyone has their different interpretations on artistic superiority in video games, but in my eyes, LOTRO's art style should really be appreciated because it makes the game world stand out from many of today's newer MMORPGs.(+) - SOUNDTRACK: Another feature that makes LOTRO such an immersive game is its epic soundtrack. There's a wide variety of songs here (like, hundreds of themes), and each compliments their respective regions fittingly. Although I can't describe in detail what the music is like because I feel as though players will get a better handle of it by playing the game themselves, but I feel like the music is not only strong and melodic but also very atmospheric, which develops an even higher quality gaming experience throughout LOTRO's Middle Earth.(+) - COMMUNITY: LOTRO has, by far, the best online community I have ever experienced in ANY multiplayer video game. As a League of Legends player who constantly encounters toxic, rude, and straight up disrespectful players, I was very pleasantly surprised to see that LOTRO has a welcoming and kind community of many different members. I'm currently in a closely knit kinship with many different members that always speak to each other and take pleasure and helping each other out with the game. The thing is, it's not just my kinship! Among the ten servers, there are many awesome kins that are not only helpful but also very friendly, which just serves as a testament to why LOTRO is such a joy to play with others.CONS:(-) - PAYMENT MODEL: LOTRO's payment model remains to be my single biggest problem with the game and it's structure. I don't want to go too far in-depth because the model present here can be very confusing, but essentially, LOTRO is free up until you hit about level 30. After that point, you have two choices: you can either cough up some money (in some cases it can be quite a lot, I paid about $80 to unlock all of the game's questing and expansion packs), OR you can grind yourself into misery and depression as you do a bunch of boring tasks called ""deeds"" which range from ""Kill 360 of these monsters which you can only find in one concentrated area!"" to ""Run throughout an area and try to find specific locations!"" The problem is, even these tasks aren't unlimited, so you can only do so many until you run out and you can't earn any more premium currency. Don't be confused, this doesn't mean that LOTRO is ""pay to win,"" as there are no gamebreaking items or anything that you can buy with premium currency, it just means that instead of being ""free to play,"" as LOTRO advertises itself as, it's really more of a ""buy to play"" game.(-) - GRAPHICS: I hate to say it, but LOTRO just isn't a graphically pleasing game anymore. The game has been around since 2007, which makes it 8 years old and it really shows. Textures are muddy, distant objects are pixelated and the character models... don't even get me started. The character models are mostly just flat-out ugly and when most people get into the game, the deciding factor of whether they like it or not is going to be usually determined by the graphics, which is a shame, because I believe that LOTRO should be looked at not for its graphics, but rather for it's content. However, it's inevitable and I understand how people feel about it.(-) - COMBAT: Not much to say here. Some skill animations are cool, but the combat of LOTRO consists of very simple key combos and doesn't really provide much difficulty. When it takes you as long as I did to get to max level, this combat can get to be EXTREMELY monotonous and boring.TL;DR: If you're a fan of The Lord of the Rings and of MMORPG games, maybe even if you're not a die-hard fan like I am, there are still plenty of things to enjoy about LOTRO. It's gorgeous, it's lengthy, it has an extremely friendly community, and it's great for anyone who has ever wanted to explore what may be the best iteration of Middle Earth to ever be portrayed in a video game. However, if you're not crazy about The Lord of the Rings, there probably isn't much for you here. The graphics are very dated, the combat is often monotonous, and the payment model is arbitrarily confusing. There are plenty of other MMOs on the market too, and I can even recommend some! Go play RIFT, or TERA, those are modern day MMOs that do things right. Overall, if I could say one thing about the game that applies to all kinds of players, it's that you should at least try it out. It is free to start, and if you like it as much as I did, then you can buy the rest of the game and still have a great experience.			"

												The Helm's Deep expansion is disappointingly sophomoric for a game of LOTRO's artistic pedigree. While the epic quest/storyline continues to be interesting, the rest of the questing is saddled with tedious chores as players help various towns prepare for evacuation, or to resist the advance of the orcish hordes (while that OTHER fellowship goes off to do the exciting stuff); boars, barrels, and inane activities abound. LOTRO's questing content as literary work also seems to have been an age long past and beyond return. The text is mostly banal, contemporary, and ineloquent.Classes have been revamped, complete with unnecessary, WoW-like spec trees that restrict choices rather than give more. Players interested in overpowered classes will be glad; those hoping for an engaging overhaul will find combat over too unobligingly soon. Item levels have also been introduced/exposed; itemization inflation is set to soar, at a time when the MMO that popularized loot porn is contemplating an item squish to reign in the absurd circumstances they find themselves in. It's as if Turbine hired ex-Blizzard developers. It's difficult to recommend this expansion at the current offered price (US $40). If you can afford it, and are invested in the long range to seeing Gondor, Mordor, and the ending of the Dark Lord, then you're probably willing to endure the bad for the good, in which case, forth into ruin and a red dawn, and all that. Despite this expansion's insipidness, LOTRO remains one of the few verisimilar fantasy MMOs available, and the opportunity to experience it with new content is plenty and good enough reason to get Helm's Deep.

												Updated: 15, January, 2015 Does not reflect any additions or changes made in Update 14. Review:The Lord of the Rings Online as an MMORPG is one of the more polished one and has kept up with the times visually. The gameplay is very similar to you if you have played MMORPGs like World of Warcraft and Everquest and does not offer anything on this front you could not find from another game. Where LotRO shines is the lore, story and world design.The Lore stays true to that of Tolkien's works for the most part and, usually, what deviations exist usually are still in the spirit of the professor's works. The story follows the Lord of the Rings book trilogy's story mostly, with lot's of additional content that portrays events during the War of the Ring which are not delved into in detail in the books. The world design and art direction is great, what the game lacks in pure fidelity it well makes up for in design. Lord of the Rings Online offers an unrivaled experience when it comes to exploring and immersing yourself in Middle-Earth, from the burrows of the Shire to the plains of Rohan. The game will hit home with Tolkien fans who enjoy exploration, roleplaying and solo/small group oriented adventuring.Pros-Great Story, that follows the books faithfully and explores additional lore friendly events.-Good solo experience, the games focus has during the years switched to cater to solo players.-For fans of the Middle-Earth Legendarium-Very friendly to Roleplayers.-Gorgeous world.Cons-The game feels somewhat dated by now.-Lack of raids and traditional instances in later expansions. ( which might be alleviated if you are interested in alternative instance types, like the Skirmishes and Big Battles.) -Weak PvP-content. The PvP has been relatively stagnant and there doesn't seem to be much improvement on the horizon			"

												First major concern a lot of people have about LOTRO - is it dead?No. It still has a very healthy playerbase, big enough that the even the RP servers feel populated. So don't let your worries about population turn you away.This is a classic MMORPG. It's going to be familiar to anyone that has played Everquest, DAoC, WoW, etc. While it means you're not getting any particularly amazing new mechanics, the perk is that LOTRO has figured out how to get the best out of those systems. Leveling feels well-progressed, classes are (mostly) balanced, and there is a lot of variety even within the classes to provide lots of replay value and ways to mitigate strengths and weaknesses.LOTRO might have the best soundtrack I've ever heard. I recommend turning off battle music and just enjoying the compositions. Bree, as well as the various Inns and Halls located therein, have some fantastic scores attached to them.Let's be honest though - if you play LOTRO you're probably here because it's Lord of the Rings. And in that regard, you will not be disappointed. The game is steeped in the lore - books and films - and has little nods to it scattered everywhere that are rewarding for someone that is really into their Tolkien scholarship. This is not a LotR skin thrown over a MMORPG framework - this is Middle Earth proper. Even with dated graphics (updates are coming soon, as of this writing) it's still a joy to look at. If you're rolling through some place like the Shire, you'll be able to soak in that sleepy, bucolic atmosphere that the movies portrayed so well.This is a great MMO experience, and I usually find MMOs tedious. Moreover, it's free - so your excuses to at least try it out are non-existent.			"

												One mmoRPG to rule them all,one mmoRPG to find them,one mmoRPG to bring them all,and in front of their pc bind them!...A must for the fans of Tolkiens work, everyone else will find a technical (well) aged MMORPG with a beautiful (and overall realistic) artstyle and superb storytelling. The microtransactions hurts the atmosphere a bit, but you can get alot for free and choose what you pay for, overall I think it is one of the best f2p mmorpg systems on the market. The game offers alot of possibilities for true RPG players, and the community is mostly mature and helpful. And there is no PvP, only PvMP on instanced battlefields (Player vs Monsterplayer = one side controls creatures of evil), whatever that means to you (to me that means no ganking or griefing, alot less flame, and overall a nicer atmosphere and less to be worried about ;))			"

												The Lord of the Rings Online, a wonderful open-world game. Freedom and quests are great but when you first start you can't just roam free... Well, you have to do the 'Prologue/Intro' where you do many quests for either the hobbits, dwarfs, elfs, men or beorning but once you have done that, you are free to roam. I found the 'Prologue/Quests' not too irritating but it does take longer to level up the higher your level gets. The races you can chose from are:~Human~Dwarf~Hobbit~Elf~BeorningSome classes include:~Champion~Hunter~Captain~Guardian~Minstrel~Warden~Lore-Master~eceteraGreat game! 11/10			"

												I've played this game since 2007 autumn (way before it was added to steam) I know that i clocked over 6-8k hours of it on xfire when i played it as most, that does not include the time i was also off-xfire and my steam hours.But to be fair i probably got over 10k hours in this game. I've seen it from it's early release to it's current days.Since i live in the EU i started playing this game when the EU part of it was run by Codemasters.My first memories of the game are probably some of the strongest memories i got from any game out there, it had a enourmous depth in the game world, i remember running around in Ered Luin and questing (this was before they added quest trackers, so you actually had to READ the quests to get directions of where to go - this was a key thing for a immersive exploration that this game world deserverd.)As you crossed borders in the game the music tune changed to something bit more dramatic or peaceful, i ran around for hours just exploring casually, stumbling across named mobs that dropped ""rare"" crafting materials. At some quest you had to group up to complete them, it took some waiting time but it was a lot of fun doing so - some even remained grouped and decided to quest together after these instance quests. An easy way to develop friends in the game at a early stage.Once the first area was done you were to set off to Bree, the current main city of the humans back then (while Rivendell was for elves, Thorin's Hall for dwarves, The Shire for Hobbits) My first time i did this i had no clue about fast travelling, this was my first MMO after all. So i ran through the entire Shire and Western Bree-Fields, this is nearly the size of two maps and it did take some time doing so, but it was amazing!I later tried out all classes and i got very attatced to being Captain, i raided and did high lvl instances with it. Carn Dûm being one of the best instances ever in my experience, it was massive and it took a decent amount of time to do it not to mention the loot you could get from it and the challenge it gave. (this was before GlobalLFF was born and way before world chat was born, so you had to use map chats to recruit people + no instance finder was there)The raids was Rift and Helegrod, both were amazing, Rift being 12 man while Helegrod was 24. There was also open raid bosses out in the world that could drop thropies, a fun addon.So, why dont i recommend this game after the experiences i've had with it?Well it all started with Mines of Moria, Turbine added something called ""hope gear"" (later renamed to radiance) this was something crucial for Moria raiding, without it you would die nearly instantly since your morale would be -80% at worst or so. This could be considered ""tiered gear progression"", you need to achieve tier one to be able to raid in tier two (tier one being instances). But the major fault here was the ""Legendary Weapons"". This eliminated all other weapons in the game more or less, crafted weapons became completely useless, normal weapon drops? Useless that too. Classes that could dual wield had a purpose to get a normal weapon, but your main focus were placed on Legendary Weapons.At a start, legendary weapons was a massive grind, massive RNG. You wanted it to be perfect, so you had to be lucky when you ""identified"" them to see your legecies on them (legecies being stat boosts like boosting certain damage on skills, crit damage, cooldown rate etc etc) and the maximum legacies was 4 when you identified them + 3 reforges after you would be on 7 legacies, then you had to be lucky that you would be given the right legacies. (back then there was no store to buy legacies off, if i remember correctly you could not farm other legendary weapons either and deconstruct them for their legacies to put on your main weapon, the legacies you were given were then ones you had to live with, if you did not like it then you had to start over on another weapon).This entire system was extremely time consuming, and it became very crucial at certain points in raiding.Turbine later decided to trash the radiance system in later Mirkwood i think or early Enedwaith. This was a GOOD move.But the legendary system remained as a plague and even exists today, every update, 5 levels extra, our legendary weapon was uselss and you had to upgrade - endless gear treadmill at a maximum level.But then it came, the major issue. And there are only three words for it.Free to Play.At this point, many of us lifetime players were very uncertain at this, microtransactions was a thing too since the store got added at the same point. This was added with Enedwaith or Ost Dunholt raid.So what happend after this is how i could call it ""the huge war between the casual players and the raiders"" - raiding gear started to became non unique since everyone could get them easily, turbine eliminated the true challenge for raids and gorup content. Suddently you could not see the difference between a decent raider and a shire potato farmer.They added skirmishes with Mirkwood, this became a massive disappointment, now it's a forgotten content, entirely. In the end, the casuals won this war. We raiders got more or less not wanted anymore, our voices was not heard. And of course, if your major playerbase are casuals then you develop more things for them, add more pay to win items in the store to please them, you could be working 20-40 hours on your first age legendary weapon, grind those legacies, max it out, make it perfect. While the guy next to you could spend 40 euros and max it out from store within 10 minutes by buying the legacies he wanted and relics even. Turbine started to revamp the old areas we had in Shadow of Angmar. Making it more easy for new players, ruining the immersive feeling in those areas and instances, eliminated exploration entierly and made questing linear, it became like following an invisible red line through the maps, more dead then alive.They butchered the first instance, by splitting it up in three wings, it became faster to complete, but the feeling died with it too. They butchered one of the most glorious mid lvl instanced called Fornost, and that was my final straw. I personally dont find it funny to have one major boss in each instance due to they simplifying them. The old dungeons had many minor bosses you could run into (sure you could get lost many times but you will learn local direction as time goes by, now a hamster could do it)They ruined pvp by adding ""Audacity"" a specific pvp stat, that killed many builds since we were forced to wear pvp gear (that was mediocre compared to our raiding gears). Turbine have never been able to balance pvp beteen the Free Peoples and the Servants of Angmar. (freeps and creeps)Most balanced was during Shadow of Angmar, and even then it was not entierly perfect either. We was promised a new PvMP map in 2008 i think, we got it 2015 - and i don't think they worked on this for 7 years, if you have seen it with your own eyes you can see for yourself that 7 years work was not dedicated for this.LoTRO's reputation has sunk entierly, most of us that loved this game is waiting for it's killing blow, the announcement of  the servers being closed so it will die with some dignity and honor, but thats too late now since everything is gone.Many new players, those who began after f2p might still love this game - they never got to experience it's true glory.Now LoTRO is just a p2w exploited game. The developers have run out of ideas and just sprinting to reach mordor then end it. They copy paste old structures in new content (minas tirith got the wall textures that are around isengard, the white city, with a black obsidan wall protecting it - call it what you like, but thats not acceptable.I highly advice you to stay away from this game, it's not worth your time, trust me.

 Heads up, my review was too long for the review box so I will post the remainder in follow up comments Comments include Pay Model and Summary Well, I feel its time to give this game a fair summary. Lord of the Rings Online is true to the T to Tolkiens Trilogy: The Lord of the Rings. Bare in minds this means a lot of differences if you expect there to be assimilations to the movies. That being said the books h definately delved deeper into the lore and ideas that Tolkien wanted to explore when creating the world of Arda.A little backstory:Lord of the Rings Online is now a little over 9 years old as of the creation of this review and is sadly speculated to be taken down in the coming  years due to lack of funding and rights to the ownership through warner brothers. Many many players have come in and out of this game over the years to experience myriad updates and journeys. I myself started my journey into LotRO 3 years prior to now. And I found what the definition of an MMO truely is.I have witnessed but a third of LotRO's life span but in that time have finished the story up to update 18 with my hunter reached the half way mark in leveling with a Rune-Keeper and had fun exploring and challenging other classes along with friends to the rough mark of level 20. With this I can tell you LotRO is a wonderful game.Why?LotRO provides and caters to all types of players. Hardcore MMO players can bash out levels swiftly find tough solo and multiplayer challenges at end game and the casual gamer who is in here for the experience can still sink many hours enjoying the combat and content the game has to offer.What are some of the things you can do in LotRO?Craft: Choose a proffession with 3 crafting skills within allowing you to create gear for yourself and harvest materials for friend that have different skills you can cater for. Hunt for materials, gather and make. Its simple and rewarding.RolePlay:LotRO allows players the freedom of doing what an MMO was designed for and it hits the mark harder than any other game, as a hunter I can make a campfire just out the town of Bree, smoke some pipe-weed, much on Lembas bread and listen to my kin play their music. By this I mean you can litterally do player made music and it is wonderful. People will spare time to listen to and you feel like a star when it happens.Fight:When you start the game you have the option for quite a few classes such as Guardian, Minstrel & Lore-Master. Each inspired by characters from Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. They each give you a unique play style and can be customised down trait trees to a specific deriverative of the class. Build yourself to play alone or to fight aloneside friends almost all classes can be brought to many different styles of combat and it does not get dull. The combat will set you up with a few working combo's but nothing really true, it leaves it up to you to fight the way you want and build abilities how you like. The combat itself feels smooth and satisfying, sound effects are on point and really feel good. Animations may be a bit dated but they still work well and feel fairly suited. You cans tart fighting weak enemies in your starting region. Move on to groups of mobs and eventually come to fight some that learn to buff themselves or gather squads to group up and take you down. The enemies change themselves up as you play through the game and it feels good learn to take your new opponents down. Or to crush them beneathe your heel when you have out leveled them.UI:The HUD and UI of LotRO has to be hands down the most customisable interace I have used in gaming... ever. absolutely everything can be moved and scaled EVERYTHING and it isn't difficult to do either.Audio:The audio is astounding rarely do you get a game that really slots the soundtrack perfectly into place but by the Gods if anything will be remembered about this game for year to come it will be the music. No you will not here the iconic shire theme or theme of the fellowship but they are replaced with equally memorable unique and above all amazing soundtracks. If you don't believe me wait until you enter Bree and tell me you can forget that wonderful rythm.Atmosphere:Now LotRO isn't exactly new and some fault it immediately for lack of texture quality or too little amount of polygons simply to forget the appeal of video game graphics when they are OPEN WORLD. This might be hard to get by at first but you can quickly come to appriciate how wonderful Middle-Earth actually looks. The design is for the big picture, zoom out your camera run into the distance the world is created picture perfect plains are open, hills steep ruins are run down and towns are bustling its all how it is meant to be in an RPG and mostly it feels like THE LORD OF THE RINGS.Gameplay:LotRO gives you a few things to do in the gameplay area. Quests the main scenario will take you through your own story as the saviour of Western Middle-Earth; Eriador and your fight against the shadows of Angmar. Later scenarios take you on the story to follow the Fellowship and fight for your life along side Rohan and Gondor. Side quests offer real rewards that are worth your time. Neatly set up so nearby quest objectives are as they should be, close to each other for convinience and a lot of enjoyment when handing them in by bulk. There is other stuff available to you as well such as deeds and skirmishes. Thse are the staples that make LotRO LotRO. Now most MMOs have their conventional dungeons but Lord of the Rings Online changed things up a bit with small enemies engagements similar to that of a dungeon. You may sometimes be running into a camp blind to wipe it of enemies take position fight counter attacks and be rewarded with loot but you might sometimes be defending and have some groups of goblins or tough Lietenants of the enemy pushing your ground for control. These are great fun to do with your friends on and can be done at all levels and for good rewards at that. Deeds are the second staple. Deeds allow you to go out into the world fulfill your duty as a hero and explore. Some are tough but they can be worth your time if you put that time into them. Deeds ask you to do a set number of tasks in each region of the world such as kill so many enemies, find certain objects, explore different places and help people out (quests). Each deed rewards you with Turbine points [which I will get to in the next section] & hard deeds will give you virtues which can be put towards buffing your character. Some give you marks a currency for trading to buy new gear and crafting recipes. Some give you loot-boxes you can open for free stuff. It ends up being worth it and seeing you have completed deeds in your log for an area is one of the most satisfying things in gaming I have experienced yet.			"

												Ive got a love/hate relationship with this game. Love:- Its lord of the rings, with all the epic story, characters, locations and events from the books (or films)- Huge world that has vastly different locations to play in.- In depth game systems and mechanics that dont treat you like a brainless idiot gamer, actually requiring you to learn the game and how to master it.- Its free (well, sorta.)- Due to its dated graphic engine, I can run this game completely on ultra high maxed out settings, and still get super high performance (and most things look pretty nice, especially the world graphics)- Its got dwarves, my favorite race.- Its got years of content to keep you busy.Hate:- Dated graphics engine. While i can max out the settings, and some things look nice, other things, like character graphics, are just UH GLEE. Dwarf beards look awful. Most hairstyles look awful. Many textures in the game are super low res/blurry, even using the high res texture pack. The game can also suffer from bad ""pop up/pop in"" in areas, especially with trees. (would love it if turbine would update some of these things)- Unintuitive mechanics. Especially when it comes to quests. So many quests (especially early on), not only dont really tell you what they want you to do exactly, but really dont even point you in the right direction. The UI sometimes helps by saying ""go in this direction"" but not always. And when you get in the general area you are supposed to be in, you are still left trying to figure out exactly what it is you are supposed to do. Ive played The Secret World, and THAT game required a LOT of investigation and brainstorming to solve quests. This games quests, have simple objects that are simply cumbersum to complete due to bad design. This isnt an issue of ""hand holding"" or making the game easy. Its probablly one of the things that drives a lot of new players away. Factor in the horribly worthless and unhelpful game map, and new gamers are going to feel like getting even a simple delivery quest done to be a major frustrating chore.- This game really clings to the ""You have to wait to you are higher level to do the fun stuff"" mentality.  Its seems like all the improved gameplay, better design content, group play aspects, and cool events are designed for players level 45 and up. They also require the paid DLC like Moria and Helms Deep. (which is fine if you like the game. One time fees arent an issue). This ""low levels are boring and slow and you just have to endure through them"" mentality however, is yet another thing that will drive away players. (which is probably one of the reasons why the game is suffering from server population issues.- Super boring and grindy quests (especially at low levels). Short of the epic storyline (which makes up about 5% of the low level content), most of the quests in this game fall into 2 categories. Fedex quests (especially if you are a hobbit), and kill quests. No attempt is made to really stray from these either. If you HATE fedex (deliver this item to steve for me!) quests, I seriously recommend NOT starting out in the Shire.- Lack of low level group content. Pretty much everything low level can be easily solo'd. Even most of the elites you have to fight. The games first dungeon isnt until 20+, and due to the lack of low level players, good luck finding a group for that. In fact, the group finding tool is 99% worthless to low level players. If you are wanting to play this game for the multiplayer aspect, to group with people, its not something you will really experience until you reach much higher levels. My advice, bring a friend or two along when you start playing this.- Not as Free 2 Play as some other more recent F2P games. Lotro is more of a ""Free to try"" game. More than a demo, or a 2 week trial, but dont expect a DC Universe or Neverwinter experience. If you dont plan on spending ANY money, its impossible to get to max level in this game. (100). Starting around 35, you will find yourself out of areas to quest in that are free. This will require you to make 1 time purchases to get a ""zone"" of content which will get you through the next handful of levels. At a certain point, you will most likely need to spend money on some of the games DLC. However, the DLC is priced decently. In fact, you can get the first FOUR (out of 5) DLC packs together on steam for like 40 bucks. However, if you are looking for a completely free playthrough of the entire game, this is not the game for you.SummaryOverall, this game is well made, and full of content (some good, some bad). There is a lot of choice and variety to be had, and a set of mechanics and gameplay that leans more towards old school mmo's rather than the simplistically brain dead mechanics of some newer games out there. However, be prepared to google/wiki/forum search for answers about things in the game, because there will be plenty of things you will need to learn.If you are ok with spending SOME money on the game, my recommendation is to play to about 20-25 first to see if you enjoy it. Then pick up a VIP subscription for a couple months (30 bucks for 30 months last i checked), and eventually grab the 4 pack of DLC. That is probably the best bang for your buck, giving you as much of the game to experience without it feeling like a paywall is locking you out any further.			"

												I have played  a lot of MMO Games intensely over the years. As every fan of the genra kows, most have major flaws, or are just bad copycats of World of Warcraft. This game stands far aside of the common I call it standardised MMO. It's a game I can recommend to anyone that does like the Lord of the Rings story, because that's where this game has it's strength.If you are seeking for fast paced action like MMO's like World of Warcraft has become nowadays, then this is the wrong game.When should you give it a real try?- If you are a player that enjoys the original sense of an RPG: exploring a world, without the target to rush your character to a crazy maximum.- If you like storytelling, because the world with it's combined storytelling is what makes this game, there is no other MMO around that merges these two things and presents them to you while you play like this.- If you want a real relaxation, I could never lay back and chill out to an MMO that well as to this, while definately not being boringAltough it's a free to play title, there is no such thing as pay to win, nor would it even matter. I absolutely hate common f2p models, because they ruin all the fun because you feel like being begged in any point at the game.Here, you get your expanision, pay a month of vip, have a lot of stuff permanentely unlocked, such as character slots and goldlimits, and there you go. If you want to advance, get an expansion and keep on. There is no need for starters to instantly buy any expansions, because you can have a lot of things to explore if you play the game with the aim to enjoy the story.			"

												I would have recommended this game a year or two ago. But they keep adding stupid ways to get people to pay and complicate the game. They keep adding several new things to character development and makes it so complicated i wouldn't even bother with learning it just so they can get you to spend more cash to unlock upgrades in them. They break promises about the main questline remaining F2P. Quality of quests are also dropping.In short: AVOID, this game was good but now it's just becoming a pay to win fest.			"

												Lord of the Rings online was a lot better back in 2007 at launch or up to 2 years after it. But time has changed as did Lord of the Rings online, so I will comment on how the game is now.Lord of the Rings online is almost a MUST PLAY for every Tolkien fan. The developer always works close with the Middle-Earth Enterprise (the license holder of Tolkiens legacy) to make sure that the game is very close to the lore. A lore that's one of the most richest ones in the whole Fantasy genre.The game world is very well done and gives you a very good feeling of how Tolkien meant Middle-Earth to be. Weather you visit Bree to take a drink at the Prancing Pony, take a stroll across Rivendell or walk through the Mines of Moria, the world feels quite real.One of the best features of Lord of the Rings online is the epic story. At the start of the game your character is about 3 months behind the Fellowship. While playing through the 'original' game (the one that was released in 2007), you'll stay behind the Fellowship, only to catch up with them in Rivendell at some time.The epic story does not tell the story of the Fellowship or your character though. Instead it tells a story of what's happening all around Middle-Earth and reveals things that are not written in the book.Game play though is an other thing. For a MMORPG there's very little player interaction in the lower levels. Mainly the last 2 expansions (Riders of Rohan and Helm's Deep as of this writing) are the places where you need to party to get your progress in the epic story. In the 'older' expansions the game has been modified so that you can actually play the old party content all alone, which I think is a sad thing.In all, I think Lord of the Rings online is still a very good MMORPG for it's age and I hope that Turbine will be able to extend it's license (about to expire in 2014 and no word about it so far) so that we can play the game for an other 5 years			"

												There are a ton of MMORPGs out there.  I admit, I got into this one after it went Free to Play.  Well... what sucked me in for 4000+hours, was the fact that you can earn in the game, the same points you need to purchase with cash money, in order to get the expansion packs.  So... even though you can purchase your way up the levels faster, by spending money on the quest packs that pay off in XPs and level development, you can also grind your way to those same level packs.Meaning, it truly *is* Free to Play.There are benefits to making a single cash purchase of some Turbine points... it changes your status permanently up one notch... this gives you an additional character slot.  LOTRO actually encourages the creation of a character created soley for the purpose of grinding the early Turbine Points that are far easier to get (deeds where you have to kill 45 enemies to earn points... as opposed to the deeds not that much further on in the ""pay"" areas where you have to kill 150... or 450 to earn the same number of Turbine Points).  You create a character, run through those deeds... hopefully with a friend or two... and delete that chacter.  Then... make another.  It is a great use for the third slot... until you earn enough Turbine Points to purchase another slot.That, and you get to try different characters and builds.The crafting is very detailed.  You will be creating characters that are good at one thing.  It is even possible to have a character that you don't actually know how to play well... but that you have levelled to great heights only through crafting.  You can also increase a character's crafting skill far beyond their capacity to survive in the areas where they would need to gather the raw materials they need.  This makes the in-game player store system... the auction house... much more of an integral part of the game.  That.. or you use your second character to go out and gather materials, and then store them in your shared bank... or your house storage.The fact that it is set in the Tolkien Universe is a huge bonus.  Everyone should play a hobbit once.Maps are large.... and the scenery is great.  It is fun to ride around when you are high enough level not to attract mobs.  Many players go into the game, to spend time in Bree and hang out with friends.Add it.  Play it.  Costs nothing but time.  Definitely worth more than that.			"

												Since my gametime (off Steam hitting around 10k) is ridiculously high i figured i'd give an in-depth review of the game both on a leveling and end game basis for both new players and potential returning players as well. This review will be done on a positive/indifferent/negative basis.Positives: + Class variation and static roles: . You play as a Minstrel, you'll be healing. You play as a Guardian, you'll be tanking etc. Some classes such as Beornings and RKs can do multiple jobs, but the game follows the old school MMO system (as expected given its age). Over 9 classes to choose from all with unique roles both end game and unique abilities and playstyles while leveing and questing.+ Graphics:     The game graphically has aged like fine wine and is still appealing to the eye, especially in the more recently released zones. The revamped zones in low level areas and the new regions in Gondor are more up to date and places such as North Ithilien are breahtaking. The artstyle that LOTRO offers fits the game perfectly. + The Main Story:   The overarching plot is fantastic at least in Volume 1 + 4, with Volume 2 being good and Volume 3 being 'okay'.  There are currently 4 volumes (the latter still underway). + Music/OST:     This has always been top notch and they've done a great job, especially in places such as Moria, Angmar, Rohan & Gondor to truly capture Tolkiens works in the flesh through the music that is played while venturing around.+ The Lore:    This is without doubt the closest to the literature source you can find in game or video form. Fantastic job in sticking and expanding upon Tolkiens works. + F2P:   I could go on about this for hours but looking at it from the perspective of a new player, and the ability to buy the content with in-game currency and not pay a single penny (Unless you want to PvP) is pretty astounding. Naturally it's grindy as hell but it's free, so you can't really complain. + Raiding:  At the time of this review there is plenty of end game content to keep you busy, some more difficult than others that require a kinship (Guild), voice communication as well as understanding the instance and your class respectively. + Landscapes/Open World: This speaks for itself. LOTRO is huge, and the atmosphere and immersion in some locations is phenomonal. Places such as Moria, Lothlorien, Minas Tirith, Mirkwood etc really stand out as the pinnacle of world building in this game.Indifferent Points:=Optimization: Game crashes are a thing as is lag, especially in highly populated zones. Can be game/immersion breaking.= PvMP:   PvMP (Player vs Monster Player) has so many positives but also a few negatives (as well as lack of any development pretty much since its release from the Developers in 10 years except for attempted balances between classes). The skill level for PvP is insane and that makes it both fun and enjoyable. If you enjoy a challenge PvP is definetly the hardest part of the game to play well. There are plenty of great and friendly players in PvP on both sides, but also a very negative and childish community that ruins it which can potentially  make you lose interest if you don't learn to ignore the chat. That's PvP for you. There are, as in many MMOs 'flavour of the month classes' that are OP with updates, the only issue is that given how small Standing Stones team are and the lack of monthly updates (Updates are released less frequently than in bigger MMOs such as ESO, FFXIV, WoW etc) it's an on going dilemma. = Developer Interaction:   This isn't really a positive or negative but in comparison to how the game used to be (under Codemasters in Europe) when developers and GameMasters used to interact with the community very frequently, the lack of actual interaction between players and the Dev Team (outside of the Community Manager through Twitch & Forums) leaves room for improvement and more engagement. Despite this in recent months this has improved slightly, so hopefully we'll see more involvement from the team with in-game events in the future.= Roleplaying:     I'm not someone who roleplays in LOTRO so i can't offer much feedback on this. The community is, for the most part really friendly and welcoming and there are servers specifically for Roleplaying, so it must be good!.=Crafting:     Crafting is something, in most MMOs (with the exception of ESO) that i've never really enjoyed. I don't mind crafting in LOTRO when i need too but i don't take any particular pleasure in doing it.. If you enjoy crafting in other MMOs you'l likely enjoy it in this game as it has many viable purposes (from leveling gear, to consumables to end game relics). It's also part of questing as many of the crafing items you need can be found while playing and leveling through the game in each area. I'd stick this as a positive except it honestly isn't anything overly special that stands out. It's just 'there'.Negatives: - End Game Grind:     While people seem to enjoy leveling alts (and while you can skip it with Valar upgrades to boost your character, bearing in mind you'll have to go back and do your deeds and learn your class anyway so it's pointless) you will pretty much have to go through the exact same content again from 1-105. While you can level in certain different areas for some levels you will have to venture through Moria, Rohan, Gondor on multiple toons. The issue isn't so much leveling (which is fun) but the grind you need to achieve a playable character for end game content. I could write an entire paragraph detailing how bad grinding to be 'raid ready' is (in an effort by Devs to keep people in game between major updates i assume) if people want an overview, but in a nutshell you have to; Obtain 83 Class Points, Get around 10+ Virtue Traits to level 20 Each. You'll have to level, upgrade, reequip and grind items for your legendary weapons. You'll have to grind essences and then craft them by obtaining crafting items from many different sources through grinding them to get the required essences you want, and even then you aren't guaranteed the best essences. ^ If Standing Stones made this less grindy (especially the essence and legendary item grind) for ALT characters, it would make the end game grind more approachable for people to do it more than once without making it feel like a chore. - Class Development:   In a nutshell; Beornings were released and are a broken mess and have been with only one patch since they were released. An introduction to a new race/class and little changes shows a lack of care, at least in my eyes for the finished product or player feedback. I haven't seen a new skill (or ability) on my main class in years. What happened?! Further more there are now MANY useless skills on multiple classes that haven't been made viable or addressed in years. This also goes for legendary legacies on legendary weapons. An example on Loremaster (My Main) is; Gust of Wind on Loremaster. Completely pointless. Ents go to War is no longer as viable as it used to be and Natures Fury is pretty much pointless as well in class rotations except for its pretty animations. - Side Quests/Missions:     This is more nitpicking but the sidequests in LOTRO (There are exceptions) are.....typical MMO fetch or kill quests. While some of the side quests have interesting stories and background with the lore, nothing has ever really stood out when questing in LOTRO outside of the Main Quest and stories. The actual stories that go along with the quests have improved considerablly since release, so perhaps i'm being abit harsh here. Despite this if you've played through Minas Tirth and done the questchain there, you'll know where i'm coming from when i say it's far from enjoyable at times. It has its ups and downs..- Mounted Combat:   Speaks for itself. It wasn't asked for and hasn't been used since Rohan effectively or at all outside of a couple of scenarios. End: Recommended :)!

												I will start off with a few good points as to why i would recommend this game (Only slightly) to people who enjoy mmos with a already created universe. The game does a pretty good job at recreating  the lotr universe of Middle-Earth or at least it did at one point. For you see it would seem the worlds are almost empty, If you are thinking of just playing cusually then get ready to grind like hell to get the turpine points to buy most of the items you need in-game. For example you need turpine points to buy the riding skill early game and alot of the other good cosmetic items, but dont get me wrong i like how you can actually get the coins with out having to pay real money it will just take a long time to get them. With the Semi pay-to-win out of the way there is the problem of the servers drying up, beacuse if you are wanting to get into this game now unless you are starting with someone get ready to walk the halls alone. There are a good amount of pros and cons to cover aslso-Pros-well crafted maps-decent gaming community-not entirely pay-to-win-story with an interesting twist-crafting is rather good-Cons-close to empty servers-lots of grinding for ""turbine points""-some glitches (though what games don't)-armour doesn't have the greatest apeal in the looksThe lists can go on for both but that is always up to the indivual person, because i have found you can't always go off of reviews you have to figure out if you like the game yourself. That being said i wrote this just to educate the people who might want to start playing this game and hopefully turbine might see this and lay off the pay-to-win a little but. So all in all it is rather fun, i guess i might have something to do with my love for Lotr.<Just clearing up i have played this game for humdreds of hours outside of steam>			"

												I've been wanting to write a review for LotRO for a long time, but every time I attempt it, I find that I cannot do the game justice. Nonetheless, I love it enough that I owe it one.I have played LotRO since 2007, and save a few hiatuses, I still play to this day. With that much history, I am sorely tempted to go into a long-winded tirade about all of my experiences with this game, how I feel about all of the changes it has endured, and share my thoughts about how it ended up where it is today. It is difficult at times to get across your point and enthuisasm without including the aforementioned. However, as this is meant to be a review and not a novel, I will attempt to refrain from that and keep my focus on the point. LotRO is a very story-based and driven game, as you might expect from an MMO derived from Tolkien's works. While it does have the common fetch-and-kill quests and sometimes redundant feeling tasks that you'll find in every MMO, by and large the quests are compelling and fulfilling. This is especially true of the Epic quests, which deal with the members of the Fellowship of the Ring and their actions. The world is expansive and highly immersive, and there is adventure to be had everywhere, in many different forms. With a few exceptions, the development team is incredibly loyal to and respective of Tolkien's writings and based the landscape and heart of Middle Earth off of the books, not the Peter Jackson movies. You will not find another game, anywhere, that has as much love for Tolkien’s works as the Lord of the Rings Online. It felt warm and grand when I first started, and it still does today.That being said, LotRO has been around for a very long time. It has numerous bugs and suffers from issues you might expect from a game of its age. Speaking strictly in terms of MMOs, it does not have the end game content or high numbers of raids that you might be looking for or expect. It is limited in what it can implement for mechanics and flashy gameplay; It runs on an engine built in 2002, originally used on Asheron's Call 2. It has numerous bugs and flaws that continue to harry it despite attempted fixes and updates. Those who feel so inclined can purchase many perks and advantages through the in-game store, which is obnoxious in its attempts to get you to notice and use it. Its population has waned in recent years, as have the resources devoted to it. Likewise, its focus on group play has lessened. Essentially, if you are looking for the more common focuses of MMOs these days, meaning lots of raiding, end game and group content, PvP, top of the line graphics, flashy gameplay, etc, you will not find that here in levels that will satisfy you.Nonetheless, the game looks impressive - running it on high graphics, it hides its age extremely well. The community remains one of the friendliest and most helpful to be found in MMOs, and whether you enjoy RP or not, there are plenty of tools and resources available to cater to both casual and extreme role-players. There exists plenty of humor and easter eggs hidden around for casual players or huge Tolkien nerds to find. To steal a quote from a blog I read recently, ""It has a heart and soul that very few games can boast of having, and those looking only at the graphics, technicalities and the gameplay to judge an MMO won’t be able to appreciate its true worth, ever. LotRO is not a trendy game, possibly never will be, and it’s most likely better for it. .... we fans get to have a game that is worthy of Tolkien’s work, despite any and all flaws."" And there you have it. If you're looking for story and exploration, love Tolkien's works, or want a friendly and reasonably casual MMO to tinker around with, LotRO is an amazing choice. Despite all of its flaws, it is a gem amongst games, and is the most faithful and successful attempt at visualizing Tolkien's world. I have, would, and will strongly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Tolkien in any way.			"

												For everyone wondering wether to play or not to play this game. I think there was never a better time starting this game. It has loads of content. Combat system is really good. Leveling is awesome in this game. There is so much to do. It is not just a game were you log in and play questing non-stop. You can craft, play skirmishes or just hang out in bree and chat. There is alot of end game content and surely lots more to come.The game is completly free. You get the areas from 1-30 for free. Then you need to purchase quests packs with turbine points. You can gather turbine points in game while playing. It is a little grind but it isn't that bad cuz you would do those things anyway eventually.If you have any questions then you could send me a private message. I will gladly help			"

												I'm going to make this quick and simple.  Play lotro for the world.  It is the best realization of tolkein's Middle Earth in a video game, period.  The early level questing up until level 60 or so is a joyous experience either solo or with friends.  End game the grind sets in and if you like min maxing you certainly can, but be prepared to devote some time.  Don't play for pvp, it's essentially dead.  The world and community keep lotro moving along, and as long as that holds true I will never leave it.			"

												The number of hours that I have played this game through steam does not even come close to the actual number of hours played as I've also played this game through turbine's own launcher.This is the one MMO which I always come back to. Over the years I've taken a few breaks from the game but I always crawl my way back, and am welcomed back with open arms. The game is showing signs of age and graphically it can struggle, especially in the newer areas (Minas Tirith for example) but throughout this I still come back and love this game with all my heart.I have recently completed the epic quest line where the riders of rohan comes to the aid of Gondor, riding through the pelennor fields - Riding side by side with Theoden and his riders - OMG my heart was in my mouth for the entire instance and I only wished it had lasted for longer.I originally started on Withywindle and with the recent server merges have moved to Evernight. Everyone will have something different that draws them to Lotro but for me it has always been the social aspect. Finding the right kinship for me changed this game to something that I look forward to playing. This is a game that if you put the time and effort into can be completely F2P - There are plenty of TP farming guides around and if you have the patience to grind you can buy almost everything from the store. Saying that I would recommend going VIP at least once within the game. There are a few perks that are unlocked (swift travel for example) that you cannot purchase through the store, and the amount of love and time turbine put into the gameplay and story it is worth giving a little back to them - They can get a lot of negativity but if not for them then I would not have this game that I so love to play.

												As a veteran of MMOs (and MUDs before that) I would have to recommend this game for several reason.-F2P: Its actually free to play. The RMT (real money trade) store items are mostly cosmetic. There are some that effect gameplay convenience wise. However, the RMT currency (Turbine Points) can be also earned in game in many different ways. Basically, the game gives you RMT currency as a side result of playing.-The Community. The community is not the typical MMO trollfest. MOST players you come across are more than willing to lend a hand, give advice or even (sometimes) free items etc. They are very friendly and generally tend to help the new players out.-Social MMO. Despite this game having boatloads of grindy combat like any other MMO, there are many  unique social aspects to this game. Making/playing your own musical instruments in a band, player/guild housing etc.-Massive world. The gameworld in this is rather big. While certain areas are locked out until you purchase the expansion, there are equivalent zones for the free (budget) player.-Customer Support is very ... human. And tends to be helpful with the player rather than absolute sticklers to policy.-Mounted Combat/Legendary Weapons/Raids/Dungeons/Crafting/Typical MMO stuff etc., etc.,CONS:-I had performance issues on my budget laptop. The game can get very laggy with xpacs and infusion of players.-WoW ruined any mmo without flying mounts ><TL:DR give it a spin if you like mmos. While it doesn't break any new ground in the genre it is a solid game with unique social aspects.			"

												At beginning LotRO is very confusing, first time i played LotRO back in 2010, i hated it, but i played just a few hours, got bored and never touched it again.But then i decided to give another shot and really forced me into it (huge Tolkien fan), i started to understand and find the game amazing in every way, PvE and PvP are outstanding in their own unique way. The best community in an MMO by far, everyone willing to help and teach you with a Shaolin Monk patience, they would even talk with me in portuguese (my main language) using Google translator so i would feel more included in the community.The best MMORPG i've played so far.And it comes from a guy which have played all the top MMOs for years (such as Tibia, Runescape, MU, UO, LineAge 2, Ragnarok, WoW, PW, ArcheAge, TERA)			"

												LOTRO is a wonderful MMO by any standards, but to fans of Tolkien's works it achieves something far greater than any other game. A huge recreation of Middle-Earth, with a lot of it's characters and plentiful lore to be found amongst the beautiful scenarios. The game is free, so you might as well try it, even if you're not into MMOs or Lord Of The Rings (who knows, maybe you'll get hooked?) and unlike most F2P games, it is NOT pay2win, and you'll probably have no need to pay any money to keep playing until arround level 30-something, when you need more quests (people usually complain that you also need to purchase the riding skill, but this is false, as the game rewards you with store points very often, for completing some actions, and by the time you are able to buy a horse, you'll have more than enough for the riding skill.).So, bottom line is, a truly wonderful game, that remains true to LotR lore without sacrificing gameplay in anyway, with a great community and pretty inexpensive to play for a really long time.Oh, you can also slap people with a fish.10/10			"

My personal favorite part of the game is there is absolutely NO requirement to spend real life money to get everything the game has to offer. Just grind the turbine points, if you dont know how, then the great and powerful google has all the answers. Definitely give it a try, you can't go wrong.			"

												The Lord of the Rings Online bears the name of one of the most famous books in the English language. If you are a fan of the aforementioned books then LotRO has a lot to offer you. It's rich in material from the books, and despite its age still offers a detailed and beautiful rendering of Middle-Earth.If you are a fan of MMO's then LotRO is probably not the best bet. It is lacking in PvP (only one region allows for PvP, The Ettenmoors) instead opting to focus upon co-operative play and PvE. At the present point it is difficult finding beginning region play, with most activity occuring at current end-game level. This makes the beginning game play tiers somewhat lonely and more akin to a generic offline RPG than an actual MMO, just another reason why those wanting a true MMO experience will probably be put off.Another criticism (as with many free to play structured games) is the increasing reliance on Pay to Win structures in order to make money. This has somewhat unblanced the game and makes it especially difficult at lower tiers. The ability to buy most weapon enhancements and skill increases means those who pay will quickly outstrip those who do not.That said the community is wonderful. By and large most of the players are helpful and happy to proved assistance in various forms, with a level of maturity that is fairly uncommon to MMO's. It is also a fairly active community, it may not boast huge subscriber and player numbers but the players by and large are people who play regularly and consistently. In terms of roleplaying the RP servers are quite active, and regular events are held and arranged by players, yet further evidence of why the player community is one of the friendliest and active around.On the whole I would definitely recommend LotRO especially to those who are fans of the world, as it provides an extended experience of the literature. It is by no means a perfect game, and it is fairly old now. but seeing as it has lasted so long, is testament to not only the love of Tolkien's works but also to the dedication of its player base.

												I’m playing with an increasingly miserable lvl 58 elf huntress. She wants to see all of Middle Earth, but she won’t. Because I am broke.I feel like writing this review in caps lock and yelling at the top of my lungs “pay to win pay to win pay to win”. Middle Earth is beautiful. Beginnings are sweet as you’re not engaged in battles straight away. You start in Eriador, and exact place depends on which race you chose to play with. Crafting is soothing, exploring is fun, everything looks amazing. When you get a horse, things get a lot easier and you find yourself immersed into the world and enjoying it so much. It leaves you curious for other parts of Middle Earth and you want to level up to enjoy them all. Music is great too and fits every scenery beautifully.But then, around levels 20-30 you realize you need to purchase a quest pack to play the next area on the map. That's fine, so you do that, still being into the game. Then you grind grind grind, until you face the same thing again. So you buy another area. And so on. Thing is, I didn’t even mind purchasing packs to see more. What I really did mind though, is how boring and repetitive quests became while levelling in parallel became increasingly harder and frustrating. I'm starting to think the best way to play this game is getting a horse and just riding like there's no tomorrow until you reach Mordor. Noro lim Asfaloth, noro lim!Unless on top of all those purchases you want to buy experience tomes. Thanks Turbine, but no thanks.Community used to be better too, but I’m guessing a lot of people left for which I can’t really blame them. Also in walks my biggest regret, and that’s starting my toon on a non RP server which is extremely boring and has very little activity. However, if you do the same mistake and want to try another server with the same toon, Turbine offers you to transfer it for 20 €. What a surprise, I think I'll get a heart attack.  Still, there were times when I was so desperate I was willing to put all that aside and give it another shot. Then server started crashing. Guess it’s not meant to be, Lotro.			"

												Good things:+ Absolutely oozing with LoTR vibe+ Beautiful landscape that vividly brings Middle-Earth to life+ Beautiful music+ Various small details that are so lore friendly(Prancing Pony Hobbit door, flies around lamps at night etc)+ Beautiful sense of exploration+ Crafting's traditional, but interesting. And actually useful unlike in many an MMONeutral things:0 Servers only in USA0 A lot of microtransactions(though you can help yourself if you know what to buy and when)0 Pretty old school gameplay0 Talent Trees(this one's completely in the eye of the beholder-imo they've done harm to the game with them, but then again they've potential and they do bring ""choices, choices"" to the forefront)Bad things:- Boring as hell(endless ""kill x of y"" with slow leveling and old school MMO combat-sorry LoTR IP can't save you from this one)- Developers lying to players all the time(it happened at the very least 3 times during the lifespan and all of those decisions ruined the game - latest: EU datacentre)- Easy difficulty + slow leveling = uh-oh.- Developers don't really care about players(back to point 1)I'll give it a thumbs up, but be VERY CAREFUL about those cons. It's basically a neutral score anyhow. Because the pros do outweigh the cons.Fair's fair and it ought to remain as such.			"

												Over my time of playing it, about 1,000 hours without steam I decided to play it on steam, which has no gameplay difference. But the game gives something I can't get enough of. If it's either defeating hundreds of different creatures, using tons of different moves to slay them, or maybe just explore the nice atmosphere. It's a great game, and I really enjoy playing it. It's full of action, adventure, and you can make a lot of new friends that can help you in hard parts of this game.I found you can also earn points to buy the worlds by playing the game, which makes it a fun challenge.It's also amazing that the creatures you fight, Goblins, Humans, Orcs, Trolls etc.Good game overall!

I used to play DOTA alot, and after that this is a deep relief for soul and body.It is actually free to play, but after time you will have feeling like developers deserved to award them with some money so this game can live long time more.

												     Traversing Middle-Earth slaying orcs and fighting alongside heroes like Legolas, Halbarad, and even Prince Theodred; what more could you ask for? Honestly, this game is not what it once was; that does not mean I don't recommend it. The Lord of the Rings Online is truly a masterpiece made a very passionate team. My first few years in this game were phenomenal - Don't let my Steam numbers fool you - if anything this game has given me a much deeper love for the lore. It's a game where the little things are the best things. The Yule (December) festival is by far the best festival I have participated in in any of the MMOs I have ever played. However instead of going on and on about this game, here are some pros and cons:Pros:- Middle-Earth is huge. Turbine has covered The Shire, to Bree, from Forochel to Mirkwood, Moria, Rohan, Ered Luin, Rivendell, and everywhere in between.- Very lore-friendly. Turbine has created an almost seamless integration of your character into the lore, the events that transpire through the main story (epics) fit together wonderfully with the lore.- Meet and fight alongside mighty heroes. You will get the chance to meet and fight alongside members of the fellowship. Not only that, but you will also meet people such as Halbarad, Elrond, Galadriel and Celeborn, King Theoden, Radagast and Bilbo Baggins; the list goes on.- Witness major events in the story. This includes the Breaking of the Fellowship, the fall of Boromir, - which is waaaay better than the movies -  The Battle for Helms Deep, the final stand of Prince Theodred, the forming of the Gray Company, and many more events, which Minas Tirith and the Battle for Pelennor Fields on the way later this year.- The crafting system. The crafting system is by far one of the best I have experienced in an MMO.- Legendary weapons. You will be able to obtain powerful legendary weapons that grow in power as they are used; you can even name them!- The outfit system. By far the best outfit system I have ever witnessed in an MMO. With the purchase of a wardrobe, you can cosmetically wear ANY piece of armor/clothing in the game regardless of class or race.- The deeding system. The deeds while 'grindy' award Turbine Points (TP) which can be used to purchase quest packs, cosmetics, and other things from the LOTRO store (See Below)There are no doubt a few I missed, but these are the highlights for me. Now onto the cons:- It is impossible to advance in the game without spending money (unless you grind a LOT). I was able to make it to level 52 without spending a dime, and having no quest packs for levels 30+ Levels 1-30 are free, however 30-100 (yes level 100) all require the purchase of quest packs and expansion packs either with real money or Turbine Points.- The game is not what it once was. While still enjoyable, the game has just started to really lose it's spark. I truly feel sorry for those who did not get to experience the game before 2012. It was amazing back then. But with all the gameplay/mechanic/etc. changes it has ruined the experience for me and many veteran players.- While nice for new players, the game is not very veteran friendly. I covered this more or less in the above statement. With all the changes going on many of the veteran players have left the game. I have seen lots of new players joining, and the game is definitely new player friendly, but at a terrible cost.- Lots of the servers are dead (or dying). Brandywine is the server to choose. It is one of the most populated servers and one of the few very populated ones still in game. That's not to say that LOTRO has a tiny playerbase; most people are just on a few servers like Brandywine.I hope I have been able to sum up this game in a positive way with the 5 years of experience I have with it. I truly recommend giving LOTRO a try. ESPECIALLY if you love the lore; that's one of the things that keeps me in the game. With this in mind, I will mention that Lord of the Rings is nearing it's end. I do not believe Turbine will renew their license past 2017. We will luckily get Mordor, and from the looks of it, the Grey Havens and the areas that are needed to ""Complete"" the game. If you're on the fence about this game, I suggest you get it while you can; it is free after all.			"

												Terrible, even infuriating, customer service. Despite this being a prime example of a good solid classic MMORPG.Had a bad experience with a GM a couple years ago, arbitrarily changed my name from ""Theodophilus"" to some randomly generated name. Claimed it broke the rules and was too religious, despite Theod- being a very common name prefix in the LOTR universe. I questioned him about it, he refused to change it back, and even banned my account for three days because I pressed the issue. There is no recourse at all as a customer, WB is just too big to care, and Turbine (or whoever) have no real means set up of dealing with these problems, they had a suggestion box and ticket system, true, but it's /dev/null, never got so much as a form letter response from those venues. Once a year I call up WB and asked if they've changed the name back for free, or taken any action to rectify or make amends for my terrible customer service experience. They sympathetically tell me nothing can be done on the phone, and I tell them that I enjoyed the game itself and would have possibly been spending money on it, and they have now lost $X amount more dollars in the past year I may have spent, because at the time of the occurrence I happily a subscriber--This was after the game went f2p, I figured I liked it, I spent time on it, I would support it.The GMs have no oversight, and can pretty much do whatever they want without repercussions. If you do gamble on this game, I would encourage you to spend no money on it, so the only thing you will lose if you encounter a rogue GM is your time. GM abuse shatters the illusion within an MMO that what you do within it has any meaning or permanency whatsoever, someone can just come along and spitefully fiddle with your entry in the database, what's the point? The suspension of disbelief was shattered, and this was reinforced by the abject lack of customer care or public relations. While the game is a fine example of a classic MMORPG, unfortunately so is the customer service, from a bygone era when gaming was a less competitive market, a higher ratio of gamers were children, and the novelty of being in an MMORPG at all may have been enough to get some kid to tolerate the unpoliced abuse by a GM. This isn't the past, I'm not a kid, and they have lost a lot of money from me. Always vote with your wallet, it's one of the few things that really matter in this world, unfortunately.Nothing preciousssSSssss here, just a database some guy can drunk dial on a whim.			"

												awesome game. this is pretty much only mmo that i've ever played for a longer period of time. it is obviously very story driven game. you follow the lord of the rings story by completing epic quest line. and this epic quest/story line really is awesome, it takes you through whole middle earth, you meet tons of characters, you participate in a lot of instances and explore every region of middle earth. it really makes you feel like you're part of the story. besides this, there are loads of regular side quests, and if you take your time like me, and read text about each quest, game becomes much more immersive.the middle earth is huge and diverse. you have nice looking shire (green, flowers, friendly people), then you have arctic cold and frozen forochel; barren, dark and hostile angmar. 10/10 for world (middle earth) variety.you have 5 races and 10 classes to choose from. nothing too crazy, but definitely not bad. each race has it's own starter zone and unique quests, where you learn a bit about lore, and meet some characters important for that race.there's quite a bit of instances, raids and skirmishes to choose from, and most of them can scale to your level.game has couple of regions where you can purchase your own house and decorate it with trophies from battles.community is friendly and mature.f2p model: you can play whole game without spending a cent, and i know people that have done that, but it requires a lot of grind. personally, i bought eriador quest pack, and all expansions (you can get them for free if you grind enough).game is not perfect though. it has performance issues in newer areas where your fps is constantly low. i don't know if there is fix for this, but i haven't looked for it really. another downside for me is that all weapons within same class (axes, swords, spears etc...) look pretty similar. i'd like to see more variety there. mobs can get a bit boring, and basically after you've seen mobs on first 30-40 levels (maybe even before) you've seen them all. they definitely need more variety.there's quite a bit of things i didn't go through (crafting, exploring, hobbies, mounts...) but it would take forever to write this review...8.5/10			"

												Just started playing, and it's already got me hooked. The visuals are really crisp, the storyline is engaging, and the mechanics are easy to get the hang of (I'm not new to MMORGs, but there are some differences to others I've played). My only real gripe thus far is that the map isn't as interactive as I'm used to. But overall, it's really great to see the lands of Middle Earth come to life in this kind of format, especially ones we haven't seen in other games or the films. I'm excited to continue my journey.

												  As a big fan of Lord of the Rings, i decided to play the MMO game version of it when I first came across with back in the summer of 2011.During my journeys throughout Middle-Earth I have met important personalities, visited many places and helped a lot of kind people. And I have enjoyed every minute of my adventure..  First of all, I have to congratulate the developers of Turbine for their effort in the creation of Middle-Earth. Following Tolkien's masterworks and using a little bit of their imagination, they created a world which is astonishing and different from any other game worlds. From the green plains of Shire to the icy peaks of Misty Mountains with the deep mines of Moria below them and even beyond, to the White City of Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor, each region offers a unique experience for the player. However the graphics are indeed a bit outdated and it might frustrate some people but that doesn't stop you from enjoying the graphical scenery of the game.  Another good thing about this game is it's variety of quests and tasks. I remember when i was fighting a Barlog in Angmar and the next moment I was at Shire, fishing at Brandywine to collect some fishes for a hobbit. Because adventure in games is not always about fighting epic monsters and bosses...Needless to say that your own personal story is so well merged in the story of the Fellowship of the Ring both chronically and aesthetically. I have to say that is a smart move from the developers that you are not declared as the chosen one or the savior of Middle-Earth from the very beginning. You are just one of the many folks out there who is eager for some adventure and wants to pursue his/her destiny ...Gradually you gain fame from your deeds and more and more people are pinning their hopes on you to purge Middle-Earth from evil.  LOTRO'S music and soundtracks is a strong feature of this game. There's a wide variety of songs here which elevate your gaming experience. Each region has their respective soundtracks which make the game even more atmospheric. You have to test it for yourself to see what I am talking about.  The overall gameplay experience is good. Crafting is an essential and rewarding part of the game. The combat system is enjoyable. You have a large amount of abilities with a variety of combos. LOTRO is by 99% a PvE game because is focusing on its story rather than the fighting. We all know what happens in the end. Good guys win, bad guys lose. Although the PvMP system , where you are playing as an servant or Sauron, is rather fascinating. The community is friendly and there are lots of players willing to participate in numerous instances. Furthermore, the deed system ( =achievements) rewards you with Turbine Points and other stuff ( points for buying things in store) if you are exploring the regions or killing more enemies.  Well, Turbine may be a little expensive ( don't let it mislead you with the F2P label) but in my opinion the pay system is quite handy. Apart from the subscription system where you are forced to pay once a month to have all the areas for free ( like in WoW), you can buy each region of Middle Earth from the store for an amount of money and then you can have it forever with all the quests and deeds of this area.  Personally, I was addicted to this game since the beginning. It is a very good MMORPG for all the LOTR-fans out there who have watched the films or read the books. But if you are not one of them, why don’t give it a try and join in an adventure throughout Middle-Earth? "

												I rarely play MMOs anymore, so I will avoid talking about combat and such in this review. Instead, I will focus on other elements of the game.So, congrats: you've just found the portal to Middle-earth. LOTRO does a wonderful job recreating the world. Despite the graphics, I still had loads of fun exploring whenever I wasn't off killing orcs. Some places, like Lothlorien, are gorgeous and breathtaking. Others, like Angmar, manage to get under your skin and make you feel just a tiny bit repulsed. The atmospheres of each region are wonderfully conveyed.Tolkien gave us a fleshed-out world, and instead of drastically changing the lore, LOTRO adds onto it. Granted, the LOTRO-created lore is plausible within Middle-earth, so I'm usually content to let it slide. As an added plus, a lot of it is interesting!I haven't been able to get far into the main storyline (nearly through with Volume 2), but I can vouch that it's engaging. While the Fellowship is off doing their own thing, your character is tasked with helping the Free Peoples of Middle-earth. Side quests are the usual fetch/kill quests, so nothing really notable there. You can choose to run around in groups of people (appropriately named ""fellowships"") or just go solo.And that leads to what I reckon is my only complaint. It's not really a free game. You have to buy quest packs for some regions, so it's a lot harder to level up quickly when you've run out of things to do solo and don't have money to spend. That's how I got bored.Servers are usually populated with a fair amount of people, with most hanging out on the roleplaying servers. Something that made LOTRO really stand out for me was the kind community. I've met a large variety of players ranging from high schoolers to parents. Many offered to help me out whenever I needed it. There will be the rare troll in the chat, but you can simply ignore them. Everyone's there to have fun and nerd out over Tolkien's works.If you're a major fan of Middle-earth and don't mind some tweaks here and there, I recommend this game. 7/10.			"

												Wow. It is really hard to review a game which became a part of your life and of your soul. I'll start with negative points then, hope it will be easier for us all this way.1. Move along if you're not familiar with Lord of the Rings. This game is made for fans of Middle-Earth by fans of Middle-Earth. It is story-driven game which rewards you for being into this world. It is not worth your time nor money if you are indifferent about LotR. Better go read some books. You might as well close this review, won't be anything more useful here for you.2. Teh graphics suxx. LotRO doesn't hold its line against any of nowadays-popular MMORPGs (except maybe WoW, which looks just as awful now). I'm not sure if I placed 2 first points in the right order, but anyway: if you're looking for impressive effects and fappable grills, move along. Go play TERA, it's just what you need (and quite good a MMORPG by the way).3. The combat system is decades since deprecated. Yes, it's THAT point-and-click we all were tired of for years. If you consider it disgusting and still reading it for some reason - move along. Go play TERA or anything else, there is a plenty of action MMORPGs nowadays.4. The game is not free. Period. If you don't spend a single penny on the game, you will have really hard time past level 25. However, don't leave yet. It's the first matter I'll deal with below.That's it for contras, I think. As promised, concerning money. You have two options: to buy a subscription or to purchase all items (mostly, quest packs) separately. Aside from that, you'll need two out of three DLCs (""Steely Dawn"" is auxiliary, nothing mandatory there). Taking all the discounts into concern (~20% off in-game items, 50-75% off DLCs at large Steam sales), the second option is much more convenient. Still, it will cost you dearly (around $30 for Russian players and probably twice that much for all the others: there's a solid reason for this difference, but I won't elaborate here).Still reading this? Kudos to you then. Now I'm going to persuade you to install LotRO.1. THE STORY. I cannot stress this enough. The game is highly story-driven. Every single quest is a brick in a huge building of the Middle-Earth story. The epic storyline follows the road of the Fellowship of the Ring. It reached Gondor as of when I'm writing this. And it's called epic for a good reason. Still, side quests play no lesser role. All of them contribute to the story and to the atmosphere.2.  The graphics. You've got it right, and f**k those who left in the progress. The effects might seem simple, the grills might seem not fappable enough, but it's LotR, not a manga. It feels natural, however natural it might be for a fantasy world. And you have my word that you will stop once in a while just to have a longer look at that landscape.3. The world. Do you remember? It's the good old Middle-Earth. You can venture into icy crevasses of Forochel (don't jump in the water!), walk among the golden mallorns of Lothlorien, explore the dangerous depths of Moria and ride with rohirrim against the tide of Uruk-hai. You can even find a hat Gandalf dropped at the very bottom of the Endless Stair.4. The atmosphere. You get used to it, to every good and bad thing about the game, and you really feel like you live in this world. The domestical system. The music. The language in quests is good and proper English (or Elven, mind you). The mobs are not concentrated at farming spots, but are mixed and scattered across vast logical regions. The crafting system (you can actually cook, Valar be damned!) HP is called Morale, so you don't actually die, but desperately flee when severely outmatched. The Dread system which turns your screen gray and replaces minimap with a flaming eye, when you encounter something truly fearsome. Like a Balrog corpse. It is, definitely, the best LotR-inspired game in terms of atmosphere that ever existed.I could go on. I could mention the community, the music playing (yep, you can play any music in the game at a MIDI quality), the PK absence, the epic battles and whatnot. But I will conclude.Come and feel it yourself. If you're still here - it is worth it. This is an experience you'll never regret. And LotRO will love you back.THIS GAME IS A F***ING BLAST AND I LOVE IT. DO IT. Join the Fellowship.Oh Eru, I wanted to say it from the very start.Sincerely Yours,Talcano Mithrenhen, Landroval (ex-Mirkwood).			"

												Love this game. Been playing it for many years. It's really remarkable. Definitely the best 'escape' game out there. Music is really chill, the world and art is beautiful and the gameplay is fairly easy going.My only complaint about it is that after so many years, it can get a little repetitive but that's mostly my fault for playing it so much. There is quite a bit of grinding involved, but it's mostly enjoyable and there's so much variety in the game that you can change gears all the time and keep yourself engaged in countless activities.

												My family and I have played this game for more than 5 years now. This game is for those who really cared about the story of middle earth, because that is one of the main things this game surpasses at. My current hours are actually no where near my actual as I played the game before steam had it for many years. This is not a fast game, and if you're careful with your deeds, you never have to pay money. For PVE, this is not pay to win. It is not fast paced or gloriously action filled, I like playing it on a lazy weekend morning.			"

												I played this game from open beta and loved it. After Mirkwood came out a few things in my life had me put LotRO on hold.  I came back about 2 months ago and it feels like a different game. That being said, it's not a bad thing, just different from what I remember. Not dramatically different but enough to make it interesting. It is still one of the best MMOs I've ever played (going all the way back to Ultima Online before EA or whoever got a hold of it and ♥♥♥♥ed it all up). The game follows the books pretty closely (and not the movies). So if you like Tolkien and are looking to get into a MMO, this is the right place for you. Even if you haven't read the books and just seen the Hobbit and Rings trilogies, there is enought in the game for you to say, ""Ah, I remember that!"" The game is a little old but that doesnt take away from its charm. It being older means the the graphics are not all HD/3D/VR-esque but are not too bad in hindsight. The story and quests drive you to want to go to the next part of the game and leveling is not that bad. The quests make it interesting to the point that it doesn't feel like a constant grind. Not to say that there isn't a grinding element to it.....it is a MMO after all.I'd give it a 9/10, just because I'm a fan of the books and they actually took the time to get it right.			"

												The game is great, if your style is grinding and free to play, then this game is for you, if your a huge fan of tolkien's work and his books, then this is for you for much of the  game's lore are very spot on. The community is very friendly, VERY VERY FRIENDLY,no exagerations. And if you want some Role Plays then this game has, much RPing are on Laurelin but some servers has it's rp.                         And a little tips for grinding Lotro Points (LP), use a minstrel dwarven so you will start at the very top of ered luin's map, why minstrel? It's because Minstrels are kinda OP (overpowered) at the starting levels (ered luin, the shire and bree-land), do all the slayer deeds and exploration deeds, if you do the quest then much better for it will complete a deed which will give you more than the slayer and exploration deeds, plus the reputation deeds you must do for it will give you 50 LP if you manage to complete all 4 of it, then after you've done all deeds at Ered Luin, do the same for The Shire ( I reccomend to do only the exploration and slayer deeds at the shire for the Quest deeds are kinda annoying :D, for reputation deeds,you need to be level 20 to use the Reputation Items, you can farm them at the old barrows or trade it in the skirmish camps) and Bree-land, eventually you can gather 800+ LP (Lotro Points) after you are done with the deeds.            It can be done for like 5-6 hours for all the starter region's deeds to be done, my record is kinda 4 and a half hours ( i use slayer deed acceleration and that thing that will give you boost on horse speed). This game has it's up's and downs like the dwindling numbers of players ( like the Dunedains XD, but there are players who came back after some months of not playing), much of the stuff in the game are fellowship (ex. Angmarm but you can solo almost everything that is important like Epic Quests).              My hours on record is 761.3 hrs but let me tell you that i have been playing it since 2012 and i have been using the stand alone client for almost 3 years, and the 2 years on steam. You are not alone in this game despite the few numbers of players, if you need help then you can ask for it in the WC (World Chat) and if you need for fellowship quest then look in the LFF chat box. God bless and Goodluck! "

												Free to play done right (and no it's not pay to win either :D ). Don't listen to folks who have one or two hours logged, you really can get a lot out of this game if you can put in some time and a little money. After all we all put time into games and some are bloody expensive!LoTRO is the least frustrating free to play experience I've had as Turbine gives you a taste of everything. They don't lock out 99% of the game. Completing 'deeds' (challenges like kill X amount of goblins) will earn you Turbine points for micro transactions in the LoTRO store. With enough time and patience its possible to buy several store items from in game rewards. If you spend even the minimum on Turbine points (£5) you get upgraded to premium account status. That gives you two more character slots per server and removes the gold cap.However if you're aiming not to spend anything at all you can't have a job or life and do that. That is some serious grinding. You'll also HAVE to spend time grinding the Turbine points if you don't even want to spend a fiver to remove the gold cap, as two gold is not nearly enough in game currency later on. Good thing is that before you remove the cap all money you earn gets saved in an overflow wallet ready for when you do gain access to it.WHAT FREE TO PLAYER'S GETThe epic quests that make up the main story line are mostly free (to continue it you need to buy the expansions).Player housing is free. Some items used to decorate can be bought in the store but most you get for free.Some trait slots are free. These are different to trait trees (the skill trees you spec into to get your abilities). You gain most of these by deeds and they can be slotted to give either passive buffs or more skills.Steeds. Getting your horse/pony/goat (can only ride goats in Moria) is a free option but the riding skill itself is not free. Don't throw your arms up in protest yet. With small effort you can get the 95 Turbine points you need to purchase this skill. Most deeds that award Turbine points (and most of them do) are worth between 5-10 points. Some deeds are worth more. It's easy to get (VIP's get a free quest that grants the skill). Some steeds are available in the store. With the Rohan expansion you can ride a war steed for mounted combat and customize it's appearance but that can get bloody expensive.The Shire, Bree, Ered Luin, Lone Lands and Celondim areas are free. Free, Premium and VIP players all have to buy the expansions, there are five in total. There are quest packs for other regions you can buy in game from about 595 Turbine points. You can travel to the areas you don't have the quest packs for, you just can't do quests there. It's important to note that free content (excluding skirmishes) drys up around level 35-38. Moria, the first expansion is best entered around level 50 so you'll be needing a quest pack to fill in the gap.Some skirmishes and repeatable instances are free.Joining a crafting guild is free but you need to pay for full access to it. You don't need be in a guild but it gives you access to far more recipes than you'd have otherwise. Having full access is a distinct advantage as there is far more choice.All but the Warden (one of the tanks) and Rune-Keeper (DPS and healing, not the only DPS or healing class in game) classes are free. The Rune-Keeper is well worth it, lots of ranged DPS magic fun. The Warden is more of a secondary tank with combos (called gambits) and other tricks thrown in.The fishing hobby (the only hobby) is free. You can catch fish to display in your home or to cook if you or any of your alts have the right crafting profession.The in game mailing system is free and is very useful to post items to your alts, not just other players.Creating a guild (known as a kinship here) is free (well it would be stupid otherwise lets face it).Free daily silver hobbit present.WHAT VIP's GETIf you go the subscription route you become a VIP. VIP's pay the following:$15 a month$29.97 for 3 months$59.94 for 6 months$99.99 for 12 monthsFor your chosen cost/sub length you get:Mailbox field access Access all character trait slots500 Turbine points per monthAccess all quest packs and skirmishes that are not a part of expansionsUnlimited chat20 Slots of shared wardrobe space (this enables you to cosmetically equip gear on any character)Additional inventory slotsCustom character portrait frameDaily +100% XP (for 30% of a level)Free weekly gold hobbit presentAccess all monster classes (Monster play is mostly PvP)Access all crafting guildsNo currency capMaximum auction house listingsThe most major benefits are the quest packs, skirmishes, 500 free Turbine points, crafting guilds and monster classes. That gives you a ton of extra content.PLAYING THE GAMEChoose race of men, hobbit, dwarf or elves, then pick your class. The usual DPS, tank and healer classes are present, along with the squishy pet class (Lore Master, that does more than just use pets). Next is the choice of where your character comes from. Choosing this region doesn't determine more than a preset skin tone and hair colour (which you can change). Choose your hair style, facial features etc, pick a suitable name and away you go. The level cap for characters is 100.The tutorial is easy and makes it clear how to use your abilities. A nice touch is the tutorial skip option available at character creation if you've already done it before.The usual MMO type features are here. Choose a crafting profession to make useful items along the way, level up and upgrade your weapons and armour, collect type quests, kill type quests, quests in instances as well as those in the open world. Most are set in the open world. There are also repeatable daily quests in certain areas. The interface makes it easy to see who is in your area if you want to start a fellowship (team). There are different instance quests called skirmishes. These can be repeated and are a bit more entertaining than the usual quests as they have a few different objectives and ambushes. You gain 'marks' for successful objectives as well as completing the skirmish itself. These can be completed solo or in a fellowship. Turn the marks in for rewards.When you start to level up you'll be getting trait points. Each class has three trait trees that will determine specifically how your chosen class plays and what skills you gain. Some skills however are not determined by which trees or how far into them you spec as they are standard skills. The Guardian (one of two tank classes) for example has a tanking, DPS and two handed tanking tree choices. You can choose to specialize in one tree or spread yourself a bit thinner into others as well.Being an MMO the graphics are not top notch but they are beautiful. Water effects are nice.USEFUL INFO ON CRASHESMany players have suffered from constant crashes. Check out post #11 in this thread;https://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?521607-Lotro-keeps-crashingThat may solve your issues. Also if you have Pando Media Booster installed get rid of it! Not only is it pointless it can slow LoTRO to the point it crashes. Both these solutions worked for me and my wife.Yet again this is one of the vast amount of games these days that has annoying bugs. Hopefully you won't suffer them or at least be able to sort them with the above solutions. Also some of the store items are far too pricey (extra bags and anything steed related in particular).There's a lot of nice places to explore and plenty to do once you have a stable game. There are many more features I've not covered such as raids, PvP and monster play, not to mention the legendary weapon system and your free hobbit present you get each day. Have a bit of patience and you'll love Middle Earth. :)			"

												I started playing this game when I was like 10 yrs old, when it just came out. I loved it then, and now that I'm 19 yrs old, I still love it. It has a certain draw to it that you just can't resist but to come back to. I have many more hours than listed by steam. Atleast somewhere inbetween 2000-4000 hours. I spent alot of my time playing this. It has is up and downs, but they're all worth it.The pros outway the cons.  The game is kinda dying it seems, cause there was a server merge recently, but I'll be happy to play this game till the very day it dies. The community is priceless in comparison to any other MMO I've played. Of course there are the trolls, and douches too, but overall they seem to be mostly kind. I spent 400$ on 2 accounts, and let me tell you that 400$ was well spent. This game is worth it.10/10 would be a hobbit without shoes again.			"

												Lord of the Rings Online is a must play for anyone that loves the world of Middle Earth, but the game itself is dated and suffers from a lack of cohesive game direction and meaningful new content. Character classes are interesting and engaging, and feel decently varied, but combat overall feels sluggish. The game used to have a great dungeon/raid system, but this has largely been replaced by the lackluster Big Battle system. Questing is largely comprised of standard kill and fetch quests, but the environments are varied and the storyline is a centerpoint. There isn't a meaningful catch up system though (unless you want to pay quite a bit of $$), so expect to spend quite a bit of time leveling if you're new to the game.The graphics are beautiful but dated. Character creation is a bit lackluster, but the world itself is where the game really shines.The music is excellent, and really captures the feeling of Middle Earth. At times it's a bit repetetive, but this is balanced by the ability to create your own music in game.			"

												I played LOTRO for about a year when it first came out and just returned to it 5 days ago. I was a bit concerned about it going F2P because most games that do that pretty much design it as Free to Win or design it in a manner that gives those that shell out the big bucks an unfair advantage. Fortunately LOTRO didn't go that route. You can play this game and never spend a penny because you earn points within the game to spend on unlocking material and servives. Sure it comes easier and quicker to those willing to pay for the points but if you don't mind grinding some then you can bypass spending real money. LOTRO to me also did a great job with the immersion factor. You feel like you are a part of Middle Earth. While the graphics don't hold up to the latest titles, LOTRO is still a great game and worth trying. I'm hooked.			"

												Fantastic game, love it, but be aware it's a very grinding game if you really want to be F2P. You consume most of your time grinding Turbine Points rather than what people would call 'playing', but it's still fantastic, lore-friendly, and very, very fun.			"

												The Lord of the Rings Online is by far the Best MMORPG I've kind of played.  I was a late to the game, but I subbed for a few months with some friends (and even more since f2p).  The fellowship quests and group content is as solid as it gets for old school MMORPGs.  A time came when new and shiny things came and Lotro was left behind for me and my pals, But I still go back every now and then.  I love the rich lore/story, the fantastic graphics (even today they look good), and the truley epic settings.LOTRO at first glance when playing is odd.  I totally understand when someone says they just didn't like it.  Yet at it's core, this game is as good if not better than any MMORPG made during it's time.  It just does things a little differently.  For instance it tries really hard to stick to the books (the I.P it draws from-not the movies) so there are no mages or wizard classes bc the only Wizards are the famous ones - (Gandorf, Radhadgas, Sarapmon). There are however classes who play like mages using knowledge of powders (Lore Master), ancient runes (Rune Keeper), and...music (Minstrel).  There are no ""hit points"" or health.  The green bar is morale, and when it reaches zero you die..so yeah its health, but not really, and some abilities are just silly like the crowd control Burglar ability ""riddle"" (in the heat of combat you tell a riddle and the enemy thinks about it for like 20 secs).  Thats what Lotro does.  It holds true to the lore of the book and the world it created.  Each class is very fun and there are quite a few 'one of a kind' classes in Lotro. So often mmos copy paste classes.  At the start of the game, the music is not great, your gear looks like barf, and you're screaming at enemies to do damage. It's different and these can push ppl away, but the music is optional, lotro has an amazing (before it's time) outfit/wardrobe system that is fully customizable with dyes and overlays, and screaming at enemies lowers their morale so get over it. The main reason I don't play it very much is the lack of friends who will play it.  Like many MMORPGs back then, playing with friends is a tricky and often demanding experience.  Need to be on the same server, and need to be near the same levels. Servers have merged, players are a bit low, but It's still good and the Free to play model isn't horrible.  You can do anything by grinding Deeds.  The f2p model locks out questing zones and trait slots, and sometimes the paygates get annoying, but if you don't care to grind deeds it's really not that big of a deal.  Especially if you make alts bc their deeds count towards the in game currency too.  If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings in any form, nothing beats exploring and visiting all of the awesome iconic places you've only read about or seen in movies.  Give it a try! I know I will as long as it's still alive.			"

												In recent reviews, people have complaints about long installation times, trouble with registering, and not being able to play the game. For me, this was not the case. I don't have a powerful rig (and also not the best wifi), and I downloaded this game in under an hour. With quick account registration and patches installed, I was soon on my way to explore Middle Earth.As for the game itself, for being almost 10 years old, it's incredible. As a fan of Tolkien, it's astonishing to run into iconic landscapes and characters. The game is beautiful for being 10 years old, and you don't need a high performancing PC to run it. There's a main quest line that follows the books and plenty of interesting side quests. Combat is fun and engaging for a tab target MMORPG. The music, oh the music. If you're a fan of the Lord of the Rings film scores, then you'll love the music in game. There's nothing more enjoyable than the ear-gasm of riding into Rohan and hearing the sweet sound of violins accompaning your journey.On the contrary, the game can become a bit grindy. Lower level quests can become quite repeditive with the feeling of ""kill 10 spiders and collect 5 bear hides.,"" can be a bit overwhelming. I know. I've almost stopped playing again because of it. But, if you pick an advanced and interesting class, it can be less mind numbing. At the time of writting this review, I have a level 20 Warden and quests are becoming more engaging. Skirmishes, epic battles, and instances are a great break from these grindy experiences, and epic battles are available at low levels.As for the F2P model, it's one of the best ones available. It's incredibly fair and there really isn't any P2W instances. Some higher level quests and expansions require LOTRO points, but these points can be acquired in game (if you're up for some serious grinding). Most of the equipment found in the LOTRO store are cosmetics, mounts, and chracter boosts. I started out as a F2P player, but fell in love with the game, and became a VIP member, spending some money on additional LOTRO Points.So download the game. If you don't like it, then all you have done is wasted a bit of your time. It's free to play people. With another expansion coming out this year and another playable race, download it now and enjoy an authentic Middle Earth experience.			"

												I am about 50/50 on this game. I like how it plays but if your going to do more than drop in ever-now and then ... dont expect anything unless you plan on paying for an account. it's an ok game to play when your bored and don't mind playing solo a lot.Getting in groups is pretty much useless unless your in a guild and they are usually paying members so.. if you want to be able to play it as intended then be ready to fork over the cash. Most players are lvl 105 now so don't ecpect to find many players at lower levels, even if you find them they are old timers and have alts that are armed to the ♥♥♥♥ and tweaked way past your little toon so its very uneven as a new player.As I said, if you want to just drop in every so oftena nd play a bit solo its not a bad game....Hope this helps.I will still give it thumbs up because it can be fun for a short time in small spurts.

												If you love the books or enjoyed the movies, this is a great game for you.  This game is P2W and there is lots of grinding.  Lag is also a big issue during mounted combat and higher level maps, such as Minas Tirith.  It is not known for PvP but does offer.  It IS for the hardcore Tolkein and LOTR fans with a fantastic community.  Some have said the MMO is dying and LOTRO does not have the players it once did.  Well, there are many folks who hop from game to game and do not tend to stay with a game for longer than a year or two.  If you are one of those folks, this game is not for you.  The game has really been enjoyable by myself and my family for the past 6 years.  We are in it for the long haul and have not yet found a MMO currently out there that offers as much as this one does.  Yes, it is a bit old school.  Yes, it is loads of fun and very addictive.			"

												I love to play this game just to unwind and take in the scenary of Middle-Earth. It's a great game to play with friends or also alone. It's free-to-play but there is content blocked by a pay wall. Technically, you can get past the pay wall by just playing the game but it's a monotonous grind. I listen to the ""LOTRO Podcast"" while playing this game and it's really relaxing. Overall, highly recommended.			"

 9/10  Is my personal rating for this game. The -1 is  only  for the slightly outdated graphics.   If you like MMO's, and know a little about the Lord of the Rings, you will probably enjoy this game. Although, the more you know about the lore, the more you will love LotRO. There is enough content here that  you can easily make the 2 charicters without repeating the same quests. I have put in 2k hours and it is still fun for me.  Paid subscription  - This is  not necessary. In the beginning, this can help with level gain and will unlock a few perks. At level cap, a subscription only allows you into the player vs. monster player area, and  does not make players over-powered. Additional areas are seperate purchases ($7 - $50). Thanks for reading, and I hope this info helps!			"

												Unsurprisingly, given the number of hours played, I find this f2p MMO really enjoyable. The recent (2013) introduction of trait trees has somewhat dumbed down the gameplay and has particularly hurt support classes, making them less useful in raid situations. The Helms Deep battles however have added some level of strategic play which may compensate some players for the loss of complexity elsewhere. Of course new players will not experience the loss felt by long term players to the complexity of play and can just enjoy the excellent epic storyline and the great graphics (these improve as you level and reach regions that have been created more recently), but all the areas look pretty as long as you have a half way decent graphics card.Skirmish and instance (dungeon) play does not become available until you reach lvl 20. Thereafter as you level up more areas of play become available.  It is worth buying the packs as you get more areas to explore and some decent perks. Although you can earn these in game if you are willing to grind Turbine points. 92:100			"

												Let me start out by saying I actually love this game...The problem is, despite being ""F2P"" it really isn't...unless I suppose you have 3,000 hours to grind LOTRO points, but even then, there's no way you could afford to purchase everything you need to play the game unrestricted. I purchased this game almost 9 years ago, before it went ""F2P."" Despite owning the actual game, they still said I had to purchase the level 20+ zone, which I already bought when I purchased the game, or subscribe before I could play it. Like I said, I love this game, so I subbed. Once I got to level 65, I found out that just having a sub wasn't enough to access the later content. I then needed to spend roughly $20 or so to access content for the next 10 levels, then another $20 for the next 10 levels and yet another probably $40 in LOTRO points to afford the end game content. This, again, wouldn't be a huge deal except the game is pretty lifeless at the non-endgame levels, making it ridiculous to have to spend nearly $100 plus what I already subbed to get to the end game where the small playerbase ""hangs out."" Having a sub should be enough to at least get you to the content before the latest end-game stuff.			"

												First of all - I've spent countless hours in this game before I finally downloaded it through steam when I had to re-install it due to hardware problems. The Lord of the Rings Online boasts a great open world based on J.R.R. Tolkien's famous works. Here you get to explore Middle-earth at your own pace, together with friends or all alone. Since LOTRO was first launched in 2007, it has grown from being a fairly small MMO to be among the biggest and broadest worlds out there. You can explore famous sites as seen in the movies and read about in the books, such as the Shire, Bree-town, Weathertop, Rivendell, Isengard, Helms Deep and as of one of the more recent updates, Minas Tirith! And not only do you get to see these landmarks, but you can also explore everything inbetween. Okay, you can't go everywhere straight off. In fact there is alot you'll have to go through to get to Gondor and Minas Tirith, but the story and places you visit on your way is just so masterfully created. You create your own character and you get to be the hero of Middle-earth in your own adventure paralell to the travels of Frodo and the fellowship. You'll see sides of Middle-earth that you never really noticed in either the books or films before. And the best thing about LOTRO is that it is completely free to play! Okay, you can buy Turbine Points and VIP membership to help you on your adventures. But it is also completely possible to farm Turbine Points in-game and get to the level cap, which is currently at level 105, without spending a single real-life dollar. I recommend this game to anyone who has a slight interest in Tolkien's work, be it the books or the movies based on them. I also recommend it to anyone who likes a good MMORPG and wants to try something a little different. Because LOTRO is different from other MMO's. Not only does it have by far the most established lore of any MMO, but it also has one of the very best player communities. Sure, there are a few jerks in Middle-earth too, just as there are in any other place, but overall the LOTRO community is among the friendliest and most helpful communities out there. The only con I can state about this game right now is that since it's come so far in development it is a little hard for new players and those of us, me included, who's taken a longer break from the game, to catch up with the newest content. But luckily, the friendly community has got you covered! If you ask for help, I bet you're gonna get it!			"

												If LOTRO had come out first, I likely never would have played WoW. (That is saying something, as I have played WoW since release and still have an active account) I've been a fan of Tolkien's world and writing since I was a little girl and have worn out multiple copies of The Hobbit.LOTRO can be complex to learn (I'm a minstrel and I play infrequently.) and the store can be daunting. However, I bought the game when it came out so I had a few nice little perks like extra slots and bags etc. If you ""rush to the endgame"" content you will be disappointed. I'm not particularly fond of instances etc, but I love wandering around on my Minstrel and seeing the world. I enjoyed meeting Tom Bombadil (and helping him with a few things) and participating in a few festivals with the Hobbits.If you are looking for an MMO where you get obscenely powerful and faceroll all the content hit up something different. LOTRO is a bit dated, but, I had great fun with all the quests (enough so that I will probably make another alt) and I come back to it every year for a month or so, get a few more levels on my Minstrel (I'll never get max level, of that I am sure!) and enjoy a change of pace from everything else I play.

												I've been playing for 3 years now, a little over 5000 hours.  The game is a beautiful interpretation of Tolkien's lore, and a fantastic rendition of Middle Earth.  If you enjoy the journey, rather than rushing to cap, it's perfect.  Many of the quests are interesting, some funny, some touching, a few a bit over the top with the running back and forth.  Exploring is always fun, you never know what's around the corner.  The devs have hidden little ""Easter Eggs"" throughout the landscape- a little cabin in the woods housing 3 bears, the occaisional bear-skin rug with a rabit sitting on it, and many others.  Hidden deeds suprise you with a new title when you accomplish an objective you didn't even know you were going for.  These are just the extras, as the whole point of your journey is to help in the background as the Fellowship persues thier goal.  I love it, and the community.  The vast majority of players are helpful and friendly, ready to advise, assist, and inform.  Try it, you have nothing to lose, and a whole world of enjoyment to gain.			"

												Played this game for a bit, I've got to say the graphics are amazing for the time it came out. A bit outdated now, while this game is seemily f2p in reality it's not really. F2P only takes you so far, until around 38-42. From then on you run out of quests and the grind is so tedious and boring makes you want to quit. But no fret! You can get quests, by buying all the expansions or VIP. Lets not forget you Turbine Points basically become essential mid game.To top it off, getting a 4 man dunegon let alone 6. Is a nightmare even on the most populated servers unless you are near max level. Because hardly anyone is leveling new characters. The solo grind is beyond lonesome.If you are genuinely interested in playing this game 1-40 then go ahead, it's a good testing margin to see if you like the game enough to invest in the expansions and VIP account. But as far as 'free' goes, that's where the game basically ends.			"

												Ive only played after the move to F2P and all I can say is that some of these old players seem unusually bitter. The changes were made years ago and yet they are just now saying how bad supposedly is. Here is the truth of the game. You get to play any of the free races of middle earth with a good selection of classes each with interesting mechanics. The story litteraly fallows the books with the player being a step behind or a vanguard for Frodo and the felowship. Although many things are locked and require Cash to unlock you can get a ton of Tubine Points just by getting achevements that are as simple as expore X area or use X spell Y number of times. I was able to unlock runekeeper doing this while my minstril was under level 20. You get to see the world, meet the people, and even play full songs on the in game instraments. Heck, There is a real life band based in the game. Check out ""The lonly mountan band"" if you want to hear some cool Tolkin inspired (or in some cases writen) music.			"

												As most I started playing the game when it went free to play. I was very interested in playing an mmo in the universe created by Tolkien. At first the game may not seem attractive due to the outdated graphics, the clunky combat and the somewhat repetitive questing. However, if you invest a good amount of time to understand it the game starts showing its jewels. As you progress through the areas you will feel your character getting stronger, becoming a seasoned warrior whose path is tied with that of the Fellowship. The main story line not only lets you experience the Lord of the Rings trilogy to its depth but also gives you an insight on secondary plotlines that were in the background of both the books and the movies.A major advantage of the game is that it literally lets you get every part of the premium content by grinding. You can get every expansion, dungeon, skirmish e.t.c. by doing the abundant deeds spread out through all the areas. I have never seen something similar in other similar MMOs. Another great aspect of the game which adds to its immersion is the community. Everyone is very helpful to each other, bad game practices are non-existant making you feel like a member of a large fellowship.Overall, I believe people who like me are fans of the universe Tolkien created would adore this game as its huge content lets you experience the history of the books as if you were there.

												I used to play this game until they released a patch which which broke the musical instruments so I left the game with sadness in my heart.You may wonder why I would have instruments as a reason to leave the game, so allow me to ellaborate;Once long, long ago I began my journey in LotRO as soon as it was released on Steam. I had thoroughly enjoyed the books and loved the movies to an equal measure so I decided to see what kind of game the MMO would be like.The experience was honestly the best I had ever had out of an MMO up until that point and I loved it down to the core of my heart. I loved exploring around the vast maps on my mount, dismounting to farm and complete quests and then return to uncover more story and venture deeper into more and more locations.The I found instruments but didn't know about how to use them correctly so I left them to one side.Eventually during my adventures I caught up to a group of people in the same area who were courteous to me and even allowed me to join them in their party so that we could all complete the quests faster and adventure together.Not long later they invited me to their Skype group and we would talk and play LotRO for hours on end. Slaying everything from the lowly mobs to major bosses and we would do so joyously.Then one person in the group stated they had been looking online at guides and forums and had stumbled across ABC files. These were essentially MIDI files that were programmed to work with instruments in LotRO. We messed around with them initially until someone in the group had the brilliant idea of synchronising our music by counting down in Skype and beginning to play the same song simultanbeously.We did so and the result was fantastic; we were essentially a small orchestra of terribly mismatched instruments but the sound was fantastic to us nontheless. Not only this but when we began to do this in centers of population like towns and hubs other players began to gather around in small crowds and use dance emotes as we played the Star Wars theme tune, MJ's Smooth Criminal, the Pirates of the Carribean theme tune and so on.Even though this had nothing to do with the game itself it was as if we had created a tiny meta-game within LotRO which we as a group resided and we even stopped questing as a whole. We simply went from town to town as a traveling band and it was the best time I have probably ever had in an MMO. It was also an extremely unique experience. Never in my life had I ever played an online game in order to avoid playing the online game in favour of doing some stupid pointless thing and it was still so enjoyable.Then the updates happened. Not only did servers begin to die out and disappear but they eventually released a patch which broke the instruments. HOW they broke the instruments, items which have literally no impact on the rest of the game or needed modifying or changing in any way shape or form is still beyind me, but they did and this crushed my heart and the hearts of my fellow group. We had spent what mjust have been three or four moths running aroudn playing music and being generally stupid while occasionally helping lower level people who required assistance withing quests.We unanimously decided to all leave the game. The thing which had become the core gameplay to us long after the grindy and repetitive combat had become stale was lost.We waited for a few weeks. We posted many complaints. There were quite a lot of forum posts. But this was to no avail. After each passing week the desire to return to LotRO had subsided and I have never return since.This in it's entirety is the tale of my LotRO experience. Although it may not be the most useful or the most interesting this is how I viewed the game during my playtime and the reason why I abandoned it.P.S. If under any circumstance they have fixed the instruments please reply to this so that people will know if they have not played the game but my desire to play is no longer here so I will not be returning regardless, thank you.

												I have been playing Lords of the Rings Online (LOTRO) since it went to free to play in 2010.  I just loaded LOTRO from Steam recently.   LOTRO has been my favorite MMORPG, since City of Heroes was closed.  I have bought all the quest packs, expansions and many unlocks for my one account. I only play on the Gladden server.LOTRO is called a ""Free to Play"" MMORPG in the description, but if you want to reach level cap in LOTRO, you will have to pay some real money.  Free to Play accounts are limited on purpose, of course. Free to Play only have the landscape enemies, all the epic story quests, few instances, some instant action quests, 3 starter areas and 1 area lvl 20 to 30, and can make 2 characters which have to buy trait powers, bags, swift travel, gold cap unlock, etc. The Devs are quite generous with awarding store points for just playing LOTRO and the game is more Free To Play friendly than others.  You can grind for store points by completing deeds on each character on your account, but you would have to work very hard to earn enough just to buy 1 quest pack.  You can also Google for guides to show you how to earn enough store points to Play for Free, check the Steam guides also.I suggest you try it out from Steam as Free to Play only, up to level 32. Then if you really want to pay, go to the in-game store to set up credit card payments. The best way to play LOTRO, imho, is to pay for the all the Expansions and Quest packs, then take VIP for 1 month, then create all your characters, then play for free as Premium account.   Expansions have to be bought separately, even for VIP players, but can be bought with store points in-game.  Paying for VIP for 1 month will unlock all the stuff for each character you open that you would have to buy separately.  With store points, you are able to unlock alot of things that VIP players get for free, and are in premium and free accounts to annoy them. Get the account Wallet also. The LOTRO store has a lot of sales on points bundles and items in store.  Don't expect payments from the Steam wallet to work, but it has worked at one time.If you have problems running this game while loaded from Steam, then download it straight from the LOTRO dot com website.  If you are a Mac user, and have problems playing this game then switch to a Windows OS computer.There is no pvp servers, just special pvp maps for level 105 subscribers to fight player controlled monsters.  You get a Orc Warrior (Reaver) for free with any character on that server reaching level 10.  The rest of the Creep classes are buyable using store points.  You can pvp on the same side by sparring but there is no rewards for that.LOTRO is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game set in a fantasy universe based upon J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth novels. It takes place during the time period of The Lord of the Rings movies. The graphics and controls are good still.  The level cap currently is 105 and there is plans for more expansions. The game like all other MMORPGs that has it's faults but it is better than the other games out there currently still, imho.  There are still plenty of hardcore and new players on the remaining open servers, after there has been a server consolidation in 2016. Standing Stone games is the original development team and have shifted producer to Daybreak game in 2017.  Has a great Crafting system. There are plenty of raids, dungeons and instant action content. Try this game out if you like fantasy MMORPGs.for more info:

												Still, after 9 years since game has been lounched it's one of the best mmorpg's ever made. Only the fact, game is still active, with still added content make this game such as unique as every mmo player need. I have played since closed beta, now i have over 1600 hours spent in this game (counted ingame time), my guild is still active after that much years after. Yes, only with a few elder members, but still .. Graphics dont look like an high end title, but ye ... it still isn't trash.  Much of key features fot times when game was new, like hobbies, great farming, nice crafting, exping of weapons, raising your own horse, housing for everyone not only for high lvl players. A lot of games after has tried to use these philosophies from lotro with theyr own little inovations.  It's the only mmorpg what i have still instaled, all these 9 long years and i'm still loging back. Not for long gaming sessions, I'm now 32 years old grandpa :D But for strong bond with this game, great sceneries, lovely soundtrack and a cup of nostalgia for sunday afternoons. I know, for today's young players is a lot of new games for chose from, with high end graphics etc. But in this game, you've got 9 years of ading quest with no ""clicktobehighestlvl"" like in wow = months of questing, months of collecting, months of making deeds, months of making your unique named and stated weapon, etc. Try it with your friends for the best experience. I will put my arm into Saurons fire if it will not be fun for you.			"

												This game was my childhood. I remember waking up every weekend and and running into the living room to load it up and play along with my parents. The game is absolutley amazing, I spent countless hours playing Lotro and I still do today. Whenever I had spare change I would go and buy something from the turbine store. Even though I am older now and don't have a lot of time to play lotro I still come back to it whenever I can. Can't wait for Mordor to come out!!!			"

												So after 500 hours I guess its time to write a review.No matter which game I play, I always seem to come back to Lotro. It has its flaws, but yet there is just something special about it. The community in general are always helpful and willing to help out new players, and after the server migrations the world feels much more populated. Even if you are not a fan of J.R.R Tolkien's work, I would still recommend you try this game for at least the first 30 levels, as you would not have to buy a single thing until then.Pros:- Great Community- The only game that allows you to explore most of Middle-Earth- Very active RP groups if you are interested in that- Hundreds of hours of content- Possible to play this game completely free (You can earn Turbine points by doing deeds in-game)- PvP is fun, as you can play either as the Free Peoples, or as Sauron's ArmyCons:- The game is old, so even though it still looks very good, the outdated graphics might put some people off- There is a lot that you would need to purchase or grind for, if you do not pay a monthly sub.- Server issues can cause lag quite a lot, especially in PvP, though in general it is fine- Balance issues with some classes, though the game is still being actively developed and balancedSo overall, I would score Lotro a 8/10, and would recommend anyone looking for a decent MMO or just a fun game to try it out.Edit: 1300 hours and review still stands, loving it so far!

												I played Lotro for 4-6 years....I tried returning a few weeks ago only to find literally the very game i had loved so much to be backtracked and burned to stupidity and dumbed down horribly...the classes are no longer classes v.v . It has become dead because of the stupid ♥♥♥♥ they keep doing honestly there used to be so much potential for the game and the developers and stuff always took it for granted and every expansion after Mines of Moria or Siege of Mirkwood or any content was disappointment after disappointment and they never cared to listen to any of the real voices of the game they basicly molded it now to be a stupid thing.... Lord of the rings doesn't deserve to be like this, I wish it could be redone back to how it was originally retouched graphics wise and have a crap ton of new features like boats/ships, swimming underwater. More including of PvP and playable ""Monsters"" cus kinda think it'd be cool to be a goblin >.> but meh...no instead they kept adding recolored and the same thing over and over :/, I would advise not to unless you just want to take in the views of each area considering most of it you have to unlock to quest in with grinded Turbine points or having purchased it all.I'll always remember Lotro, my favorite instance was Garth Agarwen back when it took a full group of 6 back when things were hard and you felt accomplished after succeeding the higher you leveled. If Possible I would love for this game to go back to how it was originally and then new features added and just a mass overhaul that J.R.R. Tolkiens world is worthy of, instead of the garbage money grab its become :(			"

												As a 7 year veteran of this game that has purchased every expansion/class/zone I cannot in good faith recommend this game anymore, Turbine have no idea what they are doing at this point and are obviously suffering from lack of staff and have been since Riders of Rohan launched.Turbine apparently decided a game wide nerf was in order because content was too easy, huge sweeping changes like this couldn't possibly affect anything right? NPC's in escort missions were hit by this nerf and in turn had their HP lowered to an absolutely rediculous amount causing some key story missions to be almost impossible until completely outleveling them (96 to do a level 87 required mission) requiring you to completely bypass doing the games main story (the key reason I enjoy it and play it) and do sidequests until you are able to go back and play catch up. If you managed to complete this story before the game wide nerf you were fine. This is insanely unacceptable to require the player to be almost a full 10+ levels higher to complete in order to finish the quest.Also of note is the absolutely abysmal or almost complete lack of optimization in the recent expansions. To put this in perspective I have trouble maintaining 15 FPS on ultra in areas with a fairly decent rig (R9 390X, i7 4790k, 32g DDR3). This game was released in 2007. I have no trouble maintaining 100+ FPS in Final Fantasy XIV on max settings. The game functions atrociously on anything above a dual core cpu and it shows. Mounted combat has been laggy and suffers from rubber banding regardless of connection since it was implemented in 2012 with no improvements, something that was touted as a main mechanic and the entire expansion was centered around. The game also suffers from extreme hitching regardless of settings/zone in every expansion past Riders of Rohan due to the way the engine is structured and reads files from an HDD, this is not fixed using an SSD or flash drive as the devs suggest in the forums.This is completely depressing as this is easily in my top 3 MMO's I've played. I love the community and the setting for this game; I have genuinely never met nicer people in an MMO than I have in this. I enjoyed being able to create my own character and explore an absolutely gorgeous world and I really enjoyed seeing an expanded form of the LOTR universe and being a part of new stories told in it.Maybe by some amazing stroke of luck the game can magically obtain a development team that is substantial enough and experienced enough to fix the problems with the game and restore it to the game I once enjoyed spending my time in, but until then the game is on life support and future updates will likely not fix the issues the game currently has.

Wonderfully created, with great music, ambient, sightseeing and just abundance of stuff to do and places to see.This game was the first to have great main story and memorable stuff to do.You can just log in and do basically nothing but walk around the Bree or Shire and enjoy it.

												Put it simple: the best MMORPG out there.It's big. What do you think is big? WoW? Check this. If you pay attention, you'll notice that any other MMORPG uses either corridor-like locations, with view always blocked by mountains, trees, buildings etc., or dramatically low draw distance, or both. Well, LotRO draws enormously vast locations with honest draw distance - not GTA V, but nothing like you've seen in MMORPG before. (The Crew was later). When you're in the fields of Rohan, you feel exactly why it is the land of horseriders.It's authentic. I play this game for 7 years and still I stop and gaze in awe at dwarf lords sculptures in Moria. Still I take screenshots of The Shire. Still I find dozens of new landscape details. This world is handcrafted by the indigenous inhabitants of Middle-Earth - piece by piece, tree by tree, bush by bush.It's homely. LotRO officially has the best or one of the best communities in online games.You know, I can go down to the basic mechanics, the classes (see in comments), the raids, the PvP, the unique mechanics like Legendary Weapons and Mounted Combat, but you know what? It's boring. Every game has mechanics, classes, balance and lots of people whine there's no balance. But this game is special. It has... it IS The Middle-Earth. If this means nothing to you, just pass by. You will like it, or dislike it, nothing I can change. But if you love Middle-Earth as I do, or if you are ready to fall in love with it, then whe shall meet at the White City. One day.Over 4000 hours /played on Russian servers before they were shut down.			"

												I haven't played an mmorpg since i played runescape and adventure quest when i was a kid. Since then i've only played FPS games (halo, cod etc.) so this was really refreshing to me. Almost had 200 hours playtime now and I'm just approaching the point where you have to start buying expansions to carry on playing the game in the same way. The game is still playable without expansion though and there is still more things to do, but you will be unable to do all of the sidequests which make progression in the came natural and prevent you having to grind levels. This game is immersive, social, and very very fun. The map is pretty much a life-size recreation of the entirety of middle-earth from the lotr universe.			"

												I've been playing LOTRO for 8 years and have a lifetime subscription (which is no longer available to purchase).If you love Tolkien's Middle-earth, you'll enjoy visiting Turbine's interpretation of it in LOTRO.If you enjoy theme park-style MMORPGs and don't mind playing an older title, you'll probably like LOTRO, too.If you're looking for PvP, you'll find it's limited in LOTRO, but still has a lot of passionate players.If you only enjoy competitive max-level raiding for ""world firsts,"" LOTRO probably isn't for you.If you like making music or role-playing, LOTRO will probably be like heaven.

												Ever wondered to explore Middle-Earth and see the town of Bree, the greens of the Shire and the beauty of Rivendell through your very own eyes? Or perhaps you aspire to be a warrior of the Free Peoples by wielding a shield with as much expertise as shield-master Boromir or string an arrow to the bow as elegantly as the archer Legolas and leave a pile of Orcs in your wake?The Lord of the Rings Online offer all those opportunities and more. Excellent graphics means that you really feel the whole Middle Earth experience when you walk through the town of Bree and into the Prancing Pony for a glass beer or mug of ale. And yes, LOTRO will let you do that!Having spent the past few years of my life playing this game in my free time, I will admit that initially downloaded the game not knowing what to expect of LOTRO's idea of Middle Earth but now many years later, I am proud to say that I've got the chance to do deeds that would make Aragorn consider leaving Arwen for. Or make Boromir betray Gondor - if that makes more sense to you.From simple solo exploring of the fields of the Shire to raiding up with up to 23 other people (24 in total) to fight the likes of vile creatures such as Balrogs and Dragons, LOTRO has it. A good combat skill and trait system allows for dynamic fights and variety of gameplay amongst the various classes. Feel like wielding a shield and turning into a unstoppable version of a defensive god or grasping a greatblade and breaking the Middle-Earth record of ""number of Uruks killed""? Then make it happen by playing LOTRO.Taking all of the above into account and adding on things like a wide choice of mounts for players, a flexible and in-depth crafting system, unique legendary items, player housing filled with the Balrog's Sword (a loot dropped from killing him) makes The Lord of the Rings Online THE MMO to play.Take your first baby steps in Middle-Earth by giving this game a try - who knows, you might even get into the history books found in the Library of Rivendell.Forward onto victory! Forward...FOR GONDOR!			"

												Undying for its iconic interactive portrayal of Tolkien's world, LOTRO has had its fair share of problems lately, but it still remains a fun and memorable game.Pros:+it features a lot of the places and events from the book+contains a very vast world, whose variety truly makes you feel like you're on an adventure+the dialogues do manage to awake some of the nostalgia which made the book so powerful+class advancement, though not special from other MMOs, is still quite decent+the story part of the quests is more developed than in many other MMOsCons:-the graphics is pretty much outdated-overall, Turbine's marketing techniques tend to be a bit aggressive and dishonest. Besides, the F2P system is quite tricky. Don't go into the game imagining you can play it up until the final level without paying anything, because that's very nearly impossible. -shallow dialogues, inaccurate portrayals of iconic places, uninteresting new landscapes-repetitive quests and often grinding, though not more than in other MMOs-the last updates have been quite disappointing in terms of the originality of the contentNeutral:-the PvP system is promising and quite enjoyable already, but it is also poorly uninvested inDespite its many issues, I would still recommend LOTRO for its landscapes, story and lore, at least for a try. If you do not like it, you may give up before hitting the level where you actually need to start paying money to advance properly. But just don't go into it with the impression that you'll reach max level entirely for free (like in GW2), because, even though technically it's possible, it's extremely difficult and will ruin the fun of it even if attempted.

												So i have 9.4hrs on steam and i don't want to count how many hours i have on the standalone client. But i have to say lotro has the most compelling and mature community that iv encountered.  Only gripes i have with the game is that partial p2p system. What i mean by this is after the lonelands questing zone you have to purchase the quest zones or get vip. Though this is circumvented through deeds where you gain turbine points (Or what ever there called now). Im not sure how it is now since the new company has taken over but this is my over all experence iv had with lotro prior to the new company.Should you play Lotro? - Yes one thousand times yes  even though of the partial p2p the community and mechanics of the game is very compelling and engaging.

												Great game. One thing that you would need to know is that if you want the game to be entirely F2P then it'll require A LOT of grinding to be able to earn ""Turbine Points"" to purchase expansion packs + many other things. Other than that, this game is a lot of fun to play, the landscapes are beautiful, and you can do lots of exploring. LOTRO has many more positive things to it so I urge you to just give it a try, the game IS free afterall!			"

												The atmosphere is great, especially in Moria and some other areas. The community is good, and combat is enjoyable.That said, quests are awful in every way, there is no dialogue whatsoever, a lot of places are badly-designed, cosmetically and practically (Minas Tirith, I'm looking at you), and class balance is not great (poor hunters). Don't bother playing without a subscription or good hardware, either - most of the game requires cash to access (including class-critical abilities), and later areas are laggy.The character building/equipment system is a joke, especially since essences.- There's a whole bunch of base and derived stats (maybe 25-35, depending on how you count), but only a third is actually relevant. The remaining stats come free when gearing for the important third.- There are sixteen equipment slots (plus legendary items, which are class features, not items), but they all do exactly the same: they exist only to dump armour with lots of essence slots into. Yes, there are set bonuses, but you could easily reduce the whole equipment system to, say, six numbers (# of four kinds of essences, # of two kinds of equipment set).- Overall, there is a semblance of complexity, but successive updates only seem to replace the need to think about your equipment with more grind-based power creep.- To be clear, combat is fine. It's just that char-op is boring.I don't recommend it, because I don't like it (anymore). However, if you're not interested in deep character building systems, you like being monologued at by NPCs (in LoTR-style speech), and you don't mind a bit of grind, it's otherwise a good game.			"

												Horrible F2P Model, And An Incredibly Boring Solo ExperienceSo many pointless restrictions to F2P playersWhatever you wanna do, you are always reminded of the store, and there will be always something blocking you unless you get VIP (Premium) or buy Turbine Points (or endlessly grind for them)Your wallet is capped to 2 gold, which is no-where near enough for people who are level 20+Your ability to use the Auction feature (Global Trade/Multiplayer Market) and sell your items is locked, you need to buy ""slots"". Each ""slots"" purchase gives you 3 slots to sell your items. Pathetic and not nearly enoughYou need to buy a ""Mount Skill"" in order to use the mounts in-game, which are desperatly needed since your character in-game is stupidly super slowAny basic features you need to use that are provided for free and easy to use in any other F2P MMORPG, you need to grind and spend hours on end just to use in this gameThere is such a heavy focus on the LotRO Store and the game practically forces you to buy into their stupid VIP Premium crap, and punishes you if you don'tLoTRO is just a P2W exploited gameAll the pointless restrictions can be unlocked, via the LotRO Shop, by doing ""Deeds""But Deeds are just a boring, endless grind of killing the same monsters that take hours on end just to turn up with afew Turbine Points (LoTRO Shop Currency). You get 15 Turbine Points for about an hours worth of grinding the same, slowly respawning Monster, and some of the lower costing features is around 95 Turbine pointsThe game is incredibly boring, and just a long boring choreIt's just jam-packed with courier missions that make you back and foward from one town to another, to transport an item, give a letter to someone, or tell someone something. Things slowly pick up by level 20, but not nearly enough to make the game fun or intrestingTL;DR - The game is one long, boring, P2W choreI highly advice you to stay away from this game, it's really not worth your time unless you're willing to drop so much money into this game			"

												I've been playing LoTRO since 2012 on and off never really comitting to it.Recently after having played Legion and other mmos such as archeage and BDO I found myself bored and in need of something to play again.Downloaded LoTRO and have been hooked to it ever since.Rerolled as a Hobbit Minstrel and the Shire is extremely beautiful!The game has quite a large amount of quests and I find myself feeling a bit overwhelmed at times but I came to realize again that this game is not set on a linear path.You can go anywhere and pickup quests in different parts of the map as well as explore or slay monsters for deeds which give Turbine Points and basically go on your own journey which is something many mmorpgs nowadays don't have.Also if you are a roleplayer this game is a very good place to do just that!Have seen a few people roleplaying in an inn somewhere in the Shire and it was pretty cool to see!Pros:Not p2wCash Shop currency can be earned by doing deeds and if done correctly 230 turbine points can be earned in 1hr 30mins patience can get you many places in this game if you choose to grind deeds for tp!Open worldFriendly communityDoesn't feel like you are just blindly rushing to end gameMost content stays true to the booksVarity of classes and RacesCons:Occasional server lagDated graphicsMonster players are behind compared to regular playersYou can do many things and this is sometimes overwhelming to newer players			"

												The steam review system is keeping me from posting my original, longer review, so here, in a nutshell:- Used to be such a great game, with an awesome community, much respect for the lore and the books etc. - Ever since the F2P conversion, there is more and more focus on the store.- Just came back after a long break (have played since launch, but took long breaks), and I can't try any of the new content as I have to unlock the zones and their quests. So either have to sub, buy TP or do insane grinds. - Even if I was remotely interested in either of that, the fact that there are still SO many bugs keeps me from doing so. Within 10 minutes, I saw such incredibly horrible rubberbanding on my warsteed (which was something people complained about when this system came OUT in 2012), that I don't wanna see more.- Game feels empty now, hardly saw any players, my formerly big and active guild is deserted now- Whatever you wanna do, you are always reminded of the store, and there will be always something blocking you unless you sub or buy TP (or grind)I am saddened by what the game has become. It was so immersive, had such a great community (especially on Laurelin-RP), but now feels empty and abandoned, and for a returning player, there is hardly any motivation to stick around and come back because everything is locked unless you pay. So this ""F2P"" feels more like an extended trial. I have no issues with F2P, many games do it so much better though.This is just a shadow of its former glory, and the few minutes I just spent after my last hiatus gave me no reason at all to ever come back.

												One of the oldest and best MMOs out there. If you love stories in games this is a good choice. It has 100s of hours of stuff to do. The recent server consolidation means the worlds feel much busier and server choice isn't as important as it used to be. The game also has one of the nicest communities I've seen in any game. The free to play model is a bit unusual, it's not exploitative in any way but I'd recommend VIP for at least a month.Now on the bad side: the graphics are a bit dated now but the landscapes can still be stunning. Combat animations are slow, which makes combat feel a bit sluggish. The game is also far too easy when levelling up, but this is fixed at higher levels.Overall I'd highly recommend it.			"

												Excellent graphics, scenery, cosmetics. Unbeatable storyline (LOTR). Endless content to keep you busy, from easy solo missions to big dragon raids, and Isengard dungeons. See places from the main story, or places you rarely ever hear of. Currently this game stretches from The Shire, thru Moria and the Misty Mountains, all the way to Isengard and beyond! Very polished and easy to play. Totally worth giving this one a try if your a LOTR fan. 9/10Review about starter packs:This game is truely amazing. I've played it for years. The only problem with this specific pack is that it doesn't even provide you with VIP status for 30 days. That is extra on top of this initial cost. I would only recommend this starter pack to people who really like to collect in their MMOs. Otherwise, just play for free until your ready for VIP.			"

												Considerations of this game from most important to least:-It's free to play (truly) -it remains about as faithful to true Lord of the Rings lore as any game has ever done so far-bonuses that are available to players who pay premium can be acquired by free-to-play players by doing a nominal amount of grinding (and if you want to get the expansions for free, you can grind a hell of a lot and still manage to get those as well) -game is entirely playable as a single player if you so desire (offering power ups at key story points if you don't have a group)-a very friendly community of players that is extremely helpfulHonestly, the only downside that I see to this game is that once you reach roughly level 30 (which does not take a ton of time - I reached level 20 after a few days of playing) things start to take a lot more time.  This is because a lot of the features in the game, such as fast-travel, mile-stone bindpoints (teleportation points), and upgraded mounts aren't available immediately to free-to-play players.  That is not to say that mounts are entirely unavailable to free-to-play players however, a mount is available to any character at roughly level 20.  Obviously it is necessary for the company to provide services that must be paid for in order to keep the game running, and considering the fact that an entirely new player could go into the game and immediately start playing what would be roughly 70% of the game content without spending a penny; that is a pretty good deal.  Not to mention that, as i said previously, if you grind 'turbine points' in game enough, you can collect enough to pay for all of the expansions - granted it would take a long time, but it is certainly possible.All in all, i would rate this game 9/10.  The point loss is purely because there are still a few extremely minor inaccuracies in the game that are noticeable to Lord of the Rings fans who are extremely knowledgeable to the lore.			"

												LOTRO is an excellent ""visualization"" of J. R. R. Tolkien's Trillogy - The Lord of the Rings. It is based solely on the books, and therefor differs from the Peter Jackson movie version -- which took significant liberties with the books. There is no ""Dwarf Tossing"" or ""Shield surfing"" in Helms Deep to just pick two glaring examples.The world of Middle Earth is huge, and contains many ""easter eggs"" from both the books and Tolkien's life. At present, November 2014, LOTRO has no ""end-game"" - it has only just begun the third book of the Trillogy, and will probably not reach the Black Gate until 2016. But while we hope Sam and Frodo reach Mount Doom on their own, there is much to do to clean-up Sauron's deviltry in the rest of the world.There is much to do in Middle Earth. 29 Servers provide a wealth of opportunity for players to create different characters for each of the four races - Dwarf, Elf, Man and Hobbit; and in each of the classes - Hunter, Champion, Guardian, Captain, Minstrel, Lore-master, and with the appropriate expansions, Rune-keeper, Warden and the just introduced Beorning. Players can create characters on each server!The Fan-run website: https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Main_Page provides a wealth of information about the game, from items and quests, to background lore.

												People complain a great deal about The Lord of the Rings Online in how it isn't immersive with its dialogue, or lack thereof, and other rather old MMO elements. So World of Warcraft and Star Wars Galaxies were not great games either that followed this game doctrine?LOTRO is an exceptional example of an MMO for fans of the books, movies, and newcomers alike. The player-base is smaller than others, but this leads to a community that is more friendly, and charitable. That is one of the best parts about this game also: the community. In LOTRO, you won't find many toxic people (At least, on my server, Crickhollow). I bought this game the day it came out, and have had the luxury to see how it evolved since then, and the toxocity has not increased much (but, this game is free, so expect some bad apples).The MMO is also very relaxed, meaning that if you are used to super-competitive MMOs, and want to retreat from it all, LOTRO is a great game to relieve that built-up tension. The crafting system is also elaborate, and fun to do as well, with crafters even giving some of their finished work for free to players in need.The attention to detail involving the world of Middle-Earth is very accurate to how J.R.R. Tolkien wrote it (not how Peter Jackson tried to erase it in the movies), with famous characters, places, and events all happening that fans read about. I can compare this to Star Wars Galaxies (RIP), where you are sort of ""Along for the ride"" with the major plot.Overall, LOTRO is one of the best MMOs out there right now, if you don't want to remove your scarf and thick-framed glasses and play WoW (tried WoW, got bored of it the same way the people who gave this MMO negative reviews did). So many elements encompass the greatness of this rather obscure, and in some ways forgotten, MMO. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes MMOs, give it a shot, it is free after all!			"

												This is probably one of my favorite things to review...as you can tell by my hours..198.8 hours total, BUT I have 64.9 Hours just in two weeks, thats how addicting this game can be, that is with no sitting around, no afking or etc..it's a very fun game..But with the fanboying aside lets get to what you guys came for and give my Pros and ConsPros:Great Community (very helpful no matter what server your on)Beautiful AtmosphereNever breaks the tolkien universe feeling (which means always feels like your really in the Tolkien Universe) Great Variety in Weapons, skill sets, and armors, you will rarely find someone with the same kind of armor and or weapon as you or even close for that matterVery Unique in its own way, personally I love the cosmetic system, it adds this feeling to kind of drive you into the universe more so you can kinda be more in character, feel like your there (Cosmetic system, allows you to equip armor and weapons that you would personally think suits you, so for man it would be ranger armor and etc, dwarves heavy dwarven armor and etc...Personally it a great feature as it gives a better feeling to it) Teams still working on the game, making it much better with every update!Added a new race called Beorning with the class (their like druids, for WoW players you turn into a bear pretty much lol) But also hard to get on free to play..but possible!Has own servers for Roleplayers (so if your into kind of the Tolkien universe for LOTR that you know a lot about roleplaying and stuff give it a shot, people are very forgiving on Laurelin (the EU and US RP server) along with other servers as well.Has some wonderfu crafting mechanics that could very much benefit you if you are in a Kinship (kind of like a clan) you can help each other have the gear you need to FIGHT For middle earth!Cons:Sadly, helps the VIP a lot, with all expansions and etc unlockedF2P's have to ""farm"" all their points in order to levelF2P's have a huge grindSometimes you could be looked down upon from being a f2p by VIP's (more my personal experience but still, something to be careful about)Time Consuming farming (not too much of a complaint as that's how its suppose to be XD)Graphics for character are out of date (expected of course from 2009)Some areas can be depressing yes, but that DOESN'T mean its still not beautiful, you could be taken away by the beautiful areas around Angmar, or the huge mountains in Moria or just in the Misty Mountains great places to go (harder to get to if your F2P, trust me..I farmed the points, tough but worth it) These are of course my personal Pros and Cons, as you would expect, but most of them were based off of other people's reactions to the game and stuff like that, so it is not just me spewing a bunch of stuff out for someone to read :P I hoped you loved the review, and trust me I'd gladly give it a 10/10 course it has its flaws but it is still beautiful, fun, and interesting.And always remember....Baruk Khazâd!

The community loves Tolkiens world and they treat eachother with respect and open arms. The most important game in my long history of gaming - an MMO legend you should not miss if you are interested in Middle Earth and its tales. What Peter JAckson did for the books in the movie world, Turbine the developer did for the gaming world. A beautiful and surprisingly accurate depiction of the books and scriptures of JRR Tolkien. A timeless Art Direction makes the game still look relevant today. Join the greatest Fantasy Universe ever imagined.			"

The main story (epic quests) has you following the fellowship (or running parallel), working in the background to fight the rising evil, aiding the good cause.You will quest around landmarks from the books like Weathertop, and you can find little touches like the petrified trolls in the Trollshaws.It may not have the best graphics (but certainly not the worst either). I grew up with a Commodore 64, so gameplay is more important than graphics for me, but things like the use of lighting to set the mood works really well for me, as does the weather.It is F2P, but that doesn't mean it doesn't cost a thing to have all content available.The good thing is that the store credits (Turbine Points) can be earned in-game, and that you can buy almost everything that is included in the VIP status with it. The only notable exception is 'fast travel' which you really will miss if you haven't got it, as the game is BIG.The bad thing is that earning TP quickly is a grind, although it can be sped up if you have some high level characters.Combat is old school skill clicking, which you either like or dislike.Crafting is extremely simple; you have the mats, you make the item. (with a % to critical success). I would have liked something more involving, like EverQuest II's crafting perhaps.Crafting does require interaction with other players, as you won't be able to get all materials you need yourself for the crafts you choose.If you are into PvP, then this game is not for you.There is some sort of PvP (PvMP), where some players have a character on the evil side, and some players play their regular 'good' side characters. There's one map for it, and the PvP crowd varies wildly per server.If you are into endgame raids, then this game is not for you. There is no (new) endgame content. There are scaling instances, which are essentially the same from L20 upwards, except with harder enemies.There is some new endgame content in the making though.Most of the population is helpful and mature, but, as this is an online game, there are some trolls and trouble makers on the chat channels. Although vocal, this is a very small group compared to the helpful people.Oh, one major bad thing: The download is HUGE, and the update process is extremely slow compared to other MMOs.Overall: If you like the Lord of the Rings lore (whether from the books or the movies) and like to explore Middle Earth yourself, then this is the only game to play.It's free up to around L30, after which you need to unlock quests for other areas.Whether you pay for it with money or with time is up to you, which is a fair deal IMO.And remember, the journey is more important than the goal.

												If you like MMOs and you like LOTR then this is literally the best thing ever. (If you just like MMOs and don't really know much about LOTR then it still might be the best thing ever.) It isn't pay to win IF you are committed because by completing challenges (called deeds) you can earn points (Turbine Points) that you can then use to purchase the expansions or quest packs. However, if you are impatient like me then you might end up spending 50 bucks, which isn't really a bad idea if you like the game because it's supporting the devs!The scenery and places you can go are amazing. The game is practically a 1:1 scale of Middle Earth (don't quote me because I know this isn't true...). The gameplay doesn't really get monotonous like most MMOs, because the quests are very fun to do (especially in a group). JUST DON'T DO QUESTS IN THE SHIRE BECAUSE ALL THEY ARE IS GETTING SENT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN 2 HOBBITS THAT ARE LITERALLY 100 FEET AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. The community is probably one of the friendliest I have ever had to pleasure to play with. Most of the players are a really good sport and are very helpful if you ask questions. If you are into RPing then this is one of the best places to go because the RP system is pretty kickass and the RPers know what they're doing.My review may not be the best, but hopefully with this one and some of the others, we get a new member to the LOTRO family!(and remember that it IS free to play so you can always try it! If you don't like it just delete it!)			"

												I've been playing this game since it became free to play, and I feel like every update since has been making the game better and better for me. I'm a big fan of Middle Earth and getting to see bits of lore that you don't experience in film (like Tom Bombadil for instance) really helps bring this world to life. I love the emphasis on kindness and friendship, and following the epic storyline makes you feel like you are a part of this world and that you all matter.As far as gameplay goes, I feel it is fairly standard in terms of controls - easy to get the hang of once you learn the differences from other games. Some people may not agree with the locking out of certain features in-game for free players, but these are easily unlockable with enough effort and determination without having to spend a penny. I personally did end up subscribing for a few months to unlock a lot of content. Since then, I am always considered a premium account and I keept a lot of the features that were unlocked with subscribing.This is my favorite free to play MMORPG out there at this time.			"

												This game was my very first MMO, started playing in 2013 (I have way more time in the game, downloaded LOTRO via Steam recently) and its a really good game. Follows the actual LOTR fairly well. Players are usually fairly helpful, so it has a good atmosphere. A plus is being able to play for free if you wanted (VIP is worth it, but its possible to grind).EDIT: The last couple of updates has made it feel almost like a chore to get the really nice max level (Level 105) gear. T2 raids are the fasest way to get it done but Teir 2 requires a really big amount of morale to even survive the raid (not to mention groups usually require a certain amount). Essence armour was fun when it was first released with Gonder but in my opinion the morale levels and essence gears are getting way out of hand. I still enjoy and recommend this game, though. You wont have to worry about essence armour until you are a higher level anyways.10/10 A great MMO			"

												     Out of all the games I have played in my entire life, The Lord of the Rings Online (LotRO) has been the most detailed and beautiful game I have ever come across. The story emulates Tolkein's original work, and as a LotR fan, I appreciate that. The graphics of this game are not top-notch, but compared to other MMOs and MOBAs I have played (Archeage, DDO, Smite, Rift, etc.), the graphics are much better. The music in this game is nothing short of phenomenal, as Chance Thomas's compositions are eloquent, detailed, and blend in with the scenery of the game. The game itself is immersive in nature. I have played for up to twelve hours at a time without even noticing (recovering LotRO addict). LotRO offers VIP subscription, but it is not needed. Regions and the LotRO quad pack can be bought with LotRO Points (either buy them or acquire them by completing deeds). For those who want to have a VIP subscription, it only costs ~10 USD per month, but there are 3 month, 6 month, 12 month, and lifetime subscriptions avaliable. I give LotRO a 10/10.			"

												Lord of the rings online (Lotro) is a great game, although it follows the main lord of the rings story line, you get the be in the background of the war, doing the minor quests that make huge differences.

												First of all I want to point out that im a f2p user on this MMO, and I have by-passed many restrictions without a problem. It's an absoloutely amazing game, especially if you're a big fan of the LOTR triology, as you can easily relate to many parts in this game, story, characters etc etc...The game truly has great content, and a huge world to explore as you level up to capin at 105 :) ...Graphics are quite decent , especially on high specs, and runs quite well on alot of systems.. no matter if you have an average pc/laptop. Communities are great (from experience : primarily depending on the server activity) for the most part there is always someone there to give you a helping hand when you start off. Apart from the exciting and adventurous story and quests, LOTRO also brings PVP, which is quite competitive involving the Freeps( the good side/the classes of middle earth) vs Creeps( the monsters/evil side). Both are playable and both are great, its all up to a matter of preference which side you would like to PVP as. I wont review that in detail, but there's plenty of playthroughs and info on pvp online.Im currently a lvl 105 Beorning [ with a couple of alts of each class, all lowbies :)  ] ( totally F2p ) in the server of Evernight - Name : Hranvir, and have not spent a single cent getting her (bar VIP for 1 month, which I decided upon in the end), with expansions, and quest packs leading up as far as the end game Far Anórien quest pack (excluding the odd few quest packs/ and the helms deep expansion, which are not too necessary in reaching end game) , as well as gold cap, Auction house slots,beorning class w/ character slot , you name it. All unlocked by doing the deeds, quests etc to unlock ( LOTRO points/the in-game store currency - above the traditional gold/silver/bronze) All through arming and also using different alt characters to repeat... making hundreds each run (approximately around 400+) within 2-3 hours.It just shows that if you're a F2P even for the start, how far and how much you can achieve without paying anything, just with some time,patience and dedication, which will pay off in the end :) . Its up to you if you want to pay for the  game expansions/quest packs, especially if you feel you do not have the time at hand to farm them all out. (even going VIP for 1 month will unlock many permanent restrictions on your account (characters which you log on while VIP is up will gain benefits), aswell as giving you some TP & access to PVP as a freep, and access to all creep classes... only for the price of €13) I have done it for one month & its definitely worth it imho! Overall, if you loved the LOTR story/books/movies, and are a huge fan of MMO's ,you like open world action, the freedom to do/go as you wish, meet many new friends, and encounter some great adventures... this is the game for you! :) I personally love this game and once you get started, its quite tricky to let go :) I felt is was just really exciting, and is a great experience you might not want to miss out on :) I would certainly recommend this to anyone and you should download and give it a go right away! If you would like to have a deeper look into the game/gameplay/action and so forth, Youtube is simply the way, as it will show you through gameplay, the races/classes/mounts/ etc etc. so do check that out! LOTRO is definitely a great MMO, and one you will certainly get to grips with and enjoy! :)*This review is based from personal experiences, so to really see if it is applicable to your enjoyment, give it a go! :)  In my opinion, it is one of the best mmo games out there, and its free! *			"

												Has a vibe to it which calms you. The music and scenery really make you fell relaxed when your in towns our venturing the roads. And the battle music I admit could use more than one track at times. The hobbies and deeds make replaying the game quite fun.

												Pretty good overall and captures the atmosphere of JRR Tolkein's world nicely.Used to play a long time ago and have come back to it on steam now; a lot of things have changed but it's still fun. The skill system and crafting is complex and satisfyingly engaging.An annoyance factor about it is the ever-present Pay-to-play aspect, very soon into the game you will be chasing turbine points to buy basic things like extra inventory space and extra character slots, increasing your gold cap etc etc as what you are given just isn't enough to be able to play properly. The Community is very friendly (certainly on the server I am on) and there is always groups happening for both quests/instances and some lovely rp-events.By todays standards the game engine & graphics could be considered *outdated* but I think some areas are  beautiful if you max out the graphics options. Recommended, especially if you are a fan of the books+films :)			"

												Wish I could say yes and no. It can be a fun game if you are into Tolkien lore. There is a TON of stuff to do in this game. But there is a lot of bugs and glitches even after this many years. It is SUPER confusing trying to figure out where to go versus which quest pack you need to buy and so forth. If you are a subscriber which makes everything available to you except expansions it is a little smoother. But as a f2p it can be very confusing. The graphics are getting dated but with everything on max setting I still found some areas to be quite beautiful. The prices on the expansions are quite expensive for such an old game. Its not a game where you can just hop into here and there. It is fun if you immerse yourself into the world though. I refused to pay another 40-60 bucks for an expansion that seems like the rest of Riders of Rohan so I cant comment on Helms Deep or any changes that came with it.			"

												Great game if you are into slow paced games. With its beautiful sceneries and amazing music, you get this lotr feeling when you play it. Recommended if you are willing to spend money after you have advanced a little in the game (you have seen nothing when you have reached level 20, so much left to do!)cons:Very demanding in terms of in-game avaiability, you have to purchase off restrictions, like gold cap.You can't proceed further than level 30 if you are not interested in grinding repeated in-game activites.Not much player activity in old game areas, whereas at the level cap there is tons of player activity(depending on which server)pros: Beautiful and large sceneries, you can travel from thorin's hall to east-Rohan!You have to dedicate your time if you want to reach the best of the best, making it kind of adictive.Many recreations from Tolkiens books!Possible to earn enough in-game currency to unlock anything you want which would cost money, if you have time.8/10			"

												This is a truly amazing game for Tolkien fans and RPG gamers alike. The game give you access to many starting areas including the beloved Shire and Bree-lands as seen in the movies and books. And give you the opportunity to play completely f2p by earning Turbine points in game to unlock other areas in Middle Earth. Additionally the Epic (main) questline is completely f2p and you can run through the entire game at no cost, completely worth it. If you want to see the beoved characters true to the books, experience some authentic tolkien lore, play classes with incredible skills and characteristics, become a member of the highest crafting guilds and test your skills in fellowships with people from all over the world I completely reccomend this game :D			"

												Best F2P MMO , especially if you're a LOTR/The Hobbit fan. Has the best community like mentioned by many others. People really like to help, if you get lost at questlines or need something etc... It really is the ultimate MMO. I've played it many years back, then tried some others games, but I keep coming back to play this, especially now when it's on Steam , I decided to start it again. The game just never gets boring. The classes, the content, the community.... It's just remarkable			"

												I used to love this game. In fact, it was my favorite MMO. I loved the Legendary Items, loved the raids, loved the PVP, loved the crafting, and most importantly, loved the world and story. At some point along the way, Turbine suffered a few hits to their staff. Many developers were gone as a result. This was awful for the game. For some reason, they decided to take away group content and focus on ""Big Battles"" which some would argue that it is still group content, but it is extremely lacking. I have played this game since Shadows of Angmar beta and loved it, but without the group content and developers being let go, I have a feeling this game is dying. I hope that isn't the case. Do I recommend the game? Well, it depends. I loved what it was and hate what it's becoming. Hopefully it will get better as time goes on. Time will tell.			"

												This game is fun and addictive as well as free.The world is open and explorable from the moment that you finish the very helpful tutorial. The world is beautifully rendered and the art style is reminiscnt of the films. The story is also captivating as you help Gandalf and the felowship. The iconic landmarks such as Isengard, Minas Tirith and Gondor are fully Explorable and the game is completley free. No nescascary subscription, no mandatory payments only complete freedom of choice. The shop allows you to buy level boosts and other items (Weapons, Furniture, Steeds, Premium stuff, etc.) through their ingame currency, Turbine Points, and they can be earned by doing deeds. The completley free players can earn premium currency by farming and thus stay completley Free to play.8.5/10-Stefan			"

												You can play your own instruments... Upload some fan made music creations and listen to Crazy Train on a lute!But on a serious note:Gameplay 7/10 - Combat is dull but overall not terribleGraphics 8/10 - Some areas are very beautiful, and some look quite poorCommunity 10/10 - The kindest bunch of players i've ever met on an MMO (On an RP realm)Is it Pay-To-Win? I wouldn't say so but you won't get very far without at least 1 purchase... It's 'Pay and you can speed everything up' (Levelling Boosts etc) however from what i can see there is NO way to purchase in game gold, which is good, and no way to purchase game changing gear.However i would recommend purchasing VIP at least once, or purchase anything. If you are planning on playing this game 100% free without buying anything ever, you are going to have a bad time. Gold cap is 2G and you remove it by making a purchase.Highly Recommended, but don't expect a free rideTime_For_Tea "

												Although this game seems outdated and there are a few problems with it, I love it.Some of the strong points of the game include:  Story and lore - there is a ton of story and lore packed into this game, which is awesome if you're a Tolkien fan  Music - the music is top-notch for the most part and really fits the world well  PvE content - there is always something to do, whether it's following a quest chain to level up you or your epic weapon, following the main storyline, fighting in a skirmish, decortaing your personal or kin house, or participating in one of the many festivals  Character housing - something WoW has yet to implement...Some of the weak points of the game are:  Rewards - Turbine has a problem with giving away proper rewards in their games. It happens in their D&D game as well. you can run through a long Instance for 20 minutes and get a bit of skirmish marks, or you can do a quick skirmish and get the same number of skirmish marks. And the daily gifts are usually something you don't need or want  PvP is lacking - I'm not very much into PvP, but if you are, this probably isn't the game for you. The PvP (in LoTRO, PvMP) system seems stale and boring. It is cool to be able to fight on the monster side, though  Graphics are outdated - models and animations need to be updated, though there are many times the graphics are quite beautiful. I appreciate that the graphics are less cartoony than other MMO's, but an update would help a lotMany people complain about it now being F2P, but it doesn't bother me, I just love the LoTR world and love being part of it. This game may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I definitely recommend it for a shade of Earl Grey.			"

The best weapons in the game are crafted, not bought. It also has fantastic graphics for the low system requirments it has. The story is great. After the helms deep exansion it took away the traditional trait system of the game and made a few classes more powerful than they should. All in all this game is great and because it is free so there is no penalty for trying.

												If you are going to play it, purely F2P, you can, by grinding TP ( Turbine Points ).You can basically get the whole game that way, at the cost of several months of straight-up farming/grinding.I highly recommend that you play with other people, whether you know them or not. Playing solo is boring, as it is slow. Some classes can actually make soloing easy. However, playing solo is entirely viable. At the moment, any class can mow down tons of enemies on their own. At levels 1-90, you will hardly find anyone to play with, there isn't enough people to do stuff with, or they don't have the content, as they have to buy it.There's also a bunch of classes with their own mechanics, the most basic of them being the Guardian.If you like LOTR lore, this is for you, however, don't expect amazing end-game stuff, and don't expect a top-of-the-line story.Some may enjoy the story of LOTRO, as it ties you with the main characters from LOTR, but some may also be bored with the main stuff, rather quickly.The PVP is...meh. There isn't any structured PVP so it's all in a region called the Ettenmoors. The balance is for PVP has always been bad/awful, as there is always something OP.The community is fairly helpful compared to many other games, but there is always an occasionally jerk/idiot/whatever.If you come expecting amazing, you'll kinda feel let down.

												I've been playing this game on and off since release, I still have the original physical copy even though that is now pretty useless. I've really struggled making headway. I play for a while, stop, comeback moths or even years later and start again. The one thing I have to say about this game is props to the devs. I know Turbine got a lot of criticism for going F2P and perhaps rightly so, but to still be releasing content after nearly 10 years is incredible in a time where if games aren't commercially successful instantly they are dead within a year. I really hope they continue until endgame in Mordor.			"

												Any fan of Lord of the Rings--casual or otherwise--will enjoy this game immensely. Every server is still highly populated (although some areas may seem barren because really, who wants to spend all day in an area that has litterally one building for miles?) and filled with people of all ages. I've met high school freshman and college graduates. The people playing this game are extremely nice and mature. I've only had two encounters with genuinely mean people and I never had to deal with them alone even if I was playing alone.There are lots of quests to do solo and lots to do in groups as little as 2 and as big as 8. There's also a mode where more than one fellowship can play together or somehing I'm pretty sure but I have yet to hit the appropriate level so I can't confirm. If none of your friends wan to play with you worry not! Most everyone is approachable and everyone has common ground. Unlike WoW or GW2 where you could start playing not knowing if you'll ever care about the lore, everyone on LOTRO likes LOTR. Some prefer the books, others prefer the movies, but you all have that common ground. There are RP servers but if you don't only want to roleplay, there are an abdundance of roleplayers running around on the normal servers to satisfy your urges when you get them.Gameplay itself is also fun. I wouldn't say it's the most outstanding thing in the entire world. You'll find similar mechanics in other MMOs and it's not any more or less engaging than those other MMOs. Depending on your class you'll get to see some really cool animations, though. The main storyline is also very engaging and very fun for fans of LOTR. I remember obsessing over it when I first started playing, haha. So yeah 10/10 I do recommend.			"

												Probably the best F2P expeirence I've had with an MMO and very dedicated developers who care about the community.  They have a system to give out store credit like candy on Halloween, so it's incredibly easy to get buckets full of free content and expansions without paying a dime.  Solid classes, combat, huge world rich with detail, and a crazy RP community			"

												If you are a Tolkien fan then this game is a must, the environments are true to the books and a lot of love and care went in to the quest and story writing. The graphics are a little dated now, it is an older game. But that doesn´t take away the fact that this MMO is a gem.			"

												This game is all about rp. Instead of leveling I'm more busy with collecting steeds, going to parties and playing insturments and dance. The fighting system is not really evolved but old fasioned for online games. Better it is, becouse all those new games are too complicated for me, being not the best gamer around.			"

												I tried this game years ago and only played the free areas. It was patronisingly easy and dull at the beginning but it got better as it went on. When I'd finished all the free areas and hit the currency cap, I moved on to a different game. I always remembered how much I enjoyed it though and recently I bought the expansion packs during a sale. It's much more enjoyable paying for access rather than grinding for Turbine Points. With the expansion areas unlocked, it's a lot easier to get TP too. After a couple of quest pack purchases, the whole game can be unlocked painlessly through regular play.			"

												 Before the Rider's of Rohan expansion, especially around the time of Mines of Moria expansion, this was easily the best MMO on the market. This was a fantastic game with great visuals, story, and the best community in any online game I've ever associated myself with, but it has been turned awry, presumably by the heads at Warner Bro's Interactive. The levelling experience from 1-75 should be as fun as ever, but thanks to horribly uneccesary class changes, among other things, the experience is desecrated. Thankfully, newcomers should still be able to get some enjoyment out of this marred product, though returning veterans will undoubtedly be dissapointed. (seriously the Helm's Deep battles are awful, and the mounted combat is even worse) "

												What can I say that hasn't already been said about Lord of the Rings Online. Released in 2007, this game has captured my attention since it was first launched with the title Shadows of Angmar. One of the last true RPGs found within the MMO genre, the game captivates with its art and design that still manages to impress nearly a decade later. Despite drawbacks in population, ownership change at Turbine (purchased by Warner Bros in 2010), and the launch of A Free-2-Play model shortly after, LOTRO still has a magical draw about it that compels players to take up arms against the Dark Lord and trek across Middle-Earth. The game is worth the subscription cost, especially if purchased for 3 or more months in advance. If unable to afford the fee, there is a Free option with limitations; just about all of which can be unlocked in-game through the use of Turbine Points gained from completing various Deeds, both kill, quest and reputation. In general, the community is helpful- much of the time willing to assist a newcomer with answers to their many questions. Give the game a try, it is perfect for the hardcore quester, casual gamer, role-player and explorer; something for just about everyone.			"

												I started playing LOTRO just a few weeks after it launched from Beta to full. I have to admit that I personally enjoyed the game a bit more before it switched over to Free to Play.  I didn't mind paying a subscription fee for all the hours I spent wandering through the lands I had read about for years before the game came out.  I read The Lord of the Rings many years before the movies came out and many times over at that.  I also grew up playing D&D with my friends. My friend Bill's mother was dating a guy named Dean who had played D&D since the late 70's and was an expert Dungeon Master. It was just so great to have an adult DM that put weeks and months into planning. When one of our characters died Dean actually collected the character sheet and refused to return it, their were real consequences to dying. The reason I mention all this is to point out that when I play LOTRO I'm commited to using my imagination and enjoying the game as if the books had come alive. I do not play LOTRO from the perspective of a gamer who is trying to succeed at winning a computer game. I play LOTRO as if my character is participating in Tolkiens world for real. For years I roamed around Middle Earth. I made it a habit of doing some of the things my character would do in the game. If I drank ale in the game I would drink one at home. If I grew and smoked pipeweed in the Shire I would pack a bowl and smoke weed at home. I spent years playing LOTRO extremely high. I've read that the pipeweed grown in the Shire is just tobacco, but the movie portrays it having a euphoric affect and that made more sense to me.LOTRO is really very good game. It's not perfect but it's very good.  There has been a good deal of care and detail put into this game. If you play it from a gaming perspective and just go for winning and leveling up this game's detail and Tolkien's signature depth are lost on you. When I play this game it's as if I can see where I am in my memory of Tolkiens work. People who will play this game primarily to level up and if they havent read the books or understand the locations.			"

												LOTRO is shaping up to be the best f2p MMO of 2017, with upcoming model/animation updates in the summer.The game is nearly 10 years old and far from dead, in fact it just found itself in the hands of a much better pubisher, Standing Stones. Community is slowly building and new content is still being released! The world is second to probably WoW in terms of exploration / lore, and gameplay is typical MMO/grindy. Think 2007. We all know the lore of Tolkien is amazing, and the game pays really good attention to the books, so I've heard.Basically, if you've tried more modern MMOs and they aren't your thing you might be looking for more immersion or depth, and LOTRO can give you that (for free)! You can purchase expansions for the game, which by the time you get to I'm assuming you'd be willing to pay for them. Get them on sale when you can.			"

												This is definitely my favourite MMO that I have played to date. I have played it before getting Steam, so I have way more game time than it actually shows.This game is basically WOW, except less limited in the free to play. You can unlock everything in the game just in F2P, and there is no difference, except for a few perks, between a player who is F2P or not. There is one location that requires you to be VIP : a location for Player vs Monster Player fighting, but there is another location for that.The graphics are not disappointing, considering this game was initially released in 2009, but could use an upgrade to bring them to modern level.Speaking of updates, these are happening constantly, with bug fixes, but also new areas and locations, quests, and other content. Now for the quests. Well, to be completely honest with you, while the main epic quest is loads of fun, and actually had me engrossed in the story for quite some time, (It's really good !), the intro quest for the Elf start is.... lacking. Sure the beginning of it is, kind of awesome, in the middle it is just pure boredom. I had to spend several different day doing it, simply because I was bored with the walking - talking - walking - fetch item - walking quests. That would literally be nearly half of the quests in the tutorial, which takes an HOUR to complete. That being said, the end of the Elf tutorial picks up the pace once again, but - not really that great.Combat is absolutely fine, no issues with the abilities of any kind, Hunters' focus system is to be enjoyed with the balance. Different combinations of the abilities can be used to fight different monsters and also people. There is a PvP system - you can spar outside of major cities.The map is just spectacular. You can explore the entirety of Middle-Earth, with different regions corresponding to different skill levels so you always have something to do in the game.Overall - 8/10, really fun game, but a few of the quests are boring and repetitive, with a few bugs.

												A long-enduring ever-expansive homage to the alternative history that is Middle-Earth, that will absolutely bury you in its many miniature gameplay mechanics steadily accumulated and tweaked over its now 8-year-long course.  And while it my look like an overwhelming ammount of content to go through to a new player, the fact that this game is most proud of is, be you a level 1, 30, 50 or 100, there always seems plenty to do to feel rewarding, and a time well spent. Mechanically, its a by-the-numbers MMORPG game, very much entrenched into evey known trope of an early 21st century online game. But its style and gameplay hasn't yet been hampered by it, rather built around it. There's the standard 50+ skillbar of each fairly ballanced class which compliment eachother in a D&D kind of way (the tanky one, the squishy dps one, the buffer, the healer, the run-around-do-whatever-you-like one), working together without ironic subtext, since Tolkien basically wrote the book on them  (ugh...) inadvertently defined the classical dungeon crawling class system anyway. You TAB around the monsters presented and diminish their red bars. Alternatively, you gather materials, craft, randomly explore, complete numerous deeds, roleplay (it is, obviously, an extremely RP frienldy game), buy junk, sell junk, play through story mode, pvmp, do instances (scalable) do quests, do quests, do quests........The strongest parts are indeed the stories of numerouns inhabitants of the world, gated behind and propelled by your typical fetch and kill x quests. You could do a lot worse then reading through abysmal ammount of text walls of these chatty NPC's, and, if you're a fan of the setting, it will be a treat throughout the game. It is skippable of course, but this is a text heavy game.The FTP model can safely get you through 1-50 without much hassle, and the remaining content is gated behind purchases, but, by then, you'll already decide if its worth your money and time.

												The best MORPG I have played, it is calm, beautifull and not grind focused. I understand people that love warcraft because of how chalanging, full of magic and effects the game have.  LOTRO is not for those people, it is a calm morpg where you can just stand in the shire listening to the hobbit music, going to taverns and leveling up while you get to know more about the amazing lore tolkien created			"

												This is definitely my favourite MMO that I have played to date. I have played it before getting Steam, so I have way more game time than it actually shows.This game is basically WOW, except less limited in the free to play. You can unlock everything in the game just in F2P, and there is no difference, except for a few perks, between a player who is F2P or not. There is one location that requires you to be VIP : a location for Player vs Monster Player fighting, but there is another location for that.The graphics are not disappointing, considering this game was initially released in 2009, but could use an upgrade to bring them to modern level.Speaking of updates, these are happening constantly, with bug fixes, but also new areas and locations, quests, and other content. Now for the quests. Well, to be completely honest with you, while the main epic quest is loads of fun, and actually had me engrossed in the story for quite some time, (It's really good !), the intro quest for the Elf start is.... lacking. Sure the beginning of it is, kind of awesome, in the middle it is just pure boredom. I had to spend several different day doing it, simply because I was bored with the walking - talking - walking - fetch item - walking quests. That would literally be nearly half of the quests in the tutorial, which takes an HOUR to complete. That being said, the end of the Elf tutorial picks up the pace once again, but - not really that great.Combat is absolutely fine, no issues with the abilities of any kind, Hunters' focus system is to be enjoyed with the balance. Different combinations of the abilities can be used to fight different monsters and also people. There is a PvP system - you can spar outside of major cities.The map is just spectacular. You can explore the entirety of Middle-Earth, with different regions corresponding to different skill levels so you always have something to do in the game.Overall - 8/10, really fun game, but a few of the quests are boring and repetitive, with a few bugs.

												A long-enduring ever-expansive homage to the alternative history that is Middle-Earth, that will absolutely bury you in its many miniature gameplay mechanics steadily accumulated and tweaked over its now 8-year-long course.  And while it my look like an overwhelming ammount of content to go through to a new player, the fact that this game is most proud of is, be you a level 1, 30, 50 or 100, there always seems plenty to do to feel rewarding, and a time well spent. Mechanically, its a by-the-numbers MMORPG game, very much entrenched into evey known trope of an early 21st century online game. But its style and gameplay hasn't yet been hampered by it, rather built around it. There's the standard 50+ skillbar of each fairly ballanced class which compliment eachother in a D&D kind of way (the tanky one, the squishy dps one, the buffer, the healer, the run-around-do-whatever-you-like one), working together without ironic subtext, since Tolkien basically wrote the book on them  (ugh...) inadvertently defined the classical dungeon crawling class system anyway. You TAB around the monsters presented and diminish their red bars. Alternatively, you gather materials, craft, randomly explore, complete numerous deeds, roleplay (it is, obviously, an extremely RP frienldy game), buy junk, sell junk, play through story mode, pvmp, do instances (scalable) do quests, do quests, do quests........The strongest parts are indeed the stories of numerouns inhabitants of the world, gated behind and propelled by your typical fetch and kill x quests. You could do a lot worse then reading through abysmal ammount of text walls of these chatty NPC's, and, if you're a fan of the setting, it will be a treat throughout the game. It is skippable of course, but this is a text heavy game.The FTP model can safely get you through 1-50 without much hassle, and the remaining content is gated behind purchases, but, by then, you'll already decide if its worth your money and time. As stated above, there's plenty to do in Eriador anyway, before venturing forth through Moria into Rhovanion, Rohan and Gondor.Tip: Get a mount as soon as you can, it's a massive game.

												I have good memories of this game, the environment is massive and detailed (although don't expect next gen graphics, it's a 8 year old game). The main questline is fun, and although the side quests can be a little grind-y, they are easily done without much effort as you complete the main storylines.But the main reason that I loved this game is just exploring the world of the Lord of the Rings. Whether you want to go to Hobbiton or Bree, or into Lothlorien, Moria, or now even Minas Tirith and Helm's Deep there's so much to see and do. You can join a kinship and make new friends there and just immerse yourself in the world.			"

												All the reviews below pretty much sum up how I feel about Lord of the Rings Online. I just felt the need to mention one feature that no one else mentioned, and that I feel makes LOTRO unique like no other MMO- the player music system. You can equip a musical instrument in game and, either by hitting keys or launching an ABC music file, play a song in game that people in the area can hear. Players have formed bands that give concerts, and on Landroval server there is even a yearly event called Weatherstock that attracts musicians from many servers for a day of music on Weathertop. Even if you don't roleplay, the abilty to perform and listen to player music in game adds so much to the experience.			"

												So, I've been playing this game off and on for the last four and a half years, so I would say I've seen enough of it to write an hoenst review. What I love most about the game are the story and the immersion you feel when you're playing. You really feel like you're a part of the Middle Earth World, which to me means a lot (I'm obssessed with Lord of the Rings). The regions are varied enough that you feel like every place is different. Also, each class has its own unique characteristics that set it apart from the other classes; most people have multiple characters on multiple servors because they want to capitalize on all the different class options and play styles.The main problems I have with LOTRO are that the combat is getting clunky, certain classes are way overpowered compared to others, and the questing in certain regions is getting a bit monotonous. The combat is generally the same the whole game, so it's important that you pick the class that goes with what you want in the game. It can just be very repetitive at times. Likewise, certain classes are way stronger than other classes. My hunter is so frail at level 89 compared to most other classes. So frail that it becomes difficult to get through basic solo quests. Finally, the quest are around the same thing over and over again. I know there can only be a finite number of quest ideas, but I would appreciate more diversity in questing. Overall, I find myself coming back to this game every couple of months, getting bored, and then coming back again in a cycle. I've done this for four years now, and I expect to d othe same for at least a couple more years. 8.5/10			"

												If you're looking for a world where the soul is in the heartfelt community rather than flash-in-the-pan, technological gimmicks, look no further than this version of Middle Earth. Come, explore, make some friends, relax, and be fulfilled by the best kind of 'leveling' & 'progress', the kind that involves no stats nor scores. The kind that involves spending the whole day fishing and talking with friends, perhaps serenading a random audience in the town square with a song that you literally wrote, or having a snowball fight in Winter, or even racing through a corn maze in Fall. Sure you could get to max level if you want, but this is a world where the person with the best attitude wins, not the one with the highest level, thanks to the best MMORPG community I've ever seen.

FTP with its ingame shop but points spent in the shop can be bought for cash or grinding ingame so cash will speed things up but is not the be all and end all PTW that some games are.

												If you're a RolePlayer this is almost a must-try MMORPG. LotRo has one of the best RP communities on it's Landroval server that you will find pretty much anywhere. Fairly standard combat for an MMO, but the Rohan expansion adds quite a bit of flare to that. You won't find better in terms of lore, immersion, and a die hard tolkein fan base.The game's one downfall in my opinion is the free-to-play model that is currently in place. You will be spending a lot of time re-rolling characters and running the same zones over and over to earn enough points to unlock the next quest packs, expansions, bag upgrades etc.. etc.. My recommendation is to subscribe and get everything for a monthly fee, minus the expansions that will have to be purchased of course. "

												I love this game, why? You can play on your own tempo and there is alot to do in the world, even in the Free edition.The expansions are realy great but I should start with the free edition to see if you like the gameplay, ofcource like any other MMO RPG the higher your level the more features.  If you do like it, and I know you will, the LOTR or Hobit or J.R. Tolkiën fans will for sure just for the story line alone, although if you do not know anything about the story, you will learn it gamewise!Like it? Wanna play more and want full features of the game? Then start with buying the ""Steely Dawm Starter Pack"".And then it is up to you but I would go first fo the ""Triple Pack"" and after for the ""Helm's Deep"" Base or Premium edition. Both are identical except that tyhe premium edition offers better gear and more in-game Turbine points.I used to play WoW for a real long time, up to Catacalism, then I stopped for almost a year or so untill the latest expansion came out and I got 30 days free play. I played up to lev 85, which is the max cap, but what I dont like is that everything in WoW, or you must Raid alot and do alot of epic dungeons, cost to much and that raids or goups are not like they used o be.If you wanna Raid or run some Heroics then you should at least know what your role is and I hate people that think they know all and start bullying others and leave middle game.Find a Guild in LOTR and if you have a few friends that play, the fellowship playing style is just awsome!

												Maybe im just getting too old and don't have the patience of old. Big fan of lotr, and mmos. Couldn't believe this game was free, i remember thinking ""wow how could i have missed this gem"" especially after reading the great reviews this game got. This game reminded me a bit of Warhammer Online which was an mmo i loved so much. The only reason this game has survived this long is because of lotr fans. There is a decent ""fanatic"" playerbase that won't let this game die and they need newbies to come along to feed and boost their ego. I dont mind that aspect, i was that player in Warhammer online. But what made me uninstall this game was the fact that you have to PAY to get ahead for everything... and i mean EVERYTHING. Every quest every notification you get is ""Go to the LOTRO store to unlock this"" or ""Go to the LOTRO store to make this faster"" its absurd how none of the reviews i read mentioned this. probably because i only focused on the good. I get how the devs need to make money but come on! at one point i thought ""well, im an adult with a job and its a free game... why not spend a little cash"" so i took a look at the lotro store and i was shocked! VIP for a year is like 200 dollars! if i want to buy a simple horse to get around 25 dollars! everything is so expensive and this game is sooooo old! i think the graphics on Zelda on the N64 looked 10x better! The quests consists of : talk to Sally Took, now talk to Barbara Took, now go back to Sally to tell her what Barbara said, now go back to Barbara to tell her of Sally's response.... And they're 10 minutes apart!!!  (without buying the 25 dollar horse) im sure this game will get better if i were to put more hours into it, but i can already tell i would have to spend a significant amount of money to compete, and to make it worthwhile. I like being rewarded for having no life and grind out levels/items... i don't like being rewarded for how much cash i have to spend.			"

												So, Lord of the Rings Online is fairly good MMORPG here with a couple of nuances:1. This is a game about the lore for the Tolkien's writing. Tolkiens fans can start with it all fine, all others would need some time to understand what is, actually, up in here. Let's say you didn't read the books, but you do want to start your sinking in it with a game? Then LotRO is definitely your bet.2. This isn't a game about PvP. While there are friendly duels and PMvP (Player-controlled Monsters versus Player) raids this isn't a focus for the project, neither it's really entertaining. Enjoyed being a ravaging orc for a change though.3. This game isn't about wiggling breasts, like, at all (notably other games on the market are, like TERA or Black Desert Online). Personally I like this aspect of the game second to lore, so if you're after storytelling and not the boobs you'll do fine.4. This game has a ton of cooperational group content to do from the very start of the game (lvls 20+), both very interesting and entertaining. Consider to make friends in kinship (local name for clans) or invite your own friends!5. This game requires some reading skills. I mean, quest texts are really good, and some of the side quest stories are awesome to the marvelous point.6. This game is great for exploring. The more areas you explore 'to the last tree out there', the more stories to hear/read you uncover, the more rewarding the deed system goes on you (deeds are in-game achievements you get tons of premium currency for). 7. Payment system isn't that unfriendly to free players if you ask me. Yes, grinding premium currency with deeds can be tiresome if you buy nothing, but hey!.. Get Steam packs available for the game and you'll do just fine. 15 USD (when on sale) and you won't need to buy anything else in months.These developers deserve support with our hard-earned cash.8. While some point out that the graphics of the game are outdated I can't call those 'ugly'. I'd say older locations look like the Gothic II ones (which isn't bad, you know) while new ones can be stunningly beatiful. Visit Evendim peaks and Forochel coasts to see what I mean.9. Music puts Peter Jackson to shame, really. Definitely a strong side for the game.10. And the last, but not the least thing about the game is the Community. People come and go, but old players always return to LotRO, so you can find all types of people in. Seasoned veterans, who played the game for 8 years, new lads and lasses, some experienced folk to group with... Roleplayers, that enjoy the very social aspects for the game. You'll certainly fit in our bunch :)Total score would be 9\10 points for the people that share the same things to love with me and 3/10 for the people that just want running around a half-naked curvy girl with a sword larger than the girl.

This has to be the most beautiful game of all time (I dont mean the graphics). The gameplay, the world and everthing else (except the graphics) is fantastic! If you are a big Tolkien-fan, like my-self. This is the game you have been looking for! PROS:+ Fantastic gameplay+ The best open world ever. You can explore almost all of middle-earth (if not all, I dont really know)!+ If you are a fan of the books or the movies, this is the game for you!+ Personally, I think this is the best recreation of Tolkiens fantastic world.+ You can meet the Dwarves from The Hobbit.+ Fantastic in everyway+ My new favourite-game+ The soundtrack is fantastic+ There is only two bad things about the game (that I have seen)+ You can play as a Hobbit, Dwarf, Man, Elf and Beorning.+ The story is great!CONS:- The graphics isnt the best.- You can only have two characters/server if you dont buy another characterslot.10/10 best game of all time!

												Ahhh,LOTRo where to begin.This game is honestly the best classic tab targeting MMO i have ever played.Before i tell why i think so i will first tell you the cons of this game as to get them out of the way.1.Its a bit old so the graphics are not as good as modern games,still pleasent graphics(its not virtua fighter)just not as nice as shiny new games2.Its new content is made under a differant company then old LOTRO so it feels a bit differant,not bad just differant.3.Long travel times between destinations.This is commonplace in MMOs but LOTRO is big and fast travel is limited so yeah,lots of running around.This is easily mitigated by LOTROs excellent vistas and the steam overview if you wanna browse the store or something while traveling,or just talk in chat.PROS!!!1.Firstly and most important is that LOTROs community is by far the best in any game.This fact is so true as to almost be undebatable.Every person i have ever met in this game was great.2.This is lord of the rings,so you instantly have the greatest fantasy world and lore ever created to explore and adventure in.3.Varied classes.You start with some good class staples like Guardian and Hunter,but some really special ones are included like warden(a combo based tank in a tab targeting game?Its crazy fun for more skill based play.Runekeeper(super adaptible healer/dps)and countless other cool stuff about the other classes.4.The world building is close to perfect for a classic (but fresh) take on the lord of the rings.In conclusion i love this this game and while you may not,you have to try it,at least two very differant classes to lvl 30,and make friends!these people are great they make f2ps and newbies right at home.GO PLAY IT!

												So, I've played through the intro of this game and done a bit of free roaming with my friend, so I thought I'd give some first impressions. (The Quest Log section may be updated, so you may want to check back at some point if you're interested, which I expect you aren't).PLOT:Judging by the intro and the dream sequence at level 5, your character (my first one being the Hobbit Burgular, Mimbulius) is the chosen one (or something like that) whose destiny is tied to the fate of Middle-Earth! The story is set out in quests that vary depending on which character you are (my friend was a dwarf and met Gandalf and Thorin and all the other dwarves from The Hobbit while I was just helping out around this little village that got attacked for five minutes).GAMEPLAY:Open World, quest-based gameplay. It is very much like World of Warcraft, but it's still a good MMO. QUEST LOG:Day 1: My friend and I set out from Erebor on the free horses they give you for 24 hours after completing the intro, and we decided that we were going to go from Erebor to Mordor, stopping at certain locations to look around. We rode to Hobbiton, where we found Bag End and looked around, then we headed off into the Bree-Lands to find The Inn of the Prancing Pony. My friend thought he could take on a bear, and it chased us all the way into Bree. At the Pony, I got my haircut and got drunk, while my friend sold all his junk items to Barliman Butterbur. We then set off for Weathertop, as my friend did not want to stay the night in Bree as to be safe. Weathertop is in the Lone Lands, what we now know to be as quite a dangerous place for two Level Sixes to be riding through at night. My friend was lucky and actually managed to make it onto the ruins, but I, however, was attacked by some freaking ravens! Meanwhile, my friend wasn't having the best time up on the hill, and he managed to use some magical item or something to teleport back to Erebor. It was just me now, so I rode on, past Weathertop, to try and go through the Trollshaws to Rivendell...I was killed two minutes later, and used my instant respawn, only to be killed again about twenty seconds after. I then respawned at a safe place (the entrance to the Lone Lands) as day began. My ride through the Lone Lands was fine, and nothing attacked me at all. If only my friend had actually listened when I suggested waiting in Bree until morning. I entered the Trollshaws, and the game warned me that this area was Level 30, but I was determined. I rode through the Trollshaws, with monsters chasing me. I reached the river that seperates the Trollshaws from Rivendell, and rode on. I could not see a path to Rivendell, so I rode up a hill to get a better view. At this point, I stopped, and, as I checked the map, the monsters caught up with me and attacked me. I moved away from the monsters, and they chased me. I moved back again, forgetting a crucial detail - I was on the edge of a hill. I fell 200ft, still riding my horse, and died as my body smashed into the same river I had believed to be the end of my worries. I had to use a 'Safe Respawn' that took me to the middle of a place called Archet, on the borders of Bree. I left to go and play Town of Salem instead.			"

												I've played this game for ages (since 2009). Thousands of hours more than Steam will show. It has been a long running favorite with huge amounts of space to explore and a skirmish system that other MMOs need to pay attention to.The downside is the game is starting to show its age a bit more than WoW does. The art in the game manages to land square in the uncanny valley and the player animation is sloppy. Anyone with a speed buff comically trots in place when starting or stopping. No ability to unsheath weapons, and everyone in your party will be synchronized when entering or exting combat. These things are minor, but jarring. Hunter's port system has become a chore, and travel from point to point to point is now confusing and tedious. Travel needs to be revamped to just a drop down of where you want to go at this point. Also, a lot of this game is simply NIH going extra lengths to not be WoW even when WoW-like was the right thing to do.The upside is the game continuously expands and improves. New gameplay mechanics, often new innovations, are introduced with each year. The lore is immersive (as it should be), and elaboration happens with consent and approval from the Tolkien estate. The cosmetic outfit system is an example of a place where WoW (and every other MMO) specifically needs to take notice. Content is often truely difficult rather than outright unfair, even when playing retro-content several levels under you.Warsteeds were a fizzle addition to the game, largely because they amplified the slop in the controls by an intentionally sloppy and unweidly system. PvMP (because WoW calls it PvP) is amazing, but often unbalanced as stats start in favor of monsters and end in favor of Hobbits by the end of an xpac cycle. Legendary weapons are not cosmetically customizable and obsoleted every xpac. This flys in the face of the intent of the original intent of the system, and is a very tedious grind. The legendary system is also confusing and dependant on huge amounts of randomness. Keep these as your forwarning as they will be the biggest sore points.Despite the complaints here, I still love this game. I still recommend this game. I hope that they will approach fixing the sloppy controls and simplify the legendary system as these are the only things causing me to drift towards other games.			"

												Overall I love this game and would recommend it to anyone. What I like about this game is that there are a lot of things to do from customizing your character, weapons, clothing, housing all of it. There are lots of quest too some some of which are repeatable. You even get to pick a trade like woodworking or being a scholar just to name a few. You can join a kinship or start one of your own and help eachother out. You also get to interact with the original characters from Middle Earth like Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Frodo, and so many others. The one thing I think is a drawback is that you have to spend money to unlock most reigons in order to be able to do quest in them and there are some other items such as mounts and clothing that you need to buy with money as well. And there is a gold cap so you have to pay to expand that as well. So unless you have a job, or some deep pockets you can dig into and if you're not a giant passionionate fan for Lord of the Rings then this game is mostlikey not for you. But if the above is not an issue for you then I would totally say this is a great game for you. :)			"

												Lord of the Rings Online or (LORTO) is several years old at this point (2007) but it's probably still the best theme based MMO in the genre. The character models are a bit date but the landscapes are gorgeous, the combat is at times slow and predictable, however, Turbine has made great strides in trying to improve the game ""play speed"". To really understand LOTRO you must understand the reason people play this MMO.1) The Story - Plain and simple people play this game for the lore surrounding it more than any other factor.2) The Community - The people who play this game are by far the most mature and helpful community of MMO players that I have ever seen. This has fallen away somewhat with the addition of a FTP model some years ago and the recent addition of a Global Chat Channel3) The casual nature and pacing of this game. Everything about LOTRO is tailored toward a more mature type of MMO gamer, So much so before the last major exspansion Turbine just flatly said that there will not be creating any more raid or large group content since no one does it anyway.A lot of people may or may not agree with this review but I really tried to distill why the people who play this game play it. If you find yourself drifting in the see of MMOs out there and just want to log in and deliver some pies in the Shire or See the Long Dark of Moria this just may be the game for you.			"

												To properly appreciate this game, you need to invest a fair amount of time into. I would say the game itself is a fairly standard RPG, perhaps above average for a free to play and it doesn't bog you down in restricted VIP only areas. However, a big selling point for me was the fact it was LOTR and I got to explore all the places I wanted to visit from the films. This was FRIGGIN AWESOME. I admit, I spent the majority of this game playing with friends, so I cannot vouch for the solo experience but questing together was the most fun I had on an MMORPG.Throughout the game, you may be able to save up enough currency to never need to invest actual money into it, however I bought the mithril starter pack which gave me enough points to progress as far as I wanted. The first purchase you need to save for is buying a horse to actually be able to get around. This is relatively painless and involves completing a fair few early tasks to get the points. Apart from that advice, take your sword, your bow and your axe and go out and explore the world of MiddleEarth!			"

												My gametime lies, I played this for over 2 years through HappyCloud before I started playing it through Steam instead ;)This game is highly underrated in my opinion, and although it's an older game it still has a lot going for it.  The pros:  - Tolkien lore, sooo much Tolkien lore.  - Ever wanted to get drunk in the Prancing Pony? Now you can.  - Great community for an MMO, trolls seem few, people are friendly, player-run events a-plenty.  - The in game music system.  You can use lore-friendly musical instruments in game to play ABC files of your favourite music, and even sync with other people in your party to form a band & play the same songs in time on different instruments.  - The free-to-play model allows for a pretty lengthy free trial period.  After that you'll want to become VIP (a subscriber) to enjoy the rest of the game, HOWEVER you only need to go VIP once to unlock everything, and it all stays unlocked if you cancel your subscription, so it's not necessary to keep paying.- Huge list of Instances, Skirmishes & Epic Battles to participate in.- Player owned houses, and Kinship (Guild) houses which are all customizeable.  - Wardrobe feature allows for lots of outfit customization.- Monster play feature allows for PvP battles while sticking to Tolkien lore.  - Extensive crafting system, & auctions of course.Cons: - Graphics are showing their age, certainly not an ugly game, but not the stunning graphics we're getting used to seeing either.- Standard MMORPG mechanics.  Nothing particularly new or exciting in terms of gameplay, basically just another WoW clone, but with Tolkien lore.- Free-to-play is limited, you will need to spend some money to enjoy the rest of the game.If you're a fan of Tolkien lore then definitely give it a try, if you're not, then there's propably much better MMO's out there for you to try instead.  This game does stock-standard MMORPG pretty well, but it's main draw point is definitely the setting & lore.			"

												This is the game that introduced me to the addicting world of MMORPGs.  The game has aged rather well when compared to its counterpart, Dungeons & Dragons Online.  If you want to do F2P go right ahead, the company who runs the game doesn't bog free players with pointless restrictions and mandatory purchases to move the game forward.  In my opinion, however, its worth becoming a VIP, as it only enhances your experience and you get your money's worth.  Anyone who has always wanted to try an MMORPG but is intimdated by bigger games like Guild Wars 2 or World of Warcraft should give this one a try!			"

												I recommend the game, but I would much rather prefer you to pay $30.00 for a two-month Battle.net account and pay another $30.00 for World of Warcraft online or at Walmart which is much better. I think this game is not near as inteesting and I don't think there are many fun quests. I still haven't figured out how to get trained in mining. I saw the trainer on my mini-map, but I never found him. It's like he just disappeared. I still think it's a nice game for someone who is new to MMORPG games, and when you're experienced, get World of Warcraft. I do like the combat system, though. I just wish that the creators would add hundreds of more enemies and enemy types. And also make it to where it doesn't take me half an hour to find a mining trainer. I still like it, though. Even if this review sounds like I completely hate it. It's a free MMORPG, and that's what made me want to get the game. Maybe it's because none of my characters are high leveled, and that's why I don't get many fighting quests. Good game, though. Thank you for whoever read this review. Have a good day!			"

												A lovely MMORPG set in Tolkien LORE, which only sweetens the package. Better than most MMORPG in the market, shame that they couldn't put the voices and music from the movies (which resulted in painfully simillar music which annoys me because they might as well have written a proper original score). Other than that it's great, there's a lot to do from the usual MMO grinding to playing a lute.Honestly, I've had more fun in it than in Wow, probably because it's free and doesn't require the stupid subscriptions that freeze your account. Ain't nobody got time for that.My recommendations for MMOs: LOTRO and DC Universe Online.			"

												This game is surprisingly good for a MMORPG, I was surprised. It is quite addicting and I can see why it did not become as big as WoW. At least new expansions are making this game better instead of worse.UPDATE: This game is one of the best F2P mmos of all time. It has stood the time and has been around as much as wow and still stand. Yes, it has a payshop which you need to go to get expansions and optional testing areas but it is definately worth it. Yes, there are paywalls. But it is sooo long and big of a game, its as big or not bigger than wow.Some might wonder why is it still going, well because the game hasnt been to Mordor yet, it is currently up to Gondor and the Halls of the Dead, you know... the trial of Aragon to get the undead on his side, yeah. That means the next xpac should be the Battle of Minas Tirth then maybe we could finally go to the gates of Mordor after and finally Mordor itself.It is amazing, i definately recommend it and I think you should play it.

												If you're a Tolkien fan, you should love this. It's a lot of fun seeing how much care and attention has gone into recreating the world of middle earth. As an MMO, it is one of the best ones out. It is certainly more geared to solo players, but does a good job of catering to everyone. The classes range from basic to some of the most advanced and interesting classes I've ever seen in an MMO. (Take Warden or LoreMaster for example)! The community is also one of the friendliest and the servers are still busy and alive to this day. It has stood the test of time and still looks astonishingly beautiful as ever. Add to all that it has fantastic mood setting music you've got a class A product. Many players simply can't stop at a single character and over the years I have kept on coming back to this game. Without a doubt my favourite MMO ever. It's also great to see the dedication of Standing Stone in keeping their work alive and keeping lotro safe for the future years with a decent, not overly greedy free to play system. Much of the content can be enjoyed for free and extras can be bought as required. The only time you may consider spending money is to open up quest packs in different regions and expansion packs. But considering the size and amount of time you could foreseeably spend in this masterpiece, it is well worth it!			"

It's one of the stupidest things I've seen also only on this game so far. The riding skill itself also requires you to ""pay"" or use the special points.

												This was one of my first MMOs and I am so happy it was. The combat and graphics may seem a little outdated but it is still fun beyond belief. It's not easy but it's not too challenging, it's super fun to play with your friends, the map is GIANT and there's so much to see and do. Within my first few days of playing I was invited to a guild by very nice players who taught me everything and showed me how to play, I progressed slowly until I was a total bad ♥♥♥, I spent hours looking for the correct ores to make the best weapons and armor possible. The gameplay is perfect. You start out by fighting wolves with a weak short sword and leather armor and a few days later you'll be taking on orcs and giants with your friends and dual wielding swords that took hours to make and heavy steel armor. THe progression is quite slow which personally I love. But that may bother some people. You can do epic boss fights and raids to earn special money that you can spend at camps to get weapons and armor that look like they were crafted by the gods. This game is also truly free to play. If you want to spend real money on special coins go ahead but it's definitely not forced upon you. You can do everything without spending a dime. I played this game all spring break with my friend. It doesn't matter if you have an old mac and a poor mouse. I spent the majority of this game on a mac and a poor mouse and it ran perfectly. This game may not look like it but if you put the time and effort into it, it will blow your mind. If you can get over mediocre graphics and sorta outdated combat then trust me you'll love this. Anyone who appreciates a good MMO will absolutely LOVE this game!			"

There's a vast world that you can explore that is similar to what is described in Tolkien's books and the skirmishes/raids are fun. It is like a more difficult WoW with better graphics and story.

There is tons of content to go through and no matter what playstyle you seek, there ought to be something for you to do.

												It has been a few years again since I started playing Lord of The Rings Online. In this period of time I encountered some ups and downs. Especially in the beginning of time, when the servers were extremely bad and most of the servers were dying out. After the recent developments considering servers, it came to my attention that this game is starting to rise again. I speak from the bottom of my heart when I say this game is perfect for the average Lord of the Rings nerd and especially the fact that it is free to play. However, it will not be easy to level up after you have reached level 40, because you reach the areas of Moria, Mirkwood, etc. This requires expensions. If I speek freely though, I would recommed buying the expansion pack, with the summer sale for example. Please note, since this is not a steam game, you have to fill in the codes on the turbine website. You can add me if you find yourself struggling, or if you just want to do some skirmish, if you play at the Evernight server ofcourse, my character's name is: Ashallil "

												I've played this game for ages (since 2009). Thousands of hours more than Steam will show. It has been a long running favorite with huge amounts of space to explore and a skirmish system that other MMOs need to pay attention to.The downside is the game is starting to show its age a bit more than WoW does. The art in the game manages to land square in the uncanny valley and the player animation is sloppy. Anyone with a speed buff comically trots in place when starting or stopping. No ability to unsheath weapons, and everyone in your party will be synchronized when entering or exting combat. These things are minor, but jarring. Hunter's port system has become a chore, and travel from point to point to point is now confusing and tedious. Travel needs to be revamped to just a drop down of where you want to go at this point. Also, a lot of this game is simply NIH going extra lengths to not be WoW even when WoW-like was the right thing to do.The upside is the game continuously expands and improves. New gameplay mechanics, often new innovations, are introduced with each year. The lore is immersive (as it should be), and elaboration happens with consent and approval from the Tolkien estate. The cosmetic outfit system is an example of a place where WoW (and every other MMO) specifically needs to take notice. Content is often truely difficult rather than outright unfair, even when playing retro-content several levels under you.Warsteeds were a fizzle addition to the game, largely because they amplified the slop in the controls by an intentionally sloppy and unweidly system. PvMP (because WoW calls it PvP) is amazing, but often unbalanced as stats start in favor of monsters and end in favor of Hobbits by the end of an xpac cycle. Legendary weapons are not cosmetically customizable and obsoleted every xpac. This flys in the face of the intent of the original intent of the system, and is a very tedious grind. The legendary system is also confusing and dependant on huge amounts of randomness. Keep these as your forwarning as they will be the biggest sore points.Despite the complaints here, I still love this game. I still recommend this game. I hope that they will approach fixing the sloppy controls and simplify the legendary system as these are the only things causing me to drift towards other games.			"

												As you can see i have alot of houres on record. This game is free to play and you can run around the entire world but to be able to do quests you will need to buy them. you buy them with turbine points. these points are also gained by completing deeds. So in fact if you want you could play this game completely for free but it just takes longer. I personaly realy like the game because of the realy big world and the manny possibilities you have withing the game.first off when starting you have 5 differend races to choose of and within those races manny differend classes (some don't work with some races). a few you have to buy with TP. there are 4 differend starting stories that help you to get to know the game. one of the big things on the side is crafting. you can make annything. in the differend areas are differend recourses.the grafics are not top notch but for such a huge game it is fantastic and if you have all the grafic setings maxed out you can find some realy nice vieuws. The social aspect of the game is realy important for manny quests are hard to impossible to complete on your own. thanks to the fellowships this can be done. And a mayor part of the time you will find yourself playing in a kinship. I met some amazing people from all over the world, some youngh some old (ranging 15-65) but all amazing in their own way.the game does allow in game voice chat but the quality isn't so superb.i personly love this game, the most time i ever put into one game. almost at 2000 houres.

												So, I've played through the intro of this game and done a bit of free roaming with my friend, so I thought I'd give some first impressions. (The Quest Log section may be updated, so you may want to check back at some point if you're interested, which I expect you aren't).PLOT:Judging by the intro and the dream sequence at level 5, your character (my first one being the Hobbit Burgular, Mimbulius) is the chosen one (or something like that) whose destiny is tied to the fate of Middle-Earth! The story is set out in quests that vary depending on which character you are (my friend was a dwarf and met Gandalf and Thorin and all the other dwarves from The Hobbit while I was just helping out around this little village that got attacked for five minutes).GAMEPLAY:Open World, quest-based gameplay. It is very much like World of Warcraft, but it's still a good MMO. QUEST LOG:Day 1: My friend and I set out from Erebor on the free horses they give you for 24 hours after completing the intro, and we decided that we were going to go from Erebor to Mordor, stopping at certain locations to look around. We rode to Hobbiton, where we found Bag End and looked around, then we headed off into the Bree-Lands to find The Inn of the Prancing Pony. My friend thought he could take on a bear, and it chased us all the way into Bree. At the Pony, I got my haircut and got drunk, while my friend sold all his junk items to Barliman Butterbur. We then set off for Weathertop, as my friend did not want to stay the night in Bree as to be safe. Weathertop is in the Lone Lands, what we now know to be as quite a dangerous place for two Level Sixes to be riding through at night. My friend was lucky and actually managed to make it onto the ruins, but I, however, was attacked by some freaking ravens! Meanwhile, my friend wasn't having the best time up on the hill, and he managed to use some magical item or something to teleport back to Erebor. It was just me now, so I rode on, past Weathertop, to try and go through the Trollshaws to Rivendell...I was killed two minutes later, and used my instant respawn, only to be killed again about twenty seconds after. I then respawned at a safe place (the entrance to the Lone Lands) as day began. My ride through the Lone Lands was fine, and nothing attacked me at all. If only my friend had actually listened when I suggested waiting in Bree until morning. I entered the Trollshaws, and the game warned me that this area was Level 30, but I was determined. I rode through the Trollshaws, with monsters chasing me. I reached the river that seperates the Trollshaws from Rivendell, and rode on. I could not see a path to Rivendell, so I rode up a hill to get a better view. At this point, I stopped, and, as I checked the map, the monsters caught up with me and attacked me. I moved away from the monsters, and they chased me. I moved back again, forgetting a crucial detail - I was on the edge of a hill. I fell 200ft, still riding my horse, and died as my body smashed into the same river I had believed to be the end of my worries. I had to use a 'Safe Respawn' that took me to the middle of a place called Archet, on the borders of Bree. I left to go and play Town of Salem instead.			"

												Overall I love this game and would recommend it to anyone. What I like about this game is that there are a lot of things to do from customizing your character, weapons, clothing, housing all of it. There are lots of quest too some some of which are repeatable. You even get to pick a trade like woodworking or being a scholar just to name a few. You can join a kinship or start one of your own and help eachother out. You also get to interact with the original characters from Middle Earth like Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Frodo, and so many others. The one thing I think is a drawback is that you have to spend money to unlock most reigons in order to be able to do quest in them and there are some other items such as mounts and clothing that you need to buy with money as well. And there is a gold cap so you have to pay to expand that as well. So unless you have a job, or some deep pockets you can dig into and if you're not a giant passionionate fan for Lord of the Rings then this game is mostlikey not for you. But if the above is not an issue for you then I would totally say this is a great game for you. :)			"

												This game is great, the quests keep you playing and all the people online are a blast to play with. I do have a major issue with the game as it is tries to make money everywhere, even in the most simplest of things. This pisses me off. A currency cap... It's one of the stupidest things I've seen also only on this game so far. The riding skill itself also requires you to ""pay"" or use the special points.

I really liked that the first missions of Mens and Hobbits started in Archet which is a big + for me as fan of LOTR.

												I've been playing this game since the summer of 2012 (though only just recently through Steam), and it is easily one of the best games I've ever played, and most certainly one of my favorites. The world is so massive and fun to explore, all the quests are enjoyable and I actually want to do all the side quests, and the story quests are really engaging. At many points I find myself wanting to know what happens next. The lore of Middle-earth is very well represented, and the game feels very true to the source material, even though it does take liberties, as one would expect. The community is a good one, and you can almost always find somebody in-game to help you out. Even when you can't, for the fellowship quests you just have to gain a few more levels and it's definitely within reach. Of the nine classes I've played (all but the Lore-master) they're all unique and fun to play. The Hunter in particular is a good beginning class, since it has a wide range of ranged and melee skills, and the quick travel skills are lifesavers. I'm only at level 70 on my main character, and that's exactly the sort of pace this game requires: nice and easy. It's a game that really draws you in, and even when I'm not actually doing a quest or deed or other objective, I still love just going around and exploring the Middle-earth Turbine has created for their game. I cannot stress the beauty of the game enough. Each and every area is unique and beautiful. From the rural hills of The Shire, to the torch lit caverns of Moria, each new vista amazes. I can't wait to see where my adventures will take me next!Overall, not only is this a great MMO, it's just a great all-around game, and I would highly recommend it to anybody interested in the world of Middle-earth.

												As a returning character to LOTRO i have alot of things to say. Firstly i have much XP on this topic im am a lvl 75 Captain named Adantheir on the Gladden Server and i have played this game for 3 years stopped and re downloaded it to see how the new FTP model effects the game. I would recommend this game to new players/friends who love the franchise and lore. Your gonna have to spend money to unlock ""Quest Packs"" which allow you to do quests in a certain area. It can sap the fun right out of lvling a character but thats the price of FTP. Understandable this could turn off a few new comers but have no fear because imo it was worth every penny and i am glad i spent money on this game and i will surely be buying the Helms Deep expansion to continue my story :D			"

												If you're a Tolkien fan, you should love this. It's a lot of fun seeing how much care and attention has gone into recreating the world of middle earth. As an MMO, it is one of the best ones out. It is certainly more geared to solo players, but does a good job of catering to everyone. The classes range from basic to some of the most advanced and interesting classes I've ever seen in an MMO. (Take Warden or LoreMaster for example)! The community is also one of the friendliest and the servers are still busy and alive to this day. It has stood the test of time and still looks astonishingly beautiful as ever. Add to all that it has fantastic mood setting music you've got a class A product. Many players simply can't stop at a single character and over the years I have kept on coming back to this game. Without a doubt my favourite MMO ever. It's also great to see the dedication of Standing Stone in keeping their work alive and keeping lotro safe for the future years with a decent, not overly greedy free to play system. Much of the content can be enjoyed for free and extras can be bought as required. The only time you may consider spending money is to open up quest packs in different regions and expansion packs. But considering the size and amount of time you could foreseeably spend in this masterpiece, it is well worth it!			"

												I love this game, if it was not for this game, I would have never have been introduce to the world of MMORPG's. I guess it was also a bonus I was already a Lord of the Rings fan, and that added another platform to be able to enjoy the story even more. And hands up to Turbine they have done the story justice and that made me fall in love with it even more. If you are not sure you have the time or money for LOTRO, Free to play is amazing and their is plenty to do and keep you busy for many hours. One of the best free to plays out there right now I believe. I honestly believe you can not go wrong with this game, great community atmosphere, amazing story, lots of content and so much to do that you can lose your self whilst playing. Well hopefully see you in game, and happy hunting.			"

												This game is surprisingly good for a MMORPG, I was surprised. It is quite addicting and I can see why it did not become as big as WoW. At least new expansions are making this game better instead of worse.UPDATE: This game is one of the best F2P mmos of all time. It has stood the time and has been around as much as wow and still stand. Yes, it has a payshop which you need to go to get expansions and optional testing areas but it is definately worth it. Yes, there are paywalls. But it is sooo long and big of a game, its as big or not bigger than wow.Some might wonder why is it still going, well because the game hasnt been to Mordor yet, it is currently up to Gondor and the Halls of the Dead, you know... the trial of Aragon to get the undead on his side, yeah. That means the next xpac should be the Battle of Minas Tirth then maybe we could finally go to the gates of Mordor after and finally Mordor itself.It is amazing, i definately recommend it and I think you should play it. Been out longer and still way better than most F2P mmorpgs.			"

												Lord of the Rings Online or (LORTO) is several years old at this point (2007) but it's probably still the best theme based MMO in the genre. The character models are a bit date but the landscapes are gorgeous, the combat is at times slow and predictable, however, Turbine has made great strides in trying to improve the game ""play speed"". To really understand LOTRO you must understand the reason people play this MMO.1) The Story - Plain and simple people play this game for the lore surrounding it more than any other factor.2) The Community - The people who play this game are by far the most mature and helpful community of MMO players that I have ever seen. This has fallen away somewhat with the addition of a FTP model some years ago and the recent addition of a Global Chat Channel3) The casual nature and pacing of this game. Everything about LOTRO is tailored toward a more mature type of MMO gamer, So much so before the last major exspansion Turbine just flatly said that there will not be creating any more raid or large group content since no one does it anyway.A lot of people may or may not agree with this review but I really tried to distill why the people who play this game play it. If you find yourself drifting in the see of MMOs out there and just want to log in and deliver some pies in the Shire or See the Long Dark of Moria this just may be the game for you.			"

												A lovely MMORPG set in Tolkien LORE, which only sweetens the package. Better than most MMORPG in the market, shame that they couldn't put the voices and music from the movies (which resulted in painfully simillar music which annoys me because they might as well have written a proper original score). Other than that it's great, there's a lot to do from the usual MMO grinding to playing a lute.Honestly, I've had more fun in it than in Wow, probably because it's free and doesn't require the stupid subscriptions that freeze your account. Ain't nobody got time for that.My recommendations for MMOs: LOTRO and DC Universe Online.			"

When i first saw this game i got excited beyond belief, in this game you can go to all these locations, just from looking at the map i got excited, but what drove me away recently was the HUD, it's a bit messy, and the map with quest markes also is quite messy, in my opinion the HUD and quest markers need a redo, and some slightly better graphics wouldnt hurt.

												My gametime lies, I played this for over 2 years through HappyCloud before I started playing it through Steam instead ;)This game is highly underrated in my opinion, and although it's an older game it still has a lot going for it.  The pros:  - Tolkien lore, sooo much Tolkien lore.  - Ever wanted to get drunk in the Prancing Pony? Now you can.  - Great community for an MMO, trolls seem few, people are friendly, player-run events a-plenty.  - The in game music system.  You can use lore-friendly musical instruments in game to play ABC files of your favourite music, and even sync with other people in your party to form a band & play the same songs in time on different instruments.  - The free-to-play model allows for a pretty lengthy free trial period.  After that you'll want to become VIP (a subscriber) to enjoy the rest of the game, HOWEVER you only need to go VIP once to unlock everything, and it all stays unlocked if you cancel your subscription, so it's not necessary to keep paying.- Huge list of Instances, Skirmishes & Epic Battles to participate in.- Player owned houses, and Kinship (Guild) houses which are all customizeable.  - Wardrobe feature allows for lots of outfit customization.- Monster play feature allows for PvP battles while sticking to Tolkien lore.  - Extensive crafting system, & auctions of course.Cons: - Graphics are showing their age, certainly not an ugly game, but not the stunning graphics we're getting used to seeing either.- Standard MMORPG mechanics.  Nothing particularly new or exciting in terms of gameplay, basically just another WoW clone, but with Tolkien lore.- Free-to-play is limited, you will need to spend some money to enjoy the rest of the game.If you're a fan of Tolkien lore then definitely give it a try, if you're not, then there's propably much better MMO's out there for you to try instead.  This game does stock-standard MMORPG pretty well, but it's main draw point is definitely the setting & lore.			"

												""...and one ring to you, free of charge"". Lord of the Rings online is the best Lord of the Rings game out there, trailing ahead of The Third Age, and Battle for Middle-Earth. This is because it encompasses the largest interactive chunk of Middle-Earth out of any of them. You may begin your journey in the humble Shire, where you will experience the joyfulness and naivety of the hobbits. From there, or any of the other fine starting locations, such as Bree, you will slowly make your way through some of the most well-known and previously unknown locations of the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's famous fantasy land. Take a stroll through the Old Forest and have a chat with cheery ol' Tom or take a seat and drift off to dream land in the dreary atmosphere surrounding Old Man Willow. Too mainstream? Get more underground and plunge into the depths of the Mines of Moria! If roleplaying is your thing, the Landroval server is host to one of the best communities in any MMO around. Join the fight today!			"

You even get to assist the Fellowship at times.-As of this year, we'll be able to SIMPLY WALK INTO MORDOR.-If you love Tolkien's world of Middle Earth, then you'll never want to leave.Cons:-Optimization issues. Lag can be your biggest enemy in this game. Certain over-populated zones are sometimes horrible for certain players.Still a very good game, despite its age. Hop in, talk to some people, join a kin.

												I've been playing this game for quite a while, Shadows of Angmar days in 2008.I have stopped with this game quite a few times. Yet I still comeback and play it.It's like the classic MMO but with the LOTR lore, sounds awesome.The game plays great, even though they use target-tabbin, I have yet to see such fluid combat in other MMO.It feels great. You really feel like you're hitting or being hit. This is one of the reasons I keep coming back.The PVP can be freaking awesome and incredibly tedious. Questing can actually be fun, but to get from 1 to 100 should take so long that I'd doubt it feels fun after a while.PVE used to be really great, but the old content is abandoned and they haven't released a new raid in a while now.The community is one of the best assets of the game, I have made quite a few friends for life over here.Finally, with all the great things I had to say, and that keep me coming back, I must say:This is Free-To-Play until some point. You can always play it, but you'll eventually need to take some money off your pocket to unlock later content. The currency you buy, Turbine Points, can be gathered through gameplay, but to get enough would take over a thousand hours.P.S.: This isn't a P2W game. They surely sell a lot of convenience, and people who pay can really get to that point with less effort, but they don't really sell advantage (anymore).			"

												Lord of the Rings Online.. Is it good or bad? I would have to say this is a generally good game. This game is very much your typical mmorpg game. The controls are very simple and easily understood. You spend most of your time in third person observing your character, combat involves locking onto a target, then clicking (or using a hotkey) to trigger the different attacks that are displayed on your action bar. Area attacks do exist, and generally the physics play out reasonably well. The World: The world is big. There is plenty of places to explore, and the graphical level is pleasing to look at. While it will not match up in freedom of movement, or detail to Skyrim, it is definitely a fun place to view and explore. At first the world will seem pretty small, it is only as you go along that the distances between locations grow to the point where it is unpleasant to travel there by foot. They did, however, do a good job of matching up when distances get long, with when you your character can get a horse. In summary: medium-big world that is aesthetically very pleasing to look at. Questing: The questing system is very closed. You progress through them, some of them are voiced, most only have one or two lines of voiced dialogue the rest you have to read on your own, you rarely have any options. They do not support the player choosing to be evil or good, or making choices that will have impacts upon how the quest will progress. Despite the limited nature of it, they did a fairly good job of making stories that are interesting, and that fit with the lore of Middle Earth. Summary: lack of player options, but decently entertaining anyhow.Characters: Character setup is highly limited. You can choose from four races (Dwarf, Elf, Hobbit Man). Then you have a group of Classes;[some titles may be wrong] Guardian, Champion, Burglar, Warden, Rune-Keeper, Hunter, Captain and Lore Master. The races share the classes, with a few classes being disabled for each race (for example no Dwarf Burglars, or Human Rune Keepers. Each class also has three 'paths' that they can follow, those will effect what kinds of weapons they will be good at, and how well your character is at solo play. In general, there is almost no cross-over between classes, and no way to change once you make your character, so research well before you make a choice. Crafting: There is almost nothing to talk about here. You choose a craft that contains three skills. Some skills let you gather, others let you craft. No single craft you can choose is completely self-reliant, so you will need the help of friends or the general world market to level up all of your skills. Crafted weapons are, however, well worth the effort of getting. They are on average far better than what you can find through loot for your level. General play: While this game is termed a ""role-playing game"", there is very little actual role-playing to be found on it. The role-playing servers rarely have players who actually actively try to take on their character's roles. There are some good communities that you can join in with, but if you are on your own do not expect players to be particularly sociable or in character. Outside of role-playing the community is very open and helpful. Questions are typically answered quickly and nicely, and there are almost always players around who are willing to help you out. There are also plenty of player friendly guilds/factions out there to join if you enjoy that kind of play. tl;dr, generic mmorpg, with its biggest highlight being that it is based in Middle Earth.

												Note:I have played this game extensively on other clients, so I have a pretty good grasp of the game. LotRO is a fantastic game, but not always the best MMO. The game, while multiplayer and hosts a variety of features for guilds and group quests, is designed just as much for singleplayer. Many times it feels like you're all alone in this vast world. hunting monsters and finding resources. It's a fantastic game set in Middle Earth where you can enjoy yourself alone or with friends. I have many fond memories of fishing, questing, and exploring. The game is FTP, well, as much as any successful MMO can be. You can grind to get the in game currency you need to aquire DLC (all but the most expansive ones) and odds are you will be a bit willing to buy something if you enjoy it enough. You can even travel to many of these expansion areas just to see how they are, you just won't have access to the quests. I played for hundreds of hours without so much as spending a dime, it's fantastic. I reccomend this game to anyone who wants to live in Tolkien's epic fantasy, it doesn't get much better than this!

												I play LOTRO since about four years ago, so I kind of grew attached to it. I know the map and the controls really well and certain places even bring back memories. I guess that's why I really love this game, so I don't have a good opinion about it. I can tell you though that it's fun to recognize places and characters from the movie, but it's a shame you can't swim underwater. The artwork might not be great compared to others (it can be beautiful, but WOW is for example more magical), and quests can be annoying, but hey, every MMORPG has annoying quests right? You can't like everything in a game. So if you don't compare games too much, and you just want to try an MMORPG, I recommend this one.			"

												This is my favourite MMO of all time. It follows the story of Tolkien's books from the Lord of the Rings. You can explore Middle Earth by your own, or you can follow the epic story line, which brings you to all the regions. The quests are good, there are a lot of different quest types, and when you're lucky, you can join a festival as well. The things I like about the game is the beautiful scenery, the storyline, cosmetics(!), and the player community is one of the best I know. There are 4 player races, all with their own backgroundstory. The classes are also fun to play (I tried them all). Another good thing is that it is normally F2P, so you can try it out as long as you like. You don't have to pay a monthly fee, unless you want some extras. The only downside is, that the expansions and the extras can be expensive. But when you play is often, it is totally worth the money.My rating for the game: 7,5/10			"

												Been playing this since launch. Glad to see it on steam! The F2P model is not the best, with a very pay as you go mindset, making you purchase quest packs as you level. This can be avoided by paying subscription.The MMO aspect is also a bit dated, but this means there are mountains of content to enjoy.This gets consistently updated with new, and free content, as well as expansions on a yearly basis. The story is well into Return of the King by now.If you are in any way a fan of Middle Earth, I recommend trying this one out purely to explore this interpretation of Middle Earth, as it is the most fully realised one to date.You can walk from the old fortress of Carn Dum in Angmar, all the way to Dol Amroth in Gondor.You could follow the path the fellowship took, or even that of Bilbo to some extent.This is a fantastic game for the role players and explorers among us.

												I've been playing this game for 2 years or more and though I do not consider myself a connoisseur of Tolkien's writtings, I know enough of the lore to interpret whatever artistic agenda the developers included in the game.    Many of you might ask,""Is the world size on scale with the books ?""Answer is yes and no, if any of you know the technicalities of a (MMORPG) PC game, then you'd prolly understand what it means to host a game world(with decent graphical features)  that has hundreads of kilometers in all directions. The game has a classical MMORPG outlook of Middle-earth but the walks between Bree, Shire and Blue Mountains aren't as tiring and long as it would be if the game was 100% canon.Mind you, there's a very complex process in recreating scenarios and plots when you try to make a game or a movie from events of a book. Likewise, to make a movie after a very complex game. While not impossible, the quality won't be the same, and from a fan's point of view, might as well burn the whole thing... No no, I'm not going to start a discussion about what the Tolkien society thinks of Peter Jackson's works or any of the other bs. My point is that you will encounter some artistical improvisation in the game that might confuse most of you Middle-earth fanatics. Bear in mind that making a balanced game world, even with Tolkien's ideas, requires some improvisation here and there. As such, you will encounter areas, monsters, bits of unknown lore, either made from scratch or continued from the bowels of all speculations. ""Does that diminish my gaming experience as a die hard Middle-earth junkie?"" That depends on you  really, while the atmosphere is very canon, you have to delve into the game to feel whatever charm it has. Try the music system of the instruments you can find and learn, go fishing, explore areas that aren't too dangerous. Do you feel dwarf-ish today? Go mine ore to make armour, shields, swords and axes for your kinsmen. Feeling like a greedy dwarf today? Go mine jewels and make amulets for your...self. The game is F2P mind you, though you will need to pay a monthly fee to have acces to advanced areas to quest around, though you can make micro-transactions in the store and just buy the quest packs you desire. Want Angmar, Evendim, Forochel and Moria quest pack? Sure, knock yourself out. Also, bear in mind that the main Epic quest is free to all players.Too frugal? Just do slayer and exploration deeds where you receive Turbine Points which you can use in the store to buy game content you desire, traits, unlockable craft guild traits and so on. There'll be a bit of work to be done through that method but there's no hurry either way, especially when dem discounts are lurking on the horizon ;)Am I talking too much? No, YOU'RE dilly dalllying too much, you filthy Tark.			"

												One of the few MMO titles I've played for more than six months. If you are a fan of Tolkien's universe, LotRO is a wonderful adaption of it. Rather than having you be a part of the fellowship, or actively assisting the ringbearer at all times, Turbine has devised a story that follows the events of the book by foiling the plans of Sauron, Sarumon and others who do not have the interest of the free peoples of Middle-earth in mind.Start in Ered Luin (home of the Elves and Dwarves), The Bree-lands (home of the race of Man) or The Shire (home of the Hobbits), and make your way through one of the largest game worlds created. Travel through Evendim (it's landmark being Annuminas and Lake Evendim itself), Forochel (home of the Lossoth, a tribe living on the frigid tundra), The North Downs (where the Rangers have made base to keep guard over The Shire), The Lone Lands (it's landmark being Weathertop), The Trollshaws (it's landmark being Imladris, the city of Elves), The Misty Mountains (it's landmark being Goblin-town), Eregion (which leads you to the black pool and gates of Moria), down into the Enedwaith and on into Dunland (it's landmark being the Tower of Orthanc).Should you journey east from Eregion, you then enter the vastness of Moria on into Lothlorien, where you can journey further east into Mirkwood or south down the Great River to the Wildermores and Eastern Rohan, a massive region comprised of four areas; The Wold, The Entwash Vale, The Norcrofts and The Sutcrofts. From there, you will travel into Western Rohan, on to Edoras and on to Helm's Deep.LotRO is also the epitome of Free To Play. While a player does not have immediate access to everything the game has to offer, one can purchase nearly everything with Turbine Points, a currency you can purchase with  real cash or earn by playing the game and completing deeds. If you're not willing to spend money, you can spend time to get the newest stuff, from cosmetics to mounts to expansion packs.Storywise, as of this writing, LotRO has just reached The Battle of Helm's Deep with it's new expansion (released Nov. 20, 2013), aptly titled ""Helm's Deep"".

												I've  been a fan of Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit since I read the books way back when. The movies where amazing. So when my brother introduced me and got me into the game ( A change of pace from my usual Chaos Space Marines)  but the opportunity to play a fantasy realm in witch we both were avid fans about, I took the chance.  Both of us being our favorite hero as Gimli, son of Gloin, we took to the character creation with an idea of mind. ( I'm also a dwarf slayer fan from the Gotrek and Felix novels.) To be long bearded, axe toting dwarves. And as it was , we could! Other than dwarves you can play as other races of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth...men, hobbits and elfs. Also like other rpg's you can choose from various classes. Champion, Guardian, Hunter, Burgler and Loremaster. Each class and race brings to the game a specific play style along with culture and language and skills and story line. Dwarves for example, get and axe damage bonus and a stamina regenerative bonus for being a harty people.  So choosing and making you're character does change you're online game experience.The game itself is so fully in depth and full of fantasy lore that its hard not to be overwhelmed and lost in it. Even if your just a fan of the books, or just the movies or just like rpg's. You'll find yourself reading the quests and missions, enjoying the simple basic rpg mechanics( Legendary weapons is A LOT of fun) and instances its hard not to be captured by Tolkiens world. Its all there, down to the movies soundtrack to add to you actually want the music up and loud when you’re slaying goblins in the Misty Mountains. In game you play as a hero of the Free Peoples defeating every orc and goblins in league with evil, from Erin Luin to Moria (my favorite) to Gondor. Community wise it has to be the most friendly based I have ever played with. There is always a fellowship, kinship out there to help with a quest or instance or get items or even craft them for you free of charge. Honestly it has a great atmosphere with a '' Were in this together'' and ''All for one and one for all '' attitude. A great game if you like joining with others and having fun rpg dungeon crawl wise. As a free to play game technically, there is a pay to play feature. With real money you can buy traits, skills, steeds, quests and maps that can easily create a large hole in your pocket. But if you choose to pay you definitely wont be found wanting. Even as a free to play game there is plenty of content and game play that you won’t be crying exactly that you didn't get the full experience. but there is so much more, if  you are willing to pay for it. It doesn’t make your character so much better than others or game changing where you become a God amongst men, but it definitely can change your experience. To make your steed go 250% faster or to play that one instance where you defeat the orc armies of the Iron crown. It’s up to you. As a free to play player myself sometimes you do wish you could do a certain quest or skirmish and there is a way. In game, for completing quests and deeds you can earn Turbine points which can pay for real money perks! It's a nice way to get some of those pay to play perks for us that have empty wallets.			"

I played this game for well over 200 hours prior to it's STEAM release and have 2 max level characters, and all of the optional classes***I'll keep this short and sweet...this game is absolutely wonderful! One of the best MMO's that I've ever played. Also, the roleplaying servers are very active, and this game offers the best roleplaying that I've ever experienced in any MMO, hands down.The only drawback is this games age, because of the age of this game, the community feels like it is slowly dissapating. While still a very friendly and helpful community, and honestly one of the most mature communitied I've ever seen in an MMO, the player base seems to be dwindling so much, that it may, at times, leave you feeling alone.If you haven't played this game, and are ok playing alone, give it a shot. If you have a group of friends to play with, give it a shot. If you're patient enough to have periods where it seems like no one is online, give it a shot. This game is great!			"

												Though it's old this is a very beautiful game. And it is very true to Tolkien's world of middle earth. So as a Tolkien fan I would recommend this game just for the world alone. I will never forget the first time I saw Weathertop or entered the mines of Moria.The quests have a feel of old MMOs. They can be rather grindy at times. But the main (epic) quest line is very well written and pulls you into the game. Makes the lesser and more grindy quests bearable. I would highly recommend reading the quest text of the main quest line as it really makes the game so much better and creates a lot of immersion. The community in the game is very nice and helpful. I don't know if it's because I play on a RP server, but I have never been trolled or anything for asking a question on world chat. People just seem very friendly and helpful. The auction house is pretty empty and often also overpriced. But asking in chat you never have to wait long to find someone willing to sell what you're looking for. "

												What most people on the negative reviews forget is that this game was officially released on 24 April 2007 and then it was added on steam on 6 June 2012.This is a great MMORPG and it was one of the best at the time, right now it's still a great game. Most people think they will be playing the same story as the one that goes on the movies but that's completly incorrect and if you are thinking of playing this game with that mindset please look for another game.You get to explore Middle Earth with your own Character, class and Race. Yes, you do have to walk alot but that's the same in 99% MMORPG's', you have a Sh*t Load of quests, easy crafting method, season events all year long (Summer and Christmas Festivals are a few examples), alot of raids/instances to go through with your friends and/or party. A good Kinship(Guild) system that makes sure there are no empty guilds taking up names, simply said you need a total of 8 players if you want your kinship to stay ""alive"".In terms of gameplay it's very similar to World of Warcraft (remember SIMILAR NOT EQUAL), pvp included and focused on certain locations.This game used to be pay to play, now it's free to play but fortunatly not pay 2 win, the shop only gets you items that you can use while lvling(not the most powerfull just average), cosmetics but you can get your own while you play the game and participate in festivals. You need to buy the riding token from the shop but that's nothing to worry about because some of the quests you will be doing will give you premium money allowing you to not only get the Riding skill but also purchase every other item AND Expantion through the online LOTRO shop.Overall this is still a great game, just depends on how you look at it, so don't go comparing it with the story of the movies......

												Played this game for way too long and way too many hours.Great game, fab community, superb wiki resources and game mods. The game is largely free from bots, cheats, exploits and if a spammer rears its ugly head once a year (if even that...last I saw one was 2012), it's laughed out the door.It's the theme park of theme parks, Lord of the Rings. Up to a couple of years ago, very down-to-earth and toned down graphics. Then WB games went medieval on the rear end of the game. In particular the store end of the game. Now you get deco pets (how about a rat the size of a horse or a shining spectral bear with a little snowstorm above it), silly character costumes and store enchants to rival many Asian micropayment grinders. Happily you can opt out of seeing any deco pets and if you see a bare-chested dwarf in purple tights running around town with a chicken nest on his head...so be it.On the plus side, there is zero focus on lingerie. The female character game models are as sexless as plywood and the males look either goofy, mildly gay or just a little burly. It's toned down but rather outdated and promises of updates to the character game models have been made.Typically, a micropayment game is aimed at making you pay and keep paying.LOTRO is different. If you sub for just one month (that is USD 15), you gain permanent perks and upgrades to your account and your characters that will remain forever. This means that the paywall is nearly non-existant.Technically you can grind and grind and utilize 99.99% of the features in the game and never whip out your wallet or add your credit card to the store. You can grind out in-game cash and you can grind out store points (example: quest area covering a certain amount of levels would cost 500 store points and you would have to spend 1-2 days dsolely grinding out store points to attain that amount).Game cash can be used to buy certain store products from other gamers. This is the one recently added pay-to-win game store bias that rubs me the wrong way. The few and far-between botters could use botted game gold to shop regular lootable items before but the choice was limited. Now they can buy most of the useful store items.Beef:store stuff vs game gold as long as a gamer is willing to spendsomewhat dated character game models inside a rather lovely gameno apparent effort is made to delete botters or exploiters even if these are very fewnot a game in maintenance mode but manned by a dwindling number of staffyearly novelty features quickly abandonedbad fishing (hey, I like good fishing in a game!)rather boring pvpSuperb:no gold sellersno focus on lingerie or sexualized childrenthe lore is deep and to a large extent exactgreat atmosphere and in-game muzakmostly great communitysuperb external wiki resources for any little feature or thing in the gamegreat options and conveniences for everything...freely adjust game window, turn weapon glow on and off, show or hide pets, chat filter if wanted, creatable user defined chat channels and tabs, save UI settings for alts but can use entirely different ones, any keyboard command adjustable and little extras like searchable NPC stores, searchable options and so on...really well done90% well-defined character classes not overlapping too much but not strictly trinity heal-tank-dps			"

												As a huge fan of LOTR and JRRT's world in general, I was looking forward to playing this game as soon as it was announced. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get it installed for a very, very long time until Steam came over to Russia. Now I had my chance to play and form my opinion. I really liked the graphics - much better than I expected. The mapping of the world is nicely done, lots of great and beautiful locations, and an interesting storyline too. At first, that is. Unfortunately, it all gets rather dull as you have to perform tons of similar quests to get that XP and get stuff without paying money for it. Because, truth be told, all this game does (like any ""free"" online game) is try and squeeze money out of you. You can play without it, but it's much more difficult and in the end it gets plain boring because you can't level up fast enough to keep up with the main quest, so you're stuck will all the small quests all over the place. It also takes you plenty of time to go places, from location to location, from quest to quest. There are lots of servers, and I played on Landroval which has plenty of players. However, it's still difficult to find people for team quests as they're so busy running around with their own quests. In the end it gets rather annoying when you just need to find one item and you're killed right in the tomb's hallway or something. The thing I loved were the holidays, all the challenges were fun and rewards worthy. And the good spirit of competition, too! All in all, I would recommend this game, though it's individual whether you keep playing or get bored at some point. I know I'm not the most patient person - with Lineage II I quit at lvl 69, and here the maximum is a 100... I surely do have better things to do with my life;)))			"

												I played this game on and off for about 3-4 years roughly. But I don't play this game vary often. It is a good standard MMO based on J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy world that brings old Celtic and Norse Mythology into today's lores. The game is much bigger since I started playing it sometimes, and there can be much to do in this game. Play the main story, practice your toon or character's crafting skill, go fishing, chat with other players in the game about whatever if they're willing and in the mood, or just roam around this mini version of Middle Earth like a Hobbit without a hill or a Dwarf without a Mountain.To put the rest in short, the community is good depending on server, the gameplay is good, and it does have a serious pvp community even though this has lost some participation compared to a few years ago. The only drawback to this game is the ftp option feels more like a free sample than free to play. It's allot like Star Wars the Old Republic with micro buying. So its still technically pay to play like WoW, but one can still have fun with the ftp option. It's just not as generous as Star Trek Online or Rift.So yes I would recommend this game to nearly anyone.			"

												This game only has end game PVP which is kind of sad.. but hey not every game can have the best pvp.. This game is very easy to play casually..  gave me a nice break from DOTA 2..  oh i am in the middle of the game but i can get up and run to the store without having to wait 45 more minutes.. ahh refreshing.. it is labelled free 2 play..  but to make yoru hero strongers with traits and such you will need to use Turbine Points which you earn by playing.. but again its easier to just buy them..  certain areas of the game you need to unlock and you can with turbine points but ALOT so that might require purchasing the expansions..  then gain you could keep playing for free until you have enough points to buy it.. over all the game reminds me of Dark Age of Camelot.. the graphics and play style.. even though the graphics are a bit dated they still look very nice and will play on most machines, laptops.. you might can even play this on a windows based tablet for that matter..  its a decent game..  though i am only mid level ..  its been fun so far..

												Lord of the rings online is a game you want to play if you are a fan of Tolkien's books or just a mmorpg player. WoW players out there might be interested in this game. In my opinion, this game brings Tolkien's books to life. You can actually travel around Middle-earth and fight different creatures, like orcs, wargs, Uruk-hais and a lot more. You can also invite people to form a fellowship and then do skirmishes together, which can be epic! This game is playable without paying money, as you can complete deeds to earn turbine points to purchase things in the lotro store, like expansions etc. Graphics are not the best, but the landscapes are still very beautiful, say Evendim :) I played like a month ago and absolutely fell in love with it, its free, so why not try it? :)			"

												I started playing Lotro at launch and then stopped playing for many years. I have recently come back (after being inspired by the Hobbit movies!) and I'm really enjoying it.The free to play model is very generous here; there is an absolute ton of content to play for free including the entire epic quest which is really good. Plus just by playing normally you earn Turbine points which can be used to unlock niceties such as the ability to ride a horse and so on.It's a very content rich game, with great story amd there's also a lot of fun stuff to do with all the festival. The community is one of the nicest ones in the MMO space and if you are into RP then this is very well catered for on some of the RP servers.			"

												Alright first I want to say I have 5000+ hours in this game but I played most of those before the integration with steam.This review is more for players looking to rejoin middle earth.With that being said I left this game when West Rohan was released after a few complicated changesto what I was used to and changes to PvMP that made the game unenjoyable.Some staff changes later and a few expansions I came back and so far I have been really enjoying myself!There is more attention in the quests as opposed to previous expansions and I am enjoying leveling and the end game content is fulfilling.Servers have been closed and condensed to preserve server population which is smart but sucks in a regard that the servers are a little laggy with more players returning every day but its a great thing as well as the game is still striving and is on a verge of a bounce back with Mordor coming next year. Definitely give the game another go if you're on the fence, I doubt you will regret it.			"

												Grindy and repetitive, yet oddly satisfying. Much of the features are locked behind store upgrades. Fortunantly, you can earn currency for the store through certain accomplishments inside the game. This secondary means of gaining store currency is an outstanding feature that is rather elegant compared to other models seen in other free to play titles. To unlock everything you must either grind out ingame (recommended) or purchase the currency, the game actually providing a choice for a completely free to play experience.Do note that this game has a habit of deleting characters of extremely low activity, so don't expect a character to last longer than 2 months without some sort of activity.

												This by far the most impressive and immersive mmo I've played in years (and I played a lot of them). Altough the graphics are a little dated now, there is always a concerning about making the game prettier. The game it selfe is very easy to play, there are no problems with the jogability, everything is intuitve (well, almost everything, Warden is not an easy class to play with). The crafting system is so pretty and so rewarding! I can spend a hole afternoon farming crops at the Shire and not be bored with. It's the most exciting leveling experience I had in a MMO, it's fun to level up and the endgame content is heavy and well made. The servers are not CROWDED but they are not emptyI'm in love with this game, I play this since 2010, before I merge it with Steam, so there are many more hours to add!  "

												I think this game is very acomplished even how old it is now and the developers are always brining us out new content every few weeks and a new expansion each year. Many people still play this game, although there is no PVP area, PVMP is very unique because you get to play as an orc and fight players in the ettenmoors.

												Great MMO! If you enjoyed anything The Lord of the Rings is, you should play this game. It has its flaws, like any game, but overall a great experience!!Good things:- Immense world- Fine graphics for a MMO- Less pay2play than most free2play MMO's around- Very great community- Legendary Weapons (for me they are the most great expression of gear in a MMO)Bad things:- PvP system is kind of a joke... A good one for me personally. But undeniable a bit of a joke.- Not as populated as back in the days, if you play this kind of games with people there are 2 main servers you can join on LotRO for alot of action... (Brandywine for the US & Evernight for the EU) The rest are pretty near empty. (EDIT: a little less empty since the server closures, which closed like 50%.)Overall score I would say a 9/10, but this game has alot of emotional worth to me. Most people would rate lower due to the aged graphics/gameplay and the lack of refreshingness.			"

A lot of quests and fights waiting to be done. Make a fellowship with your friends. Defeat your foes. Don't let the darkness spread....but. The game forces you to buy new areas since lvl 25.

It does have a unique atmosphere, but without a party of friends, or a server of co-operative randoms, the endgame will get boring. The leveling adventure can be fun though.

												TL;DR version: A solid game, very entertaining for slow and casual playing where you enjoy the leveling and don't even bother to think about ""the end-game"". Consider this Skyrim, except it's Tolkien, and you might occasionally run into other people.RP ( on Laurelin ) is good if you find the right people and places.PVP ( or Monster Play ) can vary on servers but mostly it's rather dead. Don't expect PVP to be at all balanced as it has almost no focus in the game.End-game: There are raids and bosses but as I said, don't bother thinking about them. Just focus on enjoying the leveling progress - it won't be fast, and the end-game isn't grand enough to be worth rushing your way there.Rambly version:First the most important thing: you should really consider this more of a Free to Try game, rather than Free to Play.  It's true that you earn Turbine Points ( = money )  within the game ( quite a lot too, and easily if you don't mind grinding ) but subscribing is still vastly better if you actually want to play the game without significant limitations ( all of which you can remove with Turbine Points though ). Honestly, you shouldn't think of this as a huge drawback - F2P ( P2W ) games are still a rather new thing and the common model for MMOs has for a long time been to require a subscription. LoTRO wasn't initially free either.That aside, I wouldn't recommend this game to the usual ADHD MMO button smasher kiddie ( for one thing the combat system is queued ). While it has been eased up from what it was, there is still significant grinding involved in the game. Pure, ""Kill 300 Wolves for X"" grinds, straight up. These are called Deeds and you earn stat boosts ( and Turbine Points, titles and other things ) by completing them, but for the gameplay purposes, the stat boosts ( Traits ) are most important. However, if you are the type of person who just loves to put on some music, audiobook or even just watch TV while sloooowly advancing your character, this game will be awesome for you.Gameplay is alright, but I admit it's not the greatest out there. Movement is pretty fluid, though some of the animations are a bit stiff. Skills and such don't feel very streamlined ( I feel there's a lot of redundancy - skills are there just so that you have many buttons to press ) and the combat queue is a bit clumsy. It's unique, I give it that but on certain classes I've found it very annoying. Still, it is as planned and the combat is relatively slow as a result. There are also some minor UI annoyances here and there that take getting used to ( stack splitting, cannot vendor items straight from inventory - need to use vendor ui, have to drag and drop a lot ). On the plus side, you can rearrange your UI exactly as you please and also get some nifty 3rd party skins if you're into that ( there are few other plugins as well ).The graphics are a bit dated but unless you're used to always only playing newest and shiniest games, it shouldn't bother you overly much. However the overall atmosphere with the music and scenery is amazing, especially if you are a Tolkien fan. Even if you aren't in to RP, I expect one would appreciate the first time they see the valley of Rivendell open up to them, or watching the sunrise in the Shire, not to mention many of the other iconic places mentioned in the books, or seen in the movies.This is a very fun game for those who enjoy Tolkien's world, casual but very grindy PVE, casual to no PVP and any amount of RP. For social people, the community is generally friendly and you shouldn't have trouble finding a Kin ( guild ) that suits your tastes. For lone-wolves, there is plenty of solo content and for the most part you don't really need a group either.			"

The game is fun as ever with updates, the game has yet to crash so i'd say its descently stable. The game consists of idiotic quests like fetch quests how ever there still are some awesome quests out there, I enjoy the game to say least. The game has slightly become a pay to win type model which I am against however it is interesting just over overpriced things are unless you shell out cash and buy it.

												Okay before I have anyone hating on this review, I know it's an big bloody pay to win but that doesn't really matter because it's more PvE then PvP.Like if u were dedicated and had the money to upgrade state points u would probably be able to beat an lv 100, which would be hilarious.Now let's get to the point, this game is anaddictive as f*** MMORPG and I'm right about that, iv been playing for 4 days and already hit 27 hours. This game hasn't aged at all it still looks pretty for those hard core graphic fans and is still being updated to this very day. It has an pretty basic combat system but very hard to master the skills and which skills to use first and etc, just because of the skills I dont even use my mouse, I have to put both of my hands on the keyboard.The game hasn't died yet and I think its not going too with people still starting this game, most servers are pretty active and most of the community is mature but the only stupid things I saw on world chat is dont say sh** or f*** ye my kids play this. Like I can barely understand how to play this game and how are kids going to play this, but there are kids who lose their child hood pretty quick. Don't worry about in game money which is turbine u earn most of it by just playing the game and skaying everything. Crafting is key in this game and you'll need a couple of friends to craft what u need or multiple toons because crafting is the only why u get good sh**. It's full of quest and so much dialogue but not much talking maybe some lines ,because if u thing about it it would cost a fortune to get so many voice actors. But don't worry the cut scenes for story have sexy voice acting;). Also trust me when it says massive u'll be running ur ♥♥♥ up and down but it is all worth it in the long run. This is my first MMORPG that had a very good first impression  so I'll give it an 9/10 because they didn't f*** it up yet.Why are u stilI reading its free go ahead and already get it.			"

												I can't believe I haven't found this game until now.  I am a huge LOTR fan and ive been playing MMO's since everquest.  I gotta say this is a well polished game with great lore and a good community.  The Dev's have made this game make sense.  The customer service is good I had a in-game problem and within 5 mins of submitting a ticket I had my issue resolved.

												This game is wizardry! Literaly! The games graphics in 2014 look dated at best however I find them charming and entertaining. The game has one awesome comabt system, its not standstill but it is (look at gameplay) its combat is huge! So many moves and choices its insane! The game is fun as ever with updates, the game has yet to crash so i'd say its descently stable. The game consists of idiotic quests like fetch quests how ever there still are some awesome quests out there, I enjoy the game to say least. The game has slightly become a pay to win type model which I am against however it is interesting just over overpriced things are unless you shell out cash and buy it. Nonetheless love the game, crap pcs should run it on high or ultra I will reccomend this game to people who aren't graphic nuts. If you get the game your in for one adventure			"

												~This is going to be a rather long review, please take a couple minutes and read through it if you're considering playing Lord of the Rings Online. :3Many people have said that this game is 'dying' and that has either scared people away from even starting to play, or pushing away old players who wish to play again. ~I am here to say that this game is NOT dying, NOT on it's last leg, or anything of the sort! The only reason that people from Steam say that is because Steam only shows people who are playing Lotro through Steam, but this amazing game was available, still is available to download through their website. This game has a flourishing community, many helpful people that would happily start playing with you, but only if YOU give this game a chance.In this next section, I will review what I think are the Pro's and Con's of this game. Pro's:~Many friendly people who absolutely love to play together, just waiting for you.~Flourishing community to answer all your questions and comments.~Fun and engaging content to keep you hooked for hours.~Simple crafting to gear your leveling character.~Many different classes to choose from to fit your playstyle.~Dungeons just waiting for you and your friends to plunder them.~The best gear in the game is crafted by players, not bought from a cash shop.Con's:~Many servers have a decline in population. (To move to Brandywine.)~Over-Simplified crafting.~Lag spikes in highly populated area's (As expected.)~Longer-than-usual server downtimes for simple repairs and maintenence.~Many things are still bought from the cash shop. (Personal Con.)~No real end-game (Yet, but plenty of gearing and skill tweaking to do.)You may notice that I have crafting in both Pro's and Con's, mainly because in the last massive update they (Turbine) made crafting super easy, but still fun for the leveling character.If you have read the review and agree, or disagree with what I have said about this magnificent game, go ahead and send a friend request and we can talk it over. ~If you're a new player, or a returning player who found my review helpful, you can find me on the Brandywine server, or even better, just send a friend request here. :D Always happy to help and chat. :3 "

												The world in LOTRO truly feel like a world. It has beautiful scenery and feels vast and coherent. It is tantalizing to explore areas, places, towns and villages you have read in the books, and seen in the films. Once in a while you encounter the famous characters from the stories of Lord of the Rings which is ongoing behind the scenes. For a lore player this is a dream since there is always so much to delve deeper into if you wish.The only downside to the feel of the game are the player characters. They have an outdated or even unnatural feel to them, which is contrary to the rest of the world (which has a fantastic natural feel).The epic quest line is a joy, and I recommend that you take your time and follow the actually story in those quests.

												A friend of mine recently introduced me to Lord of the Rings (I had never seen it) which led to me getting this game. I have to say that I really enjoy it! I like the combat system because it's not overly complicated and many of the concepts within the game are easy to grasp, even to someone who is fairly new to the LOTR universe. I do sometimes struggle with things like the map, meaning I have a hard time going the right way. However, I believe that this is due to my being new at the game and I feel that I will get the hang of it as I continue to play this amazing game!			"

												I have sunk months, even years of my time in this game.At times, it's made me cringe, at others, it's made me smile. It's got this great sense of you doing something meaningful cause it's not all blown up into you being the one person who'll save Middle-Earth (cause let's just be clear, the original storyline is still vaguely in the game, you occasionally meet members of the fellowship)But 2 things really bother me in this game : although it stands proud despite the test of time, the graphics and dialog system show it isn't as modern as it used to be. (On dialog : whenever you talk to someone, a huge window appears, and your only options are accept or decline. Often even only accept or close the window)One other thing : the ""cool stuff is for higher levels"" mentality. I have a terrible problem where I rerun the early levels content 250 times because my character doesn't turn out exactly the way I want it to, and that mentality makes those early levels kinda boring. Once you get there, it's really worth it though.Last thing : the social pannel for searching a party needs some reworks/hype cause I usually end up having played for over 5 hours while searching for others to do a skirmish with (which is a small instance) and no having found anyone.Besides all of that, I absolutely love this game, it's my all-time favorite.

												So, this game, when I played it, had one of the greatest player communities I've ever seen. It was absolutely amazing how immersed you felt. Graphics don't matter when you have people who love a game that much.It has been a long time since I've come back to this game, I'm hoping not much has changed, I remember playing it before it was Free to Play, and I was beyond impressed, the more I see other people play other MMO games, or multiplayer games, the more I miss growing my pipe weed, sitting in a tavern, or listening to a player band play their hearts out. I miss exploring the beautiful world that is Middle Earth, and I miss my Dwarven Champion.Not just did this game have an amazing player base, but it also had THE BEST questing I've ever experienced in ANY other mmo game, and in some cases in many other RPG games. I would go so far as to say Lotro defeats The Witcher (Series) and Kotor (1-2), two series I love very much. I remember there was an amazing depth to the game, where, sure you were one player among many, but every adventure felt important, not just your journey to become the strongest, but more your perilous trek to explore this vast world. I am a returning player, and all I can say, is I hope not much has changed, this game was almost perfect, I hope it still is.			"

												First...What is a video game ?Why do I play a video game ?A Game is basically an entertaining activity, some are more stimulating than others, and some stimulate reactions over concentration. If you get this logic right; you can discover a whole world of possibilities through video games. Someone could just decide to create a ""goat Simulator"" for fun (and you would pretend to be a goat), or create a Massive Multiplayer Game where everybody interacts with each other to accomplish goals in the game.There is a myriad of games out there today and some will tickle you to play, based on your interests of course.About Lord of the Rings Online :1st. Interests:Yes I am interested in the Lord of the Rings lore. I like the Medieval style, the powerful evil, the hobbits, the elves, the faith, the glory, the flowers, name it. I read the complete story years ago, way before the movies. Am I a complete sold out and corrupt Lord of the rings fan ?  Nope, not at all. I just like the writing style and the human-side, possibly believable logic-reality-fantasy, story of it all.2nd. The Genre:MMO. I am not a MMO FAN, in fact, I hate MMO's. They are a repeatable-similar-cut-and-paste infinite same thing said differently, lather repeat. This type of game is kinda of free-roaming-reading do the same thing. The story is vaguely known, the sense of it is tasteless.  Just roam, talk to someone and pretend it is fun. Now that's my point. (Lord of the GATHErings I called it back in my debut)3rd. Entertainment: Is Lotro entertaining? Well... I must say that something was entertaining, and still is... after playing this type of game for so long now... and still playing it ! What happened to my anti-MMO player side ?  It got impressed !!The cutscenes were a nice feature that propels you directly into the current conflict (linked to the departure of the fellowship...and following right down in their footsteps is totally great. The feeling of being part of the LOTRO world was achieved greatly with all those characters and storyline. The sense of my character being known to this fake-world was cool.  There is also an outrageous number of QUESTS ! From main quests, side quests, skill quests, deeds quests, trait quests to crafting quests, I am probably forgeting some.. there is so much.Yes, the graphics are now outdated even with full DirectX11. But it doesn’t get you out of the story that much. If you like the Lore, you will probably find it cartoony acceptable.What was the most entertaining to me, was the fact that I can take out the time I want in the LOTRO world to do whatever I wish. Roleplay with some stangers, do quests, craft, manage my house and garden decorations, look up the price of some useless item that some people desire. (Of course, in other MMO's you can also lose your time the way you want) But the most appreciable assets in those moments; The sounds ! Everytime I hooked up my headphones.. I was submerged in the wild environment, the ambiance and the tension felt everywhere in the wilderness.LOTRO convinced me where no other MMO could. The sound ! Especially in Moria... this is where it all began down the hill for me... I became a LOTRO FAN :) in Moria.Before that, It was Lord of the Gatherings ! I hopped in from time to time with a friend or two... running beside them and trying to follow up their leveling. Which was a pain ! Since they were so much into it and were leveling Fast in VIP mode.OK Now we get to VIP and the Free to Play thing.YES, before... believe it or not. IT was not FREE. You had to pay the game, and subscribe for the experience. I was not playing at that time.It then became f2p. Which is a matter of attracting new players to try the game and hopefully, make them pay to achieve their pleasure.It is FREE totally up to lvl 20... then you get the point, that if you want to continue and level up... or have some fun in this world, you will have to grind a lot of time to achieve some goals and earn some turbine points (In game store currency) to buy some useful needed quests pack or stuff. Yup, it’s a business world, where programmers need to eat, and infrastructure guys needs funds to host the game on Technical Horsepower, If you want a free computer, free energy, free internet, free games... well... Then you better get out and change this world to accept FREE as a currency. In the meantime, you won’t have any time left to play your favorite game, you will probably be outside growing your food and waiting the harvest to exchange some for... lets say... a computer! :)Is this game entertaining? YES, to me it is! And it is well worth some money. I bought some Turbine points with real money when there was a double bonus points event... and then waited for the 30-50% rebate on quests pack that comes along once or twice a year... It was well worth the ride. (More than VIP)4th factor: Replayability:Yes you can replay over and over again. Let’s say with another character.  There is so much quests... that you can probably live a lot of adventures in a completely different manner.The rest will be similar, in traits, deeds, skills and all with a slight new flavor. It's the same Game.5th factor. Price over time spent:If you pay 60$ per year for the new call of duty and you only play the campaign like me... well it is a shame. The game is much more satisfying online versus people. You can frag for a full year ! 60$ for 300 hours of game play.But for me... Since 3d Shooters is not my Main Genre, I play the campaign for 15 hours, do some LAN party with friends... and then put it on the shelf. 60$ for 40 hours ! Not the most satisfying purchase.In LOTRO, I spent about 70$ and got... if one level is 3-4 hours roughly...  320 hours since 2010 and I am not done at all with my purchases !  (Played with independent Client)It is well worth the run.If you are a Lord of the Rings enthusiast, you will probably like it even more. Besides that, it is well balanced in simplicity and complexity and its pace follows comfortably your period of learning the game.It's a MMO, you may be charmed by the genre or you may hate it. But from an adventurous point of view, even with my hate of MMO, I still have fun in this game.Conclusion, LOTRO is good, and for myself, my adventures continue mainly because of the subject world; Lord of the Rings, and its outstanding engineering sounds that keeps me coming back into the woods.

												I'm a huge Fan of The Lord of the Rings Books and The Movies,  so why not make it the First game I download and play on Steam, it completes the circle, no Pun intended. I'm new to the whole PC gaming style and keyboard gameplay, but what i've seen so far, this game is very Cool, graphics and Word play are very on point, i advise you to use a powerful computer and a good graphics card to fully experience the gameplay and to see the World on which you journey threw. The Story line is very much the same with the books and movies. with a few side missions that adds a little more spice to your gameplay. Would i recommend the this Game, Yes i would, i'm true game player, that spans from everygame console, and Pc games (which i used a remote control), so i fully appreciate the time and effort WB GAMING put into this game, the ADD-ONs are spot on, SO the game is free, but of course to get your hands on the Add-On's , you must shell out some cash, no Biggie!  So get your hands on this game, if you haven't already. That is all...			"

												Boot up the game after installing it, tells me to log in with a Turbine account.Okay, I have one of these from a long time ago, it should work.Enter details, no subscribtion to LOTRO.Okay, go to their website to see what's going on.No information given at all.Look it up, find a steam page. Find out that if your account is older than LOTRO being F2P, you can't access the game and don't get to play it without making a new account.Uninstalled.Who the hell looked at that, who the hell thought that making it so that people with an old turbine account have to BUY a game that is NO LONGER FOR SALE. Which IDIOT was in charge of quality control? Which IDIOT was in charge of making sure that things work? For a company to just have that big of a blindspot is completely absurd, game can't be that good if that's the kind of crap you have to put up with JUST TO PLAY THE GAME.			"

Graphics dosint mean the game isint good or anything, just that mabey afew rich textures here and afew rich textures there wouldint hurt.

In my honest opinion i think the team should step it up, get more updates!, not so much the lore but other things that you guys have been wanting to do for awhile!.			"

												I played beta and launch of this game... there was a lot of potential and it was very pretty at the time of launch- especially considering it was competing with the very cartoony look of WoW. There were some really interesting, unique features to the game as well as beautiful environments that were neat to explore as part of LotR lore...I popped back into the game, just to check out the f2p spin and see how things have evolved. On the upside, the game doesn't suck and all of my characters were still there. The down-sides, however, unfortunately, make me not recommend it. From my perspecitve, the game hasn't evolved (possibly de-volved), is a bit dated, continues to be a bit clunky, and is still not quite intuitive (coming from a veteran MMO player: EQ, SWG, WoW, Vanguard, Eve, AoC, CoH/V, DC Universe, D&DO, ESO, Entropia, SWTOR, blah blah blah). Most importantly, it seems barren now... so, if I want a LotR fix I'll just play one of the quality single player titles to get the same jolt... or maybe Skyrim. If I want a solid MMO (with actual players to interact with) to swing a sword around in, I'd spend my time and money on ESO or WoW. But, for other people, I guess if you really hate on WoW or ESO for whatever reason and really need an MMO fix in a similar genre or are REALLY into LotR and are willing to pay to play, it might be worth it. All of that said, it really is free to play at the start- so trying it and not liking it will only cost you the time to download, the space on your hard drive (temporarily), and however much time you put in. If you have time to burn and enjoy spending it trying new things, it probably won't be a waste.			"

												Graphics:The people that are saying this game is dated or doesn't look good are playing on medium. Especially if you are able to take advantage of DSR or other similar technologies and run on high to ultra-high, this game still looks AMAZING! Just be patient and tinker with it.Gameplay:Combat mechanics won't blow you away, but that's not what traditional MMO's are for anyway. HOWEVER, the way each class plays is VERY unique and interesting if you take the time to learn them, thus making the combat feel less clunky than it probably is.Leveling:Questing is similar to the snatch and grab MMO model; however, a good bit of story and random traveling is incorporated as well (in a good way) to allow you to explore a bit and familiarize you with what is happening around you, story-wise. You are eligible for instanced content at level 10 but don't expect to jump right into a group instance because it won't happen, the low levels are populated but you level so quickly most people don't even think about instances until they are eligible for skirmishes (skirmishes are so ♥♥♥♥)End-game Content:There is plenty to do at end-game; however, like any other MMO, it will take you some time to coordinate and find a group for any serious content completion, BUT the potential to do so is definitely there.Community:Best of any MMO I've ever seen, players are constantly offering up items for free to newer players, quick to hand out advice, and most of them, excited to help you on your journey throughout middle earth.TL;DR -- DO NOT let the bad reviews prevent you from downloading this game. If you are TRULY a fan of traditional-style MMO's (think WoW) you will most definitely enjoy yourself. The players complaining about things being ""slow"", ""dated"" or ""clunky"" merely do not know how to configure their settings for the game to run properly on their system.			"

												So its time to find a new game... your bored of everything else in your library, if you are looking for a mmo rpg that is not dead such as WoW or Tera. You have come to the right place, today as I write this review Feburary 6th 2017, this game is alive. Ever since a year or so ago, they cut down their many servers with a average amount of players on it, some more than others, into a few big servers. This seemed to help restore the community although it did divid a few friends from old servers. The graphics on this game are good for the year they came out and are probably one of the better graphics found in most mmo rpgs, the content is fun, but to really enjoy it you have to enjoy the universe which it takes place in, like you wouldn't play Star Trek online if you didn't know anything about Star Trek. Although the game is based on the books and movies of lord of the rings, it has its own original feel to it, with its own sort of story and characters, although you get to see the characters from the books through your quests, and can even aid them in battle. With 10 classes and 5 races to choose from there will be lots of variety to choose from. Next, the community is probably the nicest I have ever seen, besides the few trolls that linger in world chat, you will meet many kinds of people, the role player, who no matter what sticks to their role, the pro alt leveler, who is on leveling his 10th character and solos everything and kills the quest targets for you, and the guy who you will probably be, the person who invites everyone they see, be it to finish a hard quest or to play a quick skirmish to get on to the next level. Find a kin that has a history and that you feel you can connect with, if you are starting to play this game with a group of friends, start a kinship and slowly grow. The devs on this game are actually not bad, of course its easy to complain about the game designers of any game. Usually if you have a complaint give them a fair amount of time and they will reply back. If you have read this far then you are probably interested now your next question is, ""Is this game pay to win"", the answer is yes/no if you are either young or retired you can spend plenty of spare time completing deeds to gain ingame currency. Although there are expansion packs that are a must, but if you get that far (first one being at lvl 50 ""Mine of Moria"" then you probably really like the game and should consider spending the like 20 US dollars on it. If you are still unsure if you wanna play this game, just download it, its free.			"

												Firstly, I have been playing this game on and off for almost 5 years. I have spent more than 1000 hours on it and I have experienced every part of the content it has to offer. No other MMORPG had me coming back like this one did, but the fact is that the game is not so popular these days, yes, you can find lots of people to play it with, but compared to 3-4 years ago.. it is dead. I started playing again, two weeks ago, after a little break to see how the game evolved with the new content that is available right now. Endgame is really good with the new instances from Gondor, epic story is in North Ithilien, getting ready to go into Mordor which is exciting, but sadly, the game got really grindy and by grindy I do not mean grinding instances and raids which is fun, it is about gathering hundreds of flowers to exchange for armour and doing Featured Instances once per day to get recipes for essences you need to put on the slots in the armour. Daily quests exist too and they get boring after 2 weeks of doing them on a daily basis. Also, take into account that if you want to play this game to its fullest you will need to subscribe for 1 month to remove gold cap and unlock traits and bags. PVP is boring, coming from a player who is mostly looking to PVP rather than PVE. Creeps are in a good position right now and freeps just wont come to the Ettenmoors to fight, now that it is challenging. Also, everyone plays the FOTM classes which leads to the Moors being stacked with 30 creeps while the freeps are on the stairs of GV afking. As someone who plays this game, I surely recommend it to you because it has one of the best communities in the gaming world, everyone is nice and will help you. I will end this by saying that this game has the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen and it is truly a superb experience to see every location in the book and movie, to fight Mordirith, Saruman, the Nazgul, Mumaks and so on. I will forever play this, even though I cannot play it for more than two months  without a break anymore.			"

												First off, this game is great, for both Tolkien fans and people who haven't even seen the movies. This game has everything it needs to be a great MMO. Here are some more details with pros and cons:So the best part of this game is easily the story, I play for the stories. The Epic Quests are generally the best, but there are some really cool side quest lines too which are fun to play along. It's also cool to have Monster Play, to be able to conquer outposts and hunt down Free Players is quite satisfying. The classes, at least from what I've seen, are all unique and fun to play, each in their own way, which is cool too. Here's some stuff to keep in mind though.THIS GAME ISN'T TOTALLY FREE. Or at least, if you want to play totally free, it's going to take a TON of effort and a lot of hunting random creatures to fulfill deeds to get LOTRO Points. But there comes a point, after you've finished playing through the Lone Lands and you've played along the Epic Quest series in the North Downs, that you have to buy Evendim to continue the epic story line, which is usually something like 700 LOTRO points, and by that time I had raked up about 600, and there was, luckily a sale going on. But, I'm trying to make the point that in order to continue playing the game you are going to need a lot of LOTRO Points. Aside from that, other cons include the fact that Middle-Earth is too stinking massive and unless you use LOTRO Points to buy yourself a horse, you have to run everywhere, at least until you've discovered all the stablemasters. So that can be pretty boring.But in the end, I still find this game enormously entertaining, You can make it all the way to Level 40 without even needing to worry about buying another region if you follow all the side quests. The story is cool, engaging and original, staying true to Lord of the Rings Canon, while building off of ALL the loose ends that Tolkien left out there to create really cool stories. So yes, I highly recommend this game.			"

												Although often feeling like a micro-transaction dominated world, LOTR has done what it can to survive in the changing climate of MMOs. The game will eventually require money to be spent in order to progress meaningfully and also to reduce frustrations in basic gameplay aspects such as gold caps and inventory slots. Despite it's repetetive enemy models and requirement for endless travelling, LOTR really shines in bringing Tolkien's world to life. The game has very accurate depictions of characters and tales from the mythology, whilst providing an outstanding feeling of immersion through a beautiful soundtrack and carefully crafted environments. Some of its systems such as music composition and housing make it one of the best MMOs out there for atmospheric and paced gameplay.			"

												Lord of the Rings Online, or Lotro is one of the older Mmorpgs out there. Like the name of the title suggest, this game plays out in Middle Earth where you can play as a Hobbit, Human, Dwarf or Elf. Each race has its own background story but will eventually merged in to a in my opinion Rich storyline where you help the people of middle earth and the fellowship of frodo and his companions. If you are a fan of the movies like i am then it won't take long to fully emerge your self in to this game and even learn new things about Middle Earth it self.So...? What can you expect from this game then? As for Dungeons and Raids nothing to challenging, wich in my opinion isn't all that bad, i have seen other games where they make it so damn hard people just rage quit or can't be bothered to play it after a hard day of work or school. What is new (mostly for ppl that used to play this game back in the days) is that deeds (kill for instance 200 orcs or complete 30 quests) are much more important then before and for ppl that are looking for a quick breeze through the game for max level and then hope to enjoy the end gaming this is made possible (unless you invest alot of $ in the online shop)For player activity? I Am playing on the europe server Snowborn and there is lots of people online, never had a moment where i didn't meet someone while playing.Free To Play version of the game. You may or may not ask you self, Is it playable with out spending a Dollar. The answer is NO. Some of the expansions aren't free, and if you're not in the mood to grind deeds with multiple character you miss out on a lot of coin that is needed to unlock many things in the online shop. Ultimately whether or not you choose to play this game is up to you. Like i said above, It maybe free but you gone spend money in the end anyway, that is if you want to see and be able to do everything this game has to offer. Other then the financial aspect its still on of the better online games out there and i'm sure with the release on steam the game will get a boost in player numbers, so in the end i give it a YES on recommendations even with cash you most likely gonna have to spend.

												As MMOs go, The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar isn't half bad. Although it's gone through several permutations over the course of its lifespan, it is currently a free-to-play title with a very hefty amount of actually-free material. As a man, hobbit, elf, or dwarf, you must rise up and begin fighting back against the various forces of Sauron, indirectly aiding the Fellowship of the Ring as they make their march to Mount Doom. Fans of the LotR universe and devout Silmarillion enthusiasts will have a lot to enjoy here; the world is packed to the gills with obscure names and lore trivia, and seeing every square inch of Tolkien's world fleshed out is actually rather thrilling (according to the massive Tolkien nerd I live with anyway). As a moderate fan of the books, I personally found the world better designed and more atmospheric than most MMO worlds, but nothing to freak out about.As for the gameplay, it's solid and incorporates many of the best features of modern MMOs. Forming groups for skirmishes and dungeons is easy, quest tracking is convenient, and inventory management is a breeze... assuming you're willing to pay a couple bucks here and there for content. Playing the purely free version of the game is a little more aggravating, but still playable and enjoyable. You miss out on some inventory space, some class options, and eventually a lot of quest access, but by then you'll know if you like the game, and as game costs go everything is pretty reasonable.Along with the usual assortment of MMO quest grinding (so many boar heads and bear butts for strangely insistent random strangers...), there's also a surprisingly substantial Epic quest chain for each race, making up the actual storyline for the game as your character works with Strider, Gandalf, and many others to save the world from the generic eeeeeevil of Mordor. While I hesitate to call it ""gripping"", it's a hell of a lot better than it could have been. The only aspect of the game I found lacking was the near-absence of PvP. While players who pay the monthly fee for VIP status get access to a MONSTER PLAY mode, it seems a bit essential to include that in base play.I could go on, but there's not much to say here beyond it being a solid, high-budget, free-to-play MMO that provides decent returns for your investment in the expansion packs, and which fans of a particular legendary fantasy writer may go nuts over. I had a good two weeks tromping from Shire to Moria, and I'm throwing in the towel without a bad taste in my mouth. For an MMO, that's a hell of a lot better than average.			"

												I am a returning player who played LoTRO at time of launch and had many fun times playing with family and friends.  I decided to start fresh with a new account and started leveling a couple toons.  The game and lore are awesome, it has gone casual but for the amount of time I have to throw at a game like this being not so Mt. Dew extreme allow a more relaxing entertainment experience.  If you just want a fun game to go PvP in or surf new content only then I would not recommend this game.  However if you want a hint of old school MMO with a good community and not really interested in level hurdling to new content then this game is worth a play to at least level 30.  I've seen a number of gripes about the cash shop, however you do not need to spend a ton of cash to have an entertaining experience with this game.  It seems that way if you want totally free but I am not naive to think game developers live off good comments and troll hugs.  I threw a few bucks at the steam DLC, picked up the 3 month sub for 30 bucks and having fun!			"

												Hmmm, where to start?  OK, if you're an old-school WoWer then you'll love this (after you get over the graphics).  If you like the current dumbed-down WoW then you'll struggle to pick up LOTRO.  There's simply not as much hand-holding as WoW, but in ways that's better as you have to really get into the game (not just endlessly run raids and dungeons as in WoW nowadays).  And you really can play to level cap for free (I've met people in game that have done so).PROS: Crafting system is good after you get the hang of it, and you really can make better items than the drops at the same level.  The auction house system is good too.  And having your own home can be fun.  People are as friendly as they used to be on WoW and I haven't seen a single farmer bit yet.CONS: It is free-to-play BUT it is very much structured to make playing without buying TPs (Turbine Points) as annoying as possible.  For a start, there is the 2 gold pieces money cap - you need TPs to remove that.  And you can hit 2GP in an hour's play.  Yes, you can eran TPs but it's sloooooow.  And fellowships (forming a party) is a pain and you really need to make sure your fellow fellows know what they are doing.  I got to level 23 without dying, joined a fellowship for a dungeon and died almost immediately.  The housing system can leave you miles from where the action is so you'll probably end up buying and selling several homes.Try it! "

I've recently been picking it up again, though on Steam and would like for all of those RPGMMO lore loving fans out there to know, This Game Is F*&$ing Amazing, if you can get past the wierd controls and being underleveled, (becuase This game is more then a few years old.) Pay to play and pay to win? No such thing while it does help to get the bonuses of the in game devil deals known as micro transactions, you can just play level up get better gear do more quests, grind, etc. The story at the beginging for almost all races goes from 0 to 100 real fast. Great game for LoTR lovers though will ♥♥♥♥ on your knowledge of the world.			"

												Hmmm, where to start?  OK, if you're an old-school WoWer then you'll love this (after you get over the graphics).  If you like the current dumbed-down WoW then you'll struggle to pick up LOTRO.  There's simply not as much hand-holding as WoW, but in ways that's better as you have to really get into the game (not just endlessly run raids and dungeons as in WoW nowadays).  And you really can play to level cap for free (I've met people in game that have done so).PROS: Crafting system is good after you get the hang of it, and you really can make better items than the drops at the same level.  The auction house system is good too.  And having your own home can be fun.  People are as friendly as they used to be on WoW and I haven't seen a single farmer bit yet.CONS: It is free-to-play BUT it is very much structured to make playing without buying TPs (Turbine Points) as annoying as possible.  For a start, there is the 2 gold pieces money cap - you need TPs to remove that.  And you can hit 2GP in an hour's play.  Yes, you can eran TPs but it's sloooooow.  And fellowships (forming a party) is a pain and you really need to make sure your fellow fellows know what they are doing.  I got to level 23 without dying, joined a fellowship for a dungeon and died almost immediately.  The housing system can leave you miles from where the action is so you'll probably end up buying and selling several homes.Try it! "

												I ""HIGHLY"" recommend this game it has such a vas class option going anywhere from Tank to Heal to a little of both. i personally love the  Lore Master Class the Minstrel Class and the Rune Keeper Class, these 3 classes are epic as a LM you can be virtualy unstoppable because you have the ability to summon a pet to your side to help you with your quest thru the story where as the Minstrel not only has has the power to do Major Dps but can Also heal now the down side of the Minstrel is you can do wither or but not both at the same time, the RK on the other hand also can do Major Dps and heal but unlike the Minstrel the RK can do both at the same time. The down side of the RK is you have to use real money to purchase it from the lotro store. Now if you are a tank you coud go with the gaurdian this Class has the upmost amount of Hp i think the most ive seen in HP is 21k at max rank this class is ment for group stile playing made to take all the damage while dealing lots of Dps, nwo if you like to help the group out and do alot of DPS then i recoment the Champion this is almost like the gaurdian but doesnt have as much HP this class is set more towards high amount of DPS with little dameage taken good for group still playing, if you are mre of a ranged player and not for the up close and personal then i recmend the hunter class it your usaual bow and sword class good for ranged DPS but in this game it has a major ability that everbody needs this ability is swift travel witch basically mean that you dont have to use a stable you will have a skill that will let you go straight to the desired location the last class this game has is for more a quite sneak around play this calss is the burglar this class uses more of trickster skills to throw the enemy.  this game is a well worth it game i again recomend it and i hop ethis helps you guys/girls out and enpires you to play this game, if you do decide to play this game and start to have problems or need help add Themusicguy that is my toons name and i will be happy to help			"

												LOTRO is a good solid game for LOTRO fans, for new players is might be alittle harder to come to but over all you'l get there ,the story is great and i havint even gotten that far yet but it does have outdated graphics. Graphics dosint mean the game isint good or anything, just that mabey afew rich textures here and afew rich textures there wouldint hurt. Over all i would recommend trying the game at least because you can really get hooked if your in the mood. In my honest opinion i think the team should step it up, get more updates!, not so much the lore but other things that you guys have been wanting to do for awhile!.			"

												As MMOs go, The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar isn't half bad. Although it's gone through several permutations over the course of its lifespan, it is currently a free-to-play title with a very hefty amount of actually-free material. As a man, hobbit, elf, or dwarf, you must rise up and begin fighting back against the various forces of Sauron, indirectly aiding the Fellowship of the Ring as they make their march to Mount Doom. Fans of the LotR universe and devout Silmarillion enthusiasts will have a lot to enjoy here; the world is packed to the gills with obscure names and lore trivia, and seeing every square inch of Tolkien's world fleshed out is actually rather thrilling (according to the massive Tolkien nerd I live with anyway). As a moderate fan of the books, I personally found the world better designed and more atmospheric than most MMO worlds, but nothing to freak out about.As for the gameplay, it's solid and incorporates many of the best features of modern MMOs. Forming groups for skirmishes and dungeons is easy, quest tracking is convenient, and inventory management is a breeze... assuming you're willing to pay a couple bucks here and there for content. Playing the purely free version of the game is a little more aggravating, but still playable and enjoyable. You miss out on some inventory space, some class options, and eventually a lot of quest access, but by then you'll know if you like the game, and as game costs go everything is pretty reasonable.Along with the usual assortment of MMO quest grinding (so many boar heads and bear butts for strangely insistent random strangers...), there's also a surprisingly substantial Epic quest chain for each race, making up the actual storyline for the game as your character works with Strider, Gandalf, and many others to save the world from the generic eeeeeevil of Mordor. While I hesitate to call it ""gripping"", it's a hell of a lot better than it could have been. The only aspect of the game I found lacking was the near-absence of PvP. While players who pay the monthly fee for VIP status get access to a MONSTER PLAY mode, it seems a bit essential to include that in base play.I could go on, but there's not much to say here beyond it being a solid, high-budget, free-to-play MMO that provides decent returns for your investment in the expansion packs, and which fans of a particular legendary fantasy writer may go nuts over. I had a good two weeks tromping from Shire to Moria, and I'm throwing in the towel without a bad taste in my mouth. For an MMO, that's a hell of a lot better than average.			"

The free version doesn't let you:-have a full inventory space-fully access some areas and quests-trade money,etc. BUTbecause it's free, the stuff that you DO get is a really good deal. most of the time you don't feel like you're even missing anything!Definitely worth a download			"

Dont even need a top of the range laptop to play it but still enjoying its beauty.  Crafting system is clean and works well, Auction House is well presented and the game mechanics (such as emotes) really are immersive.

												Lord of the Rings Online is definitely an MMO game where the journey is far more important than the end goal. If your focus is on levelling as quickly as possible, skipping the quest lore, you're missing out on a great deal in this game. Although you can take shortcuts with money, you can earn TP through time and effort in-game to buy things from the store, such as new areas. The game definitely rewards having multiple characters, and the variety of the playstyles of the different classes makes each interesting to play. The most important part for me, however, has to be the setting of the game. I was genuinely excited to explore this amazing world, and it really brought the world from Tolkein's books alive for me. There was a sense of wonder and awe as soon as I begun in Ered Luin, and it hasn't diminished for me, even after many hundreds of hours in Middle Earth.			"

												Lord of the Rings Online, or Lotro is one of the older Mmorpgs out there. Like the name of the title suggest, this game plays out in Middle Earth where you can play as a Hobbit, Human, Dwarf or Elf. Each race has its own background story but will eventually merged in to a in my opinion Rich storyline where you help the people of middle earth and the fellowship of frodo and his companions. If you are a fan of the movies like i am then it won't take long to fully emerge your self in to this game and even learn new things about Middle Earth it self.So...? What can you expect from this game then? As for Dungeons and Raids nothing to challenging, wich in my opinion isn't all that bad, i have seen other games where they make it so damn hard people just rage quit or can't be bothered to play it after a hard day of work or school. What is new (mostly for ppl that used to play this game back in the days) is that deeds (kill for instance 200 orcs or complete 30 quests) are much more important then before and for ppl that are looking for a quick breeze through the game for max level and then hope to enjoy the end gaming this is made possible (unless you invest alot of $ in the online shop)For player activity? I Am playing on the europe server Snowborn and there is lots of people online, never had a moment where i didn't meet someone while playing.Free To Play version of the game. You may or may not ask you self, Is it playable with out spending a Dollar. The answer is NO. Some of the expansions aren't free, and if you're not in the mood to grind deeds with multiple character you miss out on a lot of coin that is needed to unlock many things in the online shop. Ultimately whether or not you choose to play this game is up to you. Like i said above, It maybe free but you gone spend money in the end anyway, that is if you want to see and be able to do everything this game has to offer. Other then the financial aspect its still on of the better online games out there and i'm sure with the release on steam the game will get a boost in player numbers, so in the end i give it a YES on recommendations even with cash you most likely gonna have to spend.

												I've spent a lot of time on this game, but I prefer to run it directly than run through steam so it didn't show the correct playtime. The game is fun and rich in content. You can visit many places of interest of middle earth though the map have only reached Rohan. But it's updating pretty fast, maybe we'll get to Mordor 2 years later? The graphics are good, but it's still feeling outdated a little. Go play on some populated servers. It's free to play. When you reach some locked quests, you can just buy the expansion that contains the quests. And it's pretty balanced. Just try it out, and playing alone isn't fun for me, I don't know about others.If you're a LotR fan, and you haven't play this yet, then you're missing out a lot!Go try it with one or two of your friends. MMOs are always better when you play with others~			"

												First off, i don't play this game through Steam. So my hours are not correct. I play this game since the launch in 2012, loved it and hated it at times. Many changes have been made to this game throughout the years, which is fine, but Turbine makes this game easier and easier with every update. In it's current state it's designed for the casual solo player who likes to spend 30 minutes a day questing, exploring or chatting with other people. There is almost no group play at all anymore. If you are looking for a MMO where you can raid and do instances with others, this is not the MMORPG for you anymore.If you like LOTR, and you just like to follow the story, this might be a good MMORPG for you.If you like roleplaying, this might be the MMORPG for you as there is 1 RP server and they sometimes do RP events.Also, note it's 'free'. But if you want to get to the level cap you will have to buy a whole lot of expansions and quest packs to get there, unless you want to kill millions of mobs to reach your goal.Oh, and the 'PvP' in this game is a joke. Very unbalanced and it's been like that since day 1. With every update the overpowered side changes, but never a way between overpowered and useless.			"

												when you entered you will find best community and ofcourse best epic quests with amazing maps full with beauty of middle earth and you will have many best friends i mean real friends and good mmorpg players they dont insult you or they dont trolling your questions on global or kinship chat , they are not leave raid or fellowship just for a few wipe opposite if somethings wrong they call extra help from their friends or they change the toon, your kinship mates dont take charge for crafts or items because you are friends! and when you ask help for craft on glff everybody try to help you and craft items for you without fee! this part of is kind of dreamy...but one day sauron type greedy warner bros involved this amazing story with full of hunger of money and the turbine with full of mistakes for example 10mn long raids and unlimited farming mode and bugs and expensive expension pack without no raids in it i cant describe their money hunger if i need to give a example they even sell lvl50 character -with full of item and virtue ready to enter the moria- on store to make money !!!!they dont care players p2p or f2p and f2p part is a lie if you dont buy maps your only choose is farming skirmishes or finding a friend for farming dungeons!they are broking game over and over again and they even didnt know what is the problem and how they can fixed so game closing like a few days and so many apology to earn more time to fix it and the last option giving you a turbine point as a gift for extra day to fixes... i still love lotro because of community and recomending just for those players! join lotro and see the best mmorpg players at any age from anywhere of world !!!!

												If WoW have great story, great game, great endgame and the WORST community ever, LOTRO have great story, good game, reasonably good endgame and the BEST community ever, which is the reason to keep playing :) I have tried WoW several times, reached the endgame, start raiding - do not do enough dps - kick, made a silly minor mistake - kick... kick for this, curse for that.... wtf.... In LOTRO this couldn't happen. I am constantly joining instance fellowships and raids if I am 2-3 lvl behind or not with optimal gear. And nobody will say anything against that. The entire community is totally helpful and understanding. I hope that the game will be there at least for 2-3 more years. It deserve it!			"

												With likely over 3000 hours into the game, only about 850 of which I have logged on Steam thanks to playing it without and playing in offline mode, LotRO has been the epicentre of my MMORPG experience for nearly a decade, and I believe there it will firmly remain as long as the game is alive. There as a lot that Turbine has done correctly and well with this game since its conception, and very little that they've done bad that really could take away from the experience. As the game now stands with the same developers under a new studio, hopefully with greater freedom and budget to do as they like, I have nothing but a bright and shiny outlook for the future of the game. The community is one of the most friendly and positive I've known, and community-run events are plenty in addition to the seasonal dev-run events. 10/10 ~ I will continue to ~always~ recommend it to others to at least give it a shot. It's definitely my favorite way to get my Lord of the Rings fix alongside watching the movies and reading the books. :)			"

												I've spent a lot of time on this game, but I prefer to run it directly than run through steam so it didn't show the correct playtime. The game is fun and rich in content. You can visit many places of interest of middle earth though the map have only reached Rohan. But it's updating pretty fast, maybe we'll get to Mordor 2 years later? The graphics are good, but it's still feeling outdated a little. Go play on some populated servers. It's free to play. When you reach some locked quests, you can just buy the expansion that contains the quests. And it's pretty balanced. Just try it out, and playing alone isn't fun for me, I don't know about others.If you're a LotR fan, and you haven't play this yet, then you're missing out a lot!Go try it with one or two of your friends. MMOs are always better when you play with others~			"

												I cannot speak for the game as a truly Free To Play experience, having been a Lifetime subscriber since the beginning.  Nor can I give any inclination into the Raids or larger group play that comes at end level.What I can tell you, however, that this is a truly rich game world that can really suck you in.  The various ways to progress are immense.  Bar the Mines of Moria expansion, which I found a slog, this game has never been tedious.  The landscape is rich and varied.  I've lost count of the number of times I travelled into areas far over my level just to explore.Arguably the game has got easier over the years, with the map practically pointing you directly to the quest objective (rather than some vague area) but it does help speed your progression.  And, I guess, you can switch off the help.I do not think you could find this game as entertaining if you aimed to spend zero on it.  It would undoubtedly be more of a grind than I found Aion.  You need to purchase the quest packs.  The Epic Quest line is good, but some of the zone quest lines are equally fantastic.And, no matter how hard I try to utilise a different Starter area, I always come back to The Shire.  The tranquillity of the area is made even more beautiful when you go further and further afield.			"

												I thouht this game was very fun at first, but eventually i figured out that its really menial tasks that arent much fun and i get bored 5 minutes after turning it on. I can say it is PROBABLY fun to play with a load of your friends and go on quests but whenever i ask if anyone in my group if they want to do something they tell me to lvl up to 30... 30, come on why should i even try to go to 30 if its NO FUN GETTING THERE.......*sigh* but i cant beat the game up about thiese things too much the game i beautifully intertwined with the books and the design is very nice, theres a massive map and is very compelling to go there, but trying to jet there is full of waiting and long drawn out tasks, i mean i shouldnt be waiting to get somewhere in an ""open world game"". but to sum all this uo i think its good to play if you have a CRAP TONE of time on your hands and are good at lvl'in up it could be fun so im going to leave this up to you and keep my voting at yes.

												Firstly, I have been playing this game on and off for almost 5 years. I have spent more than 1000 hours on it and I have experienced every part of the content it has to offer. No other MMORPG had me coming back like this one did, but the fact is that the game is not so popular these days, yes, you can find lots of people to play it with, but compared to 3-4 years ago.. it is dead. I started playing again, two weeks ago, after a little break to see how the game evolved with the new content that is available right now. Endgame is really good with the new instances from Gondor, epic story is in North Ithilien, getting ready to go into Mordor which is exciting, but sadly, the game got really grindy and by grindy I do not mean grinding instances and raids which is fun, it is about gathering hundreds of flowers to exchange for armour and doing Featured Instances once per day to get recipes for essences you need to put on the slots in the armour. Daily quests exist too and they get boring after 2 weeks of doing them on a daily basis. Also, take into account that if you want to play this game to its fullest you will need to subscribe for 1 month to remove gold cap and unlock traits and bags. PVP is boring, coming from a player who is mostly looking to PVP rather than PVE. Creeps are in a good position right now and freeps just wont come to the Ettenmoors to fight, now that it is challenging. Also, everyone plays the FOTM classes which leads to the Moors being stacked with 30 creeps while the freeps are on the stairs of GV afking. As someone who plays this game, I surely recommend it to you because it has one of the best communities in the gaming world, everyone is nice and will help you. I will end this by saying that this game has the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen and it is truly a superb experience to see every location in the book and movie, to fight Mordirith, Saruman, the Nazgul, Mumaks and so on. I will forever play this, even though I cannot play it for more than two months  without a break anymore.			"

												I've been playing this game since 2008. (We're talking back when f2p wasn't even an option and Moria was the newest thing)Ever since the game went f2p I've seen so many butt hurt people complain about how it ""cost money"" to do anything...News flash, Bree, The Shire, Thorins hall, and... The Elf starter area (wow... did I really just draw a blank on that? 20 Elf characters and I can't remember it... FAIL RJ!) are all free to do every quest and deed for.Here's the trick, I once did the math and to get the amount of Terbine Points needed to get your presious upgrades wouldn't take that many run throughs.The issue? I seem to be the only one crazy enough to do this. (it also helps that due to how long I've played I know the fastest way to do this :P)[Elf/RK done. Tutorial will always take 30minutes to 1 hour no matter how you speed run it but after that if you do things fast enough, you can get the Elven Deeds done easy... of course my idea of easy and yours are likely different...Anyway, I'll just be enjoying my free upgrades while you cry babies can't figure out my ways of doing things.Play the game, if you like it enough spend the money needed for the level upgrades and such (else you'll be stuck at lv 50 as a max :P) or spend the time and rerolls it takes to get the terbine points to do so.Long story short, See you in the Moors.~ A Warg/Elven Hunter who will remain unamedP.S. First thing I'd buy with Terbine points would be character slots, you f2p players don't get as many as I did :)Yes I'm f2p but I got a few bonuses for having subscribed before I was f2p :)			"

This game has unrivalled atmosfear!I am truly impressed by this game, and for the very first time since it's release I have high hopes of raching end level tus experiencing my favourite fantasy city when they release it in an expansion: Minas Tirith!I always met the wall around level 30 before revamp; levels got slow, and the ""induction"" time, which are much less noticeable now, became unbearing.This game is now a strong 8/10; would be a dead-sure 10/10 if there was so that we could create a character on the ""dark side"" and level it up in it's own zones; PVMP doe's not really stir my interest in the way game is, but as a PvE game it surely is a gem.

												I've been playing this game since 2008. (We're talking back when f2p wasn't even an option and Moria was the newest thing)Ever since the game went f2p I've seen so many butt hurt people complain about how it ""cost money"" to do anything...News flash, Bree, The Shire, Thorins hall, and... The Elf starter area (wow... did I really just draw a blank on that? 20 Elf characters and I can't remember it... FAIL RJ!) are all free to do every quest and deed for.Here's the trick, I once did the math and to get the amount of Terbine Points needed to get your presious upgrades wouldn't take that many run throughs.The issue? I seem to be the only one crazy enough to do this. (it also helps that due to how long I've played I know the fastest way to do this :P)[Elf/RK done. Tutorial will always take 30minutes to 1 hour no matter how you speed run it but after that if you do things fast enough, you can get the Elven Deeds done easy... of course my idea of easy and yours are likely different...Anyway, I'll just be enjoying my free upgrades while you cry babies can't figure out my ways of doing things.Play the game, if you like it enough spend the money needed for the level upgrades and such (else you'll be stuck at lv 50 as a max :P) or spend the time and rerolls it takes to get the terbine points to do so.Long story short, See you in the Moors.~ A Warg/Elven Hunter who will remain unamedP.S. First thing I'd buy with Terbine points would be character slots, you f2p players don't get as many as I did :)Yes I'm f2p but I got a few bonuses for having subscribed before I was f2p :)			"

												Lord of the Rings Online, or Lotro is one of the older Mmorpgs out there. Like the name of the title suggest, this game plays out in Middle Earth where you can play as a Hobbit, Human, Dwarf or Elf. Each race has its own background story but will eventually merged in to a in my opinion Rich storyline where you help the people of middle earth and the fellowship of frodo and his companions. If you are a fan of the movies like i am then it won't take long to fully emerge your self in to this game and even learn new things about Middle Earth it self.So...? What can you expect from this game then? As for Dungeons and Raids nothing to challenging, wich in my opinion isn't all that bad, i have seen other games where they make it so damn hard people just rage quit or can't be bothered to play it after a hard day of work or school. What is new (mostly for ppl that used to play this game back in the days) is that deeds (kill for instance 200 orcs or complete 30 quests) are much more important then before and for ppl that are looking for a quick breeze through the game for max level and then hope to enjoy the end gaming this is made possible (unless you invest alot of $ in the online shop)For player activity? I Am playing on the europe server Snowborn and there is lots of people online, never had a moment where i didn't meet someone while playing.Free To Play version of the game. You may or may not ask you self, Is it playable with out spending a Dollar. The answer is NO. Some of the expansions aren't free, and if you're not in the mood to grind deeds with multiple character you miss out on a lot of coin that is needed to unlock many things in the online shop. Ultimately whether or not you choose to play this game is up to you. Like i said above, It maybe free but you gone spend money in the end anyway, that is if you want to see and be able to do everything this game has to offer. Other then the financial aspect its still on of the better online games out there and i'm sure with the release on steam the game will get a boost in player numbers, so in the end i give it a YES on recommendations even with cash you most likely gonna have to spend.

												Lord of the Rings Online is definitely an MMO game where the journey is far more important than the end goal. If your focus is on levelling as quickly as possible, skipping the quest lore, you're missing out on a great deal in this game. Although you can take shortcuts with money, you can earn TP through time and effort in-game to buy things from the store, such as new areas. The game definitely rewards having multiple characters, and the variety of the playstyles of the different classes makes each interesting to play. The most important part for me, however, has to be the setting of the game. I was genuinely excited to explore this amazing world, and it really brought the world from Tolkein's books alive for me. There was a sense of wonder and awe as soon as I begun in Ered Luin, and it hasn't diminished for me, even after many hundreds of hours in Middle Earth.			"

												First off, this game is great, for both Tolkien fans and people who haven't even seen the movies. This game has everything it needs to be a great MMO. Here are some more details with pros and cons:So the best part of this game is easily the story, I play for the stories. The Epic Quests are generally the best, but there are some really cool side quest lines too which are fun to play along. It's also cool to have Monster Play, to be able to conquer outposts and hunt down Free Players is quite satisfying. The classes, at least from what I've seen, are all unique and fun to play, each in their own way, which is cool too. Here's some stuff to keep in mind though.THIS GAME ISN'T TOTALLY FREE. Or at least, if you want to play totally free, it's going to take a TON of effort and a lot of hunting random creatures to fulfill deeds to get LOTRO Points. But there comes a point, after you've finished playing through the Lone Lands and you've played along the Epic Quest series in the North Downs, that you have to buy Evendim to continue the epic story line, which is usually something like 700 LOTRO points, and by that time I had raked up about 600, and there was, luckily a sale going on. But, I'm trying to make the point that in order to continue playing the game you are going to need a lot of LOTRO Points. Aside from that, other cons include the fact that Middle-Earth is too stinking massive and unless you use LOTRO Points to buy yourself a horse, you have to run everywhere, at least until you've discovered all the stablemasters. So that can be pretty boring.But in the end, I still find this game enormously entertaining, You can make it all the way to Level 40 without even needing to worry about buying another region if you follow all the side quests. The story is cool, engaging and original, staying true to Lord of the Rings Canon, while building off of ALL the loose ends that Tolkien left out there to create really cool stories. So yes, I highly recommend this game.			"

												Firstly, I have been playing this game on and off for almost 5 years. I have spent more than 1000 hours on it and I have experienced every part of the content it has to offer. No other MMORPG had me coming back like this one did, but the fact is that the game is not so popular these days, yes, you can find lots of people to play it with, but compared to 3-4 years ago.. it is dead. I started playing again, two weeks ago, after a little break to see how the game evolved with the new content that is available right now. Endgame is really good with the new instances from Gondor, epic story is in North Ithilien, getting ready to go into Mordor which is exciting, but sadly, the game got really grindy and by grindy I do not mean grinding instances and raids which is fun, it is about gathering hundreds of flowers to exchange for armour and doing Featured Instances once per day to get recipes for essences you need to put on the slots in the armour. Daily quests exist too and they get boring after 2 weeks of doing them on a daily basis. Also, take into account that if you want to play this game to its fullest you will need to subscribe for 1 month to remove gold cap and unlock traits and bags. PVP is boring, coming from a player who is mostly looking to PVP rather than PVE. Creeps are in a good position right now and freeps just wont come to the Ettenmoors to fight, now that it is challenging. Also, everyone plays the FOTM classes which leads to the Moors being stacked with 30 creeps while the freeps are on the stairs of GV afking. As someone who plays this game, I surely recommend it to you because it has one of the best communities in the gaming world, everyone is nice and will help you. I will end this by saying that this game has the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen and it is truly a superb experience to see every location in the book and movie, to fight Mordirith, Saruman, the Nazgul, Mumaks and so on. I will forever play this, even though I cannot play it for more than two months  without a break anymore.			"

												It has tab target hotkey combat which I have grown to hate, and I'm getting a bit sick of Fantasy games, but this game was made by people who love and respect the original books. The material the game is based on was written by a well-respected literature professor, and this shines through in the setting and different areas when compared to similar games; I think the Shire is probably the most relaxing place I've ever been to in an MMO. The story missions and dungeons were very immersive and were set cleverly alongside the storyline of the books. I had lots of fun and met some very cool people. It's had player housing for a long time, which most other games strangely didn't seem to pick up on until recently. Graphics are starting to look pretty dated by today's standards, and from what I've seen of the free model it probably makes more sense to just subscribe if you're going to put a lot of hours in (the bulk of the time I played was before f2p and being available on Steam). But still worth a look in my opinion.			"

												Once one of the mightiest MMO game has been stabbed with the Morgul blade and is now slowly turning into shadows. F2P model turned the game into nothing more than endless cosmetic item fest and since the launch of F2P, there hasn't been any good expansion packs either. More and more quest lines are being dumbed down and future of the game is just to be another WoW clone, without proper budget ofc. I remember when Lotro developers said that revenue doubled with F2P model, well where does that show? In absolutely nothing, game is developed and maintained with minimum effort and smallest resources to make more cash. Perhaps it's time to give the license away to a team that loves LoTR or perhaps it's time for Turbine to get its act together and do something else with it than cash in with easiest possible way. And at the moment, im not so impressed with future plans of Lotro.			"

This game initally is very good but rapidly it becomes quite annoying because you need to buy the DLC to continue the story line, any ""Help"" the game offers is piece meal and there little if any voice acting and its not so much as a Lord of the Rings MMORPG as a Lord of the Rings take on World of Warcraft.I love Lord of the Rings I really do. This I hate. And it gets better, now they add little helpful hints that (if you read between the lines) say ""HAHA Screw you, you wont be able to advance the story cause....PAYWALL!!!"" And they are not very subtle in the fact that they screw you over. They are in essence operating on the basis that there game is SO GOOD that every one would want to pay for the DLC. HAHA...no. The next time I start to feel a little masocistic I will play this game.			"

												Honestly, it's not particularly worth your time. From the get go, the game lets you know that you're not really going to go too far if you're not spending money. While it's free to play, the free content is straight up limited, and the paid content is all over the place. It's practically a demo, giving you some extremely boring areas to explore and quest in, and teasing you with the paid content. This would be all well and good, but the paid content is also lackluster. To get the full experience, you have to both subscribe, and deal with a metric tonne of microtransactions. And if that's not all, the gameplay somehow manages to be more boring than World of Warcraft's.			"

The Lord of the GrindsThis game looks good for an MMO, has great music and a great vibe overall. The players I encountered were very helpful and open to collaborate.BUT... it takes forever to walk from quest to quest, and it is a grind to level up. For example you have to kill 50 beasts of one specie to get a Turbine Point. And with a couple of Turbine Points you can buy inventory slots, or a mount. But it takes so long it doesnt feel rewarding. Or you can pay obviously, but the Turbine Points are overprices imho.Also in a later stage of the game you can't do certain quest because they are locked, and you have to open them by paying, otherwise you can't advance in level. So it's free-to-play to a certain amount, but not forever.			"

												While this game is incredibly fun and addicting, there's just not enough people that play. As an avid LOTR fan, I love the game, but to me, it's lagging behind all the other games. This game, in short, has a very small community; you can't even find a dungeon unless you wait a half hour or more. I do, however, like the story aspect to it, as it follows the storyline as the books tell it and not how the movies tell it. It does not have all the features as the leading MMORPGs do, but it could definitely be a competitor if there was more time and effort put into advertising the game. Even if it doesn't have a ton of features compared to other MMORPGs, it is free to play, with the option of paying for expansions in-game. The free-to-play aspect is rarely seen in today's gaming world, but it is also very restricted. This game has a great potential and there is an immense amount of people who love the LOTR franchise as well as the related Hobbit franchise.Like I said earlier, this game is very addicting and has potential, but I'm not going to recommend it. My recommendation for if you want to find a good MMORPG is to look somewhere else. Yes, I'm going to say it; look towards World of Warcraft. It is much more addicting and has a much bigger community base than LOTRO. Also, Elder Scrolls Online has just been released for the PC and will soon be released for the PS4 and Xbox One. ESO has a lot of potential and should definitely be considered. Your opinion on LOTRO may be different from mine, so download it for FREE and give it a try.			"

												Once one of the mightiest MMO game has been stabbed with the Morgul blade and is now slowly turning into shadows. F2P model turned the game into nothing more than endless cosmetic item fest and since the launch of F2P, there hasn't been any good expansion packs either. More and more quest lines are being dumbed down and future of the game is just to be another WoW clone, without proper budget ofc. I remember when Lotro developers said that revenue doubled with F2P model, well where does that show? In absolutely nothing, game is developed and maintained with minimum effort and smallest resources to make more cash. Perhaps it's time to give the license away to a team that loves LoTR or perhaps it's time for Turbine to get its act together and do something else with it than cash in with easiest possible way. And at the moment, im not so impressed with future plans of Lotro.			"

Still, there's a lot to do in Lotro and there's a nice selection of races and classes to play with. The world is huge even for those who go purely F2P.

												I used to play this game A LOT (back in Shadow of Angmar days) and I witnessed the switch to F2P, which slowly started killing the game. Recently I installed it again just to check up on it and some friends I used to play with. The experience was rather traumatic. My kin (in the past one of the bigger kins on Eldar: Lorebreakers) merely a shadow of its former glory. People say it's difficult to get a party of 6 to do an instance (let alone the buggy raids). Turbine Points required wherever you go and click. Turbine and WB finally succeeded in butchering a great game it used to be. Such a shame.			"

												This game is a shell of it's former self. It was once great, even better before free to play, or so I've heard. The quest packs and expansions were completely understandable, as they have to make money somehow. They screwed it all over though. They want you to pay for everything.I started hating it when it recently tried to copy everything WoW did. They completely rebuilt the game. I loved it, absolutely loved it. Why did they ruin it, you ask? They wanted more money. MORE money. They figured if they changed everything and made it like WoW that people would come over and play it. Who thinks that? People like new things, not old, recycled gameplay and mechanics. Worst of all, you can just buy your way through the game. Why must companies insist on doing this crap?Just like WoW, this game is going to kill itself. Don't play it. It was much better before they screwed all the people who played it before. This game was awesome, but not anymore.			"

												While it says I have 7 minutes on Steam, I played at least 500 hours of this game before it was here. The reason that I have not restarted playing it is because seeing the game again was to much nostalgia for me to handle.Lord of the Rings Online is probably one of the best RPGs out there, even though it doesn't have a massive playerbase like some other ones. The community is very friendly, and this is especially important when you have the ability to create and join Fellowships and Kinships. The combat is simple enough to understand easily, yet advanced enough to not get boring after playing for as long as I have. The landscape of the many lands you can visit is very well made, with amazing mountains, valleys, and of course, plenty of enemy buildings to raid. The enemies are fun to fight, especially if you find a randomly generated boss wandering the wilderness. This game also has great economy, with ways to earn large volumes of money at low and high level areas. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone looking for a good RPG -- I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.			"

												I, unfortunately, can not recommend LOTRO.  I really want to, but can't.  It's lots of fun, don't get me wrong, especially when played with a few friends.  But the hamhanded attempts to wring money out of the game by Turbine will be kicking the back of your seat the whole way.Look, I understand that a Free to Play game still has to make some money for upkeep costs and whatnot, but NOT BEING ABLE TO REACH THE ORIGINAL LEVEL CAP FROM 7 YEARS AGO IS A SLAP IN THE FACE.If you end up playing you will find out you can reach level 35-40, depending on how much grind you do.  The original level cap was 50.Again, I'm not saying that they should give away the expansions, thats what makes all the long term money, but not letting players reach the original base level cap, and without telling them in advance, is honestly a terrible thing to do.It has has left a bad taste in my mouth that will likely be my last inpression of this once fun game.I guess if I had to sum this up it would be...Fun, but don't let the ""Free to Play"" tagline fool you.  In order to play more than 1/3rd of the game you have to sink close to 70 bucks into it for expansion and quest packs.			"

												Nice game, potraying LOTR lore, however the leveling is often boring, and as F2P the game becomes unplayable around level 30.Having said that, I know several friends who have subscribed to the game, and really enjoy it - my advice is, go for it if you don't mind the fees, if you are looking for a F2P, dont touch it.P.S. Yes, I am aware of the deeds and that they were recently made ""easier"" to achieve and thus purchase more content, but its still an icerdible boring grind and is unsustainable, especially as players need to buy a LOT of content in addition to quests, such as mount and increased wealth cap - which makes it better than swtor somewhat, but it will still give you only about 5-6 zones with minimal changes should you play different race/character later on.

												Has gone WAY downhill in recent months. Was  sorta tolerant of their pay 4 content structure since I LOVED the series and the epic storyline so much. It was also still fun to play so it wasn't all bad. However, they released the Helms Deep update. It was an utter disaster. The classes were entirely revamped and pretty much all utility was stripped away. Before you could have some mixed skills and do well. Now though, you are made to play exactly how Turbine WANTS you to play. There is no balanced classes or multi-tasking. If  you tank, your DPS was so far in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you needed a dps with you to take down the enemy. If you were DPS of any kind, you had zero defensive skills and would die almost immediately. If you're a healer, you better find a group and stick with it because your DPS AND defense will leave you bleeding and dead. This would have been acceptable, if Turbine's response to the consumer's want to roll back the disasterous update was not just a general ""♥♥♥♥ you""			"

I have a year subscription to the game hoping they would finally fix the problems with the collasped servers and installed new equipment.

												I whole-heartedly reccomend this game. I've played it for years and years, and I have never disliked it one bit. This game is a part of me. Oozing with LoTR vibe, great story, decent combat. There are a few paywalls though.kys			"

												Been bad for about five years. This new raid will have it go from either Bad (its current state) to aweful or mediocre. This is the game you'd want to have played 8 years ago, but now, there are much better options in mmorpgs. I am playing this game because I am one of the original players from 2007. Until I find a new mmorpg, I'll stay here, but I do not recommend people buying this game at this point in time. I already bought it, so I might as well play it.			"

												Well...where do i begin...lets see...#1 Graphics are terrible even after downloading the ""HD textures pack"" #2 The game is glitchy as ♥♥♥♥ press 1 button and the game shuts down or gives you black screen and you have to restart your computer #3 The camera controls are terrible #4 The combat is easy as hell and is not involveing and any way you click on an enemy and wait for a while and...BAM you win.2/10 worth uninstalling			"

												This was a very nice game before the changes happened. It's still fairly good if you love the Lord of the Rings series, world, story etc. It has nice quests with a good story behind it, but many people don't even read it. So that's sad imo. It wasn't challenging enough for me, hence why I stopped playing this. Like alot of other MMOs, this USED to be good.			"

												HI all, seriasly  THIS IS NOT A FREE2PLAY because you need  2 get a serialkey to play it.the registration for new accounts ire done throught turbines site and to register a new player account they say : you need to have a serial key to be able to register new account.So its only free2play for those who already have an axtive account and you can´t login with your steam account username and password.So NO! it is NOT free2play as they don´t send you a free serial key for game and you cannot register account without a serial key.All remember this.Codemasters ""suck"" They take absolutely no responsibility for anything,  Turbine also sucks same thing there, and Warner bros should keep there hands off any product they haven´t accualy made themselves.And STEAM...WTF!   free2play lotro and then you need to accualy buy the game to be able to login ? and steam isnt even selling it :D   so   STEAM can take a sniff at the darkest area on my g♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ while I fart.STEAM DOES NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANYTHING  AND EVERYONE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT :			"

												I'm torn on writing this review. On one hand, it's Lord of the Rings and seeing a hobbit trying to play a guitar solo on a harp using the in-game ability to play music is hilarious. On the other hand, it's excessively pay-to-do anything unless you're willing to fork over $15/month, has very little player-player interaction for a mmorpg, and only continues to be engaging because of the large number of areas to explore while leveling up. LOTRO, in my opinion, has more existing features to promote player-player interaction than maybe even WoW. However, it doesn't really have the player base that would use such features. Skirmishing (a.k.a. raiding) is almost impossible to find a group for outside of a kinsmanship (clan). If you like LOTR alot and enjoy the individual explorer feel that modern mmorpg's have become, you'll probably enjoy this game. If you want a mmorpg with an endgame, I just don't see it here.			"

												If you're a LOTR fan, it's a great way to spend your spare time.  You will spend a LOT of time walking and grinding fetch-quests and the community is less than stellar on most servers.  I recommend the roleplay servers if you're willing to be lore-friendly.  But it's regularly updated and people still play it.  So give it a shot.			"
