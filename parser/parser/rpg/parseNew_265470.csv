												To be honest, I was really mulling about whether or not I wanted to recommend this or not. It's not a game I hate, but it's not one I love in comparison to Anodyne. But the more I ruminate on it the more the game feels like it's missing a certain spark to it.Even the Ocean is a game that has a lot of good ideas but ends up coming short in quite a lot of ways. The story ends up feeling hollow due to how much ground it attempts to cover without much depth. The gameplay feels tight and responsive; but rather than feeling like you're constantly growing as a player it feels like an eternal tutorial that never ends until the game itself ends. It follows the 'rule of three' almost obsessively, making the game feel predictable as you bounce from one objective to another without adding much to the main plot outside of the snippets you get once you complete a series.That said, graphically and musically the game is excellent. There's a strong surrealistic vibe to the whole game that really creates a unique atmosphere and overall I did have fun. Just not enough to really offset some of points that soured the experience.

												An incredibly tender and charming story-based platformer built on a unique health system of managing your light and dark energy. After making it through a slightly sluggish tutorial level and underwhelming first stage, I soon found myself falling in love with Even the Ocean.While the game has some truly engaging platforming (especially towards the latter parts of the game), Even the Ocean really shines with its thoughtful story and fulfilling NPC interactions. Tying in themes of identity, race, gender, environmentalism and political corruption (just to name a few), the game was a welcome experience while processing the results of the recent 2016 presidential election.The art direction and sound design is also a high point, putting Even the Ocean on my short list of favorite gentle and atmospheric platformers, right alongside Knytt Underground.I'd fully recommend this game to anyone who enjoys exploration based platformers that are heavy on atmosphere, or to anyone who is looking to get deep with a thoughtful and inclusive narrative.<3			"

 New Surreal Platformer from the creators of Anodyne	From the creators of Anodyne, comes another surreal adventure. Taking a few criticisms from the first game, this one has a simpler less vague story. Instead of being a Zelda like, it is now a 2D platformer featuring a really cool mechanic of balancing your light and dark energy. Pros:Fun platformingLight and dark mechanicInteresting characters and dialogueCool graphic novel style cut scenes and backgroundsAmazing accessibility options for all skill levelsNeutralStory is more obviousConA lot of tutorials

												Even the Ocean is an outstanding narrative and platformer with clever puzzles, believable personalities, and quite a long adventure.* Edit: Probably worth mentioning: It's of a rare breed of game that can stand on its own merits as a story-driven puzzle-platformer, that also has a message to deliver about society; an existence proof that we can have both, breaking down a dichotomy I've seen many people percieve between compelling gameplay and artistic expression in modern games.I've been looking forward to (and following the development of) this game since I played Sean and Joni's previous game Anodyne, which itself had a wealth of imaginative worlds to explore, each with unique puzzles and atmospheres. Suffice to say, I wasn't disappointed to find the same wealth of content, crafted with at least as much care and skill as was used in Anodyne. These two clearly know what they're doing when it comes to game design and development.The art in this game is breathtaking. The character sprites have a 16-bit-era style to them, but the environments are outright painterly, and Joni's done a fantastic job on both. The beautiful, flowing appearance of the outside worlds contrasts with the comparitively rigid look of the power plant levels, which plays well into the theme of the imbalance between nature and machine. And fans of the SNES Final Fantasy 6 overworld aesthetic will like that of of this game's overworld as well - shoutouts to Mode7!And just like Anodyne's, Sean has composed yet another fantastic soundtrack for Even the Ocean. The songs are very chill, and they all enhance the atmosphere of their respective levels. I'm particularly fond of the bit with the synth solo in the forest library power plant level in act 3. You'll know what I'm talking about.The core movement ""feels"" good, which is of course crucial to platforming games. The game's horizontal/vertical energy mechanic can be used to creatively solve or work around many of the puzzles in different ways, as well as simply providing options for how to navigate the levels, leaving the player a lot of agency to play the game in their own style. An extreme imbalance of power can be used to do things more quickly or sidestep certain obstacles, at the expense of a higher risk of getting hurt, and having to dial things back when the situation demands it.Without spoiling anything, I will say that the gameplay, environments, and story themes complement one another well.Both the main and minor characters shine in having a diversity of personalities, opinions, backgrounds, ethnicities, genders, sexualities, and so on - and none of it feels shoehorned, gimmicky, or token. By all rights, this game aught to be the gold standard for what inclusivity should look like in a game. The major characters are never bucketed into a naïve ""good"" and ""evil""; they're all clearly portrayed as imperfect people from different backgrounds trying to do their best in the face of disastrous circumstances, playing different parts in a flawed power structure. Even many of the minor NPCs scattered throughout the pre-powerplant areas seem to have some thought and backstory put into them, and aren't just braindead conduits for saying ""Hey, have you heard about the next important plot point?"" like the NPCs you'd find in older RPG-type games.There's enough content that casual playthrough is likely to last even a seasoned platformer player upwards of 6 hours; the average player probably closer to 8. And this is all varied, meaningful content, mind you - nothing feels artificially drawn out or disrespectful of your valuable time as a player. Each level introduces a new element or combination of elements that has you learning how to deal with a new type of puzzle or movement technique, and each comes with a new atmosphere built by the aforementioned artwork and music.I presently hold the record any% completion time for Anodyne, so naturally I gave this a go as a speedgame as well. During the beta, I got my speedrun time down to 2.5 hours or so. The developers have even provided some speedrunning options for skipping things like cutscenes and dialog automatically (which I absolutely would *not* recommend for your first playthrough, of course), which are greatly appreciated. Years ago, very early on in the game's development cycle, the developers themselves reached out to the speedrunning community to ask what kind of things would be helpful and kept those things in mind from the beginning - and even during the beta, they continued to add and tweak things in response to feedback to make the speedrunning experience more pleasant. This kind of dedication to even the niche parts of the player base should not be ignored!(A note for the dozens of us that use Linux: There's sadly no official support for it at this point, but it worked perfectly on WINE for me when I tried it.)★★★★★ It's a mastapeece.

												Short, sweet, and filled with humanity. If Anodyne was their take on Link's Awakening, then Even the Ocean is carries the spirit of Terranigma and Soul Blazer. Joni and Sean have made something that reflects a diverse set of human experiences and weaved them into a concise story about the cycles of the natural world and our role in its balance. Best of all, it works alongside platforming mechanics that have you constantly balancing two energies within yourself to shift how you move, which comes to a head in the finale, providing a subtle complement to the story's climax. The struggle to balance the energies (which lean you towards vertical and horizontal movement) does make some challenges a bit more fussy than if they took an approach similar to ,say, Outland, but it works well with the themes of the story and for the most part the challenges are constructed well enough that those moments are easy to overlook. A similar sentiment can applied to the writing as well, with certain lines or characters not quite making their mark, taking away from the intended impact. It wraps up in a bit of hurry as well, and it gets a bit too explicit about its philosophy after the climax. Still, these are small problems in a game that works its themes well and delivers them with great humanity.You'll definitely want more by the time the credits wrap up, as it feels like you've just begun to get to know both the world and mechanics of the game as it ends. It never outstays its welcome, however, and I'd rather have a story that feels appropriate in length, leaving me wanting more, than the opposite. Even the Ocean also has a myriad of accessiblity and speedrun options, as well as the ability to play exclusively the story or challenges, all available from the start. So even if one part of the game appeals more to you than the other, it's still easy to recommend.			"

												Sometimes a little on the nose, Even the Ocean straddles the line between thoughtful and preachy, heartwarming and cheesy. The puzzle-platforming design is often simple, but it's also a refreshing take in a world still dominated by physics puzzles. It has a beautiful score, and crisp, original art that complement each other really well.Superlatives aside, I think this game is genuine in a way not typically seen in the medium (at least not in a more traditional genre like a platformer), and I'd recommend giving it some attention.

												An extremely fully featured platformer with an intriguing story and unique energy mechanic. I love this game - I got really sucked in, and could hardly stop playing until I finished it. Similar to Anodyne, this studio's first effort, there's a HUGE amount of post-game content, in varying degrees of polish. But it's totally worth the price - the main game took me ~6-7 hours on its own, and the post-game could easily take that again by the look of it.The art is worth special mention - lush, gorgeous painted backgrounds that are completlely unique area to area. It's a gorgeous game, and the love that went into it shows on every screen. I would recommend this to anyone  - and there's a speedrun mode for those of you who want to hone your skills.YOU WILL ENJOY THIS GAME!!			"

Of note is that the game allows you to skip all story sections or all gameplay sections if you're not interested in either half and has a lot of options to make gameplay easier, although I never touched any of it until the postgame dev commentary areas.

												I've been eagerly awaiting ETO since playing Anodyne a couple of years ago.  I've even been following the soundtrack through the Dev's Soundcloud page.  So for starters the soundtrack to ETO is fantastic, and it alone is worth the price of admission.  As with Anodyne, the story of ETO is touching and compelling, though the dialogue in ETO is a bit ... homogenous at times, which is maybe not a fair criticism for a two-person dev team.  And that didn't really detract from the impact of the story as a whole; like Anodyne, ETO connected with me on a near-spiritual level, and while many indie games try to connect in that way, both ETO and Anodyne have had an effect on me that I'm simply grateful to have experienced.I'll admit that the gameplay leaves a bit to be desired.  The controls are solid and the light-dark mechanic is a ton of fun, but only a couple of puzzles depended on really pushing the meter to extreme dark or light points.  Maybe some more of that would have added more challenge and excitement to the game.  I should piont out the notable presence of speedrun-focused options right in the game menu, but not being a speedrunner I found the challenge lacking a bit, and I felt that too much of the early game seemed like training on the basic rules of the puzzles.  In my opinion, the deeper challenges of the late game could have lasted a bit longer and gotten a bit more challenging.Overall, Even The Ocean is a wonderful experience, and I'm looking forward to further work from these Devs.			"

												It's good, and the worst way to describe it is: Owlboy + IkarugaThe best way to describe it would be: ""Mwah"" *chef kiss-The puzzles never really slow down the pacing of the game.-It's like a gentle breeze where the puzzles are intuitive and the mechanics for solving them are smooth while still requiring a fair amount of dexterity. Probably its biggest plus in the face of other puzzle platformers.-The story itself is more interesting than its premise leads on, focusing on breaking down the idealism you usually see in games. The portraits are especially unassailable in this regard.-Setting is like if FF7 was good.			"

												Even the Ocean is a game that really gripped me from the beginning. The story is exactly what I admire in works of art, offering up a relevent and interesting view of the world that will stay with me.The gameplay is really solid but it starts too easy and only towards the end was it starting to feel like it was reaching it's potential. I would love more, harder levels as it is such a joy to control. The mechanics are so solid I couldn't help but imagine so many more possibilities for it!.So to bring that together, great, meaningfull story with fun, solid gameplay mechanics but a little too easy and I am left craving more!I'd like to say thank you very much to the creators for the beautiful experience and I look forward to their future projects!

Even the Ocean is a platforming puzzle game with a heavy focus on narrative. The core mechanic of the game is fresh and innovative, changing the health bar into an energy balancing system that changes how the player moves through the game (which makes speed-running very interesting). This offers a risk-reward style of playing, that allows players to manipulate the difficulty of the game naturally, rather than using an ""easy"", ""medium"", or ""hard"" configuration.Though, honestly one of the best things about Even the Ocean is its world. Diversity is portrayed in just about every faucet in the game's world, and it never calls attention to itself. Diversity isn't a ""feature"" of the game, instead it's embedded into the narrative and the characters, never feeling forced, but instead building a better and believable world. On top of that, there is an astonishing array of configurations that players can make to change how the game plays to be more accessible to people with handicaps or just prefer different play styles.Even the Ocean is a shining example of how we should be treating diversity and accessibility in gamesAnd I mean that, honestly. Best of all - the game is actually fun too. I recommend this game for players that enjoy interesting stories and worlds, but also like a bit of challenge and exploration.Review by: AffinityChris Note: I recieved this copy for free to assist in the beta testing. It was not given for review purposes, but I felt the game deserved it none the less.Edit: Typo fix "

Note: I was granted a key in return for playtesting on YouTube.Even the Ocean is a unique Indie game.  While the tags call it an RPG, it isn't your typical ""gather items & weapons"".  Even the Ocean is a story -- one with deep personal motivations, and complex character relationships.  The platforming aspect is a welcome break from reading the text, and isn't terribly difficult, though provides a decent challenge.This is the kind of game you'll want to play if you are in the mood to hear a story, rather than simply hack & slash mindlessly.Pros:+ Superbly responsive controls for platforming+ Unique Light & Dark Energy system, which allows you to cusomize your characters speed/vertical jump to suit different areas.+ Freqent save points & forgiving deaths remove any frustration on those scores.+ Unique artwork: Pixelated characters are very cute + hand painted backgrounds provide a smoothness to the world.+ Rich and engaging storyline.  Neutral:~ Very high ratio of female characters in the story -- very unlike most games these days.  Provides a different perspective on the society in the game.Cons:- Some of the keybinds are weird, but you do get used to them.  (e.g. ""Enter"" to bring up the menu, instead of Esc).I would like to state, very specifically, that I am not generally drawn to ""visual novels""... but Even the Ocean has engaging text, is quick to read, and the story is very interesting -- I truly am extremely curious about what will happen next!  It's the driving force which brings me back again and again to this game.Recommended!  If you want to see more about the game, please check out my Let's Play series here:

												I'm a big fan of anodyne, and I've been looking forward to this game for a while. This game has gotten a criminally small amount of coverage by the games media, so I'll try to be as detailed as I can without spoiling anything.Mechanically, this game is incredibly sound. Movement feels good, and the health system is incredibly smart and unique. From memory, there's somewhere around 10 main dungeons and a handful of mini dungeons.  Each introduces and revolves around a specific mechanic, whether it be blocks that move when you stand on them, bounce pads, lasers, etc. Not all of these are home runs, but none of them are duds, and a bunch of them are really cool. I don’t want to spoil anything. This game is pretty easy. I was hoping the difficulty and complexity would ramp up late in the game, but it never really does. Although some mechanics are used in tandem later in the game, a lot of the mechanics end up getting abandoned after a single dungeon. This leads to fairly simple solutions. On the flip side, there's something to be said for not getting stuck on puzzles. The game is very relaxing.Sean put together a really good soundtrack; I can't say I remember any of the tunes particularly well, but it was very atmospheric and fits the game. As far as visuals are concerned, I found the character designs to be a little bland, but the landscapes and creatures are really fantastic.Narratively... The game is flawed. What I loved about anodyne is that I played it, and I didn't understand anything that was going on. You get thrown into this horrifying and schizophrenic world with a very barebones plot. You spend the whole game mulling over what message they are trying to give you, or if they even have a message at all. With Even the Ocean, I know exactly what they're trying to say, but I wish I didn't. The narrative doesn't really have a focus, and instead jumps from subject to subject. Is it about gender? Class divides? Nature versus industry? Feelings of worthlessness? The futility of life? Covering a lot of topics isn’t necessarily bad, but characters have long conversations with each other about random subjects, using dialogue that's just not believable. It breaks the cardinal rule of showing instead of telling, and it over explains things that could easily inferred through tighter dialogue. There’s a fantastic moment where one character is comforting another character, with some really nice artwork, but then an emotionless and highly articulated conversation starts up immediately after. Not all of the dialogue is bad, in fact a lot of it is very good, but when the subject matter is serious it reads more like an essay than a person speaking.On the other hand, there’s a lot of meat on the bone. I just wrote this big chunk of text about the story, so it’s doing something right. This game and games like it are auteur works, you get a very specific experience that you can’t get anywhere else. The core plot and world building is really solid too. Plus, if the find that the story’s not your speed, you can always just play the dungeon only mode.If you have a puzzle platformer itch, I definitely recommend picking this up! "

The Light and Dark side Mechanics are original and bring add a lot to the puzzles in the game. Personally I believe that the World Mad is not needed and while playing I couldn't help but wish these developers had created a Final Fantasy Like RPG. I do recommend this game but I would not Purchase the game at the 15$ price tag. On a steam sale i Would quickly get this game!Video Review:

												I’ve never played a game twice in a row before.Even the Ocean is thoughtful, sensitive, meditativeIt’s about power plants. Or is it giant monsters? Or friendship. Or ecology. Or art. It’s a grower: the more I think about it (and replay it), the more I like it.It has beautiful art and music, full characters, melancholy, a sense of foreboding, as if the world itself is holding its breath. This is a hard atmosphere to build convincingly, and the devs have done it. The loneliness and uncertainty the characters feel about their personal lives is manifest in the world they see around them.The devs recognize that a game is a collage. The elements are visible individually if you want to focus on them — writing, music, visuals, and gameplay are all great — and yet the world they create is something else, something ethereal.Sometimes it feels like a playThemes emerge as we walk through scene after scene as an outsider. We eavesdrop, like a giant looking in the windows of an apartment building one by one. Sometimes the game interprets itself. We talk to a painter who first embraces the wind-blown dirt landing on his canvas, only to then complain about it ruining his brushes. We see friends fight and make up. A prophetic stranger is thrown in jail as a scapegoat. Characters ask how joy is possible in the midst of tragedy. They notice that we only find ourselves asking questions like that after a moment of joy is over.Like Anodyne, it can be very funnyI laughed out loud at whimsical comments from NPCs, a character’s bizarre robotic detachment, or even the art itself, such as the Freudian appearance of the inside of a giant starfish (my interpretation was confirmed when it asked me to help “clear its blockages”).You’ll love it if...Even the Ocean is for anyone looking for a gentle platformer with a rich story that weaves together nature, power, exploitation, and relationships.

												I played their first game, Anodyne, a number of years ago. It's one of my very favorite games: a weird homage to Link's Awakening, a beautiful game about a person in a surrealistic dimension.Even the Ocean bears little similiarity to that game. Its strongest aspect is its reality. It feels very real. The people, and the places. The world--unbelievable in the way 16 bit videogames often were--nevertheless feels authentic. And the story it puts them through...yeah.It plays like a puzzle platformer, though none of the puzzles are particularly challenging. This is good. It uses what I'd consider an unconventional button layout (A/x to cancel, B/c to confirm on controller/keyboard, respectively) which I think is nice, too. I never got completely used to it, and that might be the point.But yeah. The puzzles aren't hard. Most of them have a lot of solutions. It's kind of reminsicent of old-school Sonic the Hedgehog levels, where there's a bunch of paths and none of them are particularly better than the others. They're just different.Even the Ocean doesn't get super difficult, but it's engaging enough in its challenge, and the story's strong enough to keep you playing regardless. And if it does, there's plenty of accessibility options, including one to remove all the puzzles (or all the plot, if you're heartless). It feels like the devs care about you, which is a nice feeling.I quite loved it, in short. If you like the odd atmospheric puzzle platformer, give it a shot. You'll probably have fun.			"

												Charming puzzle platformer. It tells the story of a woman named Aliph who who fixes the power plants that power a city. Some weird environmental stuff starts going on and she has to fix power plants and eventually battle creatures who attack her city. The platforming is really well done. There's an energy balancing element to it. You have an energy bar that goes between green and purple, one type of energy makes you run faster and one makes you jump higher. But if you max out on either type, you die. The levels are really well designed, and often quite challenging.  New mechanics are introduced regularly and mastering them is fun.Story-wise, it's good, but does get a little preachy.			"

This very solidly held my attention and kept me coming back for the time it took to beat (about 9 hours).			"

												This is a really nice puzzle plattzformer with engaging story. Everything is centered around the one mechanic of balance, yes even the story. The OST feels familiar and strange but also very soothing.By the creators of Anodyne this is another must have.			"

												Even the Ocean is a game for those that love the narrative above all else.  It's very heavily story driven with a wide range of characters and interesting plot to drive the experience.  The platforming is good as well, and the horizontal/vertical shift mechanic is novel and fun to play with.  My biggest problem with this game is it was just too easy.  Most of the beginning of the game felt very slow.  The puzzles weren't particularly challenging and you don't have to worry much about dying until maybe the last 20% of the game.  If you're looking for a slow, easy, relaxing game this is perfect for you.  If you love story driven games, this is for you.  If you want fast paced excitement, look elsewhere.

			Today, we explore a power plant in a strange world. Game: http://store.steampowered.com/app/265470/ ------------------------------------------------------------------- Media Stuff...		

 Very lovely looking, well written game. Everything about this game is skillfully made. I enjoyed the platforming, balancing your energy instead of just killing things, and working your way though areas. Sometimes there are small puzzles not to do with platforming, which mixes the game up a bit. The graphics and music are so skill fully done - cut scenes and lovely story to guide you. A very polished, nice game to play.			"

												I have a love/hate relationship with Even the Ocean. Loving the developers last game, Anodyne, I was expecting something with the same style. While you can clearly tell these two games share the same authors, they don't seem to share the same level designer (even though they actually do).This game and Anodyne is vastly diffrent in all areas but two. If you loved the story in Anodyne you'll love the story here too, it has a lot of interesting and unique things going on. They also share a similar end game (minus the collection stuff, which Even the Ocean does not have). Other than the writing, you wouldn't be able to tell these two games were made by the same developer.Now why do I have a love/hate releationship with this game (while hate might be a strong word). Here's a list:* I love it because of the story but I hate it for it's pacing problems.* I love it's dark/light mechanics but I hate that it isn't really used outside speedrunning.* I love the overall gameplay but I hate that it's way too easy until the very end.* I love the big overworld and the exploration but I hate that it practically holds no secrets.* I love all the world-building fluff content but I hate that it really has no gameplay significance.* I love the clever level-design that teaches you things by gradually making things harder but I hate that most mechanics are tossed away never to be seen again after just a short stage.* I love it as a speedrunner but I hate it as an explorer.And now for a regular pros and cons list:Pros:* Great but short story with intresting characters. Lovely setting and interesting world.* Wonderful art. The character portrait might not be for everyone though but I love them.* Great music. Really fit's the game and gives atmosphere.* Good and interesting mechanics. Each level brings something new.* A lot of settings that can really tailor your gameplay experience. Are you a speedrunner? You'll love this game for it's settings. Are you just here for the story? The settings can help you with that too. Just wanna have a look around the levels? There's a settings for you too. There's also different modes that you can play if you only want to experience a certain part of the game (only story/only game play).* The post game is great. It really gives an insight into the development of the game and funny comments from the developers as well!* The game recognized my quite odd controller right away without me having to make any special settings. This is quite rare! The standard control settings were perfect! I didn't even have to rebind the buttons!Cons:* Quite short. I don't think it would've hurt to make it longer or at least add the next con:* No secrets. You're given a big world map but it could've just as well been a menu choice of locations. There's nothing here except locations you need to go to (with three exceptions). There's no secrets in the stages either.* There's some pacing problems present here between gameplay and story. Sometimes it feels like there's a huge story chunck that ends with little game play and sometimes the other way around. This even threw me off once, thinking I must have missed something.* Since most mechanics are only seen once, it's quite sad when you find a really fun mechanic that you'll probably never see again. Case in point, my favorite mechanic was the bounceing laser balls that you could reflect with your shield and mirrors. This was only included in one of the shortest stages in the game however and then never seen again.* The main mechanic of balancing light and dark energy is only really relevant in speed runs or as a life bar. There's no ledges that you need high light energy to reach and there's no gaps that you need high dark energy to jump over. You only really use it to not die platforming (by, for example, getting a lot of light energy before going through a field of dark energy).  Pros/Cons:* Levels are clearly designed for speedrunning. This means that they are too easy if you take your time but might be hard if you're squeezing milliseconds in a speedrun. This is of course a pro if you are a speedrunner but takes away some enjoyment if you're just here for a game to play from start to finish.Other than the above the only bug I found during game play is audio related. Sometimes the dialog and/or SFX sounds dissapear until the next music loop (which is also delayed). Not a huge issue but it can be take away you're focus.Overall I enjoyed this game despite it's shortcomings. You'll definitely enjoy this game more if you're a speed runner than an explorer though. If you're like me and remember the developers from their last game Anodyne, you won't find much of the same here. Don't worry if you aren't an ace with platfoming, this game is probably not too hard for you and even if it is you can still get through it with some settings. Perfect game to give to your non-gamer boyfriend/girlfriend to make them interested in your hobby.			"

												An absolutely gorgeous game, well worth the price of admission. Clearly, a lot of love and care has gone into making this game, and a lot has been done with the base concept-- platforming, with the added edge of energy-aligments, in place of a traditional health meter.In theory, the more green/blue/Light energy you have, the higher you can jump, but you can't run as fast, and the more purple/Dark energy you have, the faster you can run, but with the caveat that you can't jump as high. In my experience, it didn't really feel like that was the case until the later acts of the game, and playing every level back-to-back in ""Gauntlet Mode"" only served to reinforce that sensation...though, within the game's story, I guess it makes sense.Definitely to the developers' credit that the game accommodates a whole load of different play-styles, offering three main game-modes to play in from the outset: the ""full"" experience; ""Gauntlet Mode"", which is all of the gameplay with none of the story; and ""Story Mode"", which is the reverse, and plays more like a 2D-platforming visual novel.Overall: a clever game, with clever level-design that makes good use of the base mechanic; an enchanting, haunting soundtrack coupled with a beautiful art-style; and a fascinating narrative to keep you invested, should you choose to follow it...and that's saying nothing of the extra bits and pieces, like the post-game, or the optional areas around Whiteforge City.An excellent follow-up to Anodyne.

												The three words I keep coming back to: Human, smart, and charming. I think the central aspect of this game for me was the characters. The designers proved themselves super talented at designing genuine characters that I could identify with, and built dialogue that was for the most organic and strong. I say for the most part because, as I mention later, some of the dialogue seemed a little stilted in service of the major humanist theme of the game. The mechanics were super tight and polished, and something I looked forward to in each new area. Even though I'm a seasoned gamer, the puzzles were tuned well enough to seem like they were very accesible to less-experienced gamers, but still satisfying enough to want to find a fast way through each room. It may be the strongest component of the game.The art and sound design never gets enough credit in games -- the soundtrack was expansive and immersive, but never too strong as it overpowered the rest of the experience. The art of each area, static and dynamic, big and small, was gorgeous and obviously very carefully thought through.  A couple of scenes stood out ot me as being kind of sparse; I can imagine that this is a consequence of prolonged development though.Something about this game that I struggled with was the narrative and pacing throughout the game. I had to spread the game across multiple playthroughs because each big story beat required a good amount of patience, and everything seemed heavily weighted on the back half of the game (I had kind of felt that I should've been able to play through everything in two sitdowns of a few hours each, but ended up with a couple extra shorter sessions). Maybe it was the hype-focus on the rule-of-threes for each objective, but it's hard to unpack with spoilers. That being said, the designers showed themselves to be super aware of power dynamics in contemporary society (and more specifically American/Western society), and spread throughout the games little, sometimes subtle, off-hand comments and references about real problems people face today. I was worried that the ending would be rather hamfisted because of some of these comments, but I was left feeling really satisifed.There's a lot of care in this game, so if you want to share in a delightfully human experience, please play this game. This is a very good game for that.			"

												This is a very fine game in terms of story. Its beliavable, its deep. The ambiency is excellent,  its indeed a fine game in terms of music and graphics.But its a poor game in terms of gameplay, I can just rush through the power plants. I dont think I saw the game over screen until now.At some point it feels like the game is mocking my inteligence by making what would be hard puzzles, easy by adding obvious solution paths on purpose...I wonder if that has something to do with the story... I will find out later.Or maybe the game is just somehow meant to be speedrunned, I think the only way for this game to be somewhat challenging would be If i had to plan a speedrun. But I think that the speedrun could be on each power plant (with time limit).Anyway, its worth for the story/character/graphics/music/vibe. Its very hard to find such simplicity and development.It feels real. Similar to undertale.			"

												Pros and cons, then a little bit about my favorite thing at the bottompros+fantastic art and music+interesting characters+the atmposhere (My favorite part, I talk a bit more about this below)+options that let you experience the game how you want to that I've not seen in other gamesCons-some of the diologue can seem a bit reduntant at times-the platforming areas seem to wait a bit too long before it begins to get challenging-story has a few things it mabye could have presented better (though that might just be me being dumb)The one thing that stood out the most to me with Even the Ocean was the atmosphere it creates.  I don't think I've ever played a game that can capture a mood as well as this game does, and it does it consistently.  So much so that, weeks after beating the game, and having several criticisms about it, I still find myself thinking about it.If you want to see the full power a mood can bring to a game, get this.

												Even the Ocean is a fun platformer that has one main gameplay mechanic where you balance your horizontal/vertical alignment as you make your way through stages. The full story will last around six hours.Pros:  Lots of mechanics added throughout the game so that no stage feels like a repeat of a previous one Some stages are quite enjoyably puzzling Plentiful save points All characters major and minor have wonderful portraits Robust post-game is a real treat Many, diverse accessibility options in case you want to play for the story and aren't too keen on platforming, or just need to change something to improve your enjoymentCons: Definitely on the easy side for anyone who plays a lot of platformers Can get a little preachy, which I actually enjoyed but I could see people rolling their eyes a little.

												Even the Ocean is the latest game from Analgesic Productions, who previously made Anodyne, which was way better than any student game had any right to be (though it got impossibly hard near the end). If Anodyne was their take on a Legend of Zelda like game, Even the Ocean is Analgesic's take on a platformer, and their refreshing design sensibilities shine throughout.The core of the game revolved around an energy system: purple energy makes you move faster, and cyan makes you jump higher. Initially, I was afraid it would be too much to handle at once, but the game treats it as a health mechanic, rather than balancing exact percentages of jump vs. fast. If I were to nitpick this mechanic, I would say that I would have loved to see more done with this, have sections only passable with all purple, or all cyan. There may have been, but I don't seem to recall any. With this, you play as Aliph, a woman who is the best power plant repairer in the fantasy world this game takes place in, and you must crawl your way through these broken, disheveled power plants in order to repair them, while dodging obstacles that raise or lower your purple or cyan energy. If an energy gets maxed out, you die. Each power plant introduces new platforming mechanics, such as springy platforms, or water fountains that boost you up if you angle your shield, or lasers that chase your exact position. Each power plant throws just enough new mechanics in to feel fresh, while not feeling overwhelming.All the while, your adventures are scored by Sean Han-Tani-Chen-Hogan's fantastic music. Gorgeous ambient drones light up each environment and make you feel safe, or skeeved out, depending on the scenario. Every time I finished a level and went back to the game's hub world, the Apex District, I would revel in the twinkly, shining music that would accompany it for just a moment before I continued on the game.However, not everything in the game is perfect. In this team's previous work, Anodyne, story was vague, and told in cryptic prose, and environmental storytelling. In Even the Ocean, the team has decided they want a massive story in the game. This is taken to the logical extreme by having a story teller intro and outro the game, and creating ""chapters"" to the story, complete with title cards, to make it feel more cohesive. And the story... doesn't work. It wants to be both a generic save-the-world story, but also something that tackles LGBTQ+ issues, global warming, socio-economic statuses, mortality, grieving dead friends/partners, and a lot more. But the writing comes off as ""my first fan fiction"" level writing. Everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY loves the main character. If there is ever any conflict between the main character and other characters, those other characters either disappear, or make up the literal next time you see them. The other people tasked to work with you on your world saving missions are straight up incompetent, making you the literal only character to do things, setting you up for a ""I'm the only one who can save the world story"", and political topics are brought up by the main character to have an excuse for NPCs to ramble on and on about the political issue of the moment, only for the main character to say ""I see what you mean"" and then segue back to the save the world story.It's a bummer, because I would love to see more games handle these political topics, but the way the story is written, it treats these as trivial side passions of these characters, not full themes to explore or even think about later on. Ideas are brought up, discussed, and thrown away with no-one ever bringing up or acknowledging what those topics could mean in the greater scheme of the story.  One other thing about the game, which I find personally fascinating as a designer, is the complete removal standard difficulty settings, instead replacing difficulty with the ability to adjust the game to how you want to play it. Only want the game, with no story? You can have that. Want the story, with no game? That's an option as well. Want to pick and choose what levels to play in whatever order you want? That's also an option. And, to be expected, the ""full game"" is an option as well. It's a neat way to solve the problem of people wanting to experience games and game stories, even if they personally aren't great at games, or even unable to perform fine motor skills. I want to see more games adopt this, and possibly even go further, with ""easy"", ""normal"" or ""skip"" options for certain levels or sections of levels.Overall, Even the Ocean is a great game, possibly one of the best platformers I've played this year, with a story that falls flat more often than not. It's definitely worth a play, and you can even skip the story entirely, if you just want that platform-y goodness.			"

												Really fun, sorta quiet, game. I like that they found a way to make the gameplay all about something other than killing. It's basically simple Mega Man levels, focused on platforming challenges (but never too challenging), juxtaposed with visual novel cutscenes. Plot feels Miyazaki inspired. Also, special note to the art: cool world map, and some of the environments have a pixel art meets painting look that is breathtaking!			"

												Even the Ocean is a beautiful, atmospheric puzzle-platformer/RPG that provides a mix of mildly challenging platforming, Zelda-style puzzles, a thoughtful, introspective story, and moody visuals and music. It is Analgesic's followup to their 2013 game Anodyne. As seems to be the case for games that have had an impact on me beyond the time I spent playing them, the experience of playing Even the Ocean is more than the sum of the game's parts times its length. Although it has some flaws, which are discussed in more detail below, ETO is worth playing.I pre-ordered ETO and had high expectations for it because of how much I liked Anodyne. Interestingly, while aspects of Anodyne show up in ETO (e.g. the surreal feel and sense of humor), the games are very different mechanically. To me, Anodyne felt a little more polished, but ETO is more ambitious, and I like that it tries new things.The main mechanical difference between Anodyne and ETO is that ETO's challenges are primarily 2D puzzle-platforming challenges. Critically for a game of this type, ETO's platforming controls feel tight and fun to use. ETO's twist is that, rather than having a typical health system, it has a system where the player has a level on a light/dark energy scale. This light/dark energy level is nicely integrated into nearly all of the game's mechanics.Aside from the energy system discussed above, ETO's platforming is somewhat standard but well-done. It never really becomes especially challenging, but the levels are designed such that moving through them feels rewarding and fun. It might also be a good game for speed-running.The game does a good job of introducing platforming mechanics naturally rather than relying on tutorials. However, there is a clear pattern to how new mechanics are introduced and used, and I think the game would have benefited from mixing this up a bit more.ETO's overall structure is mostly linear with regular points where the player can choose in what order to complete the next set of objectives. This goes some way toward making the game feel more open than it is, but as this pattern is repeated, it can make the game feel a bit predictable.ETO has a strong story aspect, and this is revealed at regular intervals between the straight platforming sections of the game. The characters the player runs into throughtout the game add a nice feeling to the game world. ETO particularly focuses on characters' emotions and their relationships. However, while the story can make an emotional impact, it doesn't seem as deep or nuanced as its scope and seriousness sometimes hints at.The developers of ETO appear to have made a strong effort to be accessible and inclusive in the design of the game, both in the game's story and in the available options affecting the game's mechanics.As with Anodyne, ETO's music and visuals are moody and evocative and they contribute greatly to the overall experience of playing the game. I've listened to the soundtrack on its own, and I wish more games make use of weather and biomes to create atmospheric scenes like ETO does.You should play ETO if you get a chance.			"

												Even the Ocean is a super stylish 2D platformer with a mechanical hook and big story to tell. Aliph is tasked with saving Whiteforge City after a routine maintenance excursion goes wrong. To do this, she'll need to explore power plants and other strange locations, balancing her energy bar just the right way to help her either run faster or jump higher. There's also downtime in the city, which focuses more on conversations and growing relationships with the locals. The narrative certainly takes a somber turn at one point and isn't afraid to delve into topics about inclusivity, priveledge, and sacrifice. I enjoyed the mix of light-yet-satisfying platforming challenges and returning to the city to rest up before tackling the next dungeon, which reminded me strongly of daily life in Persona 4. The pixel art and soundtrack are real pretty, often taking what we might know as the norm and enhancing it into something more alien. What's also nice is that Even the Ocean can be played in a number of ways: Story-only mode, Gauntlet for ramping up the difficulty, or you can even add in helper blocks if a jump is proving too tricky. It's one of the most friendly and inviting gaming experiences I've come across in the last few years.			"

												It's a fun game, but you should not expect challenging puzzles. It's more of the relaxing type although it sometimes requires good timing. Maybe the level desing should have required a more active use of the light/dark powers to traverse some parts. The checkpoints are very fair and the game keeps introducing new mechanics to keep things interesting, but still it shouldn't have been much longer than it already is.And everyone should play Anodyne btw. :-)			"

												From the makers of Anodyne, this is another amazing indie game that blends inovative, tight gameplay, with an engaging story and rich, interesting characters. Like seriously, with these small indie games you get one or the other usually, not both.It is a 2d platformer, with mechanics that feel new, and different. Many of these are bespoke for each level, so going to a new area is exciting as there are always new types of puzzles and hazards to navigate.The story has many twists in it that kept me excited to see every new chapter. The characters, while not given a large amount of dialogue (this is a fairly short game), feel so lifelike and all connect to different topics and just...things we deal with in our lives.It's hard to describe this game to someone who hasn't played Anodyne. If you have, expect a similar quality game that also deals with heavy topics in a similar way. If you haven't:TL;DR Awesome platformer with good story/character, short, tight, and great pacing.			"

												GREAT all around. the aesthetics alone are lovely but the gameplay is also extremely engaging! rather than a health bar, you have to balance your energy levels, and this mechanic gains more and more layers as you go. this makes for a good balance of puzzles and reaction time -- plus the controls are really smoothi found no bugs while playing & the frequent save points make for a forgiving experience :>the story is engaging, and while it seems typical at first, there are a few points where it breaks from the moldi really enjoy the diverse cast and the strong personalities each character brings to the table. the gorgeous art and the music of the environments combine to make distinct experiences i would love to be able to visit in real lifethe only thing i would've liked was more options when conversing with npcs -- even if it didn't effect general outcomes, it would have made me feel more connected to aliphdefinitely recommended!

												I absolutely love this game. I don't know where to start. I was a fan of the developers' previous work, Anodyne, which was strange, eerie, quiet, and atmospheric- and I use those adjectives positively here. With Even the Ocean you can see them improving on their craft in just about every way: the art is better, the characters are more alive, the story is more coherent and interesting, and the gameplay is more engaging, all while maintaining that eerie quiet atmosphericism (is that a word?) that made Anodyne so memorable. I also wanted to point out just how polished this game is. Everything just works smoothly, and it feels really good to play it too.I suppose I can't just gush, so the one negative that you'll probably hear is that the gameplay isn't as engaging as it could be. To be clear: from what I've heard and seen there are no enemies in the game, only obstacles and clever level design. I suppose this can sometimes make the game feel a bit empty, which isn't a bad thing, since it fits into the game's whole aesthetic so well. The whole first dungeon is about as easy as I'd think a tutorial level would be, but it definitely picks up from there. I'd also argue that the focus on movement instead of combat, as well as the overall ease with which you can play the game, were design choices that fit the quiet beauty of the title well. I'd recommend this game wholeheartedly to anyone but a pure adrenaline junkie. It's quiet, introspective, eerie, beautiful, and clever. Please check it out.			"
