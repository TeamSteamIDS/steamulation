												Costume Quest 2 is the second game in this series developed by Double Fine Productions.  You play the role of two twin siblings, Reynold and Wren.  The game follows on from the original game in the story and offers much of the same game play elements.  The game has been released on PS3, 360, PS4, Xbox One, WiiU and all of the PC platforms. Like I said, the gameplay is very much the same as the first game, you travel around in your party exploring the world and encounter enemies, which you battle in a turn based fight scene. These fight scenes have an essence of QTEs in them, so if you hit the button at exactly the right time, you'll either do more damage, or block more damage. As you venture throughout the game, you will discover new and interesting costumes to wear - each costume has its own special ability and unique style of play.  There is some real interesting costumes to find, my favorite is the Clown costume, which acts as your early game healer, but you also have tanky classes and damage dealing classes like in other RPG games. Graphically, Costume Quest 2 is identical to the original. The art style is beautiful though, I loved the stylized world that you are put in and all of the characters just look gorgeous.  The animation in cut scenes and in the game are second to none too.  The game is so well optimized that pretty much any rig can play this in its full glory. The plot is similar to the first game too; you are out to stop Dr. Orel White who has taken over the world and aims to bring an end to the holiday, Halloween! Obviously being the candy loving kids we all are, we can't let that happen and you must stop him.  With an element of time travel to be seen, there is some very interesting plot points throughout the game, and this comes with the inclusion of some brilliantly comical moments along the way too. Sadly the game is not voice acted - for me I was hoping it would be given how popular the first game was, but this doesn't take away any of the charm the game has. You can pretty much imagine how each of the characters in the game would sound, and the animation of them all with the facial expressions aids this ten fold too. Costume Quest 2 has moments of difficulty; some of the quests are not easily figured out and you have to put a bit of thought into them, or working out where to go next in order to progress the game. Not to mention the boss battles can also get quite intensive too; I actually had to spend a fair amount of time grinding my characters up a few levels just so they were on par with the difficulty of the bosses I was facing. This is by no means a bad thing as with each fight you win, you also get the chance to win a card, which will have a unique effect that you can use in a battle, such as avoiding attacks, doing double damage, or sometimes actually out right killing an enemy no questions asked!That brings me onto the level design, every single level in Costume Quest has absolutely tons of areas to explore and items to find. You have to destroy typical game world items in order to find the games currency, candy. The candy can the be spent at the vendors which are scattered around the world to purchase costume upgrades, or the above mentioned special effect cards. Each level also has a handful of side quests which you can complete, granting further experience points and candy as rewards. I would recommend people actually focus on the side quests before progressing in the main quest just so you keep up at the right level compared to the enemies. Some of the side quests are linked to the main quest; but a lot can be skipped over if you really want to. A full playthrough with completing the majority of the side quests at a leisurely pace took me just under nine hours to complete which is actually a bit of a jump in length compared to the original which only took me five hours to finish. Again though, there is no reason at all to play through Costume Quest 2 for a second time apart from maybe mopping up a few achievements if that's your jam. Much like the first, I would really of liked to have seen a ""New Game+"" mode just to squeeze a couple more hours out of it, and maybe introducing local co-op too, that would be an almost perfect addition given that you play as twins the whole way through the game. I had virtually no technical issues in my run through. I was able to play at 4K resolution with a steady 60 FPS the whole time. I did run into a few bugs where you could actually walk through some walls when interacting with items on the other side of the wall such as ladders and chests, but there are no real game breaking bugs to be found. I played the game with a controller given the amount of QTEs in the game, I felt that would be a better option, but this can just as easily be played with keyboard and mouse too. To sum up, I think Costume Quest 2 does exactly the same as the Costume Quest just bigger and better. I can only hope that there is going to be a third game in this series as it just gets better and better with each release. I will go as far to say this is one of my favorite games I have played this year so it gets a strong recommendation from me!

												Costume Quest 2 is Costume Quest with time travel and enhanced graphics, and that's not hyperbole. Many assets, including costumes, are recycled and the neighborhoods are likely to induce deja vu in those who played the original. The few adjustments that have been made are of little consequence so, if you enjoyed Costume Quest and wanted more of the same, you'll enjoy this; on the other hand, if you felt it began to drag and become repetitive, or that battles were tedious, you will feel it again here and sooner. For those who haven't played either, there's no reason you can't start with this one. The story in Costume Quest 2 revolves around a group of kids who must utilize time travel to deal with the results of a mother obsessed with keeping her son's teeth in perfect condition; that is, save Halloween from being outlawed by the deranged dentist he becomes. To accomplish this, you'll need to skate around neighborhoods completing quests, knocking on doors and beating up baddies for candy that can be used to buy maps, costume upgrades and battle abilities. Some costumes grant powers that are needed to access secret areas or progress the story, and you can switch between them at any time while not in combat.Combat begins with your characters morphing into giant versions of whatever costumes they're wearing and is turn-based, with QTEs for enhanced damage, blocking and combos. Whether it's Thomas Jefferson and his special attack, the Declaration of Destruction; generic robots and superheroes; or a useless candy corn that's still trying to find his courage, it's all amusing and the animations are nicely done. The biggest improvement that could have been made to the game, but wasn't, would no doubt involve the length and repetition of battles and QTEs.Overall, Costume Quest 2 is a light-hearted, humorous, feel-good game that, when played by someone new to the series, should make up for in charm what it lacks in depth. I can easily recommend it to newcomers and lovers of the first title; for those who thought Costume Quest was nothing more than fair, don't expect this to change your mind: Double Fine didn't attempt to in the slightest.

												Very similar to the first Costume Quest which is good for the most part but I found it getting repetitive after a couple hours. Removed the post battle healing and force you to backtrack to a water fountain to heal  waaaay too frequently which can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥in unfamiliar territory. No maps provided of new areas unless you buy it. Even with the map there is no indication of your current location. Battle stamps (passive upgrades) have been removed and a new buff system using Creepy Treats cards as in battle items takes their place. Fairly entertaining story but I preferred the previous Costume Quest.			"

												Costume quest is finally back. It surprised me, i was not expecting Costume quest 2. I loved the first game and i instantly fell in love with this one. Again you play as the very cute little kids (i know it sounds creepy coming from a grown man) and running in halloween costumes fighting giant angry moles and snails.The game didn‘t change much. The core is the same. Simple rpg mechanics, collecting candies, leveling up, collecting new costumes to become a three-headed hotdog. The combat system changed a little, you now need to press a button when attacking to do more damage and same goes for defending – press the button in time to receive less damage. And there‘s fountains where you can restore your health after the fights. I heard people complaining about it, but i don‘t see the problem here, fountains are always close to you, it‘s easy to go and refill you hp. Other than that the game is same as the previous one – great. Yes it‘s very short, but i don‘t know if i would want to play it for 30 hours.Double fine has done a fine job here. Costume quest 3 next halloween maybe? "

												First of all, if you've never played the first game you should. Not only to get the whole story but because I feel it was overall a better game. Costume Quest 2 is a good game, but I feel there are some questionable design choices that were made solely to artificially extend play time and can be tiresome like having to update your treat cards after battles and having to go to fountains or eat candy to heal. Even leaving the game takes time. It's still funny, it's still charming, combat became a little more interesting and challenging than the first game. I enjoyed it at the end, though much less than the original. Another issue I had is that only pre-order costumers got the DLC with some costume from the previous game, and while I'm ok with rewarding people who bought it first I'd like to see them as a purchasable DLC in the future.

												Trick or treat, smell my feet, give me something good to eat!  If you don't, I don't care, I'll just change into an actual superhero and beat the candy out of you, you creepy monster!If you've played the first Costume Quest, then you know exactly what you're in for- kids beating the crud out of monsters for halloween candy.  But this time... there's more to it than just ""the bad monsters want to steal away our candy"".  Nope, this time, there's a new villain in town... the one person who has more reason to hate candy than any one other person in the whole city......the creepy local dentist.  In fact, he hates it so much that he's somehow managed to make it to where Halloween, candy, and costumes are crimes against his order, and he's recruited the Repugians to help enforce his views.  It's up to Wren and Reynold to put a stop to it, and save Halloween for future generations.To be quite honest, this is just as good as the first one- battles are a tad bit more complicated with a bit of Pokemon-style type weakness mixed in, but you'll pick up on that easily enough.  Stickers are also gone, replaced with Creepy Treats cards that recharge after a certain number of battles.  The automatic healing after every battle has been removed too- but it's not as terrible as it sounds, honestly.  You either need to camp out around a water fountain to keep healed, or finally put that candy to more use than just as a currency- you can fully heal your party for 25 pieces of candy, or use it to buy upgrades and cards.To be honest, the new costumes you get in this one may not be as powerful as some of the originals- for instance, the Unicorn's My Pretty Panacea special is still brokenly powerful compared to the revive you get without the preorder- but the right combinations are still very, very powerful.  Enemies are no longer a finite resource- there are respawning enemies in all the areas of the game in addition to the ones in the usual places, so if you just feel like sitting somewhere and grinding levels, you can do that, too.  To be honest, though, you don't need a super-high level to beat the game- I finished it around level 9, with the Hardcorn achievement, even.Some of the late-game random encounters need a specific strategy- you'll run into a group that can drop a group heal every turn, if they so choose, and if you don't destroy them in a specific order, they'll tear you apart.It might need a little balancing in the late game, but overall, if you have the first one, you can expect more of the same fun that was in the first one- or you could just outright buy the first one as well and play through that if you want to!  If you didn't play the first one, that's still fine- you might not understand some of the story elements, but you'll like the great gameplay and all the fun!			"

												Costume quest 1 was a charming and funny JRPG with some tedious elements and very easy battles. Costume Quest 2 is exactly the same thing, but slightly worse.   Graphics & soundNot much has happened in the graphics department since Costume Quest 1. If you play the games back to back, you might notice some differences, but to me, who played them a few years apart., the two games look very similar. The game has an intentionally simple graphics style, with cartoonish looking characters. It works quite well, considering the game is a lighthearted game about a bunch of kids who have to save the world on Halloween, and it helps set the tone for the game.  Outside of combat, most animations are very simple, but they get the job done. The simple animations never actually clash with the game, nor do they look out of place. In combat animations are more intricate, while still keeping with the overall simple tone of the game. In particular the main character animations look quite good. The models are also more detailed in combat and despite how different the models look, the art style still always feel consistent.    As far as sound goes, the game fares a bit worse. None of the music is particularly memorable, and the sound effects range from alright to downright annoying. I ended up not using certain costumes due to their annoying sound effects (the clown costume in particular was bad in this regard).Story & settingIt's Halloween and an evil time-traveling dentist has ruined everything by banning costumes & candy. It's up to two kids to save Halloween and by extension the world from being boring. Or at least a specific city from being boring on Halloween, the game is not entirely clear on the details. With such an outlandish plot it's surprising to see how little they actually do with it. There are some funny moments, but mostly of the game seems to focus on tedious busywork rather than on the story itself. You visit some different time periods, but while they have a different coat of paint, not much seem to change. Had the game focused on actually telling the story of how Halloween was ruined rather than focusing on having you collect candy from houses no matter when or where you are, the game would have been a lot more interesting. Basically, it feels like Double Fine were unwilling to commit to the story they had created, and they just padded it with things that ended up feeling only loosely related.GameplayIf you've played the first game, you'll know how this game works. It's nigh identical. You move around and talk to people with WASD, and solve some simple puzzles, like many other games, and when you enter combat, it switches to a different perspective. Combat is turnbased and works very similar to Super Mario RPG, where you select what kind of attack you want to make, and if you time your button presses right, you deal additional damage. Each costume has a basic attack and a special attack that requires some buildup before it can be used.Combat is tedious though. The combat animations are very long, which makes combat take far more time than it should, and there's no way of skipping regular attack animations, due to how you need to time your button presses. Combat is also very easy, which just makes fighting a chore. You're not going to lose, as long as you're paying a bit of attention to the game, it's just not going to happen. And while combat is easy, you'll also take a lot of unavoidable damage, so you're expected to go back and heal after every second battle or so, which just makes the game even more tedious. Luckily there are no random encounters, and as long as you stay within an area and don't reload the game, dead enemies stay dead.Final thoughtsCostume Quest 2 is a step back from the original Costume Quest. It keeps all of the flaws that the first game had, and introduces a few new ones. Tedious is the best word I can find to describe this game. It's also very bad at actually committing to its strange story, which makes it a lot less memorable than it should have been. Costume Quest 2 is by no means a terrible game, but it's not very good either. "

												I can't really recommend this unless you are a huge fan of the first.  Dialogue is a little on the weaker side, combat is super easy (I never even touched the cards at all during the battle), and the story seemed a little unimaginative.  Play the first one, and leave it at that knowing that you are playing the best game in the series.			"

												Costume Quest 2 retains all the charm of the first game, and adds several improvements. The battle system is still simple (in a good way) but they've added a bit more depth to make it more interesting from a strategic standpoint.Also: 60 FPS finally! (CQ1 was 30 FPS and had framerate issues, being a previous-gen console port)I recommend the following:Play Costume Quest 1 first, and the (free) DLC, since the story in CQ2 continues immediately after thatGo for the ""hardcorn"" achievement, if you want a little more depth to the battles "

Costume Quest 2 PC Review Summary/Overview Costume Quest 2 is a Halloween-themed role-playing game made by Double Fine in 2014.  Once on a Halloween night, there were two kids named Reynold (Ren) and Wren who were brother and sister of parents, Everett and Lucy. A dentist named Dr. White believed that all the kids in the community were telling lies to others in the true meaning of Halloween. All of us should recall, Halloween was once a holiday that was pure, holy and upright. It was a holiday that was carried out through the Roman Catholic church and the Celt tradition of Celt festivals carried out each year that is still celebrated today.      However, today, we celebrate Halloween externally as a holiday in which others dress up in costumes, some cute, others scary and yet others overly gruesome and gory. In fact, one other type of costume that has not been popularized as much is the bunny costume in which females try to dress provocatively with bunny ears, usually consisting of a low-cut top and hot pants. We also know by tradition, in popular culture, horror; zombie movies, games are appropriated to media outlets every single year.      The people that play these horror and zombie games year-round celebrate the basis behind what Halloween has been shaped into. That is, an occult holiday that serves Satan and not Christ. This is filled with irrational behaviors such as people egging others houses, the old stink bomb out of the car prank and obliterating pumpkins outside on their neighbor's porches. A very long time ago, Halloween was not celebrated this way. Instead, trick-or-treating got its start following the Catholic tradition of praying for the dearly departed once a year that was seen in purgatory, the transitional state between redemption, purification, and grace from one's final eternal state. It was pure that never included the occult. Costume Quest 2 overall is a cute game where Dr. White forces kids to give up their candy and wants to stop the tradition of Halloween. You pair up with your sister, and, your friends to try to stop Dr. White before he gains the talisman to the past. The talisman unlocks portals of time that function as a time machine, time holes that can transition you from the past to the future and, the future back towards the past. The Repugians, Enemy Characteristics, and Supreme Overlord     The Repugians are monsters that were unlocked from the future that are trying to go to the past, then the present to stop Halloween. You see these Monsters at the start of the game's story. Then, the other enemy type we have, the ones you see most often within the Bayou and French Quarter are called Dr. White's Krony's. These are pointed hat, short creatures that have a dark shadow cast over them with a time clock in the center of their chest. His Krony's have taken over the city of Auburn Pines within the future. We can even call this the future-past.        Since the time transition occurred in the future that now effects the present, however, what is occurring in the present seems to change the past. That is why this categorization of it works perfectly to describe the time manipulation mechanic. That is not all, however. The main overlord behind these Krony's is a supreme overlord, Kronoculus. He has two or three forms and controls time in the game because he is Dr. White's master.      The chain of order in command of the enemies with power is Kronoculus, Dr. White, the Krony's and finally, the Repugains which are small, green monsters. That is all I can reveal for the story, enemy and character aspects to avoid any potential spoilers. Gameplay     The gameplay is characterized by battles when you are trick-or-treating from house to house. Some will be adults that put candy in your bag, while many of the residents are actual Krony's. Before the combat menu pulls up, one of your characters in your party will have a cutscene; it is only a power-up animation such as in a cheap superhero movie of some sort. Now, we undergo combat. You can select which enemies you want to attack first. Thankfully, the combat is not turn-based but rather a direct line of attack. Each attack is one-on-one in other words.      Each character costume has different strengths and weaknesses. Some are weaker against the mechanic type of enemies, but more effective against monsters. Others are more vulnerable to monster attacks but effective at fighting against technical enemies, technological.   Presentation     The sound is surround sound with small details that are most appreciated such as crickets chirping and animal noises in the Bayou. The battles are like Fantastic 4 combined with Comix Zone when the power up animation begins. When powering up, it shows a comic-strip narration with small catch phrases. These catch phrases reveal to you the timing and accuracy of your attacks, relative to how well your impact damage is which is factored in by the timing of the ' attack reticule' like an online game of darts hitting a bulls-eye.  You can easily dodge attacks by the timing of your resistance to impact which is also guided by this reticle feature. Quests, Objectives & Costume Information     Quests show costume patterns, which costume designs have been unlocked and have slots underneath; this is for when we gather new materials which only come when we have collected a full set of three material pieces that contribute to the final byproduct and creation of our new costume. Our materials are located on the left-hand side of our notebook. Costume Information, in contrast, is on the right-side. The costume information corresponds from left-to-right in our notebook to the costumes on the previous page (The left side looking from the right-hand side). In addition, vivid inscriptions have been added such as the ' candy corn.'      The candy corn is "" a dollop of sugar, corn syrup and wax shaped to look like a piece of corn.” “Focus: Inaction Combat Special: None, but looks delicious, so draws attention.""      This shows us that the candy corn costume is the only one in the game that has no offensive attacks. It makes your character passive throughout every battle. Finally, our status tab shows our level; experience points (current and amount until next level), our health and our total candy we currently have. Creepy Treat Cards     Creepy Treat Cards are power-ups in the form of cool playing cards in the game that can increase your overall experience and rewards at the end of a battle, double your damage done to enemies, give you an extra turn and other positives and negatives for each. Some of the names on the cards are very satirical while others are more formal names that are more appropriate for the game. I find it very amusing, as a result, it is one of the few times in this game that I have smiled out in the open and laughed inside myself.  Final Verdict     Graphics are lifelike, characters are animated, environments are well-lit. The most impressive feature of the beautiful graphics is when you go door to door trick-or-treating. Candles down the walkway to the front door light up until you leave from house to house. This instance of the candles was one of the other times I smiled and found solace in my heart knowing that Double Fine has made this Halloween memorable for me, despite my review being, only days before Halloween. The presentation rather makes the battles repetitive knowing how many Krony's you must duel and the animations do get old after a while over longer periods of time. Overall: 8/10 - Astounding- good for adults & children, especially the children "

												Not much was fixed from CQ1, many flaws are still prevalent and it's kind of a shame. The game length was shortened by almost half, I found myself wandering around aimlessly in this game for 20 minutes at a time trying to figure some of the more cryptic quests out and I still managed to finish it in half the time it took me to beat CQ1... although in it's defense, this game doesn't have DLC, but the DLC for CQ1 isn't 6 hours long. The story was a bit rushed, It felt really manic and clumsey and the costumes all felt more useless than in the original... The coolest costume is very hard to find and requires you to actually do a lateral thinking puzzle where all other quests are basically spelled out for you or documented in your note book. It's just a shame I finished the game before finding it because after discovering it I had no use for it... I tested out it's special move and thought it would of been cool to fight the final boss with it again, but he was already a push over.The Candy Corn achievement is just gruling and brutal because of all the quips you have to endure every time that characters turn comes up but in the long run it does you a favor... Using Candy Corn slows the pace of the game to a crawl because you lose one of your fighters for the entire duration of the game but it helps tremendously during boss fights and even more especially during the final fight.The music and design is nothing to gawk at... just more of the same except now you can double attack and use counter attacks... The buff badges have been removed and the creepy treat cards were given more utility... So now you can actually use them for something other than staring at but I didn't want to waste any in fear that I might lose out on the collection achievement... so that was a waste of resources if I've ever seen one... I never needed to utilze a single card the entire time playing.Either way, it wasn't their best effort, could of been better... I did enjoy it regardless of the lack of content but it didn't stray too far from the original in terms of innovation... just another copy and paste sequel.			"

★★★★★After playing through Cosrtume Quest 1, I took a break by playing something else, because honestly, that game is not great. It has the charm, but the combat was too simplistic and repetitive. Some players also had problems with the fast-scrolling, automated texts. Though I still think this sequel is somewhat too easy, I do think that this game can be considered as one of the best video game sequels in recent years.It's improves everything from the first game. The combat this time is more intriguing with the slight rock-paper-scissors mechanic and the significance of the cards. Graphically they also added a lot of great looking effects, lots of original assests and generally more detail to the world. I thought the first game had a great style to it, but the sequel just made the style prettier in overall. Perhaps the best improvement is the writing. The story has a lot more going on, the humor pretty much always hits and the cutscenes (including those in combat) have been treated with care.I've one would ask me, I'd say this game is one of Double Fines best, next to Iron Brigade.

												The only reason you'd want to play this is if you've beat the first game. Worth playing? Yes. But compared to the first game, this game definitely made some bad decisions. I can see why critics gave this game such low reviews. They oversimplified the battle system, requiring only one button and the same ""time your attack"" mechanic. The dumb aspect is that they mapped each character to a different button, which is completely pointless. A lot of the new costumes are cool, but they share a lot of the same abilities from the first game. I didn't preorder so I didn't get the DLC bonus costumes, but no worry. They're ones you already played in the first game and you'll probably prefer the new ones anyways. I liked how the 3rd child in your party was changing throughout the game. I like the ability to upgrade your costumes, but I disliked the new card system.  Instead of equipping stamps for different effects, you can only choose 3 cards to bring into battle. Once used, they need a cooldown of X battles to use again. The only reason I used all of them was to complete an Achievement. Overall I had fun playing the game, but just like eating candy after brushing your teeth, it'll definitely leave a weird taste in your mouth...			"

												Costume Quest 2 falls a bit short of Costume Quest. In 1, you are presented with a new challenge halfway through the game, but by the end of Costume Quest 2, you long for more. The ending is anti-climactic. Despite this it is still a great game and still cute.Easy 100%7/10 Fabulous Presidents			"

												If you enjoyed the first Costume Quest on the surface this one feels and plays pretty much the same, so you'll enjoy it too.  That being said this one is much shorter and simpler than the first one.  My 100% completion time was about 7 hours.  Graphically the game looks a bit better, but the quests are simpler, the costumes less nuanced, and the battles too simplified.  I was really excited for Costume Quest 2 after enjoying the first one and am really disappointed.			"

												Double Fine Productions is back with this amazing sequel to Costume Quest and I HAD to play it after finishing the first game in a row. A little confused and doubtful at the beginning, mainly because of the combat system that didn't feel right, I realized it was just about adjusting ; once you're ""in"", this game is just as good as the first one.One of the highlights of Costume Quest was the story and I wasn't disappointed with this new storyline - saving Halloween traveling through time, fighting the evilish Dr. White and his dental army. A lot of fun, new costumes and abilities, various new cards to use in combat and of course, new characters. The gameplay and the quests remain identical, but it doesn't get boring for all that (you can even skip combat animations if it starts bothering you after a while). Let's not forget to mention that they (finally !) added maps.Costume Quest 2 is truly worth playing if you've finished the first game. Join Reynold and Wren one more time in a second epic adventure, in this cute and amusing RPG - and, hopefully, there will be a third adventure...			"

												Remember when Paper Mario was an RPG? It's like that, but less fun and more repetitive. One of the weapons you start with keeps you from attacking; it's iritating, but made better by Double Fine's skilled writers.			"

												Costume Quest 2 is the sequel to the original turn-based soft RPG made by Double Fine around 2012. It continues the story of the two twins Reynold and Wren exactly where the last DLC for the first title ended: after managing to return to their own time, they must resort to time travel to stop the evil plan of Dr. Orel White, a dentist bent on destroying Halloween for good and rule the whole world.Gameplay-wise, Costume Quest 2 doesn't differ that much from the first game's formula, but manages to tweak several elements along the way. The combat is the feature that recived the greatest overhaul: while the whole turn-based RPG fare with QTEs for extra damage is still there, now the health of the characters doesn't refill itself after combat (forcing you to visit fountains scatterd in the areas or consume a stock of candy to heal up), your attacks can either be nice or amazing and dish out damage accordingly regarding when precisely you press the attack button, you can defend yourself and try to counterattack via QTEs, chains of attacks are available and enemies tend to hurt a bit more and some will respawn to free roam the streets again. The sequel also introduces three classes for enemies and costumes alike, Tech, Wizard and Monster: there is a little weakness/resistance system going on between each to put some emphasis on gear and target choice. Finally, this time around  you can actually buy upgrades for your costume, which either empower the character's attacks or add some useful side effects. While these novelties make the first encounters you'll face very challenging and requiring some demanding good timing, as you progress through Costume Quest 2 and gain the roughly ten levels there are to get you'll become more and more powerful and get used to the QTEs general flow, to the point of making most of the battles trivial (the bosses in this game are especially disappointing because, unlike the first game, they don't display any unique gimmick and all boil down to a very easy dps race).Aside from the combat, eveything you left in Costume Quest returns in the sequel as you'd expect: in the roughly three main areas you'll visit in the second game there a lot of doors to knock on for trick or treating, obstacles to overcome with the right costume, collectable cards that give you a pletora of effects in combat and a huge crowd of NPCs to interact with. The writing is still funny and charming as you remembered.In short, Costume Quests 2 is a fairly good attempt as a sequel and feel free to buy it if you enjoyed the first game			"

												The sequeal to the 1st game, Costume Quest 2 is exactly what its suppose to be. Cute, fun and now a bit more challenging. I played the game twice because I realize there was an achievement to finish through the whole game with one of your party members wearing the candycorn costume, which is a bit more challenging.The story takes place immediately after the first game (not gonna go any further discussion about the story because I dun want to give spoilers), though I have to say they could have a little bit more depth to the story. The whole game is almost the same to the first one, but with a number of additional gimmicks and changes:1) All the characters now have the same button prompt unlike the previous game where they all have a variety of it;2) You can now attack again after a successful attack, and also there are levels of damage depending on your timing;3) You can now defend and counter;4) Once you flee, you will teleport auto-matically to a healing-well-thingy, which follow up to my next point...5) You can now heal and save at a healing-well-drinking-thingy, not a ignorant police phone booth;6) You will have a lot of cards to use in battle to act as an battle-equalizer, because the fights are a lot harder than the first game7) You can now move faster in any costume, unlike the first game which is the ability for the robot costume;8) Costumes and enemies now have effectiveness typing, kinda like rock scissors paper. They are Monster, Magic and Mech types. Thats all the things I can think of for now.The game is now more challenging, which is good. The characters are still adorable and lovable, and the attack prompts in battle feels more respondsive. The main menu though, I wish they would just stick to the simple looking menu rather than what it is now, but oh well. Overall not bad for a sequal. "

												The Problem with sequels is that you compare it to the first game. To me Costume Quest 2 on its own is a decent and good game but in case you played the first one, you might have mixed feelings. I played both games. My opinion: I don't understand why they changed the battle-system. You don't have the different attack meters anymore, the cards you get need to be activated during the battle and do not give passive bonuses, you should heal after every fight (either with a ability or the fountain which caused me to run back to the fountain all the time). Those are my points i didn't like. On The other hand though: The story is still good and funny at times and the little quests too. Plus, you can constantly skate now. Thank god.I say it again, this game on its own is good but don't expect much after playing the first one.			"

												If you haven't played the original Costume Quest, check that out first.  The game plays pretty close to the original.  The game isn't really hard and anyone should be able to pick it up and enjoy it.  The costumes in this version are memorable and none of them repeat from the original unless you pre-ordered or they release the DLC.  I thought the storyline in this met my expectations of a sequel.  You play the kids from the original and they time travel to stop an evil dentist from destroying Halloween.  This time both the brother and sister are teamed up.  You still have to make a decision in the beginning on which one gets the dialogue throughout the story though.  I recommend picking it up if you liked the original a lot.			"

												Not necessarily finished with the game but I'm at end-game, so I'll go ahead and type this outI think this is a good sequel to the first Costume Quest + Grubbins on Ice, so far from what I played. + Great follow-up to the cute-sy story the series has, along with excellent and consistent writing on-par with the first game+ While time-travel can be a cliche, it can be seen as a fitting trope for the game (that is if you played the GoI epilogue)+ While battle stamps were removed, creepy treat cards now take its place in a much more practical way- Optimization needs work, it's harsher on the CPU than the first game- Combat is dumbed down and less varied, and some the QTEs don't register from time to time- While you could just hit the close window button, it takes too long to get back to the main menuI still recommend this game to those that enjoyed the first game though!

												Pros:-Very funny, witty story and dialogue.-Easily accessible for all.-Great music.-Wonderful art and graphics.Cons:-Repetitive combat.-A bit too similar to the first game.I never really did Halloween when I was a kid. I’m one of those killjoys who rolls her eyes at the Halloween decorations the shops insist on trotting out and flogging to a mostly disinterested British audience every year. I managed to work my way through my formative years without it playing any part in my yearly routine. I never went trick or treating, or ‘glorified begging’ as I was told it was. I’ve never really done fancy dress in any big way either. In fact I’ve probably put more effort into making costumes for my hedgehog soft toys than I have for myself. Costume Quest 2 lets me precariously live out my repressed need to threaten strangers into giving me sweets and dress up in increasingly deranged outfits whilst hitting monsters, which I assume is standard Halloween behaviour for those inclined.Costume Quest was a game that impressed me immensely. It was simple in places but filled with all the wonderful charm and wit that Double Fine have built their reputation on. Like Psychonauts (another game I love), Costume Quest is a game about being a kid, doing kid stuff and seeing the world in a fantastical way that the adults around them just cannot do. It’s silly and quirky without coming across as pandering or dumbed down. On the contrary, Costume Quest had some really clever writing. Despite my Halloween-cynicism, I was strangely excited about the prospect of Costume Quest 2 (especially after seeing the wonderful announcement trailer).After stopping monsters stealing all the Halloween candy, brother and sister team Wren and Reynold are preparing to finally enjoy some trick or treating Halloween fun. But would you believe it, an evil dentist has changed history to outlaw the festival. The simple premise belies the sharpness of the writing and the sheer joy of finding all the gags and japes the game has to offer. There is always something happening on screen, be it a quick one liner or a visual gag going on in the background. It seems there is no wasted space in the game world, everything has a purpose. I adored the art style that lead designer Tasha Harris gave the first game, I’m very pleased to see that the sequel has added to it in the best way, keeping the style consistent as new characters are introduced and fresh costumes take centre stage. The game looks brilliant, being so full of colour and life as it is with some well thought out areas to explore. It plays almost exactly as its predecessor. Costume Quest was never the most challenging of games in terms of gameplay, which is fair, not every game needs to be a hardcore l33t ultra noob-smasher pain-a-thon. I always enjoyed the gentler style Costume Quest took but it would have been nice to have the sequel mix things up a bit more to stop it becoming too repetitive or overly familiar. Very little has changed. The meat of the game is divided betwixt two scenarios; knocking on doors to trick or treat and seeing if you get candy or a fight, and then there is the fighting. It’s not a bad system but one that gets a bit too predictable the longer the game goes on. The fighting in particular runs close to becoming tedious after a while. Two parties line up and take turns hitting each other until one party has lost all its health points, it’s a time honoured system but one that wears itself pretty thin when it’s limited to a few characters with the same moves and little involvement from the player. The combat system has had a bit of tweaking though. The button timing mechanic for attacking opponents has been streamlined slightly to make it more consistent over the various costumes and there is a more effective block/counter-attack move to be learned. However you’ll be performing the same actions so many times in combat you become numb to them. The joy of seeing the kids you play as transform into literal representations of their costumes and fight giant monsters or robots loses its impact after the hundredth fight or so. The special moves your characters can use are amusing (the clown’s ‘laughter is the best medicine’ is my favourite), but even they become tiresome the more you see them. There are some enemies that certain costumes are stronger or weaker against, but I never found myself needing to worry about it so much and just used the costumes I liked best or had upgraded most recently. You also need to heal your party after fights otherwise damage taken rolls over to the next battle, but even this was never an issue I needed to adjust my tactics for. You can just eat some candy at any point to replenish health or visit a water fountain. In the end, combat started to become the tedious bits in between the story and exploring. As slight as the fetch quests and trick or treating that make up the bulk of the non-fighting sections are, I still did it all with a big grin on my face. The world is just so cute and charming that I was irresistibly compelled to play on and poke my nose into every little corner of the game. The story was enjoyably bizarre and presented well (it follows on directly from the CQ1 DLC, Grubbins on Ice). It’s frequently very funny and features a twist that had me giggling so much I dropped my controller. I spent a silly amount of time running around being a jerk honking a loud clown horn in people’s face, trying to initiate diplomatic talks with everyone and hitting alligators with candy buckets. That this is a game that encourages such childishness can only be a good thing in my opinion. It may not be for everyone, but if you’re after a game that captures the child like glee of getting caught up in an insane festival, then Costume Quest 2 may be for you. It doesn’t do anything that its forbearer didn’t do, but it’s a game that boasts buckets full of wit and an incredibly adorable outlook that’s hard to dislike. After all, if it can make stone-hearted me appreciate Halloween in anyway, it has to be onto something.From my review for Coffee Break Gaming[www.coffeebreakgaming.co.uk].			"

												I loved Costume Quest 1 and I also love Costume Quest 2, just not as much. Many of the assest in Costume Quest 2 are reused from the first. Many of the villians are copied right from the first and changed ever so slighly, like giving one monster a lab coat, TADA!!!, totally a new mob. Another big downside is how worthless some of the costumes are. Many of them felt like they fit the same roles and it was pointless to switch out much besides in open world puzzles. For example the clown, pharaoh and the unicorn. The clown for the whole first half of the game beat the unicorn and Pharaoh by miles in the healing department. The Pharaoh, you get so late into the game, I no longer died and needed her resurrection heals. However after upgrading the unicorn, the clown become useless. The upgraded clowns AoE heal was = to the unicorns, but the unicorn also healed one extra party member for quite a bit more. The best part about Costume Quest 2 is the story. The humor in the game is spot on, and I loved all of the characters and how many jokes they fit in, for the kids and for the adults. Sadly five hours into the game I was already sick of the combat, and just wanted to move onto the next story section. I would suggest Costume Quest 2 for anyone who loved the first, or just want a kid friendly non-spooky Halloween game to play this time of year. For anyone else looking for a deep RPG, or fun combat, I would look some place else.			"

Much of the charm is still there, and the changes made to the gameplay were intelligent. Persistent health between fights only served to artificially extend game time as a restorative save point was always nearby.Highly recommended, but I'd wait for a sale.			"

												Costume Quest 2 has all the charm and humor of CQ1; I found myself laughing out loud a lot. However, the combat is not only just as tedious as the last time, there also seems to be more of it. There's also a huge difficulty spike in the last third of the game that's almost unfair - it's not really fun to hammer away at three enemies with twice your hit points every time you enter a battle. Its charm, however, outweighs that tedium, especially if played with a friend next to you and/or in short play sessions.Also, the graphics are great - the water deserves a special mention, I spent quite a bit of time stopping to look at it.

												If you like the first game you should like this one because it is basically more of the same. The only thing I don't like about this one are the timed attacks in combat. It reminds me of Super Mario rpg and that was about the only thing I didn't like in that game. It's fine though I guess but one other thing that bothers me is that combat takes a long time because you have a follow up attack on each attack that you can do, enemies have a lot of hp, and all attacks from you and the enemies take longer than in most games. Although I wish combat was quicker, it isn't too bad, especially since this is the type of game you only ever really play through once. I like the first game better because it seemed like it had more detail to the story and the world. This one seems to be a toned down version of the game, but it is still a fun game in its own right. Some of the reviews I've seen didn't like this game for whatever reason but like I said its basically about the same formula as the first one.7.5/10			"

The Combat was improved from the first game... though i wish the battle stamp system was still a thing... and being able to EAT candy to heal rather than having to walk all the way to a save point was a nice change of pace.

												I have a really hard time getting into games with JRPG style combat, which I've come to find pretty boring especially when coupled with endless grinding.I love the Costume Quest games despite that and feel like they're too short, if anything. I finished this one in about 10 hours so it might have been nice if they had indulged in a maybe just a bit of grinding if not some other form of padding.But even beyond the bucket loads of charm the series already has, I think this sequel is worth it alone just for the one quest chain where you build up your music cred playing the clown horn.Definitely recommended if you liked the first one.

The play mechanics are also different when it comes to collecting cards /stamps.It doesn't make it a bad game though! Just because something is changed doesn't mean it is a bad change.Battles are similar to the first game, and a bit easier in my opinion!If you like to collect like I do, then go for it!			"

Beautiful game, and although initally jarringly different to the combat system of the first game, it becomes very quickly a challenging and fun experience. Creating a squad with your 3 favourite costumes is a real treat (pun unintended...). So is upgrading the costumes - wish you could do it more than once...definitely will be drawing fanart for this game at some point. LOVE it. Sequel, Double Fine? Please? <3			"

												A group of youngsters face a future without Halloween after an evil dentist steals a relic which allows him to drastically alter the future by allowing monsters into the human world. These monsters live off the currency of candy, something that is now illegal for humans to consume. Desperate to save Halloween and prevent the dentists version of a utopia coming to fruition, the crew goes back in time (and then to the future, and then back again?? and then the future once more... and then... kinda jump between the two a couple more times trying to unlock that freaking solar system costume) and save Halloween using the only logical method of attack... turn based combat!Double Fine have a habit of making charming games that I love. They aren't perfect (except Psychonauts which literally is perfect and when I die I hope to be buried with it) but what they lack in one area they will more than make up for in story telling, character development and humour. I found that I take more screenshots playing Costume Quest games and DLC than any other game. Everything just looks gorgeous, not like a new AAA game where you can see every speck of dirt on the lead characters face, as he walks in a rain, with a lightning storm in the background and great lighting effects - no, not that. It's gorgeous because it's colourful and engaging. The world, be it cartoony, feels real. Honestly, I enjoyed the original more than the sequel but it's still worth playing if you're a fan of their work and want to support the developers. If you are not a fan or know nothing about Double Fine or their games, I would recommend starting with the original.			"

												Mainly recommended for fans of the first game. In some ways it's a little disappointing that this is so close to the original game. Combat is a little bit better and the treats cards are more useful but overall exactly the same as the first game. The format of going to different areas and trick or treating is the same as well but I find it very fun and don't mind it at all. Also, I'm a little surprised that the game didn't expand into new territory in terms of holiday themes. The first game was obviously Fall but the DLC Grubbins on Ice was set in the Winter and had Christmas themes and references. So I expected this to continue that theme and have Spring themes or Easter references, something like that but instead it returns to the original Halloween Fall theme. Which makes a lot of sense I suppose since it is the original premise for the game and where most of the themes come from.That said though, when the game was starting I was sort of disappointed in the way it looked like the story was being set up. A dentist wants to end Halloween and make candy illegal so everyone can have clean teeth so it's up to the kids to save Halloween. Are you kidding me? That's the most cliched holiday plot I've ever heard. So, I had a bad taste in my mouth starting out. However, I was really won over. The writing is very good. The side quests have really good plots and are fun to do and everything about the cliched main storyline ending up being better than I expected. The evil dentist ends up being a very tragic figure and ends up having a great character arc.If you're a fine of Double Fine and their writing style this is a very fun game and despite how much it repeats the first oen the combat and overall gameplay is a lot of fun. To really appreciate it you have to have played the first one though.			"

												Very fun little turn based RPG. Halloween is my favorite holiday, so this was a must. Played and beat the original a few years back and got this on sale for dirt cheap. Highly recommend if you enjoy the humor in Double Fine games or if you're looking for something short to get into.			"

												Costume Quest 2 is a sequel to the extremely fun and interesting kids' adventure embodied in the original Costume Quest. While the story of Costume Quest 2 is meant to continue on from the first game, and is meant to embody the same style, I would say that this sequel is not quite as strong as the original.I am an extreme fan for the first game and still really enjoyed this game, but it definitely has some big weaknesses. Note that I played both of the games back-to-back, so certain details stood out even more than they might have for years apart.An adventure RPG is here for you again, as you continue with the brother and sister from the first game, stuck in a bad world suddenly being taken over by a dentist of all people. You must fight your way through some returning monsters from the first game as well as robots created by the dentist to keep his world in check.Many of the mechanics of the first game still exist, such as using costume abilities to explore the map, the same player stats, the turn-based RPG battles... However, there are some tweaks here and there. In the first game, the only way to sprint across maps was to use the robot ability, which was a slight grievance to keep changing costumes. This game fixes that with its own designated button, thankfully. Further, in the previous game, most battles were triggered at specific points, with only a few sections having enemies walking along the map. This game now has many sections where enemies will run around on the map and you need to avoid them unless you want battle - and many of them respawn. That change is good for giving the maps more life, but bad in the sense that the game adds in some grinding.Other bigger changes are to the battle style. In the previous game, you mainly performed normal attacks and used the special powers when available. This game adds in a few changes to that: First, you can now run away from battles if you do not want to have them. Second, the developers removed Battle Stamps and you now find Treat Cards which allow for special attacks or powers in battle. You can equip 3 cards at a time and any character can use them. They can only be used once per battle, and each card has a different time limit before it can be reused (i.e., you must complete X number of battles). Third, when you perform attacks, you must now hit the attack button at an exact timing to perform more damage, which is much tougher than in the original game.Some of those battle changes make the game stronger, some make it weaker. One thing I particularly noticed is that the majority of battles take a lot longer than they did in the first game. The developers seemed to make enemies a lot stronger and you a lot weaker. (As a note, I did have one of my characters being the Candy Corn costume the whole game!)Besides the above, the rest of the game is pretty much the same, but this time not as fun. You explore the maps, use costumes to get around, and perform trick-or-treating a lot while also solving some side quests... While the first game was quite nice to do that exploration, it now became somewhat of a chore. The story of the game is not as well-done as the first, for many of the main characters only show up occasionally, and the game has a significantly smaller amount of conversations and funny dialog. Further, while the places of exploration are still nice in style, that lack of characters and events makes some of them particularly boring.If you enjoyed the first Costume Quest, you might still enjoy Costume Quest 2 to some ends, as I still did. But I definitely think that the developers fell behind on keeping the game consistent. The feeling of heart and charm that I had for the first game only happens sporadically for this one.			"

												EhCostume Quest 2 is the sequel to costume quest and it is pretty apparent as the game is pretty much a reskin of the first game with some gameplay changesStoryThe game continues off of the DLC (I think) of the previous game where you have to go and free the future from an oppressive dentist while going through the past. It's a bit weird (But then again, so was the story of the first game). However, I think the first game had more charm. It was about halloween and monsters rather than time traveling dentist dystopias. Not bad but not really good eitherGameplayIt's been gutted and changed. You still only have one basic attack and one special attack. However, now it involves timing and your damage depends on how close you hit it to the indicator. You can also block and counter although they have their own disadvantages. The one thing that I really didn't like is that the status cards are no longer applied to characters. Instead, you have to play them in game (which wastes a turn). This turns down the amount of customization each characters has (which is already pretty low) and I wish they really didn't change it.Graphics/PerformanceThe game ran at a smooth 60 with a 4790K, GTX 970, and 16GB of ram. It looks much better than the previous game (Especially the water reflections). When you zoom into a character, it looks a bit.. cartoony but that's just the play style.Final thoughts.Overall, it's basically part 2 of a game with a different combat engine. It wasn't bad but there is just so much freaking combat and it gets old really fast. I was just rushing through to finish it and didn't want to do the side quests like the first game. Play it if you really want to  "

												The changes that Costume Quest 2 brings are evolutionary rather than revolutionary, but they're also on-the-whole smart and serve to make it a more well-rounded experience than the original, if a little less surprising.Changes to the combat are largely successful - damage types, combo attacks and the trading cards all make things a little more interesting and varied than it was before, providing more meaningful decisions in battles. It's not deep by any means, but it was enough to sustain my interest over the 6 hours or so that it took me to see the end. It was also good to see special meter retained between battles, although the retaining of damage between battles mainly just provided a chore of going back to water fountains regularly to recharge. Luckily, there's pretty much always one nearby. Elsewhere the game has all the charm we've come to expect. A graphical uplift makes the already lovely, stylised visuals even sharper, and the time-travelling plot provides opportunity for a wide variety of locations. Peter McConnell is back for the soundtrack, which stood out to me as one of his finest, with the themes in the past area making particularly fine use of slide guitar. The humour is endearing rather than uproarous, which suits the tone of the game well. It would have been nice if they'd had a budget for voice acting, as I'd love to hear this world come to life in that way, but we can't have it all.Over all, a highly successful sequel which doesn't do too much to the formula, but makes smart changes where it can and doesn't overstay its welcome.

												Halloween + RPG + Humor = Costume Quest. This is as fun and charming as the first costume quest. If you loved the first one you will love the second one. It has an improved battle system with more reaction. Three Creepy Treats cards can be used during battle that have different effects (they regenerate so don't be afraid to use them). Also there are a bunch of new costumes for you to wear and use.			"

And all the costumes have the same quick time events in order to land a good attack or defend.

												The main difference between the two Costume Quest games mostly lies in story and settings, and not much on gameplay that is very similar.Since I really liked the first episode, I should have appreciated this one; because once I have found an engaging gameplay, I really like to play it again in sequels. But in a strange way, Costume Quest 2 had a complete opposite effect on me.Maybe it's because of the long launch, the counter-intuitive main screen, the ""knock on doors for candies or combat"" part or the ""too-fine / too hard"" controls, I don't know. I felt the pleasurable experience from the first Costume Quest somewhat vanished.Even if I do appreciate hard and punishing games that presents tough challenges, doesn't help you a bit, and reward your efforts with mastery; I wasn't expecting Costume Quest 2 to challenge me that much when I only wanted a laid-back, relaxed play time.

I'm playing it only because I bought it. I really enjoyed the first Costume Quest and I feel this is a let down. If you want to see gameplay and know the story, just watch lets plays.

												Costume Quest 2 feels exactly the same as the original game, which is not a bad thing if you're a fan of the original. The sequel continues the story where the original game left off with the same characters. The sequel did not have the same Halloween vibe as the first one did for me, which made going through the game not as enjoyable as I wished. If you enjoyed the first one it's worth playing the second one, however if you could barely get through the first one then I would recommend avoiding the sequel. Overall, it was pleasant to see the Costume Quest storyline continued in a sequel however it does feel like a large expansion pack rather than a sequel on its own.			"

												If you are aiming to play this on a Mac, without an Xbox controller, I really urge you not to bother. I think it's an absolute joke that Double Fine are allowed to include that Apple icon in the description.I adored Costume Quest, but there are many changes in the sequel that haven't improved the game and the new controls make it very uncomfortable to play. For example, WASD has replaced the arrow keys for movement. Fine, but when you have to use E to pail-bash and Shift to skate, my left hand is doing way too much work and my right hand is just hanging out at home like it's not invoted to the party. It's painful.The fight sequences are dull now. They've tried to add more features but for some reason it just feels more repetitive. I havent even got as far as using the treat cards in fights due to how frustrating the controls are.To top it all off, on A Mac the entire right third of the screen is...well I don't know what's going on there but it ain't working. It's black or greyed out. I have to change the resolution to fix it. Every. Time. I play.I feel like I've tried my best with it but, no. What a massive disappointment. I actually want my money back if these issues are not fixed.			"

												Costume Quest 1 was a cute, simple and very tedious game.  Costume Quest 2 seemed to double-down on the tedium while losing some of the charm, as I couldn't even finish the first area before uninstalling.  Fights are simple but very long and feature timed button presses against HP-sponge enemies.  They are all long and boring and samey in the worst way.  It's hard to believe someone at Double Fine didn't see the problem here, but I'm guessing they knew it was a bad design choice but were more afraid of being accused of releasing a short game than a tedious one since people that play games would rather slog through garbage for dozen of hours than have fun for a few.Even the writing in the bit I played didn't seem as fun as the original, and even exiting the game is strangely tedious if you don't force quit out of it.  Costume Quest 2 is a really disappointing game that apparently learned nothing from the flaws of its predecessor.			"

The only complaint I would have is probably that the healing costumes (like the clown) become very unnecessary due to how over powering you can be compared to your opponents (even the final boss). Still, for the price of a premiere 3D movies now a days, this is a great deal for even as little as 6 hours of gameplay (fastest I've heard anyone play through it yet).

												I'm going to be perfectly honest; this game took me a while to warm up to. The original Costume Quest was one of my favorite games of all time, so the changes that were made to gameplay weren't all that welcome at first. As I played the game, though, and let go of my prejudice, I discovered a really great game with a cute story and some really cool mechanics. While I'm not sure it surpasses the first game, it does serve as a good continuation of the Costume Quest tale. While I may have gone into this game shy, I had grown to thoroughly love it by the end. I have a feeling I will be playing through it every Halloween along with the original and Grubbins on Ice, and I'm really happy to have it in my collection.Pros:+Really cute story, with well-written characters and an enjoyable story arc+Picks up right where the first game and DLC leave off. The continuation feels nicely organic.+Costume upgrades were a nice touch, both in how they improve the costumes and the physical changes that occur+Classic Double Fine humor+The musical score fits really well with the game, and functions better in places than the original in my opinion+All characters can use the skate shoes now+Some of the new costumes are simply fantastic+Candy CornNeutral:=The game can be short if you don't explore endlessly or grind for candy and experience=The game bosses seem underwhelming compared to the first, and don't put up much of a challenge=Somewhat requires you to have played the first game and the original DLC=The new Paper Mario style combat is a wild departure from the first. I think I preferred the original combat as the different costumes required different combat quick time events, but the combo system in this version is welcome.Cons:-The new Creepy Treat card mechanic isn't as much fun for me as the old battle stamps-You no longer auto-heal after combat, meaning you're always running back to a fountain to heal. There is an option to eat candy to heal instead, but it never seems worth the cost until after you've bought everything you can.-No bobbing for apples game			"

												If you played CC1, then maybe just wait on the next sale before picking this up. The two games are very similair, and to be frank, this feels more like extended DLC, than a sequel. The game can also be a little buggy, and the keys can be awkward on a keyboard.That being said, the dialouge is still quite good; and the story is rather fun. The cherry on top is some of the new costumes, even if the abilities have all been recycled.			"

												tl;dr: there are some minor issues, but still completely worth your money.I played through the entire game in about 6 hours, with my girlfriend playing the WiiU version at the same time. The WiiU version seemed to have some occassional audio bugs where I (with the PC version) encounted some clipping issues on some stages (which was actually kind of cool, but potentially game-breaking). Because of this, and the somewhat ""floaty"" controls (at least in the PC version, with xbox 360 controller), the game doesn't feel like it had all it's bugs squashed. Some things could be a be ""tighter"", but doesn't really detract from the game's playability.The platform costume exclusives (PS3/Steam pre-order) are annoying. Give me the option to buy them as DLC, I don't care; I'll buy them. Just give me the option.CQ2 is roughly the same length as CQ1. It's also roughly as hilarious and fun. I laughed out loud so many times during this game. The writing is great and there are a tons of fun easter eggs and references. Buy it if you liked CQ1 and want more of the same. If you want Skyrim, go play that instead, I guess.			"

												It was a good game... until the bedroom.Everything was going great: I had just grabbed the talisman, and I was going to leave... but the door doesn't even f***ing work! I tried to walk through it, and there IS no leaving the room! That's pretty much the end of hte game. THere is no escape route. If someone knows Im wrong, please, tell me how to get the h*** out of the room... I would LOVE to know!So, 2/5 for this game. Too many bugs, collision avoidance is crap, and the # of enemies is just ridiculous, due to the fact that they are easily avoided.Ok, now for the actual review:Costume Quest 2 was, to be the nicets possible, ok. I mean, it was never really my kind of game to begin with. HOWEVER, it did leave an impression.I suggest playing the first game AFTER you play the second game. Playing the first game before this one kind of ruins the second game, because Costume Quest 2 doesn't even have a PRAYER to live up to #1.The enemies are bull. They really are. The further you get into the game, the easier it becomes to avoid them, and the more you start to realize the boss fights are the only real battles you need to be concerned about.There wasn't enough to it. The game didn't have enough to keep me enteratined, and it became over-repetitive REALLY fast. The fact that they implemented their exploration abiltiies in such unique ways (like the squeaky horn getting them the money to get the boat ""fixed"") made the exploration abilities INTERESTING, but it seemed just too easy to get the costumes with said abilities. I wasn't even TRYING to get the Hot Dog costume: it just sort of happened.I hope they don't make a 3rd. Let me just put that out on the table. The first game (sounds) awesome, the second game was more of a drag than the 1st... they would TOTALLY butcher the third. $500 says so.Anyway, this game isn't recomended. It wasn't good enough to appeal to ME, and my expectations are LOW. Use your $10 to buy something worthwhile: you'd be better spent bying the first one for hecks sake. Costume Quest Staff: were you even TRYING?!!			"

This game is very nice and a good continuation picking up from the extended end of Costume Quest.Emphasis on ""nice' and ""Good"", not outstanding (like the original). If you liked the first game, you will probably find this one good too...Having played the first for the first time soon before playing Costume Quest 2, I can say that the first game had a lot more charm and better writing and attention to detail. The story seems less Halloween-centric even though it says it is, it loses some spirit trying to add scale. The sequel also relies on hints, tells, and story elements that are very dependent on the first game making it feel like it cant stand on its own.Costume Quest 2 feels like the DLC for Costume Quest 1 did, sorta tacked together in the same world but not as much heart or attention put in it, its the little things that seemed to be missed or stand out, unlike the original (I'm not talking graphics persee)I truly feel something was lost, I chuckled or smiled a bit in Costume Quest 2, but I played Costume Quest not a week before, and I was smiling and laughing my butt off. It just felt drawn out after a while, and a great example of this, compared to the last fights of Costume Quest 1, which were awesome and funny and sorta epic, the last fight, heck most of the boss fights in 2 were sorta boring, leaving me pining for more.That isn't to say Costume Quest 2 isn't good, they try to shake up the combat a bit and have different ways to power up your characters and it has many many many nods to the original game, almost to the point of head scratching at times. I think the game sorta took itself too seriously, even though it was also being ridiculous. Also, I can see they were trying to make the game ""more rewarding through skill"" but in so doing, they made the game dismally easy in the process.I have a feeling, and this is my opinion, that this game may have been DLC for the original, based on the content (aka, the excessive reuse) I witnessed.All in all, the style and shading and detail has changed a little bit, subjectively to its detrement or benefit, and the game plays in a more active fashion than before, making the player react more during turns than the original. Engine wise and concept wise it actually has not greatly progressed from the original and I beat the game with a feeling that this was ""expanded DLC"" of the original, it uses and relies on the original too much to consider it as it's own game, really.Costume Quest is a game that revels in Halloween, the sequel does not, and though it is not bad, it doesn't fufil my cravings like the original did.

												Costume Quest 2 is superior to the original, as it improves upon many of the gameplay mechanics that it introduced. Here's what CQ2 boasts:+ A new combat system.Anyone who's played CQ1 will tell you that that game's battle system was not the most exciting. It required you to perform quick time events to increase the damage output of your attack or the damage reduction of your block. Instead, CQ2 now requires you to press a single button at a precise moment to do the same. This sounds terrible but actually the timing is brutal with its precision and messing it up can and will screw you over, especially when you get into the realms of needed precise timing to be able to do counter attacks and double hits.That said, much like the original CQ, you will run on autopilot eventually, as the precise timing will soon turn into muscle memory.+ Many different areas.This is either a hit or a miss, as the original CQ had only three areas, however each area was unique and really well made. In CQ2, there are now several areas that can sometimes seem a bit samey. They're all great to look at, but do sometimes feel like a chore to navigate.The new addition of maps is fantastic, and I've heard complaints of people saying they would prefer it if the map told you where you were, but I didn't mind that. What I had a problem with was that the maps looked like♥♥♥♥♥♥ but once you orientate it in your head, finding your position is easy.+ Enemy classes.The original CQ had four uncredited enemy classes: ranged, melee, support magic and offensive magic. Here, they are now monster, tech and magic (the two magic classes have been fused together so healers can now cause lots of damage, as if they weren't irritating enough!). The relevance of this is that each costume has a class that it is stronger against (will do more and take less damage) and weak against (will do less and take more damage). This is actually quite a nice addition as I used to prioritise enemies to eliminate with my strongest costumes and then finish off the weaker ones with my weaker costumes, but now the game is forcing me to do that and it's much easier to figure out how it all works.+ Many new costumes.Some of them are just reskinned old ones, the ghost is the ninja, the pharaoh is the pirate and unicorn, and even the new hotdog and wizard seem similar to each other. But they do work differently by now having new costume specialisations. As well as healing, attacking and defense, you also have splash damage and ressurection costumes, among others.+ Upgradable costumes.Costumes can be upgraded for a large sum of candy by talking to Shady. It's unclear when upgrades are available or how they are unlocked, but they are useful, acting as permanent buffs and changing the model of the costume slightly.+ The robot's skate ability is now in every costume.'Nuff said.+ Useful Creepy Treats Cards.Gone are battle stamps, my friend, Creepy Treats Cards are all the rage now! Every Creepy Treats Card has an effect that can be activated in battle, which requires a cooldown to be used in later battles. You swap out which cards you take into battle outside of combat in your logbook. The effects are more interesting than the old battle stamps, such as ""Next minion to attack this hero is defeated"", ""Double XP at the end of battle"" and ""Mute a minion's magic attacks"" to name but a few. I mostly used the 'double XP' and 'instant death upon attacking hero X' ones and wasn't particularly interested in the others. I will say I preffered the art design for the Creepy Treats Cards from the original CQ.+ Story.The story continues immediately after Grubbins on Ice, and if you thought the first two stories were ridiculous, take a gander at this one. Dr. White the dentist has made a deal with a Time Wizard to go back in time to when he was a child to steal a talisman from two witches in a bog that used to exist before Auburn Pines which stops monsters from Repugia entering the human world so he can create his metropolis of a clean teeth utopia and rid the world of Halloween and candy forever.Sounds ridiculous but its actually very interesting to watch and its great to be along for the ride. What's more, I have a soft spot for watching characters I know and love grow up, and CQ2 nails that when you travel to the future and meet a married Lucy and Everett.With all of that said, CQ2 isn't perfect. There is a big black hideous tumour growing on the side of its face, resembling an awful new game mechanic that wasn't needed and really detracts from the experience. Those who have played CQ2 know I'm talking about the fountain drinking.Your health does not recover after battle, unless you level up. So to recover your health to full, you have to drink from a water fountain. This means that every couple of battles you will have to backtrack to the nearest fountain just to have a drink, only to go back to where you were and continue. It's really easy to avoid fights if you don't rush it so you pretty much won't get molested on the way to the fountain, and running away from fights teleports you to the nearest fountain anyway!It's really dumb and doesn't add anything to the gameplay, other than an annoyance to have to backtrack. Plus, when you enter a new area, your first priority is to find either Shady or a fountain, as any area entered for the first time spawns a map for purchase from Shady. So if you find Shady, buy the map and you'll see where the fountain is. If you find the fountain first, remember where it is.Overall, Costume Quest 2 is fantastic. Fans of the original will adore this game, and like Costume Quest before it, I can see myself giving this game multiple playthroughs. It took me about 7.4 hours to beat first time round, when the original CQ and its DLC combined takes about 6. Both of those times are taking all quests completed into account.			"

												Costume Quest 2 is by every definition of the word, a sequel.Before playing this game you have to play the first game, and the DLC, Grubbin's on Ice. You will have no idea what's going on if you don't, as it starts directly after the end of Grubbin's on Ice.It feels just like the first one too, in the best and worst way possible. It follows the same formula that the original game does, so it just feels more like more of the same. While that's not entirely a bad thing, it does make the game forgettable and it makes you feel like you've already done everything before.If you enjoyed the first one, you'll likely enjoy this one too, but maybe not quite as much.

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Costume Quest 2 is an adventure game developed by the wonderful people behind Stacking, Brutal Legend and Grim Fandango: Remastered; Double Fine Productions and published by Majesco Entertainment and Midnight City. Double Fine Producitons once again hits the nail yet again with their cleverly designed and well thought out gameCostume Quest 2 continues right after the ending of Costume Quest which I won't spoil here. Across the game's worlds you have to go and knock doors to ask for candy. Sometimes you will get regular human beings who give you candy, sometimes its the nasty Grubbins which it will send you into an RPG button prompt combat system. The combat system is sort of fun but can get very repetitive and boringThis game, the same with Stacking, is meant for people unlike me who are known as completionists. Completionists will have a ball playing Costume Quest 2 and leveling up. The game's graphics are really cute and well designed, the music is nothing special but it is good neverthelessCostume Quest 2 is the same as Costume Quest, it is very repetitive. Expect to enter the boring combat system multiple times and doing the same thing which is trick or treating can get boring and repetitive too. The game is okay at first but it can be impossible to finish if you are not leveled up properlyCostume Quest 2 has some improvements from the first game but also has some new or the same issues that Costume Quest suffered with that made me not enjoy it. Costume Quest 2 however is certainly more enjoyable and entertaining yet somewhat repetitive at certain points and is certainly better than Costume Quest RECOMMENDED :)  "

												An extremely dull sequel.  This is the worst kind of boring tripe, it improves on nothing and adds next to nothing (apart from an almost useless map).  It feels just like an expansion pack for the first game.  This is a pure ""phone it in"" sequel.  The combat is almost identical but they managed to make it worse since you have to now pick a sticker rather than have them on your characters.  The enemies are blander than the first game and your own attacks are duller.  One character even refuses to fight.  It also shamelessly repeats the gameplay from the first game, hint to Double Fine, finding six kids that are NOT hidden at all is not fun.  All too quickly I became bored and avoided combat.  This is terrible sequel that is mired in its own blandness.I bought it in the sale and still feel ripped off.  Buy the first game instead (this game assumes you've played that one anyway).			"

												I feel like this series could have done without a sequel. You start out the whole game with no idea what the plot is but all the characters know. You never get the backstory of some of the people.The battle play was dumbed down and is now pretty boring. I don't need to pay attention because each character has one button and the attack never changes. The first game used different buttons and you had to remember what move on  your buttons went with what attack and which character. The creepy cards are obnoxious. They don't always clearly state how long they last and the whole 'wait two battles!' is pointless. I can just replace the card. The battle stamps were much better thought out. Also. This is just a little pet peeve but there isn't anyway to skip the cutscenes Before every. flippin. battle. I'm getting real sick of watching Wren turn into a clown. -_-Overall... I'm pretty disappointed. "

												Costume Quest 2 has a lot going for it over the original: an epic time travelling story, more detail in the art, more varied (and awesome) locations, more variance in the (already excellent) soundtrack, and you now meet new characters for the third person in your party based on what time period you are in.   Don't worry about having to go to a fountain to heal yourself after battle, which would mean you need to backtrack, as this isn't the case.  You can also heal yourself by eating candy at any time.I just finished Costume Quest 2, and I ended up liking it even more than Costume Quest and Grubbins on Ice (which I already liked a lot).			"

												Wow, this runs so bad i wanna smash my eyes in. First of all I got this free so im not complaining, second I downloaded it and i started it up and held a solid 5fps. I have a nice gaming laptop too, can run bf4 high-ultra 1080p at 70-80fps. But this game, it seems after the windows 10 update all the games are just garbage and can't run at all. If devs fix the compatibility with win 10 then it'll be awesome.			"

												Having enjoyed Costume Quest I was looking forward to this sequel coming out - and I wasn't disappointed! Costume Quest 2 is a refinement of the good parts of the first game (goofy colourful fun, simple mechanics with many permutations) remixed with some more modern handheld RPG elements (items with a single use per battle, reaction based attack bonuses).The puzzles are straight forward enough that anyone should be able to solve them but are still difficult enough to require some thought and experimentation. The only exception to this is the final optional costume which involves a fairly obtuse solution, though thankfully it isn't required to complete the game.I found the combat system intuitive and forgiving. While the attacks now require carefully timed button presses it is still easy to get a Nice! damage bonus, which is more than sufficient to progress in the game. The best bonus is Amazing! but it is effectively impossible to get consistently. There have been complaints of input lag making combat difficult but I have not witnessed this with either the keyboard or a gamepad.My only real complaint is that it is a bit shorter than I was expecting, but it still took 6 hours on my first playthrough - that's just less than £2 per hour (assuming you don't play it again) or about the same value as a cinema ticket.If you want a silly, day long distraction for the younger generation then this will do you well. There won't be much replay value unless you are a completionist but, unlike other games, it is still possible to get all the costumes and achievements in a single sitting.			"

												First of all, if you haven't played the original, go do that. It's a simple but charming game. The battle mechanics are very bare bones but it's art style and humor make it worth while.This sequel is basically ""more of the same"", but it's a missing a little of the nice touches of the first. The battles have been tweaked a little, but are still very simple and basically still a matter of choosing the target and timing the QTEs. There are reusable cards for effects the special actions, but in-depth combat is not what this series is known for. While the gameplay maybe slightly improved, some of the other charming aspects don't resonate as well as in CQ1. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what is missing since it's on the subjective area, but in the end it didn't have the same impact on me. It still is ""nice enough"" game, but not on par with the original.---In the end, while Costume Quest 2 is a somewhat uninspired sequel with only a few tweaks, it's still enjoyable, but only for fans of the first one. It's a short game, but priced accordingly, and probably a good pick on sales.			"

												I just finished Costume Quest 1 and was excited to play #2. It took me quite some time to get things set where my computer would play the game. I had to make my resolution very low and remove shadows, etc. to get it to run. I still can barely use my mouse to move the cursor at menus :(  I am having a lot of trouble in combat with the lag from my keyboard but think I can eventually learn to work with it. I also was glad I had someone that had already played it some to tell me how to enable my arrow keys for moving. (It's in the key section of the menu - not the control part). I do miss being able to press the <shift> key and not watch the cut scenes going into battle - the videos are fun the first time but when you have to fight someone multiple times since you keep getting defeated, it gets tediousIn spite of the difficulties, I am still excited to play it and think it will be fun. I pre-purchased it so hope I find out where/how to get the free extra costumes. So, I will give it a ""thumbs up"" because it will be fun, but wish I could give a ""thumbs down"" for how it runs on my computer. I have a fairly new Windows 8 machine with plenty of memory that has no other issues.			"

												Not as good as the first costume quest in the slightest. They took away the fun badges and gave us crappy treat cards instead which i hardly used the entire game. With a game which time traveling is a major plot point, i found it funny and ironic that there is no backtracking like the first game's coffins. If you miss a quest or a costume piece, your basically screwed until your next playthrough. The game is extremely laggy at times. It would flucuate between 60fps and 30fps throughout the entire game, All in all, i had fun with the game because i am such a huge fan of the original. I'll still recommend the game to you guys, but be aware, this game feels like a gimped version of its former self.			"

It was almost perfect.The fight mechanics were way better, the ending was beautiful, and the story was great and actually kinda SAD!The only REAL problem I had with it tho was the setting. I'm kinda tired of time travel, but that's probably MY problem as I just bought the Back To The Future-games ;) But still, I'd like it if we either visited MORE ""times"", or at least visited some places for more than 15 minutes.

												Back in for another sugary bite of RPG goodness. If you played the original then you know what's in store ... a cute Halloween-themed story interspersed with turn-based quick-time style combat. While I preferred the battle stamps to the creepy cards (due to having to manage your hand) and the different quick-time combat meters of the original, I still found Costume Quest 2 to be a fun successor. The story was enjoyable and the visuals on par with CQ1. It was entertaining enough that I won't mind having another go through to root out the remaining achievements.			"

If you couldn't look past the flaws of the original Costume Quest I doubt this game will win you over. However, if you greatly enjoyed the original Costume Quest's humour and charm (as I did), you will have a blast playing this game.			"

TL;DR: This is a nostalgia game for those who liked the first Costume Quest and is, therefore, highly recommended to them. Technically, it is a prequel/sequel, but favors the sequel side.Fine grained dissection:Lots of cameos from the first game in the prequel section of this game, but they could've gone more in depth with the character backstories.The sequel section of the game is more thoroughly explored and even has a fair amount of closure unlike the blatant cliff hanger at the end of the first Costume Quest. This, alone, makes it worth the buy, though maybe when it is on sale, if you can wait.As for the execution of the game, it's visually stunning compared to the first Costume Quest, otherwise, it is very similar. There are many new worlds and costumes which are fantastic additions to the Costume Quest universe, but the battle system hasn't been changed so much as to be mind blowingly new.[Begin battle system dissection] Having that said, like some, I also hardly ever used the new Creepy Treat system (unless I was grinding for candy, even then, I only used the candy boosts) because it is not that relevant to the outcome of the battle. In fact, you essentially waste a turn using them. [/end]It is possible though not entirely necessary to grind for candy in this version, which can be...painful. Having Candy Corn battle will make or break the grind sessions. Near the end of the game, you get around 200 pieces of candy per battle (more the higher your level), but the cost of things is so high that it is still classified as grinding.There are still some mild bugs, such as cutscene transition speed-ups and quests occasionally breaking if you do not complete them in the right order, but it auto-saves so often that it is not a deal breaker.[Begin ending dissection]They went for an early Disney-esque ending where everybody is happy, but not everyone in the prequel side of the story was given complete closure. Nevertheless, the ending was vastly more concrete than the first Costume Quest, though it does leave a little wiggle room for something small, like DLC.[/end]			"

												Its cuteA 6 / 10 on my scaleCombat gets repeatitive, is very frequent, and enemy battles always run the risk of offing you if you get carelessStory is nothing to write home about, on par with the first gameLength - Took me 4 hours to beat it at ~100% completion.  Then I took a half hour wandering the ""kill screen"" final end ""credits"" before realizing that after talking to everyone multiple times, trying to enter a house, and the like nothing would end it...  Kind of a weak ending.  At least you don't have points of no return this time.Costumes - Lots to choose from, sadly only a handful have map interaction, the rest are just for kicks.  And you'll find yourself using just a couple in battle because they are so clearly better than the others.Graphics and gameplay are about what the first offered, if you want more of that then great.Basically, if you like me have a lot of disposable income and time.  Then check it out.  If you expect anything more than the first game, you will be sorely disappointed.Again6 / 10 - Above average, below greatwith 5 being the average kickstarter greenlight stuff you see nowadays, a 10 doesn't exist, and not nearly enough games get the 1-4 that they truely deserve.

												My review at www.yourgamesource.com where anyone becomes Gaming Press!So October has always been a haven for Halloween and indy horror games. This year is no exception, and the first big shot is from Double Fine Productions. They are better known for a nice little title called Psychonauts, as well as some amazing smaller titles like Stacking and Broken Age.Costume Quest 2 is obviously the sequel to Costume Quest from 2010, also in October. At the core it is a turn based RPG with multiple classes and monsters. The first one took about 8 hours to completely, and I'm about 3 hours into this one, and it seems like it going to be much longer! Candy is your currency, and trading cards are your accessories. To change your class, you just don a different costume, each with unique powers and weaknesses. From a clown with a nose horn to a Pterodactyl that blows away leaves. To the very amazing candy corn costume from the first game, that we never got to use. Now we get to, and to make up for it there is an achievement for using it in every battle of the game. I already failed that achievement this time around, because oh ya it is the tank of the game, it has no offense, cant use items, or anything. It just has a fairly high threat, and decent amount of defense.The premise of the series is to go door to door trick or treating, fighting monsters, and collecting candy. You use the candy to buy upgrades to your costumes, trading cards, and maps of areas. 11 new costumes and 4 classic costumes (pre-order bonus) make up your classes, ranging from offensive, defensive (seriously the candy corn doesnt do anything but soak damage!), and healers. As an added bonus, the roller skates from the robot costume of the original are permanent, and useable in any costume. Trading cards are now items, slightly replacing stamps. You can put 3 cards into your inventory, and then use them in battle. There is a wide range of options including double exp for the battle, heal to full at the end of the battle, when the enemy attacks they take damage from it as well, a character can go twice per turn, and many more. Maps, seriously they added maps. If you watch my stream of the first game, you can see in the expansion, I missed one house, and could not for the life of me figure out where it was. Probably spent 20 mins looking for it. The map now shows you all the houses that can be trick or treated, as well as healing wells, portals, the number of costume parts found/available, and secrets found/available. Quite a huge addition in my mind.Combat has had a few tweaks as well. Each character is assigned a button specific to them. It factors in on offensive and defensive sides of the battle. You now can combo a second hit, if timing on your first hit is decent. There are also two tiers of timed hits Nice and AWESOME, both give a bonus to the damage taken, and then roll over to a second hit, which also has a timing action. Defensive uses the same button for the character, and majorly cut down on the damage, just like the original. A big difference from the first is the special meter. Instead of just powering up for 2 turns and being available on the 3rd, it charges up with each attack you give and receive. So now instead of just rotating heals on boss fights, you have to actually think about when the best time to use them is. Each costume as has a strength and weakness associated with it. These correspond to the types of enemies, and give you a bonus or penalty to your attacks if they match up with the enemies type.This time around the story picks right up after the ending to the Grubbins on Ice expansion. After jumping into the portal to escape the Monster's home world, you go back to your home town. But things are different, apparently your parents moved next door for some unexplained reason (my theory is a different dimension, not developer error). You then see Oral White DDS and some dude with a clock on his neck jump into a portal and then reappear from it. Your candy bags from Halloween soon disappear and a strangely familiar face jumps out of yet another portal and asks you to jump in with him. For some inexplicable reason, you jump in. Turns out it is Everette, the Knight from the first game, who has grown up and married Lucy (like we didnt see that coming!). The future is crazy, Halloween, costumes, and candy are outlawed, monsters run the place, and all the houses have banners promoting tooth related things as if they were the local sports team.All in all the game has improved in many areas, still has the inside jokes, and political statements of the first. Was completely worth the $15 it costs on steam (or $20 if you want the original as well). Anyone who is a fan of the first, stacking, or DFP in general should give this game a serious look. If you want to see how the game plays, I have already streamed quite a bit of the game on the gamesource twitch and youtube channels, so take a look at them! The score that everyone wants to see is that the game is an 8.5 out of 10. The game is 'fun' but not great, and I'd rather have fun than great and boring. The timing on the attacks is a little annoying at times, and I've already encountered a few glitches (non game breaking, just graphical annoyance, and some candy you cant reach at times).			"

												A very good, hilarious game. If you enjoyed Costume Quest 1 or any other rpg you will definitely enjoy this. With nice graphics, fluid turn-based combat and a great story this is a must play game (Especially for Halloween).			"

												On my macbook pro, the game starts up with right-edge  screen content extending off the screen, so, for example enemy hitpoints canot be seen in combat. Changing the resolution casues repeated crashes. Booting into windows, the game runs super slowly and and the combat button timing seems off, so I can't get out of the tutorial.Please patch.			"

												The story of ""Costume Quest2"" is nothing the gun, the body and the blood.There are only fancy and cute materials.But, I've been excited!Many adventures are nostalgic slightly, and sad, too.Game system is similar old JRPG.I think you'll feel bored.I know, game system of recent RPG is real time.But, pretty costumes are amused you. You will not feel bored.If you get tired of the game playing now, I recommend that you play this.			"

												Right, now that I finished the game.  Time to give my impressions.So, would I still reccomend this game?  Yes.  And here's why.As I have mentioned before, the combat is been reworked a little, so instead of function selections it's actually QTE button attacks.  But there is a bit more variety than I first mentioned.  Not a whole lot, you can double attack and counter (if you can time the counter right).  But it still makes a faster pace to battles.The Battle Cards replace the Battle Stamps and Creepy Cards, you use the card like items in battle, which takes up one turn.  You can have up to three for selection at battle, and they take a number of battles to recharge (you can cheat this by restarting the game).  The cards vary from ""Enemy takes his own damage"", to ""Double Candy from Battle"", to ""Get healed 25 percent of your health for three turns"" etc.  You get these cards by drops, buying, chests, and trades.As I said before, the area's are expanded out quite a bit, but there is only two hub worlds you can play in.  But that's not bad though, there are big maps, and one would take up nearly 3 area's.  Exploration are well done, but near the end the game curves paths to more straight lines so it's easy to get to chests, kids, or quest items.Speaking of quests, not too much to offer.  If you played the first one, you'll know what to do in the second one.  If you haven't, it's mostly talk to this person, use this costume to find clues or get to new area's, play hide n seek.Story is alright.  It's nothing to write home about, but it doesn't have to be.  It made me chuckle and that's what I expected.And that's what I think of this game really, it's expected.  I'm rather glad most YT'ers are sorta overlooking this game, they probably would have chewed it up by the changes since the first one was very charming, and thus it will give them time to look at it for what it is and not what they want it to be.If your still on the fence, I would recommend a sale then, at least 30 percent off.  But as it being of Double Fine's first sequel ever?  I think it's alot better than I would have first though.  Give it a shot.			"

												This is a very good continuation of the series. If you liked the 1st CQ, you'll like this one.***Below is my review of CQ1. It holds true to CQ2 as well. There are very few changes other then the story.***This game is all about the charm. The story isn't the same ol' derivative RPG story. The characters & setting are very enjoyable. I especially enjoyed playing this during Halloween, It put me in the holiday spirit.As an RPG there's nothing truely ground breaking here. The combat is ok, It's a class based system. Classes are selected through a series of costumes. Some costumes have healing abilities, some are damage/crowd control & others are defensive. It may sound unique & interesting, but the battles generally all go the same way due to the fact that your abilities are not able to be activated till the 3rd round. Damage for 3 rounds, if the enemy is still up, stun heal & damage battle over.I'm a fan of Tim Schafer's work, but I'm going to rate his work on it's own merits. This game is fun & charming & I would recommend it, but I would say wishlist it & wait for a sale.			"

												Yay, long awaited!So I've been waiting for years when I hear the 'rumour' that a sequel will be coming out. Been counting down the days and I finally get to play it. Since the Costume Quest was released 3-4years ago, playing this made me reminisce a little. The game play is a little slow but the characters are pretty interesting. Here's my first walk through ever, hope to give people an idea of the game play!

I highly recommend this game, but you really should play through the Costume Quest 1 before you play this one. My only complaint is that when you get out of a battle, you are not healed so you have to go all the way to the beginning of the map to get a drink from the water fountain.8/10_____________________________________________________________Edit:When I first bought this game, you couldn't eat the candy to heal.

												I really liked the first Costume Quest, but I like this one even more! The gameplay has evolved a little bit, with special moves and strengths/weaknesses giving the battles a bit more strategy than they had before. I'm not really a hardcore RPG player, so I wouldn't have wanted them to make things too complicated, but it's enough that it felt like a step up from the first game.Story-wise, I actually found this entry to push things just a bit further. The story takes more dramatic twists and turns I found far less predictable, the characters felt more ""far-out"" and less suburban, and some of the later story moments featuring the antagonist made me laugh out loud more than any one moment from the previous game.If you'd like a not-too-hard, fun little romp that brings back all those warm-fuzzies of Trick or Treating as a kid, you can't do better than either Costume Quest game.

												So I can see why Costume Quest 2 is considered not as good as the first. So here is what they did right Vs. What they did wrong.The right1. They kept it cute and charming.2. The story is interesting.3. The time travel mechanic was done well. 4. Seeing the characters from past to future was clever. 5. The new and old enemy designs are cool.6. The new costumes were innovative and well thought out. 7. Using Creepy Treat Cards for a benefit in battle was a good change of pace.8. Certain enemies are stronger or weaker to different costumes. The Wrong1. The change in battle style was unnecessary and was many times just difficult to use. 2. The ending basically ret·cons everything you do. Making what happened in the first one not even matter.3. Only 3 of the Creepy treat cards are useful from my point of view. What they should have done.If they changed the fight style the way it is with certain enemies being stronger or weaker to certain types of costumes. Then to balance it with the annoying combat style they should have made it to where you use a turn in the middle of battle to swap your costume. Similar to switching a party member in certain RPGs. Still this game took me about 9 hours to complete, it's not that expensive. Granted mine was a gift, and it's fun enough to replay. I give it 3.5 out 5			"

												Just finished the game.In short, this game has a personal style.Strongpoints:-The story is simple but the details are intricate.The past causes correspond perfectly to the future ending.-And one thing interesting about a time travel is that you have many  possibilities to reverse the whole story.That inspires me to move on and hold on, though some quests & acheivements are miserable to complete.-The graphic style just like CQ1,I like it very much.-And I also love the music in CQ1&2.Whenever you guys release a soundtrack I will definitely buy one!-Comparing to CQ1, this game makes NPCs much more alive &humorous.Alway enjoy talking with them!And quests need you to do that!Or you will miss some quests,espeically the solar system costume.Shortcomings:-Some quests & acheivements are miserable to complete.-Sometime battle speed & waiting the door to open run slowly when I use my laptop to play it;-Some costume are interesting,but others just look like those old ones in CQ1 with different surfaces.-Can not avoid the repeated quest &story pattern in CQ1.The secrect's idea is new,but it is boring sometimes.-It has a much more complex battle system&cards usage,so it takes me a lot of  time to get used to. But you don't have to use cards to win the final battle,so what's the meaning of cards?(except collection)Rating： 7/10I love this game&Iook forward to CQ3!Hope CQ3 has a obvious improvement.( CQ2's DLC is also welcomed :)			"

												After completing Costume Quest 1 earlier this year, I was looking forward to playing 2 and grabbed it in the Halloween sale. If you want to know about that one, I suggest you go read my review on it as a lot is similar.Just like the first game, this is a wonderfully quirky game with so many jokes that I was frequently laughing out loud. In particular, the Candy Corn costume always made me giggle, despite reading the joke 50+ times. There was less meta-humour in this one than the first, but it was never boring.The combat is very similar to the first, but improved overall. There is now only a single form of attack (compared to various QTE-styles in the first game), but they've added additional mechanics like countering that add another dimension to combat. They also added 'actor types' which are a basic form of strengths and weaknesses split between 3 classes; it sounds odd, but it's easy to understand and it adds a tactical edge.Like with CQ1, however, I did tend to stick to the first costume you get and swap out the third as I went (the second was always Candy Corn for the achievement), but as the visuals are interesting and the cutscene moves are now skippable, that isn't too big an issue.One issue I should mention is this game was very easy. I only failed perhaps two fights (and one was because of a glitch), but I did do some grinding in places for XP and candy (in-game currency). The boss fights were very straight forward and fit SO MUCH better into the flow of the game compared to the almost puzzle-like ones in CQ1.The story is clever and moves on from the first with just enough nods and references to 1 to induce nostalgia. They would, however, go over the heads of anyone who hasn't played 1, so definitely play that before this. It is a sequel in every sense.This was a fantastic game that kept all the good feelings I had for 1 and added to them, creating its own individual experience that fits beautifully into the Costume Quest universe.Well worth your time, money and laughter.

												If you liked the first one you will like this one too. It didn't fix some of the problems, like repetitivity, that the first one had aswell, but it made some progress. I suggest playing it in the ""Hardcorn mode"" to make it a little bit more challenging, cause as the previous one this game ain't hard enough, probably by choice... as this is a simple Rpg game that can be enjoyed by anyone. Graphic and soundtrack are better. It has it's flaws but i've enjoyed it enough to 100% it. Ps. I suggest to play this right after playing the first one cause there's a lot of connections and absolutely no recap.			"

												Finished Costume Quest and bought Costume Quest 2 immediately. This game was fun to play. Some quests were easy to do, others were hard - which required a certain amount of time to explore the whole area. What I don't like about this game is the combat system. I am more on the Costume Quest combat system, which has a variety of different combat combos. This game is just ""pressing (the number) at the right time"" and done. The graphic was better then the first one, the story took place in different timelines, which was pretty interesting. There was not as many bosses compared to the first one. This made my gameplay less fun. Overall, it is worth to buy and play, but do not expect the combat system to be good.			"

												If you have played the first game then you know exactly what to expect from this game. Just like the first game, if you love the classic turn based RPG's and comical adventures, then you should really enjoy this shorter game.First off, the game continues immediately where the first games DLC ended. Literally starts at that cliffhanger ending. After you have saved Halloween and your friends, you enter a portal to return home but end up coming back a few months earlier. As you start Trick or Treating again you find out about a plot to get rid of the holiday and its costumes. So now you are on a quest to save Halloween again! Unfortunately, the game is really short. It is not too much bigger the the DLC. In my opinion, this would of been a great DLC instead of a sequel.The levels in the game still have that incredibly detailed cartoonish feel. The level of detain in each area is outstanding. However, there are fewer locations and they are not as diverse. The look of the costumes all look much smoother and better detailed in combat. However, the costumes outside of combat do not look as ""horribly made"" as the first game. That was one of my favorite elements to the game. The horrible taped up costumes transforming into these colossal realistic versions.Speaking of costumes, all the costumes you received in the first game are all gone. So you have to acquire a new set. This time around, the costumes are more traditional to the holiday. The superhero and candy corn are back but now there are costumes like ghosts, wolfman, clowns, etc. One of the changes made to this game is that the costumes can be upgraded to make them a bit more powerful.Also changed is the combat. You no longer have different activations for each costume. Everyone has the same attack activation. However, they have assigned a specific button for each character. so the first character has to use button 1 for their moves and the others use button 2 and 3 respectively. From watching the trailer, you see that the combat is changed up a bit as well. You have to hit the button a the precise moment to do more damage. Later on this will be upgraded to give you two attacks. And the block will work that way as well, to include a counter attack. Stamps are gone from the game and cards are now introduced. The cards can be used in battle to give you character a boost or hurt your enemy. But they all have a cool-down timer that is about 3 fights (not rounds).Other than that, the game is exactly like the first game. If you enjoyed the first and the DLC, then you should enjoy this little conclusion to the set.			"

												I've played both games now and gotten 100% completion in both. Overall I enjoyed 2 on it's own merits, but I feel it is a lesser outing than the first. The change in both the battle system and the cards was unwelcome. I'd much rather have passive abilities i can choose and stick with than having to constantly juggle the 8-9 useful cards constantly. Real pain when you forget that a good card is off cooldown. The super secret is kinda neat and you'll feel pretty awesome if you figure it out yourself. The overall story was short (I did 1 playthrough, and got everything in that one playthrough and did it in 9 hours) but was well written and funny. I'd have to say try it but don't go into it thinking it would be like the first. It's not. Worthwhile on it's own but lacklustre compared to the original. Also thinking a sequel might help a bit, least for lengthening playtime, more achievements and maybe fixing the battle system? Granted not sure where they could take a sequel, but I think Double Fine could find a way.			"

												Okay, first off, I'm a fan of the first Costume Quest. If you loved Costume Quest, you won't be disappointed with Costume Quest 2! I enjoyed the story line, the cuteness of the costumes, and the creativity and imagination that was behind the special attacks that each costume had. This game gradually got more difficult, but overall it's easy to play. Fun for all ages! :)			"

												Great sequel, expands everything about the first game, good fun times. Has one of the best credits i have seen. Played with a smile all the way through. Go for the Hardcorn mode achievment, it's very funny.Candy Corn can't control what the media says about him "

												I LOVE this game, it is the perfect follow up to the first one. The graphics still look great! The combat is amazing, the achievements are awesome and it is just a great game from start to finish. Liked the first one you will Love this one, If you haven't played the first you May become a bit confused with the story just cause it picks up after the last but not so much so that you would not enjoy the game, just some characters are ""known"" from the other game. Gameplay: 10/10Combat:10/10Story: 9/10(Story only gets a 9 cause I would like the game to be longer, like a JRPG about Halloween kind of longer :D)			"

												The combat for this game was changed up from the predecessor, which I guess a part of me liked. In this one, timing is the focus more than anything. I'd say it's a lot more of a challenging game than the first one, but still just as fun. The story was pretty cool too, time-travel and all. I'd say 8.5/10 is a decent enough score for this game, although I think it's neither better nor worse than the first.			"

												Costume quest 2 was a amazing rpg filled with awesome imagination and fun for all ages.i was very excited for this game when i saw it on ign,this sparked my eyes when i was going to buy the first costume quest for the second time since i wanted to play it for the feels again. i was 11 years old when the first game came out it was a awesome rpg that really excited me about game design, so when i found out the second one was comming  out i was very excited. i preorderd the game right away and watched any thing about the game. the day it came out i went straight to my computer and played it i  was gonna 100% it no matter how long it was gonna take me. but moving on to the gameplay, the gameplay is a turn based rpg with a little quicktime events dashed into there and is very awesome when you get a amzing strike on the monster you are fighting.this really moves me to the art everything is drawn with a cute but awesome tiwst although this one didnt have a classic trick or treat feel it still is a nice twist about a time travel game. i 100% it in 15 hours you can say thats pretty quick but for 15 dollars i feel like its worth your time on any spooky night.

												Game is very similar to CQ1, which isn't a bad thing. Main problem with this game so far is that they removed the post-battle full heal and now you need to run to water fountains every so often just to heal up. This puts in a lot of backtracking that comes across as filler.			"

												Costume Quest 2 the follow up to Double Fine's Costume Quest released in 2011. I was excited when I saw the announcement for this game and bought it the moment I had the money. Costume Quest 2 brings you back in the shoes of twin siblings Wren and Reynold, it appears the game leaves off right after the first game, like the previous title this game revels in a lot of clever humor and a decent storyline. One part this game falls short at though is it feels far too short to be a full title, it feels more like a DLC in length one can beat the entire game just going start to finish in about six hours. Although I do recommend this game I recommend getting it at a discount.			"

												This was a really fun game over all.It had it's problems as the new combat system was a lot harder for me to pull off at first (It took forever to master the first combo) but over all I really liked it. I definitely recommend it if you are a fan of the first game, because it still has the same feel and charm, along with a really engaging story.While I'm sad there were only two main areas instead of the first games three I really love all the design that was put into these areas.Now I wasn't sure about the changes at first but I did like a lot of them in the endAttacks and blocking was a LOT easier to pull off once I got used to them and it was a lot better to pull off then in the first game where the buttons would be unreadable sometimes.I'm also kind of sad that they got rid of battle stamps but the creepy treat cards were a nice replacement as they were really useful and fun (Morons is seriously the best card for boss battles)I had some issues with the game, but in the end I don't care because I really enjoyed this game.I even put in the effort to get all of the achievements except for the candy corn one which... I'll probably attempt some other time when I feel more comfortable with the idea >>Anyways check out this game if you are a fan of the first one, but keep in mind that there are some changes.			"

												I finished the game a few days ago and have been meaning to say THANK YOU DOUBLEFINE for such a fantastic, fun game. I loved every minute of it. I got 17 out of the 18 Steam badges…doubt I will go back to get the Candy Corn in every battle badge…that takes some serious dedication, and anyone who gets it deserves it.I liked the addition of the ability to eat candy instead of finding a water fountain to recharge, though I think it would be better if the candy hit was larger than 25 pieces (maybe 100 or even 250 would have made sense, so the player would be less reliant on it.) I think that made it a little easier than it needed to be, but it certainly came in handy for me a bunch of times in the game.If you ever decide to make a Costume Quest 3, I’ll be one of the first in line. It was a really fun time.			"

												Brilliant game, but flawed.It's hard to review this without the caveat ""but if you're a kid"".If you're a kid, probably all the design decisions in this game make sense.However, if you're over 7, you're going to feel pretty frustrated at times.I would have no problem recommending this to any of my nephews.But given that a greater part of the audience is older, and it wouldn't've taken much to accomodate that (a difficulty level selector, for starters), it's definitely not without shortcomings.First up, the good:* better than the original - more nuanced battles (once you get further in), better mechanics, the cards are actually fun and exciting to use* great atmosphere - if you like double-fine's style, this is their best ""feel""-wise since Psychonauts, and feels a little similar to grim fandango at points* better use of costumes - this time, only certain costumes can perform certain actions, and the game takes on shades of (albiet very easy) adventure games - which is great* Great humour* Great and innovative level design* fun!!!Now, the annoying:* some random-as cards - ""peanut butter bombs"" is basically a ""win this battle"" card. Really weird.* Bad keyboard choices for PC. Holding WASD direction keys in tandem with 'Q' (required for certain portions of the game) results in stuck keyboard errors on most PS2 keyboards. Not to mention it gets a bit cramped getting your hands in there like that.* Mouse support is bizarre, and terrible. You can either use mouse or keyboard on the menus, but using mouse, for example, on the creepy cards menu results in weird glitchy selection.* Inconsistent keyboard use. Depending on the menu/area of game you're in, 'returning' can either be 'esc', 'q', or space. There is no way around this. Also, regardless of how you've set up your keys, the arrow buttons will be used for certain menu actions.And the bad:* respawning. Monsters respawn when you leave a level/game, meaning you can basically grind for candy, making getting 'all the stuff' not strategic, but basically boring. Certain candy-hit items like letterboxes etc also respawn their candy. This took away from  the game in a big way, including leaving the player without a feeling of progression.* no difficulty selection - the game presents little challenge - which is a shame due to the amount of mechanics thrown into the combat* ridiculously easy end bossTo fix this game they would need to tweak their PC version a little more, throw in a difficulty selection at the start of a game, and basically get rid of the respawning monsters. Then it might actually be worth getting that really cool Creepy card, just to win that final battle.Still, fun.			"

There are health fountains about ten seconds from any point on the map or you can just eat some candy out of your stash. Wish I known that the treat cards don't get used up they just become unusable for a few battles. Great Buy.			"

												A worthy successor to the original.  Combat is vastly improved over the first game;  the Creepy Treat cards give you more options than ""fight to build up your super meter"" and ""use your super move"", and the costume affinities introduce more strategy into how you select your targets in battle.  As well, there is more variety in enemies. Different types of enemies use different spells and tactics, and feel much less like simple reskins.  Outside of battle, the graphics and the writing have all the charm of the original game.  The only thing that feels lacking is character customization; hopefully, if there's a Costume Quest 3, both the first game's battle stamps and the second game's Creepy Treat cards will be on the menu.  If you loved the first game, you'll love this one too.  If you haven't played the first... well you should, but give this a try anyway.			"

												This is a decent follow up to the first Costume Quest that I would recommend to anyone who loved the first one, although it doesn't add a ton to the game. So I would play this game with the ""Hardcorn Mode"" achievement in mind, because the last game did somewhat better at not just favoring the player in most battles.Pros:Graphics are slightly better. ""Hardcorn Mode"" achievement is a genuine challenge. Level depth seems better. Power up attacks and counter attacks (learned later in game) are welcome additions.  Variety among costumes, their abilities, focuses, and purchaseable upgrades. Candy wasn't so plentiful like the first game that I naturally had enough candy by the end to buy all creepy treats - A welcome challenge.  Maps are nice, and their counters for costume pieces & secrets are very helpful tips.Cons:New additions to the game make it way easier outside of Hardcorn Mode. Time travel story is a little more convoluted than the story from the first game.  Creepy treats are now special attacks, and they're either consumables or attacks you can reuse after a certain number of battles (can't spell ""Con"" without convoluted).  Maps cost way less than creepy treats.  A faint dark translucent horizontal line appeared on most levels throughout the game when navigating on foot - Does not appear in any other game of mine.  Battles almost always feel in favor of player unless playing ""hardcorn mode"" but that feels like forced balancing.			"

												Costume Quest was a decent RPG that was a good introduction for young RPG player. Now we go to the sequel and see what’s new.Story:After the events of “Grubbin's on Ice”, our heros made it home on Halloween even though it was winter. While walking around, the twin's Wren and Reynold, find their dentist is up to something and with the help of a time wizard, gets a talisman that lets him unleash the monsters and gets Halloween. Confused, a time traveller finds them and tells the twins that the dentist has taken over and now you must go on an adventure to save future and Halloween.This is a time travel story but you only go to two time periods(Bayou Past and Dystopia Future) but the time travel isn't that complicated. I don't much to about about the characters except for the villain, Orel White. This guy is such a delight when he's on screen and is properly one of the funniest villains I've seen in a while. I also like the dental theme empire that your explore. It's nice to have a fun take on a dystopia setting every now and then.Gameplay:The combat in the first game was repetitive as every fight was the same thing, over and over again. Here, the combat has improved greatly as now you can keep you special bars but you health doesn't refill after a fight. While most of the costumes you get are simply reskins of the ones from the last game, they now have different strengths and weakness to fight enemies which are: monster, magic and tech, and now the costume select shows what stats you'll get for each costume, AND the dash move can be used by everyone. While the all this make deciding costumes more flexible I must saw that Thomas Jefferson is almost essential to a party as he's one of the few costumes that's strong against tech.Also, the cards you get in the last game gave been promoted to card you use in battle like one that gives you two moves, one that stuns all enemies or one that gives more exp. While I didn't use them much myself, they can be useful depending on what kind of party or stragey you want, although some take longer to recharge than others. I also noticed that every enemy was different as some can do special buffs or debuffs and some attack faster. A trowbog was a lot faster hitting me than a gubbin.As for the stuff outside of battles, it's mainly the same as the first game, with similar side quest and similar trick or treating with a few minor differences, mainly in the second area.  Not much else to say.Presentation:Most of the character models are copy pasted from the last game along with new ones for the new monster types and they replaced the adult model with the one for the twin's parents and Dorsilla. I still think the fat people are adorable in this game. While the music isn't that memorable, the theme for the French Quarter is really catchy. There isn't that much great music so it really stands out.Verdict:Like every good squeal, it improves and expands on what didn't work or this case was tedious and made it a bit more challenging.8/10			"

Score: 7/10Similar GamesCostume QuestSummaryThe gang is out collecting candy again, but with a twist. Time travel and an evil dentist has cause the end of halloween as we know it. You now must time travel to prevent it.The GoodSame adorable style of graphics and humor as the original. The level designs are much more interesting this time around. The objectives are a bit more interesting along with use of costume powers to traverse the level or solve small puzzle situations. The use of cards that give combat advantages.The BadEven though the combat should be more interesting with timed button presses forcing you to stay involved it ends up just being annoying. The cards are great, but the actual abilities don't seem as interesting or balanced as the original.ConclusionIt's a great game if you loved the original. If you didn't like the first one you won't like this one. It doesn't really evolve enough to be called anything beyond an extension of the original.ValueIf you play and like the original I'd suggest playing this, but get it on a sale.			"

												After finishing the first Costume Quest I was chomping at the bit for more Halloween goodness, and was so glad a 2 was available! Same wonderful charm as the first game, with the added benefit of slightly more gameplay and storyline. I recommend 1 & 2 to pretty much anyone that will listen to me rave about these games.

												Pretty much a repeat of the original Costume Quest, but I still had a lot of fun playing. I think it would have been interesting to have story line choices incorporated in so the player isn't just battling and collecting cards. I really like the story, so making character decisions would have been more fun I think.			"

												Costume Quest 2 picks up right where the first after the DLC left off. It follows the events of your crew consisting of brother, sister duo Reynold and Wren. However unlike the first, this one is beset with bugs, lag and lack the memorable aspects and charm of the prior game.Pros+ Cartoon aesthetic is still lovely and evokes a nice Saturday morning cartoon vibe.+ Audio matches much like the first.+ Story is good overall but I preferred the events of the first.+ Battle system is improved a bit, now there are single turn double attack and defensive counter-attacks which reflect some damage to the enemy attacker.+ Funny at times.+ Combat requires you to master it otherwise combat will feel tedious at time.Cons- Combat QTE feel like it has some lag as there was numerous times where I hit the QTE correctly but for some reason it failed to respond correctly. There's a fair chance you'll not make it out of the tutorial introducing the QTE combat mechanics.- The new Creepy Cards system is disappointing, unneeded and can be ignored completely when compared to the Battle Stamps of the first. You can take 3 Cards into battle whereby you can spend a turn to use any one of your cards like consumables. Cards have various effects but the downside is that unlike your special meter it takes 3 battles until you can use that card again. Who thought this was a good idea; all it does is make me not want to you the system entirely.- Certain Creepy Cards will work 100% of the time on normal enemies but will not on bosses whatsoever. Again, who thought this was a good idea. If you were to compare the Stamps from the first I could augment my costume build without any restrictions and it would work all the time but this just adds insult to injury to those who like the initial system.- As like many games these days, bugs exist. There's this one bug where the QTE buttons failed to show up against certain enemies forcing me to eat a lot of damage as I couldn't mitigate the damage using the blocking system.- A map exists but it doesn't indicate your position, lovely.- Main menu is the most unintuitive menu I've ever had to use. Normally it's hit the Start Game button but here you've got to watch an intro scene which displays options controls or start game controls every time you wish to play. - You can't quit the game easily. Normally it's a simple process of hitting the quit button to either quit to the main menu or desktop. With this however, when you quit you're taken back to the unintuitive intro scene, before being presented with the main menu. So the only way to quit easily is to save your game and ALT + F4 out of the game. What nonsense is this?Irritations+/- Reuses a lot of assets of the first.+/- Doesn't really add anything new to the game. Most additions feel like it could've been DLC for the first.+/- Quest are generally unchanged in their execution but feels really repetitive early on in your adventures. It's essentially the same talk to quest giver and go Trick or Treat on doors but it feels ways more repetitive as there's nothing else to do. +/- AI is dumb. I remember dying quite a few times in the CQ1, but with this one, unless I made a mistake or the game failed to register a QTE I'll not die but that could also be attributed to me knowing the system now.VerdictFor some reason this game feels like a cash grab which saw to cash in on the popularity of the first one without really addressing its flaws. Instead of issues being resolved from the first we're met with those same issues and new ones to boot. At 3+ hours I got bored of the tedium and constant repetition and unlike the first this one feels like it has little to no charm and loses my attention quite early. I really enjoyed the first game it had charm, endearing story, simplicity in its systems which still had a certain level of depth. This on the other hand feels like the complete opposite. It doesn't improve on any of the original's ideas, it adds new but buggy systems, restricts prior systems and to me that's the worst kind of sequel but it's not terrible. So even though I'm recommending this do note that it has problems.			"

												Simple game and very nice for casual players like myself. Both this game and the first were good in my opinion, but I would recomend the first more than the second. Standard RPG style and I'm not sure why people are complaining about the graphics and small quirks, at least they fixed the bug where you couldn't clip through your team mates and get stuck at the end of the game. I only found one bug in the game and overall I would say that's pretty good. Takes about 5 hours to complete and 7 to get all the little hidden secrets. Add an extra 10 min to get some achievements and you're golden. 9/10, perfect for your run of the mill casual.			"

												This is a decent follow up to the first Costume Quest that I would recommend to anyone who loved the first one, although it doesn't add a ton to the game. So I would play this game with the ""Hardcorn Mode"" achievement in mind, because the last game did somewhat better at not just favoring the player in most battles.Pros:Graphics are slightly better. ""Hardcorn Mode"" achievement is a genuine challenge. Level depth seems better. Power up attacks and counter attacks (learned later in game) are welcome additions.  Variety among costumes, their abilities, focuses, and purchaseable upgrades. Candy wasn't so plentiful like the first game that I naturally had enough candy by the end to buy all creepy treats - A welcome challenge.  Maps are nice, and their counters for costume pieces & secrets are very helpful tips.Cons:New additions to the game make it way easier outside of Hardcorn Mode. Time travel story is a little more convoluted than the story from the first game.  Creepy treats are now special attacks, and they're either consumables or attacks you can reuse after a certain number of battles (can't spell ""Con"" without convoluted).  Maps cost way less than creepy treats.  A faint dark translucent horizontal line appeared on most levels throughout the game when navigating on foot - Does not appear in any other game of mine.  Battles almost always feel in favor of player unless playing ""hardcorn mode"" but that feels like forced balancing.			"

												To be honest it is definitly not as good as Costume Quest 1 - but the narrative and character design is as cute as ever.Gave me some awesome flashbacks to the first game and for me it has replayvalue for gathering all achievements since I missed some things in my first playthrough.For you guys who have problems with the key-responding in fights considering blocking and dealing critical hits -> just put down your resolution and check if the game is in full window mode - this solved that problem for me.

I'd say 8.5/10 is a decent enough score for this game, although I think it's neither better nor worse than the first.			"

												I've played both games now and gotten 100% completion in both. Overall I enjoyed 2 on it's own merits, but I feel it is a lesser outing than the first. The change in both the battle system and the cards was unwelcome. I'd much rather have passive abilities i can choose and stick with than having to constantly juggle the 8-9 useful cards constantly. Real pain when you forget that a good card is off cooldown. The super secret is kinda neat and you'll feel pretty awesome if you figure it out yourself. The overall story was short (I did 1 playthrough, and got everything in that one playthrough and did it in 9 hours) but was well written and funny. I'd have to say try it but don't go into it thinking it would be like the first. It's not. Worthwhile on it's own but lacklustre compared to the original. Also thinking a sequel might help a bit, least for lengthening playtime, more achievements and maybe fixing the battle system? Granted not sure where they could take a sequel, but I think Double Fine could find a way.			"

												So I can see why Costume Quest 2 is considered not as good as the first. So here is what they did right Vs. What they did wrong.The right1. They kept it cute and charming.2. The story is interesting.3. The time travel mechanic was done well. 4. Seeing the characters from past to future was clever. 5. The new and old enemy designs are cool.6. The new costumes were innovative and well thought out. 7. Using Creepy Treat Cards for a benefit in battle was a good change of pace.8. Certain enemies are stronger or weaker to different costumes. The Wrong1. The change in battle style was unnecessary and was many times just difficult to use. 2. The ending basically ret·cons everything you do. Making what happened in the first one not even matter.3. Only 3 of the Creepy treat cards are useful from my point of view. What they should have done.If they changed the fight style the way it is with certain enemies being stronger or weaker to certain types of costumes. Then to balance it with the annoying combat style they should have made it to where you use a turn in the middle of battle to swap your costume. Similar to switching a party member in certain RPGs. Still this game took me about 9 hours to complete, it's not that expensive. Granted mine was a gift, and it's fun enough to replay. I give it 3.5 out 5			"

												I like this game, but not quite as much as the first one. But that's mostly personal taste - I preferred the fantasy-themed monsters and plotlines of the first game over the scifi of the second, and the increased complexity of the battles did nothing for me. The costumes didn't make much of an impression overall, and the constant costume-switching for advancement got annoying, but the hotdog cerberus is my absolute favorite.It's still a good game, with many of the same mechanics and characters as the first.

The card system they implemented is pretty awesome, adds a lot to battle and you can choose which ever ones you prefer.I don't know why but I enjoyed the story and costumes in the prequel, Costume Quest, so much more.If you're debating whether or not to buy this one or the other one, I'd recommend the first one. (This one was shorter and felt a little easier as well)However they're both super cheap when on sale, so you should obviously get them both if you can, still a very cute game.			"

												""Costume Quest 2"" is a direct sequel to ""Costume Quest"" and also plays like. Well, most of the time.In the sequel a grumpy Halloween-hating Dentist threatens to destroy the beloved holiday in order to build a new society where candy and Halloween are illegal. The heroes from the last game - the twin siblings Wren and Reynold - again fight baddies, collect costumes, candy and trading cards but this time also have to use time travel where they take a glance into a bleak future with even North-Korean, communist tendencies (no joke, there are two or three or even more references).So the story's a bit bigger than last time, although I admit that I prefer the first game also because of the story. It felt like something a child would completely fantasize about (some bullies stealing candy and fighting you, the own mother being the evil witch boss) while the sequel provides a story that's almost nowhere just out of a child's mind. It's a matter of taste but it's still enjoyable. But the first game just spreads that Halloween feeling much better.The gameplay is almost the same and not hard to learn after a while. However, fighting and handling the menues and trading cards are different. Generally it's not bad but if you played the first game and liked the controls there, you might need time to get used to the new controls. When it comes to fighting, there's a character teaching you moves in tutorials.The new costumes are sweet for the most part and in some way or others replace the old ones (like the clown replaces the Statue of Liberty...I never thought I would actually say this or write this down...).The graphics are a little bit better and the music is okay, though, not very memorable.The puzzles throughout should be easy to solve, yet there are also challenging ones (like getting access to a place or finding necessary items in a city with easy missable corners). And also you can collect achievements for a couple of optional actions (like pimping your costumes which you can but don't have to do).Overall it still is fun but I like the first ""Costume Quest"" more. If you haven't played the first game, you might not totally get into the characters or their references to the first story. I generally recommend to play both if you love RPGs and/or Halloween.			"

												Starting this game I was immediately skeptical. The first Costume Quest held a special place in my heart. It's sequel had a lot to live up to. From the get-go I was not impressed. The game's storyline seemed loaded, time-travel - really? Despite the graphics retaining their similarity with the original there was a lot of added 'detail', it felt cluttered. To top it all off the fighting mechanics had changed. From playing the original to this in a short span of time, the altered fighting style was jarring and uncomfortable. But the costumed kids had provided me such joy in the past, I gave the game the benefit of the doubt and stuck with it.After some groaning and grousing. Some frowning and some grumbling. The storyline began to unfold. Familiar faces resurfaced and a smile was gracing my lips. The world you explored had deepened, the hidden bonuses for exploring were genuinely rewarding. The battle system, especially as it expanded became just as enjoyable, if not more enjoyable than the original. By the end I was thoroughly satisfied! The antagonist was a great blend of bizarre and entertaining and entirely appropriate for the game's Halloween-themed setting and the cotumes were, as always, fantastic to see in battle-form. (Of particular note was Jefferson's 'Declaration of Destruction.') The strengths and weaknesses mechanic was also a nice detail and the ability to upgrade your costumes, which in turn, changed their appearance, was kind of awesome. Unfortunately, the game felt much easier this time around. Much more forgiving, especially later on in the game. The water fountains were never an issue, as you could eat candy on-the-go to keep your health in check. I didn't use the cards a single time, only after I had finished the game to farm the achievement. The only tedium I found was exploring the little overworld's your character's traverse, as the maps were almost entirely useless and a few secrets and a hiding kid or two drove my patience to it's limit. Nevertheless, I would highly suggest this game for it's charm, maybe not at full price, mine was bought at a discount, but for the original I shelled out the full price, here and on my old ps3. It provided me with quite a few hours of enjoyment, it is an exceptional sequel and I would definitely buy another installment. I've always had a soft spot for Halloween. :)			"
