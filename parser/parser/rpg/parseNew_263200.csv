Early Access Review
								I've seen the game about on the web for a while and decided to buy it purely because of my love for games such as Starbound and Terraria.I was not disappointed.SoL doesn't feel nearly as expansive as Starbound (Which i will try to avoid comparing it to, though the two are very similiar so this will be hard) however what it lacks in explorable planets and the like it seems to make up for in crafting content and the amount fo materials you can collect.One handy little tool that you have when starting SoL is the HTWLT or Hight-tech-wrist-laser-thingy (I'm almost 100% certain this isn't what it's actualy called), which functions as all the basic tools you need to start out: pickaxe/axe, flashlight, map, object grabber and a lovely home for the AI companion that accompanies the player and provides a few tips. One thing worth mentioning is that your character won't actively pick up any objects you mine or get from a kill, this has to be done manually, an action that is default bound to the middle mouse button. In my opinion this is a good thing, as it means that your inventory doesn't have to get clogged up by dirt blocks being hoovered up by your player's legs. Unless you want it to. Weirdo.Whilst I haven't amassed a huge number of hours on SoL (yet), it feels far more realistic in some of the systems that it has, for example your inventory. In games like Terraria or Starbound, you have a grid based inventory where every item is stored in a 'slot', in SoL however you simply have a backpack in which everything you pick up is thrown, which leaves in up to you to jig it about and make it organised.The combat also feels vastly different and improved from similiar games, as the player is able to attack in a full 360 degree circle and left clicking will perform a slash attack whilst right clicking will perform a thrusting attack. You will also find that different melee weapons have different effective ranges and that they all feel weighty and satisfying to use. The bow (I haven't tried any other ranged weapons yet) also feels just as satisfying, almost as satisfying as watching a sheep run in fear as the first arrow hits their backside.The crafting is pretty similiar to any other game, with one key difference: you can actually take things apart and use their pieces in other recipes. I can't really say much about the building side of the game as i've spent a vast majority of my time hunting chickens and cooking their flesh, though i still have no idea how to eat it (you do HAVE to eat in this game, in case you were wondering).Also, BACON.If there's one thing i'd have to pick on it would be the level of guidance for new players, some actions such as eating and destroying background blocks aren't covered in the few tips your AI companion gives you and I have yet to figure out how to do either of these things. Having said that, this is the first time the game has been playable by the public, so i'm sure the Devs will be adding more tutorials as the game progresses :)Overall SoL is definitely worth your time if you're a fan of similiar games as it feels familiar enough to not be daunting, yet it has quite a few nifty features that help it feel fresh and new. Please don't be put off by the people that say this is a Starbound clone or anything similiar, SoL has its own legs and it stands on them perfectly well. Great job Devs, keep up the good work :DEDIT: I figured out how to eat, you right click on the food and a stomach icon fills up, though the stomach icon was hidden behind the inventory screen so I had to drag that out the way. Still, BACON.EDIT: You can't destroy natural spawning background blocks at all, but you can place your own over them :) Oh and the HTWLT is actually called the 'Meg Tool'.			"

								Yesterday I decided to purchase Signs of Life on a whim. I mean, at $8.00'ish dollars it's not a tough sell, really. I have to say that Signs of Life has impressed me greatly so far. I definitely LOVE the very colorful, beautifully crafted world, and already I can't get enough of this game. I loved discovering that I could bash stuff with a torch. I laughed when I found out that I could 'suck' an item towards me, and watch the item launch somewhere when I let off the 'suck' button too soon. I found that if I sucked up the Impaler Spikes and let the button off to quickly, it would actually impale me. Tell me that small pleasures are the sign of a small mind, but either way, sign me up. :) I love that the Pickaxe has a more realistic approach to swinging in a true arc than any other 2D miner, and using the right button gives you the ability to do the little tappy-tappy semi-swings that let you work in smaller areas. I am discovering silly little things all the time, and it's great! I own and play Starbound, Edge of Space, Terraria and Craft the World. As I've noticed, a lot of people are comparing this game to Starbound, so I'll work from that common perspective. So far me (and my kids) have put 142 hours into Starbound. But it's missing something. Perhaps there is just SO much randomness to everything in Starbound that it's difficult to identify with anything in it. My kids grew bored quickly with it, and I was trying to figure out why. It may have to do with dated graphics, which seem very washed out, but that's the art style they are going for and it doesn't bother me a whole lot, especially after growing up on ASCII games. The only thing I can speculate at, is that there is so much to do in Starbound, but not much reason to do anything. Hunting for food is a chore, and killing the 4-5 monster types on a planet gives me high marks on the yawn scale. And 'treasure chests' often go ignored because I know it's just gonna contain another Tier 1 weapon, or a copy of Tech I've already received 5 other times. Now with the few hours I've had with Signs of Life, everything is fascinating. I want to discover as many new things as possible to see what I can build. AGIS (Aegis?) has a low and wicked sense of humor for an AI, and the creatures of the world feel life-like. Chickens lay eggs (and even have the animation to prove it!). The bugs( insects) are so happy being in the game that they do flips. What more of an endorsement do you need?! The monsters begin to differ as you dig deeper into the world, and they get tougher too. Every time I stumble upon a new life-form, I think, ""What little surprises do you have for me to discover, my pretty?"" The only thing that truly rings false to me so far, is finding sheep and goats living down deep inside the supremely dark and oxygen deficient caves and caverns. Perhaps that is a bug that may be fixed later. Anyway, to sum up this extremely long post, Signs of Life has some serious promise, and for the few hours I've played it, it has been very enjoyable, fun, funny and I can't wait to put some more time into this game, to see what other simple pleasures I can discover in this beautifully rendered game. Keep up the great work!			"

YouTube™ Video: Signs of Life Review (Early Access Preview) 

			Views: 6,486		

			This is a review of the Steam Early Access game, Signs of Life. Steam Store: http://store.steampowered.com/app/263200/ Developer Page:...		

Signs of Life is a side scrolling exploration sand box.  The player explores the world and mines resources to craft new items.  Items range from armor and weapons to tools that aid in the crafting of new objects.  The exploration is great.  It's as fun and exciting as it can be in a 2d world.  The crafting is rewarding and the new equipment looks awesome as you equip it.  The gathering of blocks needs to be more stream line though and the fighting/motion is awkward.    If that gets fixed it will be a really fun game.  It's a decent value at less than $8.			"

								I purchased this game after reading through the negative reviews and seeing the developer personally answer each.  That says alot about the interest the developer has to his player-base.  Thanks for that.  In terms of the game itself, it doesn't seem like much when you first see the online video and feels a little ""strange"" when first playing.  However, the game is carefully crafted and well designed.  What takes the most time is the controls.  But hit ESC and select ""Keybinds"" to see them all.  Also, the environment is wonderful.  I love the way each sprite is rendered.  It has a simple system for these sprites and focuses on the main goals of the game.  I love the amount of content.  Literally everything has a purpose.  The building mechanics are simple enough and well designed to give you exactly the immersion needed and nothing more.  Also, I LOVE that the games make no *elaborate* claims.  The game is exactly what the description promise.  Additionally, nothing ever feels monotone and the game lays out a well defined goal.  And, this game has no MODDING capabilities yet (still a work in progress).  This I LOVE!!  Because it means the developer actually built (is building) this game, not relying on his users to create new functionality or add new content.			"

Early Access Review
								My intial review was overly harsh, and lacked proper insight to be helpful. ( I was really wrong.) You should totally check this game out, Reason why below:Quick And Dirty:The game is a must play, it is superbly refreshing both visually and game play-wise to anything in the  survival miner adventure game arena.Full Disclosure:Like other games of the genre, your object is mostly to survive your harsh new world.  You mine ores craft armors and tools to your delight, and build yourself a home or fortress. That's about where the similarities end.The game has a Flash-like graphics look to it. Do not let this deter you at first sight, it's gorgeous. From the fire effects, to the smashing of eggs on enemies, to the felling of trees and leaves falling about you, the beauty and dare I say simplicity of it will draw you in. Did I mention you can light sheep on fire? I'm still not too big on the controls, a tad of a learning curve to them, mostly muscle memory though, so once you got it, you're good. But the actual movement of the player and and other mobs is really awesome and fluid. Like the ability to crouch, and still and attack and function normally allows you to build these small winding passages that your character fits through, but not for the deadly aliens looking for a meal.Oh you have this like AI-Guide like thing, that's farily whimsical. I would like to see/hear more from him. Kind of like your best friend, who's sole purpose is there to troll you, and revel in your misfortunes.The death mechanic(On death all items and equipment is dropped) is a little harsh in my opinion, and I would love to see hopefully an option for maybe like a casual and normal difficulty, and Normal being the game's default mechanic. That being said is does not take away from the fun, it further extends the dire situation your character has found themself in, and ensures a thrill to your mining runs, as there is no warp to surface or death port option, and forces players to more carefully evaluate mining situations with safety in mind, to ensuring a Spitter (Alien critter that spits some kind of corrosive acid at you, not good with children) can just drop in on you and wreck your party. Hell and if one does, time to test out them emergency protocols, otherwise known as Kill it, Kill it with Fire!So the game is definitely worth the pennies, if surviving on hostile planets is your thing, but another thing to mention as it's a sore spot for me with a lot of these Early Access Games. This was released end of January, like 27th or 28th, since that time there have already been 10 updates pushed to address everyone's concerns and feedback, and they are very active here on the Forums for developers.  Hell, typically the Nerd Rage rants go completely unanswered and just lost to the interwebs, yet within hours of my nasty review, I was contacted and nicely mind you to address my experience. Like I wasn't told to go complain about Early Access nonsense elsewhere, It was justa simple hey, you seem to be having trouble, let us know we'll get it fixed if it wasn't already updated.			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR: SoL is one of the best Sandbox games out there if you are willing to put the time into it, and I can not recommend it more if you are into that genre.-----Signs of Life is a breath of fresh air (for me, at least) in the survival-sandbox genre. Most games in said genre tend to visually resemble eachother, or play identically (i.e. make a crafting table, then furnace, etc...).SoL manages to differentiate itself from the lot, mostly thanks to it's (although minor) storyline and lore. Sure, it has pickaxes, mining, 2D voxel worlds and the likes, but it offers much more than the run-of-the-mill sandbox game.Having played for a good couple of hours now, I've made it to the point where I've acquired the Level 2 Access Card, and have explored the 4 structures that I've found (I'm certain there are more that I've yet to discover), and am starting to get a nice collection of gadgets, and technologically advanced items.However, at multiple points during my current playthrough, I started getting afraid that I might have gone through all of the content, due to the fact that I had no new recipes that seemed interesting, nor could find anything of interest that I had access to either. Though, I will admit that when I 'did' discover new recipes and the likes, I couldn't help but pull a massive smile, knowing that my playthrough wouldn't be done anytime soon.In it's current state, the game has huge amounts of content (most of which I haven't even discovered yet), and quite a bit of potential. I'm hoping that the content shown on the trailer will be soon added -if not already-, as I'd love to find larger bases, ruins, and more content to explore.SoL is by far one of my favourite games in the sandbox genre, and could easily compete with, or even surpass games like Edge of Space, Starbound or Terraria, if enough work is put into it in the coming months of it's development.

Early Access Review
EDIT: Review updated to acknowledge Update .5! Now with Steamworks Online co-op!TL;DR: Contains a lot of unique ideas for Early Access, but progression via trial-and-error is prevalent.Inevitably, Signs of Life is going to get compared to Minecraft, Terraria, Edge of Space and Starbound for being a sandbox game where you build up your shelter and arsenal from scratch. However it's got enough unique features and ideas for being Early Access that a $10 pricetag can be justified.Pros:-Developer(s) is/are responsive.-Many small details in the game. (hit detection and headshots, boots boost kicking damage, basic metallurgy, etc.)-Very clean and pleasing art style. (crisp detail in the foreground; soft detail in the background)-Armors aren't linearly better or worse. (i.e. damage reflection V.S. mobility V.S. energy regen)-Organization is very easy and convenient with crafting worktables, container placement and sets of material pouches.-Your wrist-attached ""MEG tool"" is versatile. (light, mapping, ore-scanning, mining, collecting) and convenient-Most enemies are exploitable in some way. (again, your MEG tool is versatile)-Achievement hunting is amusing. ('Me Time')-Saving and exiting leaves you exactly where you were on that world and character.Neutrals:-Currently no intro/tutorial feature, but it's planned; once implemented, should help players with game progression. Partial fix: get a friend or check out the community hub.-Fairly strong ""grind"" factor (a love/hate relationship, I'm sure) comparable to Minecraft. Not as rough as it used to be, once you get your hands on mining upgrades.-The music isn't terrible, but it isn't terrific either. Probably a matter of personal taste on this one.Cons:-As of Jan 9, 2014, overall weak Wikia and Steam guide support, requiring players to figure most things out by themselves. May be different now.-Locational progression is confusing at first.-No ""Trash Can"" slot to recover deleted items from, creating the potential to completely delete items by accident. FIXED!-Ranged options are weak and/or expensive until late-game. Crossbows, bows and energy weapons are actually nice and not too difficult to obtain/keep filled. EDIT: new Sulfur Monsters and Grinder should help with getting sulfur!-No liquids in the world whatsoever. Haven't checked in update .5 yet.-By default, font size is a little small and Auto Run isn't on. Tweak your options to fix!-Some details are too small and require squinting at.To iterate, Signs Of Life shows enough novel ideas, potential and active development that it's worth the $10 pricetag, and at least a close eye for free updates.

Early Access Review
								Summary: A solid engaging, and thoroughly enjoyable experience; definitely a purchase for anyone who enjoys games of Terraria’s kind. The complaints I have with this game are not too noticeably and will hopefully be fixed as it heads closer to completion.Long Review: At first glance it looks like another Terraria clone, which I’ve played but never hit off with. Signs of Life is similar in the aspect of Terraria, but possess a more serious theme with a heavy emphasis on exploration. The game is tough in the beginning due to the lack of a tutorial and new users might be deterred like I was at first. The only source of information was AGIS the AI which squats in your wrist device, and he is about as helpful as he is insensitive. Alright, I’m being a little harsh. He’s my only companion and I depend on him to discover crafting recipes. For that I can overlook his jabs and would-be-delight at my coming misfortunes. However I must put a negative on his dialogue. Some parts feel too much like no writing effort was made and instead was just words slapped together to convey the basic intention of his attitude. Tsk, tsk, shame on you developers.The graphics are pleasing; bright and vibrant. I enjoyed the design of the characters and environment. It has more realism than you would expect from this type of game; none of Terraria’s pixelated approach. A plus in my books.The crafting system made my brain twirl a bit in the beginning and AGIS being the help he is, only kept piling more recipes for my brain to work out, into my already flooded list. Though once you learn how the gears tick and get the basic tools up and running, it is bloody damn enjoyabe!The soundtrack I hardly noticed. So far the songs I’ve heard when I pay attention to it, fit the whole atmosphere quite well; Peaceful and lulling, perhaps too much so as it tends to flow in one ear and out the other. I actually heard more of Terraria’s music than I did here. The lack of combat oriented soundtracks for when you engage monsters makes me give this edge of the game a slight negative.The monsters are interesting and for the most part, well imagined and thought out. Some are the only source for certain crafting ingredients thereby forcing you into the dark reaches of the earth to hunt them down. I have my issues with their current behavior in combat. They can be a threat, especially in the early stages where you’re just learning to stand on your feet, but once you get decent gear, it is disappointing. They are also encountered sparsely, this makes it easier for new poorly equipped players, but subtracts the danger feel as you explore. However they do spawn in more numbers as you go deeper, but not enough to make you feel satisfied. The lack of types, numbers, and ease of which you can eliminate them as you get better gear subtracts from this aspect of the game. Now while I’m being a spoiled kid and bashing the hard work of the poor developers, let me just add that the lack of dangerous creatures above ground, apart from that one special chicken, is disappointing to me.Now onto the developers, the charming creators of this experience I am so enjoying. I’ve read a number of negative reviews and nearly each of them they have responded to with grace and factuality to the criticism and gripes people have of this game. They are also active on the Community Hub and welcoming to ideas. Get ready because I will hit you with a list of mine as well as issues. Ugh, when I’m actually energetic enough to write it out. Currently they are my second favorite, a big round of applause to them. Their involvement with the community was a factor in encouraging me to buy Signs of Life.Now the game has some lore which adds a nice touch. In a way it helps drive you on to discover the full story as you explore and craft. However it is currently lacking in content. Understandable since this is still early access, but please bear that fact in mind. Newcomers, if they are slow minded dimwits like me, can expect to have enough content to work through and learn the ropes for 24.8 hours before it gets dull. Progression till then is perfectly enjoyable if you’ve managed to work out how to proceed. Good news is that a tutorial is in the works. This will transform it into a smoother experience for rookies. However, currently there is only one world, or in Terraria terms, one biome. And that is the green lush forest grassland. I do hope more locations with varieties in animals and flora will be added later. Fingers crossed.Now that Signs of Life has had Co-op multiplayer added, it is even more fun. This game is another little gem lost in the swirling mass of titles being thrown into Steam since the Greenlight feature, and I find most of them to be very dreary. Don’t pass Signs of Life up if you are into the style. Perhaps genre would be a better term, but oh well. PS: It is a pity you don’t know how lazy I can be. That I managed to force myself to write a review of this game means it is worth having a gander at. Oh well, oh well. No one will believe me. That’s fine. I know myself. That’s good enough.			"

Early Access Review
								When you play a game that exists in a genre that’s already heavily populated with awesome titles, it’s easy to jump to negative comparisons. In the case of Sweet Dogs Studios’s Signs of Life, you’ll be having too much fun to think about how games like Terraria or Starbound may be more expansive.Signs of Life is what Sweet Dogs Studios defines as a “sci-fi survival sandbox platformer”. It mixes different elements of crafting games while adding an adventure game feel through the storyline. The premise of this game is that you’re one of the lone survivors of a devastating incident which left most of your crew lost or dead. Your task is to land on the planet (which is conveniently Earth-like) your crew originally intended to investigate and survive long enough to find out what happened to them. In spite of the morbid implications left through the clues about your crew that you’ll find throughout the world, Signs of Life manages to stay light-hearted and keep you focused on exploration and fun.When you first start out, you’re given several character creation options. Since the game is still in its Early Access stage, your options are limited but the developers have promised to expand on the character creation system in the future. I simply opted to make the most girly-looking dude possible and ended up with pink slippers and a super-saiyan haircut. You then make your landing on the planet via your escape pod and quickly discover that you’re going to have to improvise in order to make it.The crafting options in Signs of Life were a lot more intuitive and varied than I initially expected. You have dozens of options from the very beginning, and as you discover new areas and objects, your virtual companion AGIS compiles new recipes for you. AGIS is only one component of your infinitely useful wrist-laser device, which is what you use to break blocks and collect items. The only thing the wrist-laser can’t be is a weapon – you’ll have to just settle for guns, crossbows, swords, and a plethora of other weapons you can craft based on your preferences.One of the more difficult aspects of the crafting is perhaps the gathering of the actual materials. Although some of the materials require a common-sense driven gathering process (picking up rocks from the ground, chopping down trees for wood) others require exploration (you probably won’t find a battery in a tree). You’ll also have to get used to figuring out the base components of certain objects by looking through their recipes and trailing backwards in order to achieve crafting that item. That may seem cumbersome at first, but the crafting menus are built in such a way so that everything is easily sorted and found.My personal favorite thing about Signs of Life has to be the art style. The backgrounds that seem to move with you are beautifully done and serve as a contrast to the blockier style of the actual playing space. The graphics give an overall sense of polish to the game that may not always be present since it is still an Early Access game. The music that plays in the background is mostly non-intrusive and peaceful. While it serves to make sure that the planet you’re on isn’t entirely silent, it’s not enough to make you feel like you’re not alone – which was probably the point. Signs of Life really emphasizes the fact that you’re a lone survivor, isn’t always pleasant. The game will definitely benefit from the eventual implementation of multiplayer, as do games like Minecraft and Terraria.With Signs of Life, Space Dog Studios has created a game with plenty of character. It’s through intuitive gameplay and special attention to detail that this game will stand out in the eyes of those who play it. When Signs of Life is finally finished and out of Early Access, it will likely have the potential to be a contender among the Terrarias and Starbounds of the genre. Signs of Life is worth the investment. It’s not a perfect game, but it’s definitely a lot of fun.Recommended "

								Short review for those interested.Nice opening story with amusing humour from both the AI bot and a lot of the tooltips in general. It's well thought out and never do you feel lost or being pushed in a certain direction. (more then I can say for certain other games)Graphically speaking it is lovely (my starter ship landed next to sheep and chickens, meanwhile epic beards/pink slippers are implemented). Scales well for higher resolutions (1440p+) and has builtin options for bigger fontsizes, which is great for us older folk that don't mind the ability to actually read stuff. Controls overall are refined too. You get several item slots on the UI each being designated to a type of gear tools, melee, guns etc. Harvesting in general works well because you can have the maintool selected and just hotkey stuff like your builtin torch without switching. Not done much In the crafting department yet. All on seperate windows with flyouts under each type of craftable keeping it neat, tidy and logical. Well thought out UI in general really. On that note I *love* the Ultima Online style inventory system in which you can drop gear wherever you please in each bag. Might seen messy to those not familiar, but with the earlier mentioned slot system and scrolling between items you will soon find that it's not.Soundtrack is fitting for the game and didn't break the immersion. Overall and relaxing and enjoyable experience so far. Currently seems to be focused on refining the SP rather then MP. Which to me personally is a great thing.Price is a steal and easily recommended.			"

								It's difficult to review this game as just positive or negative.  It's for times like this that we need a ""Mixed"" button.  I don't hate this game, nor do I love it.  I'll just judge it as whether or not I'd recommend it.  At this point in time, the answer is no, but it mainly comes down to your personal choice and willingness to wait for more content.*  I looked online to find out whether I should buy Signs of Life or Starbound.  Everywhere I looked, Signs of Life won in a landslide, saying it was more ""Signs of Life = Something an adult made.  Starbound = a 2 year olds plaything.""   What I actually saw in playing Signs of Life was more opposite than not, not that I'll go *that* far and say 2-year-olds created this.  However, a giant mech chicken?  That sounds like something out of old school DragonFable.  Also, the conrols are counter-intuitive and it needs controller support (or better mapping).  I think I was expecting more from this game.  Yes, it's in early access.  I'm happy to support a developer.  But to find out we can't even go off planet in this game?  It's a deal-breaker for me, at least at this point in time.  So I guess it boils down to: do you want a game where you can mine and build and explore buildings left by previous inhabitants but not talk to them?  Great!  Do you want to support a (judging by other reviews) helpful and attentive dev team?  Awesome!  But that's about all you can do.  Personally, I don't think I'll play this game until it gets something I can sink my teeth into.  I'm excited to find out what the devs will do with this game, though.  It has great potential.TL;DRPros Interesting story so far Extensive crafting Nice character customization Attentive dev team Great potentialCons Counter-intuitive controls No controller support Can't go off planet Short storyGet it if you want to support a promising game, but as is, I can't recommend this game except to people who love sandboxes.*  I'm excited to see where it leads in the next few updates.  *review subject to change			"

								This is mostly a cut/paste from a feedback post I made on the discussion boards. Feel it has enough merit to share as a review. Hope you find this helpful:-Graphics: 10/10-Audio: 10/10 -AGIS: Epic. (Your trollish landing pod A.I. that is hell bent on shaming you into accepting responsiblity for everything that isn't your fault. He/it is mostly helpful, but offers a great distraction to early game failures. Such as when you get murdered by space goats like a newb.)-Game Content: So WOW. Much YES. I watched the trailer, looked through the pictures. Hit up the youtubes for a few and still all of that didn't prepare me for the amount of fun and excitment to be had. I'm writing this, and then goiing back to playing I'm having so much damn fun. The ability to transfer my character between worlds is an amazing feature I've enjoyed in other titles, and I am very thankful to have it here too! (Replayability! 10/10)-UI: Responsive and extremly user friendly. Buttons do what you'd expect them to do. There are also some you didn't think you would need, but are thankful to have! (+10 for being able to move every window!)-Crafting System: Feels mostly balanced thus far and very easy to use.The right click to change to a sub crafted item makes this system flawless. No digging for a thing to craft a thing. Just click and AGIS is your uncle you have a new shiney. Little to no tab swapping for detailed crafts. Carry (most of) your crafting stations with you!? (Thats right, smelt ore while slaying aliens in the same mine shaft to craft more ammo to slay more aliens.) Perfect. 10/10-Inventory Management 100/10. (My inventory OCD is blown away by the work invested to keep my gear/mats/junk orginized and readily available. Bags, boxes, crates, furnature galore. Great work on this system!!!) (!!!!!)-Progression/pace: After playing titles that have similar systems I started with some understanding of how progressing would no doubt work. I wasn't wrong. Very fluid transition between armor sets. Almost never felt like I was grinding for anything. Just exploring for the underground stations passively gave me the materiels I needed for each upgrade to armor/tools/crafting stations. All while ENJOYING the game. Well done. The weapon progression did seem to be a bit lacking, but thats only because I refused to waste early mats on ammo and I thought the Leaf Sword was too damn cool looking to replace. Once Steel became an abundant item in my bags, the OP cave clearing began!(And then I built a Material Printer and learned how to farm for Power Cores. I own my planet now. All aliens have been served eviction notices and I am currently selling mining rights to intersted buyers/fellow crash landers. Alien slave labor packages available to serious investors.)Tons more to be experienced in this title that I haven't mentioned. Exploring and discovering those features will leave you feeling rewarded and 100% satisfied with your purchase even as an Early Access game. This belongs in your library.-Eld			"

Early Access Review
								Don't recommend.  Maybe it will get better as the EA progresses, but so far I found myself binge playing this game once then putting it down and never picking it back up again.Why?  Is it a bad game?  No.  But neither is a very engrossing game.  There really isn't much here that's new and unique.  It features a few small touches that are intriguing (such as the wearable holographic mini-map that must be filled in by manual scanning), but largely none of these made me really feel all that engaged.The art and presentation is fine, if bland.  Only real complaint I had was that the high-rez, high-saturation pixel art made it hard to figure out what is an actual user interface element and what are just little visual doodads that serve no purpose.   But you learn quickly enough what is clickable and what isn't, so it's not like it prevents you from playing the game.  It's just a style I don't particularly care for in a game.  (Starbound had the same issue, though it featured low-rez pixel art.)The trailer showed all kinds of nifty items, such as lasers, flying ships, etc.  But after seven hours of play, I had nothing to show for my time save the same standard progression of items that you find in these games.  I had yet to craft anything that was cool and exciting;  All I saw in my future was an ever-progressing grind.  Replacing my copper items with iron, and so on.  I'm sure I'd get flying laser ships eventually but the incentive isn't there for me to try, particularly when you die very far away from your spawn and must back-track quite a long way to recover your items -- Without even a marker to indicate where you died.  A lot of work for too little reward, IMHO.Crafting is okay, and like that it's implemented via a list.  (Though it's annoying that you cannot mass open or close categories.)I think this has signs of life (pun!) but for now I would recommend you wait.			"

Early Access Review
								(Written during Version 0.45)Through making some poor choices, I've learned to be incredibly specious of Early Access games. I've purchased quite a few that have looked promising (and even WERE promising), only to find my initial investment squandered due to the developer(s) not following up on their initial design ideas, or, in two cases, all but abandoning their game completely. To add to that anecdote, I never caught the ""Minecraft bug."" I'm not very artistic, so the idea of an open world where you just GO did not appeal to me. Terraria approached the middle ground that I could see myself enjoying, but this...Signs of Life is my mecca. There are some very unique, well thought-out aspects of the game that really lend to helping it carve out its own identity in the mire of ""sandbox"" games that have been popping up as of late. From the clever M.E.G. tool that you use to collect resources, to the trial-and-error method of discovering new items to craft, Signs of Life very aptly toes the line between being accessible to the player and patronizing them.As you progress throughout the game, the developers have managed to create an atmosphere of discovery that is almost completely organic: the more you do and the more you explore, the more you will learn. That being said, there are a few aspects of the crafting system that aren't very intuitive (@Devs: perhaps a classification system for certain items could help new players to know what can and can't be used as fuel). This is, of course, where the Early Access part of the game comes in, and community involvement is a crucial part.The developers are, thankfully, not at all like those mentioned at the beginning of this review. I have seen developer responses within the *HOUR* of an issue becoming known on the forums, and that in and of itself is one damned impressive feat. IN CLOSING:+ Wonderful art design; color schemes are fantastic+ The soundtrack is haunting, hypnotizing, and cathartic+ Excellent flow in the crafting system, save for a few bumps here and there+ The world is alive and makes you naturally want to explore- Some clipping issues in the terrain (my head would get stuck in 99% of cases)- Dodge / roll mechanic can be bothersome when trying to make minute adjustments in positioning- Overlapping inventory system DRIVES ME ABSOLUTELY BANANA SANDWICH I WILL TYPE IN ALL CAPS FOR THIS- (This last point isn't a negative, but it is because I want more story, please.)For $10, you're making EXCELLENT use of your money.

Early Access Review
								The Good:-Graphics and animations are gorgeous-Handheld multitool you start with feels like something a crashed ship survivor might actually have, high tech without being game-breaking, and scales up nicely over the course of the game-Imaginative enemies with an AI that, while simplistic, knows what it can do and how to accomplish it, and will even outmaneuver and trap you-Story (what there is of it, I'll get to that in a moment), while not all that new, is handled better than most triple-A titles do it, paced so you learn more as you advance-Tech scales up nicely from primitive constructs assembled with sticks and vines to plasma cannons, and the transition actually feels pretty naturalThe Bad:-Not much variety.  It's very easy to reach a point at which the game has nothing new to show you, or where there is more content but you're completely stuck as to how to advance or just plain don't realize there is more.-Rare updates.  It was doing very well, but the last update was two months ago, and didn't add much.  Even if it's just the odd new weapon or another bit of the story revealed, I'd love to see more frequent updates.The Verdict: If you like Terraria, this is like Terraria but in my opinion better fleshed out.  There's less content than in other games, but what there is has been polished to a mirror shine, with the promise of more on the horizon (even if that horizon is sometimes frustratingly far away).  A brilliantly executed take on the sci-fi survival game that I sincerely hope will keep growing and realize its potential.			"

								This game is a side scroller.  A super deep, and very atmospheric side scroller, that let's you kill, build, and dig your way to complete domination of your little section of the world... which is pretty big, actually. The combat in this game isn't too engaging, although it can be pretty funny to kill a chicken with a rock.  Actually though, this game is more about finding and crafting the plans, metals and machinery to build a really cool laser rife to seriously kill that chicken... and anything else that comes your way.  Careful for the huge, metal, mechanical chicken that you may run into later on, though, as he'll probably be looking for some payback for all those dead chickens.This game will keep you guessing for some time, and you'll probably need some cheat help to get you moving along at times.   It will keep you entertained for hours, although the long term replay value may be a little lacking.  I played it for over 40 hours before losing interest.... so it was definetely worth the money to me.			"

								A spectacular game so far with plenty of content despite it's early access status.I only have a few minor issues, in which I will state them in the questions I have for the developer(s) in hopes of having them answered1. Will there be more diverse terrain generation in the future? Such as curved/diagonal blocks for easy terrain navigation, as it's tedious to continuously place blocks to get to higher spots.2. Will there be character wipes in the future to make room for updates?3. Will the game eventually have an ""ending"" or do you intend to make it free-roam for as long as the player wants?That's all I have, TL;DR this game is worth it's 10$ price tag.My rating is at least a 9/10			"

								An interesting game, but one that seems to be going nowhere. Right now there is too little in the game to make it a worthwhile purchase, and after years of development I have seen very little significant change. Here are the problems as I see it:1. Too little content. I know this is early access, but, seriously, only one surface biome?2. So many animals wandering around that I feel like I must be stepping in sheep dung with every step.3. The limb movement system, while nice to look at, makes combat seem a little wonky. (Bow combat is the worst.)4. There's no reason to build anything more than a one room cabin. In fact, just put up some walls and a roof to keep critters out while you craft. Back walls are optional.5. The inventory system is messy. It looks like a throwback to Ultima 8, with everything piled on top of everything.6. Survival is trivial. Food is unbelievably abundant.It does have some nice features, such as a radar map system, and an actual plot (not finished.) And, to the devs' credit, they were quick to help when I had an issue with world generation that made my game unplayable. They do seem to be actively working on the game, adding new features occasionally. (Usually new weapons/armor.) But the games needs more to it. Right now, you will lose interest fairly quickly.If/when this game ever gets better, I will change my review.			"

Early Access Review
								At first glance, Signs of Life looks like another shameless ""blocky sandbox pickaxe terrria/minecraft ripoff"" to be tossed on top of the ever growing pile of said games. Yet, while only being single player, it does a lot more than other titles trying to cash in on this theme.This game does a fine job standing on its own in this theme, though like everything in beta, it has its own share of problemsWhile the game does a lot right, I feel like the game doesn't know what its doing with itself, as if its trying to be a comedy, and yet take itself seriously.  I can't help but feel like the developers were trying to achieve that quirky balance borderlands 2 does so very well.  The game unfortunately the game never captures this balance, and instead falls flat on its face with its story.It however does do an outstanding job with the crafting system, and the many gadgets you can make with it.The game has you start off landing on an unknown planet with minimal survival equipment, the clothes on your back, and an AI partner with terrible dialog.  You then set off to explore the planet, looking for equipment, useful materials and as the name of the game suggests, signs of life.The top of the world looks like Willy Wonka exploded, painting everything in bright colors: its cheery, safe, and it counteracts the rest of the game in terms of atmosphere.  Dig down, or explore one of the abandoned stations at night, and the atmosphere does a complete 180 degree turn.  The atmosphere is dark, dank, empty, and devoid of all human life.  As you explore deeper, the atmosphere of the game gets even more creepy, with alien tentacles raining acid on you, floating sacks of puss that explode, and large vicious looking aliens with scythes for legs.  The further you go down, the more dangerous it feels, the atmosphere does a very good job of this.Unfortunately the storyline can't seem to latch onto what the atmosphere does, and write a compelling narrative to motivate the player into finding out what happened on this planet.Instead the storyline tries to play it silly, inside of a dark, unlit station, with human corpses strung about.You find E-readers in these stations, with some of the articales writen in them hint at where items of interest to you can be found.  However, you will mostly be reading about some doctor acting erratically (the game tells you he is afflicted with ""Space Madness"") and as a result, everyone around him, including his CO's, are implenting EXTREME measures to keep the space madness doctor from rifing through their property.(minor spoiler here) One such example was the leader of the installation, She finds good doctor madness combing through her pantie drawer.  Instead of sticking the guy behind bars until they can send him into the place with padded walls, she demotes his access, then processes to bury the device that promotes keycard access, several hundred meters underground, just for the hell of it.(end of spoiler)Your only form of story content besides the e-readers, is your partner AI, AGIS.AGIS is suppose to be  malfunctioning, and yet, he says nothing you'd think an AI would actually say. He constantly makes useless comments that help in no way, and when he does actually say something somewhat useful, you've already tuned him out.  He's basically a watered down, forgettable version of claptrap attached to your wrist.  Hes annoying, but you can forget about him, so that makes him slightly better than claptrap?Where the game actually shines is the use of the M.E.G. your wrist mounted multi tool.  This thing is sweet, and actually puts all the other multitools you see in other games of this theme to shame.  It functions as your map, your scanner used for updating your map, an autolooter, and of course, placing and breaking objects and blocks.  All of these functions can be upgraded to improve them even further, everything besides AGIS that is...  Honestly, all this thing needs is a blade attachment and it'd put the omni-tool in Mass Effect to shame.The crafting is very strong here, making use of resources constantly.  In Terraria, theres a point where you stop gathering copper, because you have no more use for copper, unless you maded to make a copper castle, using copper blocks.  Here, copper and most everything else constantly has a use, so your always gathering for everything.Guns felt kind of lack luster, the game makes you jump through hoops to get your first real gun besides the 9mm pistol, and most later on enemies are resistant to your bullets.  The Laser gun was my go to weapon, as it could kill anything, although waiting on your energy to recharge was a ♥♥♥♥♥, but you never truly ran dry, where as bullets actually use materials.All in all, I enjoyed the game, even though when I played it, there was no final boss fight, or at least I couldn't find one.  My only worry is that they keep rolling with the shallow storyline, and make the final events of the game lackluster, making you feel like you wasted your time, as a bad ending has that effect.Conclusion:Pros:- Strong crafting system.- Lots of interesting materials to scavange.- The M.E.G. Tool does an outstanding job for its intended use, as a multi-tool.- Enemies look interesting, and later ones look imposing.- Loads of weapons to choose from.- Certain areas of the game deliver an erie atmosphere, supporting the actual title of the game.- Graphics, while looking the part of a flash game, actually do a pretty good job.- The inventory system is reminiscent of the old Ultima games, which I love.  The autosort works very well.- Retrieveable arrows and bolts.Cons:- No Multiplayer- Weak storyline (its a bigger deal, brought by the fact of the first con, no multiplayer.)- Gunplay doesn't feel very rewarding, since you need to scavange for both the materials to make the gun itself, and its    ammo.  You are more likely to use ranged weapons with retrievable ammo such as bows and crossbows, or weapons that use your energy.- AGIS has to be some sort of spawn from claptrap- Lack of boss fights (though it is still in beta)- Lack of tutorial on how your M.E.G. is upgraded.Final verdict:  Would recommend, but only to those who can't get enough sandbox, blockfest, diamond pickaxe goodness.If you are tired of these games being perpetually in beta such as *cough* Starbound *cough*, then stay away until 1.0.

								Signs of Life is a game very much focused on exploration and creation, and it does both very well. You start off in a pod filled with only the basics(such as a gun and a single bullet, if being the only one on a planet gets too boring) and a sassy artificial intelligence that doesn't quite understand the meaning of empathy. From there, you must run, punch, and scream your way to a better home.The graphics and soundtrack are both very pleasing, the crafting system is delightful once you build yourself a nice workshop, and the general building mechanics are pretty well executed. The combat, however, lacks in a way that most sidescrollers do: It's not very dynamic. Despite this, the enemies, or at least the ones that are a threat, are well designed. You can power through them, but their gimmicks enable you to employ some neat tactics to make it a bit more fun.Signs of Life also does not hold your hand. There's no real tutorial and you're mostly left to figure out everything yourself. Most people I've seen get confused with(what I'd call) the story progression of the game, though there are enough hints left about it to where you can eventually figure it out, and be mad at yourself for not doing so sooner.The developer is fantastic. They're very engaged with the community, and get right on any issues you may be having. It's worth noting that I had no issues at all until I opted into the beta, and the issues I had there were patched an hour after I contacted them. For an early access game, Signs of Life is incredibly stable and well thought out.Overall, 9/10 Easily.			"

I mean, bloody hell, I wrote an angry and rude review yet they actually spoke to me and spoke calmly. The game may not be at it's peak yet, but the developers are working hard to make it something desirable and really step up and communicate with their community.

								Compared to other games I've played, Signs of Life is both more simplistic, and more complex. Simpler in that construction of a base doesn't take 5 days, and that hordes of enemies are, while a possibility, not likely to simply turn into a never-ending swarm that'll override any defensive measures in a couple minutes.The complexity comes from the mid and late-game (for now) crafting, where you need to use literally every crafting station/system you have on hand to build things like the rocket launcher or the Jewel Bow. Even some of the earlier recipes can take 4 or 5 differing components to make, and at least 2 crafting stations to make the parts in the first place.Honestly, I don't find it a problem. I find it a nice change of pace from the more ""grind it til you have it"" tendency of more than a few other games (World of Warcraft, for example.).My only real issues stem from just how much digging you're apt to do just to get enough resources to build that fancy Material Printer or that last box of rockets.I would rate this game a 9/10 as it is, if only because the game is incomplete.

What is it?Signs of Life is a sci fi Metroidvania sandbox game that involves lots of digging and collecting resources in order to craft better items.How are the devs?The developers do read the forums and often comment on feedback and questions.How much content is there right now?There's actually a pretty good amount of content for an Early Access game. I was able to complete the amount of story there is right now and get to the high tier items in about 20ish hours.Is there multiplayer?Yes. I haven't gotten a chance to test it out yet but it was added recently.Are there Steam trading cards and emoticons?There sure are.Is it worth the cost?I suppose it depends on what you think of Early Access games. If you're okay with purchasing the game and playing it with the possibility of encountering bugs and before all of the content is added, its a fine purchase imo. If you don't like that idea, maybe you should just hold on while it develops a bit more.			"

								Being a huge fan of crafting/survival and in particular Terraria, Minecraft, and Starbound is what brought me to Signs of Life. As a rule, I tend not to buy Early Access games, choosing instead to mark them on my wishlist, however I couldn't help but purchase Signs of Life and over a year later I am still quite glad I did.What I found was a game that had an amazing groundwork laid, but little to fill the time ones I had gotten myself to the highest tier of gear, but such is the case in Early Access games. As time has passed and the Dev's continue to make updates to the game I am more and more reassured that the amazing groundwork they have put in place is going to eventually become the fantastic 1.0 that I look forward to for SoL. And if any of my friends were looking for a crafting/survival I would most definitely point them in SoL's direction if they're willing to be a bit patient.But even so, this is perhaps the best place to highlight both the positives and negatives of the game, so here I go:-I love the graphics, pixel art is rarely given so much high fidelity, and I always felt that it fit the game far better than a more 16-bit esque style, similar to Terraria. Sci-Fi looking Hi-Fi is important to me.-I am intrigued by the story although I will admit ignorance on any new additions to it. The planet is infested and a lot of people are dead and/or missing. I hope I can make a ship or something to get off this crazy planet before I join them, I'm just saying.-There's a myriad of items and weapons to craft, letting you have a goodly amount of variety when it comes to your favorite monster killing weaponry.-I actually really like the MEG AI character, I can't put my finger on why but he just manages to toe the line between funny and annoying for me and do so in a way that just makes him more enjoyable. I'm dying horribly and all he has is a pithy one liner, like please I will drop you down a hole the moment I have all the recipes, just you wait.Cons (these are longer but more due to wanting to be detailed in my constructive criticism than anything else):-Lack of Difficulty Settings: Call me a baby, but most of my play sessions of Signs of Life come to an end when I die. The punishment of losing all of my items and having to spend the next 45 minutes chaining deaths as I attempt to run back down to whatever pit I lost them down is really frustrating. While the loss of items in Minecraft was also an issue (that many people modded around to be fair), part of what always softened the blow for me was that any items, or armor I made had durability and thus would eventually have run out anyway. This is not really so in Signs of Life, so the need to dive down 4000 feet in only my undies is tantamount, and I've often resorted to console commands just so I can get to the items without dying.-Lack of Fair Fighting: So just gonna be honest here, my go to strategy when fighting monsters is to build dirt walls around myself in a fit of panic and then stab or shoot them through a hole while they ineffectually try and destroy my hideaway. If this strategy was the one you wanted to encourage in your players then this is not a con (I actually don't dislike doing this), but I always felt that the monsters were far too effective at wrecking my small, shipwrecked♥♥♥♥♥for any other strategy to be viable. Hopefully in the new version things might be different, and I am not suggesting for this strategy to be removed so much as, well, it to be easier to kite or go toe-to-toe with these underground goons.No Tier Gating: So currently, while there is a wealth of items and tiers of items to experience, I tend to skip right past one or even several of them at once simply because it is practical to do so. Why should I make leather armor when after 15 minutes underground I've enough for copper? Why bother with iron, gold, or silver when I can just spelunk down and get the materials for steel? No solution to this comes to mind really, besides somehow gating the access to higher tiers behind some sort of technology that must be gathered from bases. -The UI: I'm sure this is a complaint that you have heard often, since your redesign of the UI have been some of my favorite updates to the game, and I feel like you have made some really good choices with the redesign, so I am only here to ask you one thing, please let me control what is on my hotbar. I understand wanting the first button to be on my tools, but I can't count the times where I've been happily mining away and then I accidentally touch my middle mouse button and now I have an axe. Or when I pull out my shotgun in battle but in my panic I accidentally am unleashing flares at the enemy due to fat fingering the middle mouse button. Or even the number of times I have pulled out both my sword and my gun before actually getting to the mapping tool that I wanted. Just an option to either have the hotbar like it is now, or in a more customizable way since I don't really need to always have food readily available to chow down on, but I could always use more melee weapons at the ready, or the ability to swap between MEG and pick without having to scroll through axe, hoe, and who knows what else first.

Early Access Review
								I wouldn't recommend buying this because there are better games out there that follow a similar idea. Try Terraria or Don't Starve as they are both survival games that are better laid out and thought out. It's not that this game is bad per se but that there are better options out there if you want to buy a game in this genre.Normally I would end the review here but for the developer here are things that I think you should work on.1) Don't try so hard to be funny. It doesn't come off right. I found it more annoying than funny.2) The crafting system is confusing. I was told that I could make an ingot but I couldn't look at the metal in my inventory to figure out how to make an ingot. The AI said I could use a smelter but I had no way of looking up the smelter recipe to figure out what I needed. I had to go to the wiki to find out which really breaks immersion. Either things need to be intuitive or there needs to be a way to look it up in game without needing to exit the game.3) Similarly with cooking meat. It wasn't exactly an intuitive process. I tried starting a fire and throwing the meat onto it because there didn't seem to be a way to interact with the fire to cook the meat.4) When you start cutting the trees with the laser, there was no indication that anything was happening. Even if it is something like making the tree shudder a bit like in Don't Starve or having little bits come off like Terraria, there needs to be some sort of visual feedback that something is happening. 5) I also wasn't impressed that I needed to make a wooden sword and club to start out with. For a fantasy game, those are the ideal sorts of weapons but for a sci-fi game they don't seem to fit. I know that it's hard to come up with a simple low level weapon that sticks with the sci-fi theme but perhaps if you already had something like a light saber but needed you to generate energy to make the battery work? This way you stick with the theme but still create a need for exploration and gathering so you can't insta-stomp the local flora/fauna.6) Not being able to pick up things unless you use the grab laser is also annoying. 7) The pacing of the game is too slow. It doesn't feel like you are achieving anything or getting anywhere, especially at the start of the game when you are new. 8) The inventory system also needs work. We should be allowed to put whatever we want in the hotbar, not have it restricted to what you think is ideal and having to scroll through things.That's about it. I just don't feel this game is fun enough to recommend to anyone. Good luck in the future.			"

								From someone who has spent many hundreds of hours in SB and Terraria  etc..  this game feels different.The environments are beautiful and alive with color..  much more detailed than i expected.The crafting is hands down the deepest most detailed down to the finest part in any game of the genre I have played.There is just so much to see it kind iof amazed me how the Devs really thought about the world..  shelves with a bottle of shampoo in the bathroom of a base you can take..  a boom box in the barracks you can take that changes the in game music when you click it.. you can gather so much its crazy.. take it home and horde to your hearts content.Add a nice sound track and not one glitch so far...  its a winner all the wayBuy it.. its worth far more than the asking price.

								A great game with lots of terraria/starbound(ish) concepts. I've had lots of fun with this, however i've got just one complaint.Please fix the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ spawn caps for animals/neutral mobs on the surface... Every time I leave my house for 10 seconds I come back to find a friggin swarm of those blue-flying things smashing their heads into my door. So If I open the door, of course the house gets flooded with them.Or when I'm trying to do a simple task outside like cut down a tree, or mine a block, something always has to get in the way and get hit and then get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at me and attack me.Overall it's a fun game, it could just use a bit of multiplayer, and fixed spawns for animals.

								Temp review... will write a better / longer review later.This game is like Starbound, but it's far more grindy (right now, soon to be better balanced). I've already spent enough time into the game to notice that the threats are almost non-existent (aside from the bosses which currently can be exploited). Armor currently just feels optional. Getting ores takes forever currently, but again, the dev says it'll be improved next update. Mining with a pickaxe is a bit clunky cuz it requires so much space, so you're likely to use the MEG tool which can also be upgraded to be superior in digging speeds anyways.Overall, it's an interesting new game with new ideas and everything, but it being in early access, it's just not quite there yet with the finished games which compete with this game.EDIT: I'm giving this review a thumbs up based on the dev's replies here and in Steam Discussions. The dev communicates with us all the time and is very appreciative of suggestions and feedback unlike most other game devs out there. Also, I do see this game being an awesome game, potentially even better than all the competitors out there.			"

								I absolutely love this game. I never played Minecraft so I was kind of new to the crafting genre, but I had played a few survival games so I was not completely uninitiated. This game has a whole less dimension than Minecraft but I have devoted so much time in the last week or so that I shudder to think of what Minecraft would have done to me.If this game is not a pinnacle of the genre then I would like to know what is. Even in Early Access it has so much going for it. Also, I am going to try not to spoil anything here but there is a lot of evidence to indicate that there is a lot more danger and plot developement to come. I just put a power core into the Pioneer Base and it has driven me to heavily fortify my base. I now sleep on a raised platform lined with turrets. I also have a block of solid marble filled with guns and trap rooms with turrets that I will teleport into if my base falls. When those guys come into the game they will not take me alive. God I love this game.			"

								I bought this game on sale a long, looong time ago. Never made time to play a bit of it.I started, got the hang of it and just got hooked, those seven hours are just from today, I am a sucker for this kind of games.I'm not a fan of pressing the middle button to pick up stuff, as I scrolled through the reviews I saw a dev's comment that It can be toggled off so it can be automatic, so that's a plus, I would've liked ingame info about that though.So far so good, I like the art style and how my character moves, when he runs, FINALLY I sense that my char is running not walking fast like in other games, the jumping animation looks cool, once you get a backpack to glide with, traversing the map is really easy, if your base is tall enough.Excelent work from the devs and I've noticed they answer the questions, reviews, etc. What I would change is, the pick axe, and the axe do way more damage than the melee weapons, I'd change that, since there's no point of having a sword when you can use your axe or pick to destroy the mobs. If you got money to spare, and you like Terraria-like games, give this one a try, is well worth it. "

								I was very skeptical about buying this game. I wasn't sure if I should buy this or not. I love games rpg/sandbox/crafting/etc. games and this was one of them. I was so use to the pixelated versions. This is more realistic. It's also in very early development. Then I check the forums of the game and the devs are really up to date with the game and communicates with the people. Devs like that will surley bring this game into stardom. That was one of the biggest reason why I bought this game. Other than it being amazing.Pros/Cons-Pros For an Early Acess game, It is really fun with quite a few content that could last you hours. Devs keep game updated and communicates with the community. Hotbar- (Organizes tools into one bar and allows you to scroll through it.) Kinda like 1 is for mining, scroll through that one bar and you can switch from laser mining to pickaxe to etc. 2 is for melee weapons, etc.-Cons Takes a while to get basics down considering the texts come up at certain times or random times. None others. Robot Chickens exists to kill everything.                                                                                   My ExperienceExperience 1 : Crash on an alien planet. Learned how to mine. Laser mined a tree. Couldn't pick up the materials it dropped. Fustrated, I committed suicide by trying to kill a bore. I respawned in a base which I am guessing is a Pioneer station. Kept trying to pick up the mining pickaxe and mining clothes. Still couldn't. Fustrated I Made a new character.Experience 2 : After creating a new character, I repeated the same process EXCEPT, I found the Pioneer station. Took me forever to mine under it to get inside it. Still couldn't pick things up. I looked in the chests, but too conflicted to bother taking anything. I returned outside and found the alien fighting with the bore. I somehow got caught in the middle and joined war between the two breeds. Sheeps were dying left and right as the bores and alien fought. I died soon after. I deleted the character and tried again.Experience 3 : Repeated the process up to the Pioneer station. I FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO PICK THINGS UP. It didn't tell me until then. (I will let you guys go through this as well.) Excited, I decided to cut trees and mine ores. Died by running into a mantis alien. Experience 4 : I tried to go and find the Pioneer station along the way I made some things finally, but I ran into some other base that seem to have no entry point. At least none that I could find. While trying to find one, BY MY LUCK I FOUND A GIANT ROBOT CHICKEN OUT FOR BLOOD. YES I SWEAR TO YOU I WAS STUCK AGAINST THE BASE TRYING TO JUMP UP RUNNING AWAY FROM IT BUT I COULDNT. IT KEPT SHOOTING AT ME . I died a terrifying death. "

Yes, in Starbound you can fly to different panets and you can customize your spaceship but in SoL you feel you can do alot more. For one it feels more realistic compared to Starbound and less cartoonie. The crafting system seems endless and more rewarding.I could go on and on but you'll just have to trust me and get this game while it's as cheap as it is.			"

								This is a very enjoyable game, even in these early stages of development, the devs are active and listen to feedback. It reminds me of craft the world a little and serveral other 2D survival/exploration/crafting/building games. It has a very indepth crafting system and a good sense of humour as well, something missing in a lot of games these days, it will also not hold your hand, death is a pain and even with a respawn function you will need to go back to get your stuff. Overall I'm enjoying this game and I am looking forward to seeing how it evolves and what it looks like in the future when Iit hits gold, until then I'm happy to play whats there over and over, as each time I leaarn something new. I still have to explore the underground alien bases and everything else under the surface as I have only just scratched it, thumbs up.			"

Early Access Review
								Not having touched this game for a year, I decided to give it another try. Initially I left a positive review, just recently left a negative and now I'm back to positive. Most games I've played don't deserve a postive review, with the few exceptions, this being one of them.The main problem with the game is that the instructions as to how to play it are not very clear at all.1st off coming back I had forgotten everything about it (my first 100 hours of game play). So I'll talk about my last 20 hours of gameplay.The game needs a tutorial or better explanation as to how things work, Here's why:The first 15 hours I spent fighting with the action/toolbar. There are two. One is predetermind what goes in it and the other you can put into it whatever you want. You can only see one at a time. So on the first actionbar #1 is you Meg tool (main digging tool), #2 is your fists. Etc. When I got my first pick, I assigned it to #2 on the second and an then the frustration would start, When I switched to the 1st, the pick would be there replacing the Meg tool, I did see little up and down arrows but couldn't figure out how to use them. I had hit every key and nothing had happened. Only after misclicking did I notice that the middle mouse button controlled these. After that the game became easier and funner. After 18 hours into the game I finally figured out how the map works. You press the M key to bring up the map. All you see is 4 dots on it. One of them being you. How does that do anything for you? Well, I misclicked again. The purple Meg tool sends out sonar when you hold down the mouse button and updates your map with cave walls. I have as of yet to figure out how I got the map to stay on.Took me over 10 hours of experimentation to figure out I didn't have to chop down trees to get wood, only cut of branches, that eventually grew back.Crafting is well done. Everytime you pick up something new, for instance iron ore, your crafting icom sort of blinks and you're presented with your new options in yellow. All your craftables are organized into various categories.Picking up items a year ago was a pain, you had to hold down the C key. Per the Dev, you can turn on auto pickup in the settings menu. I for one would have never thought of looking in there for that.....ever.There are bugs still present. Initially coming back my game crashed a few times creating charaters. Sometimes when taking out back blocks and if there are items on the ground, your tool will stop working for a bit.Base building is obsolete in this game, you come with two prebuilt metal bases. So there is absolutely no need to ever build a third.I also didn't like that you get almost a full set of iron armor and a copper pick from both bases, thereby making all armors below iron obsolete as well.I was a bit disappointed that in sandbox mode you can select the size of your world but not in single player mode. I have not tried multiplayer yet.Otherwise the game has good graphics. There is more content to play with. I haven't run into any game breaking bugs yet, so that's also a plus.			"

								Signs of Life is something that you.. Really don't see too often. Yes, it's a 2d sandbox-y game with weapons and physics and bosses, enemies, you name it. but out of everything I've seen or played, SoL is really.. Unique.To start simply, the controls are wonderful. Yes, you will hate them when you first start, but once you get used to the sorta.. Flow and feel for the game, they're quite nice. Fitting, at the very least.Next up, the game has some very.. Unique things. The art style, for one, is genuinely interesting and allows for some funny things to happen. The physics (while the concept isn't new), are pretty well done, and with the throwing mechanic it makes for some fun things you'll have to figure out for now. The weapons, which fit the theme and work pretty well, are generally well balanced, and not one really makes the game too easy. Crafting is actually a fun system in some ways, and though inventory management isn't always easy, it really does work well.But, theres one thing that really makes me reccomend this game. While exploring I came across a REDACTED, and having zero clue whats going on, I.. Explored it. And I found a REDACTED, REDACTED, and some REDACTED that was hinted at being used in the REDACTED. Slowly I started figuring out this abstract REDACTED REDACTED and it was.. Amazing. Going in spoiler free just made it that much more fun, and its laid out in such a way that you really can figure it out pretty easily. It's an experience I'd kill to have again, and with the planned updates? I'm entirely happily paying for what I have now.Which brings me to that early access tag. Honestly, yes, it does still feel a little unfinished. It's openly unfinished, and I think thats honestly a good thing. If it takes time to get this game going far, so be it, it'll be worth it. Buy for you and a friend to mess around with, then fall in love with it and wait eagerly for the next update. Considering how little exposure there is for this title, I'm entirely happy buying if just to support the devs.			"

								I really enjoyed this game, and hope to see the finished product when it's released. In the early game, exploration was really fun, and reminded me a bit of Terraria in that aspect. Just exploring, learning more of the backstory, and encountering weird creatures and upgrading your gear all felt like things I wanted to do, and it wasn't until I started making the highest level armor, Jeweled at the time, that I began to feel bored.With more gear, bosses, and story content, the game will be great. EDIT: I had previously had issues with new engine, but reinstalling the game fixed it. I definitely think the game is worth the price tag of $10 if you enjoy 2d sandboxes, especially since it's still in early access.			"

								I bought (Early Access) Signs of Life a shot not expecting much.  I have been playing starbound for a couple of weeks but hit a wall due to the last big wip and update. This game had me hooked within the first 5 minutes. If Signs of Life is released with just a quarter of the content that Starbound has, it will be an extremely fun and re-playable game.  As of version 0.20, there have been no game killing bugs, not even annoyances to speak of.  There are quirky things like small harmless animals spawning in my house, that's really it.  Highlights:· Visually more realistic than Starbound which can feel a little too cutesy at times.· Variety of armor and clothing combinations for a distinct look · The structural building blocks have a great deal of variety and interlock systematically like Legos.  · The crafting system is fun and compels you to explore the planet so you can craft more complex items.· The story is revealed organically as you discover clues.  More to the planet than meets the eye.			"

Early Access Review
Signs of Potential?The short of it: The game has a unique feel, primarily thanks to the quasi-realistic physics of your character as well as the sense of humor. The progression is going to feel very familiar if you've played any similar sorts of games. The natural environments are lackluster when compared to the technological buildings. Combat shows promise, but I feel that losing a fight is still mostly a question of being outnumbered or not having good enough gear rather than skill. You will need patience, and a lot of it.  Updates come somewhat slowly.The long of it:I like this game, but I somewhat begrudgingly recommend it in this Early Access phase.  I love the humor present in some of the logs you come across and definitely get a chuckle out of the AI that acts like it's totally high.  The buildings that you find and explore are filled with interesting little details.Unfortunately, the core of the gameplay - mining and crafting - doesn't bring much new to the table for the most part.  Mining is made easier due to your fancy gadgets showing you the best ore caches, but it otherwise is very predictable.  You still mine for the typical elements, and still craft mostly the same old stuff.  The gear progression is a little odd to me as well, with iron gear being less effective than bronze, which didn't make a whole load of sense to me.  You can create ""sets"" of gear that will give you a bonus, however I've only so far run across one set as such - though this will no doubt continue to expand.  You eventually progress to being able to craft modern and futuristic style equipment, but these seem only currently valuable to use against a small handful of enemies.  For the better part, I was able to completely able to dominate this alien world using medieval-tier gear.The buildings you find are quite interesting, although I crave more interactivity.  I'd love to be able to repair/access computer systems for example, that allow me to control things such as lighting, food dispensers, automated defenses, etc, etc.  You can find these buildings far too quickly and easily, though, and they are full of stuff that will obviate you needing to craft several different items.  They also make homebuilding fairly obsolete, as they are already a far superior shelter than what you can construct for yourself in the first few hours of the game.  Shelter is also something more of a convenience in this game, as night isn't particularly much more dangerous than day.  There is one species that is nocturnal and that can damage you, but you literally have to trip right over them for that to happen.The natural environments are unfortunately not terribly interesting.  You are going to be pretty well acquainted with most of the natural wildlife within the first few minutes of the game, as they tend to completely saturate your surroundings to the point of annoyance.  At first I would feel bad about accidentally killing those cute little Springtails, but they are going to wander into the path of your pick so many times that you will cease to care.  With only a couple of exceptions, the surface critters are so abundant that they pollute the tunnel systems below the surface.The underground areas are pretty stark and uninteresting.  The tunnels mostly feel very cramped and claustrophobic, and you don't run into too much interesting terrain until you get very deep and start to run into the ant-agonists (ha ha!) in the bowels of the underworld.  There are a few more new species to discover down there, and they do pose a more significant threat than the surface creatures, though not so much so that I ever really felt scared.  There are also currently no liquid or semi-solid physics you need to worry about.  No scenic waterfalls, or glowing pools of lava, or the danger of burying yourself in sand.  Because of all this, doing the necessary task of mining for crafting ingredients feels far more boring than it has to.Crafting is a mixed bag.  Literally.  Your bag is going to be mixed full of dozens of different ingredients.  You can craft several different collector satchels that will automatically sort different ingredients as you collect them, which makes it much more managable.  You can also craft most things straight off hand, no crafting station required.  On the one hand, it's more convenient because you can craft most things straight out of your inventory.  On the other, this makes the mechanic of having to return to ""home base"" nearly irrelevent for most things, and also devalues the need for storage objects - of which you are going to find plenty of anyway.  Some of the recipes don't make very much sense to me as well.  Tin armor being more effective than iron, and the idea of crafting crossbows out of bronze when this would in reality make it much heavier and no more effective as a weapon than plain ol' wood.  You do get to upgrade your fancy MEG tools though, and that's interesting, and you'll later be able to craft increasingly more impressive technological tools and weapons.The Bottom LineProgress is going slow, but I hope it continues.  Ideally I'd like to have larger and more interesting worlds to explore.  Villages, space pirates, aliens both friendly and hostile, etc.  I'd love to see emergent gameplay happen when various forces in the world collide, such as enemy colonies attacking each other, giving the player the option to participate in their conflict or perhaps just loot the corpses of the losers.  I'd like to see shelters become more important, as well as the defense of shelters.  It would be very cool to be able to build robots and autoturrets to help fend off hostile invaders.  Eventually what I'd hope to see is the ability to progress to the point of being able to build your own shuttle and travel to new, randomly generated worlds.  Perhaps building up entire colonies on multiple worlds and carving out your own little empire.For now, it's an interesting entry into a genre that needs some fresh approaches.  I will continue to monitor this game for more signs of life.			"

Early Access Review
								I've spent a great deal of time now in Signs of Life over the last few weeks and months, and I feel it's now a decent time to update my review of it. I still think the game deserves a thumbs up becasue it is definitely heading in a very good direction. From the mystery of Pioneer One and its inhabitants to the very well designed alien ruins, the game has an amazing allure that simply cannot be ignored. However......I must say that I purchased this game for a friend on the sole basis of showing him exactly how bad the inventory system is. I'm fairly certain he is now seeking extensive therapy. The game's inventory is so bad that I just couldn't NOT show it off. While the game itself is geting very good, the inventory could be better put to use in tech schools across the globe teaching new developers how not to design an inventory system. Simply put, it is a creature of pure madness. I'm quite sure there is a special place reserved in Hell where people will simply sift through an inventory system just like this to find a sweater for eternity, and that poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is going to find it faster than the player. I literally wish that just like the tablet, I could turn my shotgun or pistol on my own face in-game with a right click and just end it all after a few minutes of searching for that one item I just picked up. Yes, it highlights, no, you cannot see it behind the wall of crap already in there. Who thought ovelapping items after a sort would be helpful? So I have bags that auto-sort various items out, but a lot of good those do when they, too, become so cluster ♥♥♥♥ed that finding an apple is... how did I say it before? A chore.I literally could go days on how bad this inventory is, but that's probably enough bashing to get the point across. Besides, we have more to talk about here.But first... I can't humiliate the inventory system without making some suggestions to lighten the load. So, with that in mind, I would pose the idea of not overlapping items in the containers. Slotted bags may be in every game, but I assure you there is a damn good reason for it. You need a clear and concise view of every item in a bag. At this point, I would even welcome a text based inventory menu. Even something exactly like the crafting menu but for inventory would increase the usuability and efficiency of this inventory system by 3000%. On to other things... Datapads. I have one word for datapads.W H Y ?Why is there no journal? Why am I sifting through 15 identical datapads (amongst 500 other items blocking my view, mind you) to find that one datapad I just picked up that holds crucial information on where to get multipass lvl 2? Seriously?Though shalt use a journal. Bind it to a key, let me read past messages in one simple to use window on the interface. Don't throw me to the hounds of hell in that tiny white box of nightmare in the corner of my screen to find crucial data to progress the game.Now I know everyone might think this review is all bad, but by no means should it be viewed that way. I wouldn't take all this time if I didn't actually care. I really do think this game has LOADS of potential, and I'm not sorry I bought it. I finally got to experience the multiplayer aspects and, although I couldn't find a way to toggle off friendly fire, the framework performed quite well. Exceedingly well, perhaps. It's a fun game, with an incredible alluring mystery about it that you just want to know more about. I find myself wishing I could scan things with a query tool to learn about them, because exploration in this game is very unique. I can't wait to see what else gets added.I know she's still on the drawing board. So I say keep up the good work, and please, for the love of almighty Zuess and pals, rethink inventory. It's the worst aspect of the game right now.Side note to people thinking about buying and playing the game, you gotta give it a chance. It seems wonky at first, but it gets better. Just don't get sucked into the 9th dimension of hell that is inventory management.(PS, you should make those cracked bricks in Pioneer one look more cracked and noticable... had to google that one.)

								I've spent the better part of an afternoon/evening playing Sign's of Life, and I'm loving it!  I've spent many a days playing Terraria and Starbound, and I found myself at home when playing Signs of Life.  Personally, I like it more than Starbound, and feel the crafting system, so far, to be VERY deep!  I'm looking forward to what this game will eventually become, but even as it stands right now, I'm having a BLAST playing it!  I've definitely gotten my $10 worth of entertainment out of it, plus a whole lot more!			"

Early Access Review
								I love all kind of crafting style games and well i saw this game a time ago and well it did not look that interesting. Well i stumbled again on this game and this time i looked some videos from youtube and i got interested and bought the game. I was pretty surprised that this game was this good and considering its still early access. I did play terraria and starbound that are closest games that you can compare to this. But for some reason this feels a bit better somehow. Signs of life tryes to do things a bit its own way and not copying straight from similiar games and seems its a good thing because it feels a bit better.I like that this game is more scifi oriented and not much of fantasy at all and i hope it stays that way. Crafting system is very easy to use and it got categories and a search button that i have to use a lot. Lots of items need other crafted items so thats where search comes handy. Could be easier if there was possibility like double click on the required items on the crafting recipe so you could jump straight to making those and skip the search button that way.One thing more thing i like about the crafting is that when you find new resources lets say a new ore you learn recipes when you pick it up. Nice way to avoid confusion with massive recipe list at the start.It took me around 20 hours maybe to go trough about everything the game has to offer at this point. There are tough some stuff i still could get and will because it's hard not to play this game. There is just something that pulls into this game.But its not perfect game tough, it got bugs. I've stumbled on two so far, one was game crashing upon death. I've not died in a long time now so not sure if that issue is still in game. Second i found was that splitting items from a stack makes the whole stack gone all together. Other than that it worked pretty well.Can't think of much more negative to say other than its not finished and need more content in the game. If you like terraria and starbound i think this should be one to keep an eye on. "

								As it stands, the game is still fairly early.  The plot's not complete, and the tutorial is still being worked on.  But, what content is there is very polished, and effective.  There's a fair amount to do, but you have to piece it all together yourself.  This game does not hand hold you, and it can be punishing at times.  However, once you really get into it, the game is not that difficult.  I can't wait to see where the game goes from here, one to keep your eye on!			"

								My interest was first peaked when I saw Survival with Aliens, so I thought I'd have a quick peak at the game. What I thought was 30 mins of my time was actually 3 hours!This game is very addictive and you get sucked right in to the game. One of the cool things I ended up doing was crafting a Bow & Arrow, then creating walls for a penn where I could just take out animals from a distance to collect materials.It took me a while to realise, but holding the mouse wheel down to collect items IS AN ABSOLUTE GODSEND! Thankyou for putting that in!!I'm still trying to figure out if I can install some basic lighting in my mud house at this stage (for night time, which is pitch-black), but as a bottom line comment...... If you like sandbox vs survival vs aliens and you don't mind every hour of your life feeling like 5 minutes, then you must try this game.			"

								A strong, albeit lesser known, title in the Terraria genre.  Polished combat mechanics and solid character progression raise this above many of the others in it's class.  The game offers a good bit of exploration as the player tries to solve for all the unknowns on this alien planet.  The story isn't fully finished (as of this review) but what is in kept me intrigued.  While the game starts you out with little more than the clothes on your back, progression is still made fairly quickly.  The inventory system is a bit of a throwback to the days of Ultima Online but gives strong enough inventory filtering to make it easily manageable through early to late game.  At such a reasonable price I'd say it's a must buy for any fans of this genre.			"

Early Access Review
								I've only started playing, mainly due to what I've seen as the developer's genuine care and involvement for their community. I've been burned out by other EAs where the devs seem to just drop out, even if it had such a good foundation, and this has happened frequently in 2D side-scroller crafting/adventure games. The devs (I don't know how many there are, if there's multiple) seem to frequently update, are involved in the community, and don't come off as defensive rather open to anything. Even negative reviewers have commented positively on the Devs.Now, onto the game in a simple pros/cons list with overall review:Pros:  -Simple, yet lovely graphics. This is a smooth looking game for EA, nothing exceptional, but its extremely easy on the eyes.-AI isn't aggressive at appropriate times. I don't feel like I'm constantly under danger, which I appreciate when I'm trying to build/explore.-The technology in the game, although I'm barely in, seems great. As you come in a landing pod, you can guide it to land, and (as per story) the battery begins to die out, I landed on top of an animal splatting it. I actually laughed out loud when it happened, I'm not the type to laugh, rather smile at these situations, and I've come across a few more like it.-I think the Devs listening to feedback is obvious, in other reviews they talk about crafting issues, and as I've just begun to play this game, every ingredient you get opens a recipe, and it seems rather clear cut. While there is some struggle, (pickaxe, for example, I though I'd know how to make it from copper ore, but it took making boards to open the recipe), its not really a pain at all. Its an effort, as I feel there should be with some games. They've also included what seems to be a basic tutorial, again compared to other reviewers, there may've not been one before, and this is representative of the Devs involvement.-Ton of potential, for early access, its incredibly well-done, and considering they just added multiplayer, I think there's a ton of room for this game, and as the devs have proven themselves with this, I look forward to other games from them in the future. The pricing is just right for this.Cons:I'm only early on, I haven't really seen as many, so this is a nitpick attempt.-You start off with a multitool that can mine blocks and cut down trees. This isn't bad at all, I like it, but there's instances where a pickaxe or an axe may be necessary in the future, and that kinda gets lost on me. I've come across what seems to be deposits that I can only mine with a pickaxe (I haven't even gone really underground yet), but I don't know what the significant difference is. Again, this is a nitpick attempt, and nothing really critical of the game. As I advance in the game, I may add more cons here, of which I'll note it was edited in, but otherwise.. Not much. Its a really solid EA.Summary:This is what I had wanted from my other sidescrolling sci-fi EAs, except not only is it being properly and consistently executed, its being done so by an engaged Dev who seems to care for community feedback and does it at a extremely decent price. For thsoe who've been burned out by EAs that may've fit this bill, I can only try to assure you in that, I feel this is the one sure time we won't get burned. I'm crossing my fingers, but the devs are making a reputation for themselves and have passion behind this game that is all ready a solid foundation.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is great for an early access game, and pretty well polished compared to other games of this type.If you're the kind of person who enjoys exploration, quirky humor, or just a new experience, this is for you.I really wouldn't say that this game is a Terraria clone (This game has way better controls and animation)And I most certainly would not assosiate this game with Starbound, those developers kind of got their money and slacked.I'll get downvoted for both of those, but it's an honest review, accept it.These deveoplers are dedicated and push out constant updates, do polls on their offical website,(www.playsignsoflife.com) and ask the players 'what should be added next'? This really expands on early access' letting you watch the game evolve, you help it evolve, though that is contolled so the game does not turn into a mess of features.Lastly, I'd like to comment on the lore, as you cannot just have the whole story written up when a game releases on early access, they leave small hints telling you what happened, letting you piece the story together yourself and leaving intreguing cliffhangers to expand upon, allowing you to get together with the rest of the community to converse about it and really boost the feel of this game, and the community's interaction.It does have it's bugs, but they're very minor, and there is just a bit of missing content; those holes are being filled pretty rapidly, however!All in all, I'd give this game a 9/10 for now, of course this game could take a turn for the worse at any time, like any early access game.

Early Access Review
								I love the game so far with over 35+ hours invested and look forward to future updates with more content towards release, please keep in mind this is an early access review of the game in it's current state. As well my personal opinion and first impression, as I only write selective reviews on refreshing game experiences. So the only real issue that I have encountered is the fact that the world is a small place after all and loops around back towards the players starting position, which can be completed around ten minutes or less. That aside it is large enough in terms of depth, the surface world as well an ecological underground world where time has no meaning. I have also been informed  by the developer that ""world-generator"" is not limited to the previously mentioned constraint, and that is temporarily due to creating quality content to fill the void.   That fact aside there is plenty of content to keep the player occupied for many hours. As a game about exploration, this allows the player a rewarding experience. I dislike the linear trends of most games, feeding the player non-vital information through tutorials leaving nothing else to discovery. Games only need a few mechanics to be great, a storyline is just the icing on the cake. The game starts abrutly as your escape pod crashes downward into the atmosphere of an unkown planet with a limited fuel supply, you land safely upon flattened terrian with nothing remote of a civilization around as you gaze through the glass upon your new surroundings, you step fourth...    AGIS, your ""friendly"" artificially ""intelligent"" friend! This is your A.I. companion, and although it's moral programming is limited, AGIS will allow you to learn crafting reciepes,and reverse engineer as you discover new resources to survive. You will find from time to time, that AGIS is able to lighten your mood during convexing times upon the desolate planet, that or you have gone past the breaking point of your sanity. :DAGIS is part of your MEG Tool, that's the name of the device attached to your wrist. This multifunctional tool will allow you the player, topographical mapping functions, illumination, traction beam, and laser extraction, powered by a battery capacitor and lens. All of which are upgradable through precious gemstones, and salvage discovered on the planet.(Sapphire, Topaz, Amethyst, Ruby,etc.) in varied conditions affect functionality of your MEG. If you so desire, forgo all of the techology as decreed by the gods! And manually work the planet with your barehands (pick axe, gardening hoe, regular axe, shears, hammer, and seeds).   If your preferred genre of gaming and in general is sci-fi, for $10.99 you won't have any regrets, especially for a game that's currently in the early stages of it's development. Do not try to compare this gem to what's available on the market. If there is an aspect of the game you wish to have included, removed , or improved upon, offer a suggestion on the forums for the game, I'm sure the developers would appreciate it. I whole-heartedly recommend ""Signs Of Life"" if you are looking for a 2D side scroller with simple build and exploration mechanics. On a personal note this game satsifies my missing nostalgia for the 90's (SNES,SEGA,ETC.) .   If you found this review helpful, please help further the development of this game by rating this review, +1			"

								So I've had this game since around Christmas of 2015 and didn't start to actually play it until very recently. And I wish I had started back when I first got it. This game is a LOT of fun. The crafting is simple and diverse, fighting monsters is difficult when you first spawn, but as you progress (get better tools, armor, etc.) they become much easier, but to keep the challenge aspect the game has minibosses, bosses, and the monsters get progressively tougher as you dig deeper. The game also has a story that you can follow if that's your thing, which I recommend as it leads you to some good rewards. The devs are also pretty active too which is always a plus. Overall I rate this game a 9/10 and highly recommend you get it.			"

								Very good game for early access. I put quite a few hours into it and it was enjoyable. I like the UI how you open up the bags and you see all your items laid out inside. Although this can get very cluttered. I started playing a week before they implemented the auto organize feature, it does help alot but items overlaping eachother doesnt look that good. Also some item icons are huge while others are so tiny you can barly see what they are. Hopefully this will be addressed. I also wish they would make it so you can dig deeper. Even though the total depth is pretty deep. It does feel like it doesnt take all that long to get to the bottom.Overall: I cant wait to try this game again when it comes along more in development. First impression was i couldnt belive how much content actually was in the game for being a almost brand early access game. Compared to otheres ive tried out this game has much more items,monsters,recipes to craft, etc. For a $10 i whole-heartedly recommend this game.			"

								This game is AWESOME! the physics are not too good, but it is a 2d terraria type game. now,when i say that, i mean it's a 2d voxel based game about building and not getting your butt kicked. pros: amasing gameplay, dungeons and (a) boss character custumosation, and sheep that you can peg with fruits. cons: small world. thats about it. yeahhhhh. not a bad game.

								This game will naturally (and rightfully so) be compared to Terraria and Starbound.  I have all 3 and I think that SoL will be my favorite of them. I havent devoted enough time into SoL to say that with certainity yet, but the inital impressioins were very differnt from those I got with Terraria and SB. This game is more intentional it feels. Its slowed down a bit. Everything looks a bit different than what we are used to . Everything seems to have a bit more ""weight"" to it. I didn't drop in the world and craft full sets of stuff, construct a house, and run across the map laying waste to everything i saw within 1-2 hours.The best way to compare it really is to say... Imagine another football game came out. Something other than Madden. We would all naturally campre said game to madden. But when we played it we  would all likely say ""its a football game, but its not madden"". Its a 2D sandbox resource mining survival game... but its not SB or Terraria. Also, Its 9.99. Go buy it. Even if the DEVS packed up shop today and we never saw another update. There is alread 10 bucks worth of content.Should you buy it? Did you like Terraria? Did you like Starbound? Then yes.... buy this 2. Even if you bought all 3 you've still spent less than any big studio release =)			"

You have plenty of stuff to craft and diferrent monster to hunt. Overall, if you like Sandbox then get it, especially for that price.			"

								Having put 27 hours into the game now, I think it deserves a review.Even though this is in alpha there is still a good amount of content to play around with. You can make all the things, dig all the tiles (minus the ""bottom"" of the starting planet. Not sure if that will change later), fight all the creatures and feel cool doing it. My favorite thing has to be the laser digger; you can upgrade it to the point where you literally just pass over tiles and they are already dug. This is awesome.The data module that talks to you (Agis its called?) its rather amusing, talking to you like you would someone over the internet rather than an in-person conversation. I laughed outloud a few times at its responses.Its still got a ways to go but I feel like this game could be a real gem with the kind of developers it has. Good job guys and gals!TLDR; If you like Starbound or Terraria at ALL, you'll enoy this game.			"

								Signs of Life is an excellent game. I can recommend it for several reasons, and those will be listed.      It has a wide array of content, even if it is early access. I haven't played long, but I've already seen four fully (And beautifully) textured armor sets, as well as various different weapons and tools. There's a decent array of creatures, and more will hopefully be added. There is a good elemnt of exploration, even if the world is limited. Furthermore, the world is well designed and constructed. (There's a difference there)     It has a... servicable survival element. If you die, you lose all your items and there are a multitude of ways to die. The qualms I have with it is how easy it is to gather food and kill monsters. The fighting is also simple, which is perfectly fine, and in this case, good.     The game's controls are... Fine. You can rebind keys and all that, and the game is easy enough to figure out after awhile. However, there are a few minor problems with it. E.G. If you rebind a key, it goes back to default when you leave the game.     The game has good textures and a decent aesthetic. However, if there was one qualm I had with it, it was the voxel-based terrain. Some games do well with it, but those games (Like minecraft) usually don't utilize good textures, they're trying to instill nostalgia. In my eyes, voxels and lifelike graphics don't match. Still, it's still only a minor qualm, and many people enjoy the voxels. I might just be the black sheep.     Overall, I'd recommend this game for the above reasons. It has a great concept, it has great playability, it runs fine, and a fine aesthetic. Buy Signs of Life, it's well worth the price.			"

								This has to be my favourite game in this genre; if I hadn't had to  have taken a 3 month break due to an illness I would have many more hours sunk into the game. I don't have the time right now to write a more detailed review, that is something I will do that in the future, but I wanted to point out a few things I like about the game.I love the colourful graphics, the storyline, the crafting system. The myriad different items to make or find, the different weapons and armour,  the wildlife that sort of feel like a living ecology, the different aggressive creatures, wow the list goes on. As I said, I plan on writing a more in depth review at some point, but for now let me just say, if you like sandbox games with an interesting storyline and great graphics, buy Signs Of Life now! "

								Hell yeah this is a good game. Played it during an Indie-Game-Saturday event, and really enjoyed figuring out the interaface and how stuff works. Things appear complicated at first glance, but we quickly found it to be intuitive and well-laid out. The game sets the bar for how hot-bars should be done. Music is good, graphics are fine enough. What really sets this apart from others like it in the genre, is tech depth. I mean after 4 hours we felt that we barely scratched the surface here. Cool thing is that it is not simply a sandbox - there are actual storyline goals (as far as I could tell it is to rebuild the ship and get off the planet). Developers seem like cool people too.I think I got this in a bundle, but I would have guessed it should cost around $20. And for the current $9.99 price tag, its a steal.			"

								Let's start off by throwing something important out. This game is very much like Starbound minus interplanetory exploration.A wrist tool that acts like Starbound's matter manipulator was probably meant to be while looking cooler at the same time. Physics for arms/legs/tools meaning if you're in a mine tunnel, you'll probably want to stab that alien with your sword instead of swinging it since the ceiling's kinda low!Signs of Life is, compared to starbound, a well-polished game with more content. For example, one of the main issues that I find in Starbound is that the procedural creature generation holds back the crafting system. In SoL, killing a sheep gives you wool and red meat, killing a chicken gives you feathers and poultry. In SB, you're getting pixels or alien meat.The bases are also well made, make sense, and tell a tiny story. Again, it lacks procedural generation for the bases and just about everything, but I never thought that feature was all it's cracked up to be.The only cons I have is that mining is an extremely time consuming endeavor, and that the horizontal size of the map is very tiny. Overall, I feel the game has high potential. I would like to see a much larger surface, more surface features such as little buildings, and torches you can hold while using the wrist laser for mining.			"

								Alright my hat is off to the Dev(s) for this game! It is truly the most fun I have had since the chemestry portion of System Shock 2. Now that’s not a comparison but Signs of Life does have this in common with that title; no hand holding. Please don't change this, guys. That one aspect is where so many other designers take their game down a few notches by dictating to you exactly how you will spend your free time. In its current state Signs of Life walks the fine line between ""How the F do I.."" and ""Why did I pay for that?""    Here a bit of practical knowledge in how things are made and critical thinking of how to solve problems will enhance the way you play this game. You don't know how to make alloys? Read the Wikipedia page of how it’s done and you will more than likely be able to figure out the approximation within the game.     ""But Raj I'm dumb as FK and the only way I can afford to play games is because people on the street pay me to eat rocks and stuff. Why do I care about this game?!"" It's cool man, one: Get a factory job. Two: you can strike creatures until they die and then eat them in this game so you are covered. Many flashing lights with pictures and sounds of outside things in here.    There is so much I could talk about my experience so far that I would be here for another eight paragraphs when I know you guys won’t read it and I would rather be playing the game some more. So I'll just say this:If you think the industry is dying and there is nothing (good, original, fun, engaging, immersive) left out there and you WISH there was.. BUY. THIS. GAME. RIGHT. NOW.Dev Team: I will blindly buy your next title. "

								This game is obviously a work in progress and is lacking in some areas noticably the story which sets a damn good background but ends way too soon (Early Access and more due to come later). The crafting system is well thought out and your avatar has a genuine weight behind it which is lacking in other similar titles (looking at you starbound). Early Access though it may be there is still some content here worthy of the price they are asking (bout £8 at the time of this review) and I can heartily recommend this game if you are a fan of survival, crafting and terrraria/starbound.

								Ok, for those of you who like this style of game, and are looking for something new, this game has some very fun aspects. The game does bottleneck at the mining restrictions like most of this type so progress is limited to perseverance. It is not quite as good as some of the other titles in the arena, but it has potential to become very interesting. It is worth the price they are asking and defenately worth it if you can find it on sale.			"

								Well, not the most user friendly game so far.  I spent a short time getting used to the interface and controls but have already found a couple of issues.I changed the Font/Text Size in Optioins to Large but there is still alot of small text around, especially in some of the pop-up boxes.More importantly, I tried to change one of the key bindings and it doesn't work.  A certain action is defaulted to the middle mouse button, but I prefer to use the Right Mouse Button...but no dide.  It would not accept the RMB as valid!?  I'll check with the Devs and see if that can be fixed.To game looks great and you get some useful tools right off the bat.  So while the keybinging issue is a bummer, I'm still giving this game an Early Access Rating of TBD... (To Be Determined)			"

								I can't recommend this game, especially when you consider its price. If you wanna fork out that kind of dough you're better off getting Starbound or Terraria. The game has a very clunky feel to it and it's obvious that it's early-access. Maybe it won't be so bad when it gets out of early-access but I'm doubtful.			"

								From what I can tell, Signs of Life is a quaint exploration game. I quite like it, the exploration is fun. One thing I don't like is that the game is apparently open to crashing randomly, at least for me.My take on Signs of Life is to give it a go. From the devs being awesome and listening to the community, they'll iron out any major crash bugs within an update or two.			"

								'Signs of life' is another one of 'dem ol' Sanbox games. But unlike most sandbox games, Signs of life has a lot more of a better feel to it, such as characters bending this way and that to look in the mouse's direction, pickaxes colliding with rock in it's swing arc regardless of whether or not that's the one you aim your cursor at, running and walking aminations are great, and all in all it brings a lot of life to the character. You're not some blocky dude, or a sprite that looks like it was ripped from Final fantasy, you play as a detailed human being. You begin your journey alone, save for your trusty wrist device's AI (Whom may or may not have zero sympathy for human life), aboard a pod freshly landed on some alien planet that isn't too different from earth, save for the fact that you can probably walk along it's surface in like, 15 minutes. But you aren't quite so alone, with sheep, tapirs, and other generally peaceful wildlife decorating the planet's surface, while deep underground, you'll find things that you'll need to shake more than just a stick at.With plenty of weapons, armors, parts, items, objects, and basically a whole metric sh-tton of other stuff, this game is packed with crafting materials. And you don't just use some logs to make things like a chair. No, you saw them into planks, use cotton and thread to make padding, and craft nails that you require a hammer to use to assamble the entire thing. Crafting isn't just slapping a few pieces together, you craft all of the parts needed to assemble what you need. And there's lots of things to be made. Need guns? SMGs, handguns, shotguns, rifles and more are a lengthy mining trip away. Want to hit things? Swords, clubs, bats, and even weapons made from pieces of your foes can be made to give your target a good beating or cut them down to size. Want to protect your delicate babyflesh? Armors can be made out of anything, from wood and twine, to bone, to iron, to silver, to some of the rarest minerals you can find.The game is still in alpha when this review is/was made, but it's still a fantastic game so far, with multiplayer now built in and more amazing things on the way. Keep it up, developers, this one may just set a trend for a whole new generation of sandbox games.			"

								Really enjoy playing this game. I am a big fan of Starbound. This game is very immersive also. I really like the progressive learning that is evident in the game. And thus far the mystery surrounding the game via messages is great. Did not really know if the map device would be useful. But it is proving to very important to the games progression. All I have to say is keep the content coming. I also really like the crafting involved. Also like that combat has many ways that it can be resolved, not forcing one into just one solution. Thank you also for the console toggle that lets you determine if you want to lose all possessions or not. You give the player the option to play as one pleases instead of being forced to only what the developers or just a select group of people would want.			"

								I enjoy the game. I like the feature to where you do not know how to craft things until you find the materials and other things and the bosses. I love everything about it but one thing. The only think I dislike is that there is no feature to choose if you can keep your inventory upon death. But that aside, I recommend this because the different weapons you can make and the tools you can use.Edit: You can do /toggledropitems to choose wether a character drops items upon death or not. There is nothing else about this game that is bad. Atleast in my opinion, I am really into this game.			"

								To start off, I have to say that games that are similar to Terraria are my favorite types of games. I've been looking for a similar game for a while, but I haven't had much luck.That being said, I really like this game. It's not too hard, and it's not too easy. It requires patience, there are TONS of things to craft. There's a lot of unique features that Terraria type games lack. But there still isn't much of a building prospect yet, or at least in my opinion. I see a lot of potential for this game. I would love for worlds to be bigger, to see a dungeon aspect, with more monsters, and more bosses.So far, I like the game, it's more enjoyable to play than a few other Early Access games.			"

								OK. WOW! im not sure how many hours i put in. but i bought this game this morning. and havent been able to put it down since. i dont think ive eaten today either. this game is early access, and so far, ive seen almost 0 bugs. and those are just silly visuals that dont take away from the game itself. the open sandbox and ammount of things you can do just by standing still and crafting is astounding. i am really impressed. im an avid sandbox gamer. (minecraft, tererria, rust ect.) and since its only 10 bucks usd, i KNOW im going to get my moneys worth. i cant stress the beautiful graphics even on a 1080+ just stunning. for all you sandbox fans, this is something to get while its only 10 bucks. the downside is people who are new to sandbox games might have a difficult time gettin the grasp of it all in one go. i would say intermediate level of play. but again, ive barely scratched the surface of this gem. BUY THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME OR THE ROBOT CHICKEN WILL SHOOT RPGS AT YOU AND YOULL DIE AN EMBARASSING DEATH. MWHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Graphics amazingStory- Confusing, but good.

Early Access Review
								I was originally somewhat skeptical of Signs of Life, as the trailer and screenshots I'd seen hinted at what I would probably call a ""Baby's First Terraria"".  After recently being disappointed with Darkout, I decided to give this one a shot.The first thing I noticed was your AI companion and the giver of what amounts to the game's tutorial (unfinished as it is).  Namely, I noticed that I actually grunt-chuckled a bit at one or two of his lines, which is something I'm not used to experiencing...  I mean, sure, he's no comedic god, but how often is it where you honestly make some audible expulsion of breath when playing something by yourself?...the second thing I noticed was just how helpless and left to your own devices you are in the beginning.  Not to say the game is particularly difficult, it really isn't...  But the learning curve for figuring out what you're supposed to do and how you're supposed to do it is quite a tricky slope.  It does somewhat help that AGIS is as snarky as he is, so those first flailing hours of trying to work out how to do and craft things really makes you feel like the self-destructive primitive fleshbag AGIS thinks you are.  Still, it really helps to be very patient with this game in the beginning...  It doesn't so much hold your hand as thrust it into a fire and then smack you for getting yourself burned.Perservere through the liftoff phase, and you'll find an actually quite pretty, engaging environment with lovely lighting effects, a great deal of playstyle customization, and an atmosphere that manages to be irreverently tongue-in-cheek and yet still bizarrely creepy and tense at times.The game is still quite unfinished however, the ""tech tree"" and progression of the game is hamhanded at its absolute best, and a confusing maze that turns in on itself at all other times.  It's frequently very difficult to find out ""where do I go next?"" or, worse, ""what do I *DO*?"".  As well, the game currently just sort of peters off as there's no real indication that you've accessed most or all the recipes and enemies it has to offer at this point.  But it will certainly give you plenty of hours of exploration and running like a coward before that time comes.All in all, I would very much recommend this title.  It's different enough from Terraria to stand alone as its own game, similar enough to not be completely alien, and in my opinion actually does a few of the gameplay mechanics better than the genre's poster child.

								Decent Terraria-type sandbox game. Leans more towards a realistic feel than the other games in the genre. Has a goofy sense of humor, but doesn't feel like it's overdone. Developer has stated they are focusing more on an enriching story than a free-form building game. Already has some interesting plot elements, but still feels a little shallow right now. Lots of construction options, but a lot of them feel kinda pointless at the current time - feels like a work in progress, which is only a bad thing if the developer doesn't follow through.Overall at this point in time, a good game for maybe 10-15 hours of playing. I think it's worth the current asking price of $11. Looking forward to some future updates. especially the continuation of the story, and I'll probably come back and check them out.			"

								Game is awesome, and adult, and the characters arent microscopically small on the screen. Could be amazing, ive played though the content once a yearfor the past two years. Best of all the side scrolling crafting games ive played. I have this fear though, that its never going to be finished, Edit 4-27-2017Very pleased to have the developer respond to my comment, this is one of the few games that I have loved for the past many years, if you are considering this game at all, buy it, it is increidbly polished and fun, with great mechanics (the wrist lazer and upgrades are so fun) once its finished I have no doubt this game will be on my top ten favoites of all time, right along with games like FF7, Ocarina of Time, RE4 etc. Its a fresh expereince with great story and mechanics. Exicted to see it finished, cudos to the devs, so glad you havnt cut and run like so many other, best wishes to you.For the price the game is amazing and ive enjoyed it infinitely more than triple A titiles that ive spent 60 plus on, to anyone interested, buy this game and support the devs, we need more games like this.

That was completely my mistake. That actually changes a lot of the issues I personally had, and this is now a YES RECOMMEND game now.I've saved the original review below for context with the dev comments:------Previous review--------I cannot recommend this game at this time. It's too early to buy.I think a lot of the problems I had were with the early access so don't take this as a complete no on recommendation, just no for now.  It's a bit clunky and counter intuitive, the controls are not optimal and the toolbelt can be frustrating. I think it's just too early right now, and it's clear there is a lot of work to go on the game. I'm not sure if I have a lot of faith in the controls getting better because they're so bad, but hey anything can happen from now and the time of completion. So take that comment with a grain of salt. On a more positive note there are some really great moments to this game and it shows a large amount of potential.I will review this again at a later date as the game is more complete and hopefully upgrade it to a recommend. But for right now, I can't recommend it for the state that it's in.----------End of old review------------Thank you so much to the Dev for responding and clearing up that issue with the game, turns out it was me. I can tell that this game is going to be good, and the fact that the dev took the time out to help me with my specific issue is beyond awesome. Thanks Signs of Life!			"

								SOL(Signs of Life) is an EPIC game! It's so fun to play!SOL has many things to craft, create, build and fight. This game is well programmed and has great performance on all my computers and notebooks, I can't believe it's still in Alpha its more like a full game.			"

								I had fun playing this game, its well built and has a good graphical feel. this game has some exploits that really need to be fixed, rocks are genuinly the most OP weapon in the game my brother and I beat the first boss with them!pretty much any enemy in the game *Aside from 2-3 enemys* rocks will kick there♥♥♥♥♥without you having to risk yourself. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying this game is bad but rather it needs work in some areas.spears also are near impossible to pick up (at my time of playing) which was frustrating. also this game has a lot of bullShzit such as keycards, this was a confusing item to get and I'm really not to sure how we got one. Other than hitboxes, parasite sheep glitching through blocks I had a fun time with this game, currently I wouldn't reccomend you go into it looking for a 15+ hour experience because its only really fun for under 15 hours, unless you dont complete the game then your good until its done theres not really much replayability.Thats my personal opinion of this game, feel free to respond6/10. needs exploits fixed really			"

Foreword: I was kind of new to this kind of genre, did some other type survival/craft games but not this one.Recommending this game was a easy choice.  It's fun, much to do and a lot to explore already in it's early stage. It has some bugs but the devs of this game are one of the most involved I have ever seen. There is almost always a dev around on the discussion page. Giving tips and major help. I have no doubt that they will finish this game to perfection in the future. Also, bugs are expected during early access, don't let it scare you off from buying this. Should you encounter a game- or progressbreaking bug, see that you contact an developer, I am sure you will have it fixed in no time.(Will update the following as the game progresses)Pro's: Very involved developersGraphicsMusicCraftable itemsWorldsizeCustomizable CharacterWildlifeGameplayGame is autosaved very oftenCon's:Sounds could me more abundantBecause of Early Access you may encounter some bugsMore extensive noob tutorial would be nice11/10 - Would fall to death in a pit I dug myself again.

								I've had this game for too damned long without doing a proper review. I got this game pretty early in its dev cycle, and with every update it just gets more and more fun. It's one of those games I keep coming back to. Tons of weapons and tools and... quite frankly, toys to play with. Kill mobs with swords, a whip, aluminum baseball bats, bottle rockets, party snaps, firecrackers, a blunderbuss, a heavy duty laser cannon... Definitely a game with a sense of humor. IMO, it's a bargain at twice the price.			"

								Signs of life. The title of the game explains exactly what this game injects into the Open World/ Survial/ Building hybrid genre thing that a good few games have going on. A pulse in the almost ""Beating a dead horse"" game style. A sign of life that is! Puns aside. I don't compare games. Signs of Life lands you on an alien planet, that isn't too alien. It's like Earth in ways, thats why it was chosen. But like Earth it's got it's own life forms and plant life. This of course means some will be harmless and others want your sweet meats! Gravity is still a thing here, but your guy jumps like it may be less, or he might just be robot from the waist down, I don't know IT'S SPACE AGE FUTURE STUFF! Onto the game itself. There's a story, but it's being worked on of course. The crafting is pretty solid, a component you might need to craft makes sense. One thing about it, is you're gonna need to take steps at times. Take Dynamite sticks for example, you need cotton and wood to make a spool of cotton fabric, then you need the fabric AND more cotton to make cotton cushoining. But that's still only 1 out of 4 items you need to make Dynamite. This isn't really a problem with how much the game provides you with! Sure you think it has too many things around, but you're also on an Alien planet that hasn't been overrun by humanity so supplies abundant! And you're gonna notice you wished you collected more before trying to craft, trust me.This is a good game. I can see it going in a good direction and the scale being wonderous. Buy it for a breath of fresh air.			"

								Game needs content beside digging and rarely crafting something.From my 10 hours of playing 9 was digging down down and down to get some new ores to smelt - lead or silver or else. Nothing really happens, alien bases are just empty or drones there. I can't see any reason to build home at all (as you can smelt everywhere). Great idea with bracelet upgrades, but I was able to find 1 red gem for all 10 hours in the box at alien base - never found it while digging. So how much rewarded should I be improving my bracelet mining power after xxx hours of digging? That doesn't feel right.Game seems boring and what should be fun (digging, building) seems rather punishing, when you need to spend several hours to dig down to get lead or silver. If you are interested, I would advise you to separate 'digging layers' not by huge length as it is now (instead you should reduce it at list 2-3 times), but by filling each 'digging layer' with unique and really dangerous enemies. That would make a reason to smelt / craft 'all that' - and you know, preparing yourself for danger & fighting it or be smart to avoid it and get rare resources is 100 times more fun then just digging one extra hour			"

								Game has a cool idea, but minor problems galor.Many of these you can fix by changing a setting or somehting, but there's a lot of them.No Tooltips.Poor TutorialManual pickup of everything.Janky controls.The writing? Good.Graphics? Solid design scheme, someone put a lot of solid effort into making the game gra[phics cohesive and descriptive.But when I'm stuck trying to figure out how to grab things, and move them around, and having to continually reference stuff - the game needs some improvements.It's showing the standard flaws of an early access game - a community forms, and educates itself so it doesn't see the little bugs, and it increases the barrier to entry for nubs like myself.Will re-review when it is no longer early access.

								In all honesty, i love playing games on my off time with school and anything thats on steam is great. There are alot of things  this particular game has going for it, dynamics of exploration, different sequences of products you can develop, and the assumption that you can develop many different ways to suit our personality throughout it. I know this game is still being developed but i would have thought it would be essential to looking at guides or a mode where you can play the game in a guide to actually understand the fundamentals of what youre actaully doing. For instance, i play for 20 mins looking my character...not really knowing what to do or what was available until i watched some youtube videos. I think developing an actual guide to what this machine does and what it will do for you, levels of exploration in deep underground mining, levels of hazards when pursuing deeper exploration etc. Plus it seems once you go underground, the surface seems to not provide much other than trees...and maybe it should be balanced a little bit. Ill definitely continue playing the game to get better at it but maybe more bases and or guides to upgrading can help. Thanks.			"

								You tried starbound ? This one is 10X better. Buy it ! It is a fun and clever game :- Nice features, blocks realistic and lovely (not the painted ones of starbound)- An amusing story, yes you red it, a STORY you discover reading data-notes- A real crafting system (and a real scavenging) No you will not copy stuff, you will have to craft them !- Hard to progress if you're not carefull (as in minecraft). Advice, first stay in surface and craft at least a bone armor.- Challenging mobs with their differents strenght and weakness. Don't try to attack the armored one with bow/sword- Even the mining or fight animations are nicer than the Starbound ones ...You will enjoy it.Some time after :It seems i geared my character to the max and killed any kind of mobs ... I still can built an house. There is only one kind of planet.  I wait updates, the creators are very actives  ;)			"

								The game is great at it's current level of development. Though the game can be frustorating when it comes to finding certain resources, like grey stone to make a campfire, lack of clear objectives and directions, and the very small hit boxes on the creatures (talking about when you try to kick a creature), I really like the game. It has pretty good controls and a really good concept. The theme of a sifi, sandbox, building game really fits it. Despite some difficulties navigating caves and the other frustrations, i can easily see this game grow to multiplayer game that almost loved by all. As the game developes, I bet a lot of the games current tools, like the mini map hologram, will change and upgraded to even better tools (couldn't think of anything  better to say there). At it's currently an alpha game, i give the game a 6 out of 10, because I know others might not be as patience and understanding of its alpha gameplay. To me personally though, I give it a 7 or 8.

So when I pressed launch, it started loading and then it says I need to update my graphics drivers and that i need to install a driver providing OpenGL 2.0 or higher. Now all of this is because you changed the engine.Hope you find this review helpful and fix this.			"

								If you read nothing else read the bold text at the bottom if you already plan to buy this game. Wow when I first looked at this on my brothers gamelist, I laughed. ""A terraria clone god it even looks weird"" But then I played it, infact I was so sucked in that I set my last white chocolate vanila icecream lemon sorbet filled icecream bar down for a second to do something in this game and it ended up melting into a puddle next to me.... anyway.It's exactly what I thought it was, But it is also more.The tool that you use to mine is a good example, something so simple as the graphics of making it look like a cutting beam had me locked in from minute one, lots of little things make this stand out from terraria's shadow not that it's better, but that it's different, But I have loved every minute off this game so far!Now before you run off buying this, take this to heart, cause I people need to think about this first and some never do and end up unhappy and on here venting anger.THIS IS AN INDIE GAME!

								This game is actually very fun.  For being in early access still this game has so much to offer.You can mine, build, upgrade, hunt and much more!To get better gear you have to collect all materials you come across and to access certain stations you may have to even explore deep under ground or break into other buildings just to get the ability to access the stations.All in all - I love this game and I look forward to what else they have to offer.

								Lots of content and things to do so far.  Still in development of course, but even so I'm glad I purchased it.  Really looking forward to how the story plays out and what new things will be added in the future.  For now, I've played about as much as I'd like to... but I'll be coming back after a few more patches.			"

								I generally love the game.  While still clearly in early access, the graphic design is solid, and gameplay is getting firmer every day with no crashes or game-ending bugs I've found!  A lot of mechanics are still under construction, but the devs are dedicated, active in the communtity, and seem to be ever moving in the right dirrection.If you're willing to wait a bit between updates, and put up with the usual occational early access issues (and starting your game over on a regular basis to see new content), it's a solid buy.

								This game is really good.  The controls are tight and the artwork is very pretty.  It's like Edge of Space except this is executed properly.  Both games have similar descriptions but 'Signs of Life' has the fundamentals down pat.  If you were apprehensive about buying this game because of past disappoints with other games in the genre, don't worry.  The Devs are focusing on the right areas for this game's design and will put more of the content in later, as opposed to some other games out there with all the bells and whistles but have artwork that clashes and mushy controls.

It may be a little slowpaced and you won't get alot of recipes at first, but in all fairness the game is in Alpha and it is very awesome for being in Alpha. I have committed 70 hours to this game so far and I hope to commit many, many more!      Yes it does need fleshing out, BUT the Develepors actually listen to you. You can vote for items on their homepage and make suggestions in the forum. Hell, they even talked to me a couple times when I posted problems I was having with the game and pointed me in the right direction. What else can I say?     Do you like rocket launchers, cool snazzy threads, giant chickens that rain hellfire( ok its only one giant chicken so far and dont think there will be any others but he is supposed to play a more important role later), machine guns, dynamite, whips, chains? oops, no chains. sorry. Anyways. Get this game and help us help you help us help you all by posting in the forums and helping the devs.			"

								3 out of 6 stars. I'm on the edge here, but ultimately not reccomended. Mostly ebcause of low replayability.Pros: - nice graphics in comparison with similar titles- clearly SF-themed and oriented- some interesting objects and animals that do make you feel like its an alien world.- has some background story and its interesting to play it the first timeCons:- short, you can reach top range gear quickly and not much left to do from that point on- while the world is procedurally generated, the amount of biomes and objects is very limited. So playing it the second time feels entierly the same as playing it teh first time. - building options are frankly very limited in comparison to let's say terraria or minecraft. For such an SF-themed game, you will be unable to build the nice futuristic style buildings that you can see in the game (these are NPC ones and mostly cannot be removed or rebult).- Same main missions, same boss etc in each playthrough.- Low overall replayability. This is sadly not what one would expect from minecraft-ish style procedurally generated world games.Overall teh game can be enjoyable in you first playthough, but once you pass it once you ill have no reason to play it again.

								Note: There is no end goal at the time of writing this review of the game.Interesting game at first. But I find that the game is very uninviting very soon after you've explored the topside of the planet and gain access to some of the buildings.What you'll soon find out is that (at this time of writing) the majority of the game has you digging underground. So much to the point that they should have called this ""Signs of Digging"". It's very repetitive and a chore at times. Unlike say terraria where there are many surprises both above ground and below ground. Signs of Life turns into a sci-fi mining simulator for material to craft items which is actually the other interesting content in the game(at this time) but even this has it's own problems.Now I've played the game way back before and I got to say. The UI was terrible because everything was just text in the crafting menu.But after coming back it to see if anything changed. I liked how the UI for the crafting has pictures/icons instead of text. If only it would have extended into the items you could be crafting and also giving highlights to items that are craftable. Instead of just text.I'll say this, at least the game this time took up a good couple of hours of me finding material to craft items. But after finding out that there's no end goal and that the game is still in early access. I stopped playing and will return much much later to see if there is anything new to actually do.Long story short do I recommend it?Honesty no I don't, the reason I have so many hours in the game is because I have patience and having to put up with the frustrating and boring aspects fo the game.Also another thing is that at points I needed to look up a guide to progress in the current state of the game. Which I immediately put a strike on the game for driving me to look up what to do next.But hopefully the developers will improve the game and make it better. I mean they actually responded to my review so at least I got their attention about the game.			"

Is a Sci-Fi,Terraria,Starbound AND Edge of space like game (Although I have NOT played Edge of space I saw trailers) And I LOVE Terraria (And LOVE Starbound also) but unlike Terraria it has more hmmm Realistic feel like the movement and speed of attacking and moving all together OKAY Pros and cons time! Pro's: 1. there is a humorous A.I that is in a Pipboy on your arm (not really a pipboy)           2. You can kill random chickens           3. When you swing a sword,pickaxe,axe,etc. it bounces off the wall (REALISM!)            4. There is a giant robot murdurous chicken to the far right side of the ""Alien planet""           5. MANY MOAR!Con's: 1. Yes I will name 5 each           2. Do I have to name con's?           3. But there arent that m---           4. OW!           5. err okay.

								I absolutely love it.a few problems with the game tho.It's just too easy,there is a wide variety of armors and weapons that all go by really nice with the animations.Once you go minining for the first time you'll be able to get a full iron set and a silver pickaxe or if  you are not a filthy casual you might even have steel equipment (pickace,axe and swords) not that purple garbage.Right of the bat you are given a lazer-like mining tool that can DO ANYTHING FROM THE START (you will never need to use most of them simply because the lazer is op).The game goes for a story line that is more of an objective (items) hunt rather than a actual story (we just want to cool stuff) in order to progress you need to find signals of abondoned structures and get better equipment. So why not do the same for the lazer thing? More update are no the way filled with hours of fun but as of now the underground is boring and most of the enemies you encounter are easy to kill and some of them even drop really nice stuff and by 'nice' I mean stuff you shouldn't have soo early(like gems or whatever that make your lazer stronger which as mentioned above makes the game even easier) all of the weapons give the game a nice feel,the feeling you get when you upgrade from a bow and arrow to a burst rifle (which is best ftw) is amazing but it falls just short when you realize that most of the weapons do♥♥♥♥♥♥damage and that means that instead of getting a burst rifle or any other weapon for that matter you might as well just stick with the clobb- the smg with terrible accuracy but with a damn fine fire rate.Why you ask?the burst rifle does 10-15 dmg (depending on the enemy you're facing) and the clobb seems to do the same.What would you preffer, to hit an enemie 3 times for 10-15 dmg or 15 times  for 10 dmg?(rifle round vs 9mm come on now...) Don't get me started on the railgun and the rocket launcher 4 devastating hits for a crab/frog looking creature? come on! Just a few buffs and a few tweeks to make this an awesome game (and more enemies to use it on).The devs are really cool guys,which is why I just know they will make the game better with time,and I'm willing to wait .(excuse my english and obvious lack of punctuation)                                                                                                                                                                                        -Cream			"

								If you played Terraria or Starbound, then you'll feel right at home here.  The mechanics are pretty similar with the occasional tweak here and there. There's a fairly typical mix of old and new weapons, swords vs guns and so on. It's nice that to have an early armor options that require minimal killing of things, although some of the plants can be deadly, since some of the critters that drop leather are kinda dangerous.At this point (0.6?) the limited story is a bit of a downside in my opinion. It feels disconnected, kind of like my experience in Starbound up to the initial starbase and thereabouts. Terraria has a stronger, but looser narrative. I think it'd be nice to tie the player in a bit more, since whatever the lore is aside, it feels like the player crash landed and then stumbled into stuff. So, there's not much attachment or concern for the back story people except to hope they had some good stuff you can loot and take not of any warnings about what to avoid... Not sure why I've crashed on a planet in an escape pod.Regarding the UI:I do think that the inventory is not a strong point as is. It's interesting, but stuff visually overlaps, which is a little annoying when you have to click on things and having to manually request auto-arrange/auto-sort can be annoying at times. The auto-bar which groups items into a small set of categories and provides access via scroll to all items of a certain type through a particular bar is, however, a nifty feature, even if it occasionally leads to unintended shooting (you know, like of your foot!) and food consumption... One of the more interesting notions is how the map works. You don't get a map by default or even by passive exploration, you've got to actively build one with the scanner. I'd strongly recommend upgrading it at least one step before engaging in a serious world mapping attempt, though, it'll make it a fair bit easier.TL;DRFun to play and fairly engaging, but there's not pressure to build anything more than a minimal shelter before heading off to explore. The AI communications are annoying in a way, but a nice touch even if it's kinda of telling you that you're an idiot the entire time and implying that you wouldn't even survive without it's help. Some things to get used to with the user interface (UI) and movement. Also, try not to fall too far, it's kind of painful.P.S.Giant Robot Chicken is a plus. Surprised that it's peaceful if you don't attack it though. Might be funny if there was a base in the game somewhere that looked like the chicken gave it a hard time...			"

Early Access Review
								Steam recommended this one.  I bought it because it seemed like Starbound, both in graphical style and in game content.  But as it usually is on Steam, let the buyer beware.  Because this game is a frustrating mess that anyone would be better to avoid.At first glance, the game is pretty and detailed - graphically the game works...however...Altho the game doesnt state it, this is a digging game.  You dig...and dig...and dig.  The game only progresses when you dig.  It slows the game down to a boring crawl.  Can't make steel until you find anthracite...and that one is VERY far underground.  Funny thing - you can build a laser pistol, but you cant make steel. Combat just plain ole sucks.   Weaponry, when you can make something useful,  is laughably  underpowered.  Three shots from a pistol to kill a crawling slug,  anything bigger and you better be climbing...if you get caught on a straight run, you're dead.  Not because you dont have something that will do the job - you just can't access it fast enough in the clunky UI before the monsters kill you.Crafting recipes, while seeming to be balanced, hit an invisible wall because of two things: a required ""Project"" and the correct materials.  Recipes show up based on what you pick up, meaning that you may get a recipe you can't use, because you're not sure what the resource is from.   Add in that you may have the materials, but can't use a recipe because you can't complete a required Project, and frustration ensues.Also, prepare to restart again and again...with nothing.  When you die, and you WILL die because of the poor game mechanics, you drop everything you own.  Everything...right down to your sandals.   Then you get restarted back on the surface sans anything.  Which means totally resupplying yourself and a long run back to where you died to reclaim all your swag before you can try anything else....which is totally unecessary and totally boring.  And of course you can't build anything to help with the restart process because the resources are too rare.  Catch-22.  For me, that was the thing which made the game more trouble than it was worth.Go spend your ten bucks on something else..stay away from this one. "

Early Access Review
								Version reviewed: 0.6.I understand this is early access, but I was still expecting a lot more from this game. A few things in the trailer don't seem to exist in the current version of the game (e.g. starting in a base, a jump-jet with unlimited fuel, a moon environment... it actually looks like the early parts of the trailer... that's supposed to be backstory, but presenting it in the form of actual gameplay that we the players don't get to experience is a dirty trick. Though there is still a very playable (if incomplete) game here with most of the demonstrated features. I still, though, have other criticisms.First of all, the inventory management system is a serious pain. With no auto-organizing, optional snap-to-grid placements, and the inefficent sort/organize functions for containers... at least being able to carry an unlimited number of nested containers and label them though, helps organize things. But something tells me the final version of the game is going to do away with that.Secondly, the controls. In addition to the difficulty of successfully picking up smaller/thinner items, there's also the awkward and clumsy movement that gives me lots of frustration trying to make jumps. It's also hard to attack exactly where you want to attack. Singling out the right item you want to use in automatic mode takes a long time if you've got a lot of stuff (and an effective unlimited inventory means you can and should get as many toys on your person as possible) and manual mode is impractical since the hotbar is limited to seven slots plus two quick slots.Thirdly is the fake difficulty. Death is cheap (you drop everything and respawn, and I don't think items ever disappear from the world) but it can be really irritating to get back to where you dropped all your stuff -- especially when you respawn with a partial bar of health, an empty stomach (you only regenerate health when you've had something to eat), and no armor. And many monsters that stand in your way can kill you in precisely two hits in that state. And then there's the frustration of having to re-organize your main inventory -- since whenever you pick something up with the grab laser (the fastest way to pick stuff up) it just gets thrown into a random spot in your bag.Fourth -- the progression. It just doesn't feel right. This is clearly a space-age survival game, but the metals available to use don't even include titanium. Steel is the second-best metal there is, with the tier after that being practical post-game equipment. Also, why the heck is bronze stronger than iron?Fifth, everything that's missing. No music. No way to quickly switch ammo types on a held weapon (you need to select the item in question which you probably have in a nested container in your inventory to change its used ammo).  No mechanism wiring systems (no designing elaborate traps or light switches). No liquids (water/lava/etc).I haven't even tried to build a base of my own because the game gives you a prefabricated base from the start, and building structures is made a lot more complicated than it has to be as every building material has like 8 different types of blocks, and the clunky interface and crafting required would make it more of a chore than it's worth. I dread having to build anything creatively in this game.I've clocked 31 hours into this game (as of this writing) and I feel like I've basically seen everything there is to see. That's depressingly low for a survival game. You're better off going for Starbound -- this game has a long way to go before it can even hold a candle to it.Maybe I'll check back in a few versions and see how it's advanced.			"

It's Sci-Fi themed world is just laced with atmosphere and eye candy. People will compare it to games like 'Terreria' which is a good trait to have, but games like 'Terreria' become stale overtime so a fresh approach and feel is needed. That approach and feel is present in this game. I was suppose to be giving this game a quick look for my 'A Quick Look' series, and already 2 hours have gone by... Man these games are addicitve. - Highly Recommended!			"

								This game has alot of potential and i mean it, at first you probably think that there isnt much at all because there isnt much to see on the surface it just loops but once you start your first mining operation and a couple of days later you realize this game is has alot to offer the creatures are intresting and hostile so you want more but soon things get old you know what the creatures do and how dangerous they are but you get past that and dig soon you hit rock bottom your meg tool and pick is useless you mine for materials untill you get better gems and a new pick thats the great feeling you get and thats progress you find cool new items and you want more thats what i had going on in my sessions its a great game and you should get it its worth it. Ok i suggest that you leave the review and move on because you wont get it if you dont have the game and your not experienced or a veteran anyways heres what i wanna suggest a deadspace mode and aliens(u no xenomorphs),i want gamemodes like arena (you fight to the death using what you can find in a area). zombie survival ? (like dayz or maybe black ops zombies type thing ) . I also would like to suggest humans vs aliens (like alien monsters vs humans and or aliens vs humans).*ATTENTION DEVELOPER*:if you decide to do any of these please dont rush it take your time these are suggestions not requirments decide if you wanna do it and thanks for creating this great game, Oh and please give me feed back i would like it :D			"

								I am not recommending this game at this stage of development (while taking into consideration it is an Early Access title).The progression in this game feels disjointed, the crafting system has a very uncomfortable UI and the inventory system is reminiscent of Ultima 6, complete with tiny icons in a large bag (but thankfully with drag-and-drop functionality, unlike U6). Also like U6, everything has the same kind of ""polish"" so it's not always clear what buttons do what on windows (the minus button was not apparent as the 'close window' button, especially with what appeared to be a button [but wasn't] in the very top right corner - where the close button always is in modern UIs).The game feels clunky in the UI and in how your character moves and interacts with terrain, and the animations add to the clunky feeling. This is part of a disconnect that I'm experiencing  I am not compelled to explore or figure things out, and when exploring it's not apparent what I can do with the things I mine/gather or how to do things with them. The game is clearly meant to be very open, but it is too lacking in focus at the beginning.However, this game is definitely not the worst in the genre, and I would still put it in the top 25% of this style of game. My recommendation is to wait until later in Early Access when more of the game is finished, and check reviews then. I hope the devs continue working on this game because it does have potential.			"

								I cannot honestly recommend this game ATM.  It's not a bad game but w/Steam's up/down review system I must err on the side of caution and give it a not recommended.The graphics are decent and the game plays fairly well once you get into it BUT there is very little to guide the player as what to do.  The crafting system is on the complex side with new recipes randomly(seemingly) popping up but they seem to be more tied to resource gathering.Resource gathering: a PITA.  While there is an autogather option that can be turned on, it SURPRISINGLY does NOT use the grabber tool and so only picks up what is on the spot that your character's feet cross.  The grabber used manually is easily blocked in ridiculous ways forcing more mining that one might want to do just to get at the originally mined resources.The game menus are a complete and total mess.  Honestly it's the best way that I can describe them, illogically organized and arranged.  e.g. when wanting to strart a new game with a new world instead of offering a NEW FSCKING GAME menu option you are presented with CREATE AN FSCKING CHARACTER.  This as you might surmise allows the player to create a new character which is just a name  and very few character depiction options.  To create a new world/map in singleplayer(SP) you must dig down into the SANDBOX menu(WTF?!) where you will find the options to generate a new world.  THIS IS ALSO WHERE you can DELETE OLD FSCKING maps/worlds.  Yes I would've though that would be my first place to look.  This menu madness continues EVERYWHERE in the game.Controls: while they work, they are clunky and dissimilar to ANY OTHER similar game.  Apparently like the menus they don't have a clue...Development: EXTREMELY sssslllllloooooowwwwww...If these things end up being correct upon release or close to it(as that's when I'm likely to bother trying it again), I'll update the review accordingly.

								The game looks cool and all, buuuuuuut it has no way to explore... more. I mean you walk a few blocks, you know, you find three labs. ""Thats cool!"" I said, but then you walk even more and find THE EXACT LAB I JUST PASSED LATER!Problems:1. World is SUUUUUPER Small.2.There is a secret hidden easter egg to understand what happened in the planet, but that's it! It doesn't even show you how to get. It was just a guy who discovered it and posted it on the forums.3.One boss only...4. The same aliens over, over, and over againGood Sides:1.Good textures and animations.2.Well done character creator and once again animations.My Opinion:Do not buy this game, yet.The game could expand and become even better. If you want to try out the game and test it out go ahead, but if you're just their to play with people just don't buy it until it's a full. The game doesn't have a lot of features, yet. Maybe it will on the future.			"

There is  little to no guidance in the game and it just feels absolutely infuriating when something you don't know is harmless kills you in an instant only to have you respawn with nothing. And good luck trying to retrieve your valuables from that cave you were exploring because that OP monster that killed you in two blows will continue *ss f***ing you until you bust a whole through your monitors just because f***ed up once.

								The idea of this game seems promising. Hopefully new features will be added soon.  The biggest problem for me are the controls. I found it very awkward to control the character and tis has put me off. Also the way the enemies move seem awkward. I have since brought Starbound which in my opinion is a better game. I hope this game moves in a different direction to Starbound as the way it is right now it simply cannot compete. I am glad this game was relatively cheap priced as I would have felt very ripped off if I had paid anymore.			"

								This game has a curious quaint style that starts to draw you in.   The crafting is fun and interesting,  showing promise at release as long as more content is added,  as crafting is currently a bit limited.   Ingesting ideas abound,  but again need a little more polish,  as enemy ai is easily tricked,  and is even simpler on multiplayer. The current final boss of the game is challenging on single player,  but doesn't drop aggro on the primary target, allowing a friend to stand behind it jabbing away. I really enjoyed the experience,  being a bit slower than similar titles wasn't a detriment,  and can't wait to see where the development takes this game.   Optimistically 8.5/10 for future game, current version 6/10 for small content/unfinished and low challenge through the material placement system.			"

								It's an okay game. It's not amazing but you can't really blame it. I can't wait to see what this game becomes. It's fairly difficult to grasp the functions and the inventories but it seems that it will get better (as it has before). I wouldn't recommend the game now but in the future, It's something to look out for. 5.5/10 "

Early Access Review
								The first two early access games I got into were the early access versions of Minecraft and Terraria. They were both great in their own ways. I've since tried other early access games and have had many disappointments. Fortunately, Signs Of Life did not disappoint. There is a lot of exploring to do, many things to do in this game and a lot of things to make. The game is stable and the gameplay is very smooth and polished. Development is a little slow, but it is steady. As of this review, I think we've been waiting on the next 'big update' for maybe over a year now. However, the devs are active. They chat on the forum. Occasionally they've put out an update which adds something interesting. I should probably add that the dev team only has a few people. So, progress is probably good and steady for a team of this size.Overall, the $9 price tag is well worth it. This feels like one of those games that someone made because it was something they really wanted to do, not just to make a quick buck.Also, there has been an Alien Artifacts update which is pretty nifty.
