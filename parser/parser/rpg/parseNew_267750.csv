												I have mixed feelings on this game. I love Shadowrun (it’s an rpg), but this is an xcom-lite tactical game with a Shadowrun theme. The big question: ‘is it fun and worth the sticker price?’ Yes its fun, but that might be my Shadowrun allegiance speaking. I don’t think it’s worth the sticker price, due to the lack of replayability and the stale co-op. There are better and cheaper tactical games out there, and for that matter, Shadowrun games as well. SR Chronicles has no offline single player mode, and had a horrible rollout because of it. I wrote two other reviews before this and the devs asked me to reevaluate each time, so I’ve put in more than a hundred hours playing multiple characters start to finish getting a good feel for the game. I’d pass on this game for a couple of months in hopes that they get their act together; even then this should only be a $15-20 game.Likes:-The community-The graphics in the tactical map-The music: Mass Effect 1 meets the original Shadowrun '93 game-The themeGripes:-Thumbnailed character portrait at creation.-Character names aren’t unique – I’ve been in matches that had multiple people with the same name.-I've had up to 8 people stuck in a party, which can only handle 4, and we all had to restart the game to get a mission to work.-Broken character clothing as loot, with no way to sell the 20+ pairs of blue jeans, etc.-Skills/gear max about midway through the game, making the skills kinda boring.-No magical counterpart to cyberware – initiation would be nice.-Low essence cyberware is no longer available midway through the game, so if you install something early on that you don’t like later on, you’re potentially stuck with it (if you already have 3/4 slots filed).-Lack of variety in music.-Voice acting is flat - tone is always the same, so in combat people won’t sound frantic, or are overly bubbly, etc.-Many missions share the same maps, and in many cases you start and finish in the same spot.-Graffiti seems a bit bubblegum and usually looks like it was done with a giant sharpie marker.-Character conversations in the hub: low-res character models, terrain that normally looks good, but is zoomed in so much it becomes a pixilated mess. To top it off the objects in the setting are high-resolution.- Occasionally when you kill someone they’ll become obnoxiously clipped to their gear as it rolls away (most notably flamethrower users).-There needs to be a message system for the in-game friends list to make sense.-Co-op needs an initiative log or something along those lines to fix the cache click problem – so you don't worry about attacking the same guy or moving on top of each other, stealing each others melee kills, and potentially losing multiple turns to actions you didn't know you took (I frequently lost 1 or 2 turns this way, but I've lost as many as 4).-Co-op incentive just isn’t there: If you get together with all your friends and try to run through together it’s fun-ish (but needs voice chat to coordinate), but you really can’t play with anyone else in the interim unless you want to continuously go through the same levels. If you get left behind, trying to co-op with your now higher level friends is even more difficult, because you could be stuck doing 3-6 damage while the guys you’re with are doing 20+ and they are sporting 20+ points of armor and 3x your hp, making you a flimsy target that can’t get better gear and is only getting a fraction of the karma. While your group may go back and redo all the missions to catch you up the rewards make it more like grinding for the sake of grinding.-If you run this game solo the npc’s only come with a single skill and sometimes their skills will unlevel between missions, and they don’t otherwise keep good pace with the karma level of the story.The devs have already drastically changed how the game was balanced since it released (abilities, damage, etc), and this is a game coming out of early access. They have whole portions of the game that aren’t even developed yet, that are part of the core game. The bugs are frequent and atrocious. You’ll find yourself having to logout of the game every few runs. Set pieces in the background will attach to the foreground, and trolls horns will disconnect and float in the next square over. Uncontrollable screen spinning is also a problem every now and again, as well as broken cursors. Critical hits will often cause the screen to zoon into the backside of a wall, instead of on the action. Frequently the End Turn button will disappear or move somewhere else on the screen. I think my biggest gripe is that the ability buttons don’t have enough of a click box (or it changes randomly) and when you go to click an ability you instead move to the space below the ability box. There are so many bugs that it’s not uncommon to run into people grumbling about something that should have worked (e.g. over 100% chance to succeed at a skill only to fail). If early access was closed beta, then the release is open beta. This is not a completed game and from day-to-day you wonder when they will reset your skills and what major nerf or tweak is going to happen next. All games get rebalancing, but this game gets totally retooled every time a patch comes out, especially with things like pets being added before fixing the bugs, making you feel like the devs still don’t know where they wanna go with it.

												First off, this game was not developed by Harebrain Studio, but another developer, Cliffhanger. While not a bad thing in itself, I did expect their own take on the Shadowrun title. After hours of playing Shadowrun Chronicles, it seem the games from each developer share little in common other than the Shadowrun universe. So I make the opinion of if you wanted another Shadowrun Returns/Dragonfall, you should wait for Hongkong otherwise you'e getting a more action oriented Shadowrun with a linear story. It's not exactly worth its price tag right now.Chronicles is a stripped down version of Shadowrun Returns in almost every aspect. What I can say about the story is that they released the first chapter for the game and I think it is somewhat bare bones. The chapter has set up a pretty good premise with a decent plot revolving around a mysterious infliction and a dragon. Unfortunately I believe it falls flat on developing any good antagonists or story companions at all. What pieces of characterizing is through nodes you click on and read while doing a mission, which seems lazy to me. What I also feel I need to say is that there are no dialogue options at all. There's little to no decision making throughout the game so replay value relies solely on trying out different character play styles. There is a hub of npcs like Shadowrun Return, which they're placed just as merchants, offer main quests and side quests or adding a small amount of context to the world. Currently, there is one major hub for the game and you don't really travel beyond that. Perhaps we will able to travel to different locations in future content.What is different is that the game is unlike its predecessor is fully online. Meaning you are playing on server and requires to have an internet connection. It also means that if the server is lagging, there will be time delay in your actions in and out of a mission. The real divergence is in the skill system. There are no attribute scores like Shadowrun Return of any sort instead skills are packaged into different sections: Mind, Body, Blade, Blunt, Hacking, Rigger, Pistol, Automactic, Shotgun, Spellcasting and Summoning. You invest skill points or Karma into these skill sections. Investing point grant abilities and passives of sorts. There are some synergy between abilties and passives, but not much depth to it. It seems right now there is no cap limit to amount of karma you can earn, but there is no way to get a refund on your karma or respec unfortunately.I want to mention that there is no matrix combat in this game. Hacking is now apart of other ""unlocking"" abilites (Organ Harvesting, Picking Locking and Demolition) that allows you to open doors to loot random items while doing a mission. Also there is only right now a very crude character stats page showing only what tier of skills you invested, but no details in what your hit percentage, critical strike, and such.The combat is where the meat of the game is. It's a turn base strategy game with usually four teammates. These characters can be henchmen of your choosing from a random list of mooks. who are not customizable at all.  It can also be someone you can invite a player from either a friend list or out of the chat channels. Unfortunately, there is no quick start or looking for group system in the game making it not so much user friendly for those who are shy or whatnot.The gameplay itself is often described to be similar to XCOM games where your characters are relatively fragile and getting hit by anything can be lethal or at least very damaging. So the game revolves around getting your character into a good placement to flank or take cover from your enemies. I like mention there is no types of cover in this game such light, medium or heavy cover. It just cover now.The enemy AI is pretty solid in that they'll try to on the most part get into cover and flank. Also they will try to focus fire, which can be good and bad.The missions themselves get rather repetitive and bland as you go along. It so far consists mostly eliminating all enemies or defending an area or character with some minor nuances. The same could be said about mission environment as you sometimes play the same map with different objective at times. As for enemies variety is pretty decent in what you fight as you progress with occasional boss fight.Since this game is considered a ""MMO"" or Massive Multiplayer Online and with that end game content should be discussed. As of right now, there's literally none. You cannot do anything after finishing the chapter, but you can join other player's story progress to garner more karma. Making end game content into a grind fest of sorts. Cliffhanger have announced they are going to release end game content soon though.What is missing though, if you have played XCOM or other Shadowrun games, is Overwatch. Overwatch allows you act against any enemy that enter your view range. It is considered to be one of the key elements for this genre that helps your charactes from being rushed by the enemy.What I wish it had as well is cover/environment destruction like in XCOM. It has little to none of it this game, which was rather disappointing in hindsight. I believe it would made battles more dynamic and more complex than its simple current form.Bottomline is that there is more work to be done for Shadowrun Chroncicle if it going to be more of an action packed game. In its current state is a very mediocre game that like other co op games gets somewhat better if played with a chummer or a friendly community player. I feel so far I have not gotten my money worth out of the game so I am inclined to not recommend it right now.			"

												While this is by far the best co-op turn based game I've ever played (in terms of making turn based and co-op not suck when put together). But it suffers from some extreme problems, and is ultimately not very fun. The devs are having trouble with fixing some of these issues due to the way the game is coded, and it's creating some various serious problems for a small portion of their player base (like me).All in all, it's a great idea that's ruined by poor planning and it's just not very fun. You'll see all this game has to offer in the first 10-15 hours, and then you'll repeat that same 1-trick poney 100 more times over the next 100-200 hours needed to get a character that is actually capable of doing the end game content.If you do decide to buy this game, do your homework before you make a character. Certain aspects of character creation can permenently make your character garbage at end game AND some of the weapon skills are DRASTICALLY underpowered (with no proper balance changes in sight, due mostly to technical limitations). So don't end up sinking 50-60 hours into the game like I did only to find out that your character is completely worthless at end game and if you want to be useful/have fun, you need to start over again from scratch.

Early Access Review
								Doing a quick once-over for the game again since my intial review, I've found that it has improved dramatically. Unfortunately, I would still not recommend it to anyone but the most hardcore of Shadowrun/Isometric Strategy fans.However, it is still very incomplete. And I would recommend waiting until it is finished before purchasing.Once the game is finished—which could take a very long time at this rate—it should be okay at the very least, which is a massive improvement from what it was previously; a poorly written, buggy mess that played like a poor man's XCom.

												Do not buy this game!If I could get my Kickstarter pledge back, I'd take it and run in a heartbeat. Cliffhanger failed to keep their promises at every stage of development, radically reduced the scope of their game, delivered an aborted fetus of an MMO, then promptly filed for bankruptcy.Shadowrun Returns (plus Dragonfall and Hong Kong) by Harebrained Schemes shouldn't have been punished by having to share an IP with this drek by Cliffhanger Productions. Do yourself a favor and skip this title; if you need to get your Shadowrun fix, buy Shadowrun Returns instead.			"

												Not yet, but they're on the right track.This game has had a long, rough road behind it, but the worst is over. The development team has shown a hell of a lot of love to this game to beat it into its current shape, and while it's still rough around the edges, in another year or so, this could really be the definitive Shadowrun experience.The combat plays like a simplified version of Shadowrun Returns, isometric (but 3D modeled!) turn-based. There's no overwatch, and the action system is much simpler-- essentially, you can move and shoot each turn, or move double the range and give up your attack. The combat's simplicity is actually one of its strengths, really; it feels fast and relatively fluid, and the combat is pleasantly lethal without being overwhelming. It also has a random cinematic camera which activates rarely and is always a pleasant surprise-- it really shows off how pretty of a game this is.However, this is a very opaque game. That description of the action system was determined through trial and error, and there are a few VERY frustrating interface bugs that make it even harder to tell what's going on. Why did a '-4' pop up over my drone yet it didn't lose HP? Why does my entire team's actions look like they reset when I summon a spirit? Why does taking cover increase an enemy's resistance to technological effects, despite it saying it doesn't use line of sight? Why does clicking during a cutscene not skip it and instead move me to that point on the map (almost invariably out into fire)? This is not the sort of opaqueness that encourages exploration and discovery-- combat just becomes confusing and frustrating because I can't tell what's going on.If you really loved Dragonfall and you still can't get your fix, this is now a solid option. In another year or so, I really hope I can recommend this wholeheartedly.			"

												Shadowrun Chronicles is essentially just a cyberpunk MMO someone slapped a Shadowrun sticker on.  Truth be told I got it on sale for a mere $12 or so, and honestly I feel that's probably a fair price for what I did get.  It's playable, I can see myself sinking some time into it just to get a turn-based squad combat fix.The game itself is extremely linear, you have no dialogue options which kills immersion.  Playing a Summoning character, it baffles me that any time an NPC mentions something magic related my character responds like he's never summoned a spirit in his life.  On top of that skill trees are treated less like Shadowrun build options and more like shoe-horned generic MMO.  For example, my character is a summoner.  I can summon a bear... that's my only option.  In a true shadowrun game i'd be summoning all manner of spirits.  I'd also not be a 'Summoner' I'd be either a mage or shaman who also summon spirits, not so much here.  Basically everything that the Shadowrun Returns series has done absolutely correct the team behind Shadowrun Chronicles has decided to not do at all.My suggesiton? If you haven't purchased Shadowrun Returns, Dragonfall, or Hong Kong, use your money for those.  They'll give you a more genuine Shadowrun experience.  If you want a game where the developers clearly didn't know anything about the Shadowrun universe... go with this game and you too can own an Ares Predator pistol with an ammo capacity of 4...			"

												UPDATE: I still stand by this being a fun game but I'd make sure you have a friend or two along for the ride. The game has lost a considerable amount of steam and it's not always easy to find a group to jive with you. Before you purchase check the charts http://steamcharts.com/app/267750#3m. Also the new content apparently is difficult enough to make the old crowd reluctant to play with people who don't regrind lower level missions until they have very high stats. My girlfriend and I came back after finishing the game to play the challenge missions. Even though we had enough stats to finish the game we could not find a group to accept us for the challenge missions because we had not spent time replaying the previous missions for more karma.This is a rough gem but it’s still a gem. There are scant few cooperative turn based strategy games out there. In many ways it reminds me of playing the old Hero Quest™ board game from my youth but with a dash of the original Guild Wars™ and a whole lot of Shadowrun to top it off. Like in Shadowrun this isn’t going to be some cakewalk co-op game. You will need to use cover, time combos, and carefully consider your routes through the levels. But planning your route is enjoyable because the environments are easy to read and detailed enough to convey the atmosphere. Your abilities even cause car alarms and windows to shatter. Unlike most tactical games session length is nice and short. You can hop on, hit the global chat, and be in a game and done within a half an hour, or less.All that being said this game does have issues. Many of the game mechanics do not reflect the Shadowrun setting well. Mages use mana, there is party limit for drones and spirits, and a quick hack can drop a person dead. All games can lag but when this game does it especially drags down the experience. A team of four gets eight inputs a turn. If every input had a five second lag that would be 40 seconds lost just waiting per turn. It very quickly adds up to tens of minutes just waiting for input lag. For a cooperative multiplayer game there are conspicuous number of features missing for a game that has finished beta. For example you can’t whisper to people, there is no group finder tool, and there isn’t even a list of hotkeys or controls.Overall though I think this game has a certain charm about it. Like playing a quick board game with friends and then saying “drek” when the dice go bad. At it’s current price of $29.99 it is a little steep but worth it considering it just released, and definitely worth it if you can find it at $19.99. If you like Shadowrun, you like turn based strategy, and you like co-op this is worth checking out.			"

												I love Shadowrun. I used to GM a tabletop game when I was younger, the new Shadowrun Returns -> Hong Kong are great. Look at my Profile, I built up the Level 5 Badge for two of them! That said... Shadowrun Chronicles is just not good. It's a turn based game akin to X-Com, but don't expect half the quality of that sort of game. This does just enough to qualify as a game and that's it.So what's my issue with it? Firstly, it doesn't stick to anything Shadowrun, it doesn't have the statistics, it doesn't have the skills, it doesn't care about what your character can do, it doesn't care what your character background is. It lets you select two weapons and go from there.Decking is a weapon. Don't expect any Matrix, it doesn't exist. So okay, we have a game with orks and trolls, weapons and magic, in a futuristic X-Com style setting, right? Sound good? It's not. You can move, you can shoot, that's it. There's no overwatch, no covering angles, you can sit in cover and watch the enemy run around you and shoot you in the back, even though you had a turns worth of actions left to do something about it. There's no tactics here, it's all about kill or be killed.It's a shame because, as I said at the start, I love Shadowrun and a multi-player game where you take on runs sounds awesome, but unfortunately.. it's not.I bought this on a Steam sale so I'm not that annoyed, but if I paid full price I'd be feeling pretty annoyed about now. Avoid. Seriously.			"

								I kickstarted this and just played the first mission.  Once its finished and the polish gets added this will likely be great.  Right now its good, which is more than many can say for Alpha sneak peak situations.  $20-$30 is high for what is here right now though (3/31/2014), and if you have not yet played ""Shadowrun Returns"" I would encourage you to spend that money there first.  Keep tabs on this though; outside of Warhammer 40K there seems to be limited offerings for fun Fantasy Sci-fi violence and worthwhile storytelling.			"

												I did not enjoy this game, and the reasons are as plentiful as they are egrigious;1) Despite shifting from a zoomed out out more-or-less ""flat"" aesthedic to a 3D one, the execution was poor. The charaters are kind of blocky and the effect is like the shift Command & Conquer made with Generals.2) The voice acting was halfassed and oddly implemented; only in the second half of the game to the actors seem to to try. Additionally, only a handful of characters have a voice, and not even all of the main dialouge NPC's.3) The story is blunt, dry, and plays through like a poor imitation of previous Shadowrun stories, but written by someone with only as shallow understanding of the shadowrun universe. In short, I was bored before I got halfway through.4) The upgrade tree and combat mechanics are really watered down compared to previous Shadowrun titles. It feels very limiting and removes a large degree of tactical planning.5)The missions are extreamly repetative, going so far as to frequently recycle stages.6)The ""minions"" that are avalible seem to be completely random and have zero basis in wherther they die or not or what mission you are playing.This game feels like a hack job looking to exploit the Shadowrun reputation for profit. Don't buy this game. I regret every cent.			"

								This game is sincerely awful. Don't even touch it. Seven months into Early Access (which was released a year late) after a half million in kickstarter (for a game made on a free engine) with money from two different backers, and it looks like they've managed to make something resembling an isometric tactical game. I wouldn't say an isometric RPG, because that would require there to be important decisions the player could make. In fact, you can't even really call it a tactical game. It's an isometric thing where you put your people behind cover and shoot at things until whoever has less shooting power explodes.Play Shadowrun Returns instead.			"

												I purchased this game solely for single-player play. I have not played and will not play any multiplayer. I have played through the entire game once with a pistol/blades elf. I don\'t regret playing it and generally had fun, but there are some major shortcomings. I won\'t be replaying or buying any DLC.PROS:1) Turn-based squad combat is fun.2) Even if rather limited, it is set in the Shadowrun universe. There is no substitute for that.3) Character customization is pretty well done.CONS:1) Requires login to servers to play and you are forced to see the global chat.2) No choices to be made in the story until the very end. You can choose not to do side missions, but those are just inconsequential grinding for money and experience.3) Writing was boring and lifeless. Didn\'t use contractions.4) Weapon progression seemed silly. You save up a bunch of money waiting for new weapons and armor in the shop and then buy the best new weapons an armor. Thing is, you don\'t even know what you are saving up for until it\'s available and once it is, you can probably just buy everything you want immediately.5) No documentation6) No Matrix7) Deckers doing damage to everything short of magical creatures with their deck seemed silly.8) Mages not having access to a physical attack seemed like an artificial limitation.9) Henchmen (NPC runners) can only have single offensive skill. This made melee henchmen nearly useless. You need to use cover in this game and it is not easy to do that if you have to get up close to contribute at all.10) Henchmen can\'t have tactical items (e.g. medkits)11) No overwatch capability12) Wild camera movement during enemy turn makes it hard to see damage amounts as they appear13) Lots of map reuse. You can start me at a different end of the map, but it\'s still the same map.14) Missions started to feel very formulaic. I began using the same set of henchmen for every mission (Halon, Bats###, and Jimmy Mac). Cover, mark, fire, slice, rinse, and repeat.15) Every character gets two actions per turn and attacking ends the character\'s turn. Unless you get a temporary bonus, you can\'t just attack twice. You can\'t attack and then reload. You can\'t attack and then run for cover. This felt so limiting, simplistic, and artificial. "

												This is a top down 3-D, RPG-LITE, turn based tactical game with short, combat-oriented missions. The game design decisions are built around the idea of quick play for Co-Op: from the UI, to the tactical choices to the repercussions for individual actions, everything converges to generate a combat-focused fast-play experience by turn-based standards. RPG or Tactical?As something of a hybrid Tactical-RPG title, I would say its leaning markedly towards the tactical end of the spectrum. If you’re coming in expecting a full-blown RPG with a dynamic interactive story, you’ll likely be disappointed, as the efforts of the developers is more oriented towards generating a dynamic tactical game with high replay value on their content (ie. mostly gratuitous gun-fights with bodies dropping all around). The story telling emphasis has increased markedly with the latest April updates, so while it's not a branching story with player choices altering the narrative, it does have a good plot and a good immersion with a large number of NPCs to interact with (and mixed but overall very good voice acting mixed in too).Character BuildingCharacter creation is also more like a richer version of a tactical squad based game than a full-blown RPG. Everything is skill tree oriented, and its like a much larger X-Com mechanism with a linear progression down each tree and many of the progressions offering “this or that” choices. Characters can have two weapon trees active, plus two trees filled with passive abilities, which in many cases are kinda like what attributes would do in a traditional RPG system. It seems implicit that they first decided on the combat mechanics and then built the character skills and abilities while trying to keep things balanced, like you’d expect in a tactical game. It was not designed to cater to people who bought the game so that they can build a very specific sort of mage or what have you, so everyone would do well to know that before purchase. Visual customization of your character is all about a wide and ever growing wardrobe of exotic fineries and sultry rags. Its still a work in progress, but it's extensive now and will continue to get expanded upon post launch.CombatThis is really the strength of the game. As noted, the core philosophy is quick play, and this has come together very nicely with game mechanics that generate decisive results off of single actions. What does that mean? Well, good shots with a clear line of sight or done with melee weapons have a VERY high chance to hit. Likewise, getting hit does a LOT of damage in relation to most characters ability to take damage. Things are quite furious here, so its basically the opposite from the Shadowrun Returns attritional combat model where firefights drag out and sometimes see characters get hit with an assault rifle and it degrading their hit points by 8% in extreme situations. Conversely, targets that are buttoned up behind cover have a much lower chance to hit, so you're really encouraged to use sound tactics and maneuver.There’s also interesting dynamics with a rock-paper-scissors aspect based on physical-tech-magic damage and armor, some targets being extremely vulnerable to one, but immune or resistant to another (physical damage being the ‘safe but doesn’t open vulnerabilities’ option). There’s also a marking system where deckers and magic users can “mark” a target that opens up the abilities for other team members attacks.I personally would endorse the AI as being respectable as well. The melee based enemies are aggressive and generally just try and bum-rush you, while the missile enemies play it much more conservatively and use cover. While there are the occasional bad moves, they generally put together a coherent strategy with the more purely missile oriented forces I've seen in the game really trying to probe around my flanks. Multiplayer or Singleplayer?You can play either way. There’s 4 player Co-Op, but you can also easily play single-player by running the whole team yourself (your main character and 3 Henchmen). Co-Op is REALLY fast as everyone is allowed to move right when the player turn starts - when one person initiates a move, everyone freezes while that's finished, but there's no waiting on someone else unless they're the last person to move that turn. Get with a team that knows what they're doing and its maybe 30 second turns - very fast pace for turn based! It takes a whole different tactical approach and I found myself fairly terrible at it after being used to controlling the whole team, but all the mechanics come together beautifully to keep the game moving.There’s also global chat and I’d say its generally quite friendly, as we might expect in a game that’s currently Co-Op oriented. There isn't PVP yet, but they’re working on it, though deathmatch style PVP between mature runners probably isn’t coming anytime soon (major balancing issues there with the high end PVE abilities, stun combos and so on). However, one of the ideas is to have asymmetrical PVP where one set of players takes the runners and the other controls the Gang or Corporate troops. The other option is for an “Urban Brawl” with set teams of combatants without the high end abilities/kit. Not sure when this will be implemented.BugsOverall this is quite stable for me on a Mac. A new update can see problems but they get sorted quickly enough, with most bugs being more of the nuisance variety rather than CTD type stuff.Future ContentOne thing to keep in mind with SRC is that launch isn't launch in the way that a singeplayer game is. Its a pay once to play business model, but they're planning ongoing content updates for free combined with quarterly DLC, so development is ongoing in the style of Online games. So, expect lots of changes from the features offered, the game balancing and so on. Apparently new squad building mechanics are on the short list of features with the NPC Henchmen runners, which will add a lot for single player runs (or runs with 2 players with each controlling a single henchman).OverallWhether or not this is a good purchase for you really just comes down to the preferences of the individual here and your expectations. You’ve got a number of things that are well developed or emphasized and then a number of things that RPG fans would be disappointed not to see (and if its something that's going to really slow the gameplay down, it might not ever make it into this Co-Op focused game). SRC offers a unique package of turn based Co-Op (that can easily be played singleplayer) with brutal fast play firefights that still have that heroic feeling of ""I'm gonna rush in there with my Katana"". The story and atmosphere have improved by leaps and bounds this April, so you've got a good context to draw you in too. So long as you're not looking for a pure RPG experience, I feel confident to give SRC a solid recommendation as the 15-30 minute gunfights are great fun with a seriously addictive quality.			"

												I've held off long enough from posting any sort of review as I wanted to give Cliffhanger a chance to deal with all sorts of issues with this game. I think 6 months from release date is time enough.First, I would definitely give Cliffhanger a thumbs up for sticking with the game despite the bankruptcy, the game changes from its Kickstarter inceptions, the VERY rough launch and disruption of other IP's they are involved in. That's a real testament to their determination. But also one of the few positive things I can say about the game. Now for the actual review.. -------Don't let my limited hours of play fool you..there's a reason why my playtime hours are few (part of the negatives) but I've also got decades worth of multiplayer/MMO/single player game background under the belt to make this review plausible despite those hours. Also, I played the Shadowurn PnP since its inception around the late 80's/early 90's. But I'd also like to make SOME concessions to the fact that I haven't had a chance to experience ALL aspects of the game yet and that some of my review will be slightly skewed because of it.Graphics (6): The game looks incredibly similar to the Shadowrun Returns look/feel that was released around the time this was in development. To the point of being mistaken for a HareBrained Schemes product. It's not by HBS. SC has the same isometric perspective but it has camera rotation (of which I approve). The graphics are simple, but detailed and varied enough to not be too repetitive. Skinnable features like bodies, outfit pieces, weapons, etc. help break up the cookie cutter monotony.. but not by too much. But SOME variety is better than none. especially for a multiplayer game. It's just nothing to rave about.Sound (5): Ambient sounds are very decent. The music is decent (although it gets repetitive after awhile). My BIGGEST complaint is the voiceover work. I don't think it's the Boston accents (fake or otherwise), as I've known Bostonians and don't mind the accent at all. I think the problem is that the voiceover work is lifeless and not quite matching with the scenes/moods. The voiceover work feels VERY scripted or prompter-read. As I said. lifeless.Performance (5): During the god-awful launch, I REALLY wanted to write a review. But Cliffhanger asked folks to bear with them and hold off on writing reviews.. so I did. The network performance back then was horrendous. So much lag and dropoffs.. it was ridiculous and unplayable. They've since fixed that (good work indie developers). The graphics and network performance are now up to par and I don't really have anything negative or positive to say. It works. It's not an AAA title so it's not like there should really be any performance issues. So why the lowish score? Because I cannot login to the game due to my unicode Steam profile name. I've played ALOT of Steam games and my unicode name is not an issue. It is when attempting to login to SC. Why does SC use my profile name (which can be subject to change) rather than my Steam ID # (which does NOT change)?! It doesn't make sense and I like to leave my profile name the way it is rather than to change it for ONE game. First world problems, eh? Gameplay (7): The gameplay is decent. It does a good job of embodying multiplayer aspects that one would've liked to have seen in something like Shadowrun Returns. The turn-based tactical gameplay feature is pretty much the same as it is in Shadowrun Returns. Good variety of outfits, weapons, skills and enough things to do. What kept this area from getting a higher rating is the boring hub, the overall repetitiveness and lack of open world. It's the launching pad for your missions/story, places to get supplies, talk to a few NPC's now and again and that's it. Cliffhanger lost the chance to make this a little roleplay area for people to hang out in and be a shadowrunner. This is where you can feel where it went from Shadowrun Online to just Shadowrun Chronicles.Story/Content (7): This is another area that could've received a higher rating. It's just storyline/missions. Some are repeatable, some are not. This was a complaint with Shadowrun Returns. If you have a hub, give us random shadowrunner jobs for money, karma, etc. (much like the Sega Genesis version of Shadowrun.. nostalgia). Regardless, Cliffhanger did a decent job of bringing Shadowrun to the multiplayers with an ok storyline. New content is also upcoming too, which is a good sign for the game's longevity. Verdict (6):It's an ok game. Nothing spectacular. Nothing incredibly bad. It's just right in the middle, slightly above mediocre. It had/has potential. It still has room to grow. Maybe I will change my review in time. Despite my middle-ground score, though, I will not recommend this game. This is a niche game for Shadowrun players. It would be boring to pretty much anyone else. Plus, you can't help but feel SC is a Shadowrun Returns knockoff clone, just with multiplayer and without the UGC (User Generated Content)			"

Early Access Review
								As a fan of turn-based strategy games, and a fan of Shadowrun tabletop since 1st edition, I was absolutely delighted when I heard about the Kickstarter for a turn-based strategy MMO designed in the world of Shadowrun.A little background before I begin (skip past the line if you just want the review):I have been a consistent member on their forums since donating to the Kickstarter. Through that I have found Cliffhanger to be a small independent studio, and true to their name at the start, asked for a very modest ammount for such an ambitious project. However, they got the funding to do it, and through a number of pitfalls (like losing their artist... like literally, disappeared!) and some setbacks in the initial development (realizing they needed a stronger game engine to do everything they wanted- and had to design a new one to accomodate!) they finally launched the Early Access Alpha. I have also consistently participated in this process since it launched.The Alpha launched smooth, and for the most part each update has been tight and bug-free. When bugs have come up, they quickly take care of them. They care very much about the project, and are as passionate as the fans they're making the game for, and it shows in every update.Now that they're about a month away from officially launching, I feel comfortable giving as complete a review as I can. I have to say I still look very forward to each and every update as it has gotten better and better! They have ALWAYS listened and responded to feedback, and extra development time was taken to make the game 'right' based on that feedback._________________________________Shadowrun is a game set in our world's future. Magic has once again awakened, including dragons and creatures of myth, which both blend and  clash regularly with Megacorporations and high-tech advancements like cyberware and AI's. Magic returning to the world was not a smooth process, and led to reshaping the landscape of politics, society, and even warfare. That's where you come in. As a shadowrunner, you exist in the shadows of those giants (politics, society, and warfare) to work for often unknown employers with even more ineffable agendas... Whatever pays the bills, right Chummer? Character Creation is easy to grasp, You choose a gender and a race (Ork, Dwarf, Troll, Elf, or Human) each of which have their own advantages and disadvantages. You may select from a variety of backgrounds to help round out your character with other qualities as well, and help set a tone for how you want them to develop. The list is ever-expanding with them adding to it all the time. Backgrounds examples are: Bouncer, Ex-Cop, Gutter Rat, Ganger, Spirit Talker (magic, remember), Engineer, Tribal Youth, Lucky, and even ""Boring"" if you don't want any of the other options (it has neither bonuses or penalties). And you'll have a place to put in your own text to expand on that and tell your character's unique story.The most fun part of character creation is (of course) designing the character! You get to choose from a wide selection of fashions, gear, and hairstyles to build your character with. One of the best parts is THERE IS NO GENDER SEPERATION IN FASHION, giving you the widest selection to choose from! You want to make a male Ork in a mini-skirt? Go for it chummer, we don't judge! You don't want to be all girly-girl as a female Elf character? Put on a road-warrior stop sign top with some camo pants to go with your cigar and automatic rifle! The next update before the official launch will also include a variety of skin tones to choose from as well!You have a number of Skills to choose and build up, but you can only use two Skill-sets at a time during any given run (Pistols, Automatics, Shotguns, Conjuring, Spellcraft, Hacking, Rigging (drone combat), Blades, and Blunt Weapons). Find the combination  that works best for you and build them up with the XP you earn, increasing the 'Skill Tree' system which opens up more options and manevuers for your character to use during combat. You can buy into as many Skill sets as you want, but be careful not to spread yourself too thin by doing so! Better to aim for a couple specialties, especially early on. There's a lot of really good, tough choices to be made there!Your ""Attributes"" are represented by a Body Tree, and a Mind Tree that you can build up as well. Are you fast and limber, adept at dodging things, or big, tough, and built like a brick? Maybe a little bit of both? Are you knowledgeable about lockpicking, and data manipulation, or observant and quick-witted? Again, little bit of both?  This should be completely nailed down in the next update, so I don't know the particulars, but we have tested a number of the systems that will be going into it. These Trees will help 'fine tune' your character with little bonuses to health or dodge, make you more adept at skills and feats you can perform (lockpicking, hacking, breaking objects, etc).Gameplay is solid as a turn-based tactial game. The tutorial eases you into it, but it can get deadly quick as you progress further into the plot. Gangers, corporate security forces (as well-armed as any paramiliatary force), armored drones, cyber-security dogs, and spirit guardians all stand in the way of your goals, and armor only goes so far against a chainsaw-weilding ganger maniac, or a security captain with a flame thrower!One thing. It's not 'open world' like a lot of MMO's. There are social hubs you gather in, and a map of the city that you travel through with various zoned instances, that open up more and more areas for you to explore as you progress in the game. It's easy to forget that though once you're in and playing.The main story has mostly been hidden from us until launch, so I can't give an honest review to that. The only things we know for sure is a dragon went on a rampage, everyone's getting infected with some sort of insanity, the city's gone on lockdown, and if we want to survive we need to get a supply route going for one of our contacts, and there's a lone officer stuck in the middle of this without backup that needs our help (and can pay well enough). Another BIG thing we've known since the Kickstarter, our combined actions will affect the world in a MAJOR way. Cliffhanger has teamed with Catalyst (the current producers of the tabletop game) to co-create this story. The combined actions of our characters will bring down one of the biggest Megacorporations in the world!!Which one? Well that's for us to decide!There will be OPTIONAL PvP in the game as well! They have already outlined a few modes for us. One is a run team (their characters) vs another team playing the role of NPC security forces or gangers. The other is a ""Running Man"" style of team vs team in a Sport style environment with leaderboards and such, and another is 'objective based' which pits two teams against an environment and an objective that doesn't mean they have to fight each other... just keep the other from it.So if you're a fan of Shadowrun, you'll want in on the action and see what both Cliffhanger and Catalyst have in store for us!If you don't know Shadowrun, but are a fan of tactical turn-based strategy games, this is definitely worth a look!If you're a fan of interactive roleplaying with other players in a dystopian cyberpunk futureistic setting? Well it's still worth a look! I can already tell you from the forums there's the opportunity for a thriving roleplaying community in this game, and the Dev's are already working on possible things to encourage it (private 'hang out' areas for groups to talk away from the main social hubs, etc.)Hope you enjoyed the review, and with any luck I'll see you in the shadows!Crunch~			"

Early Access Review
								No, just no...Someone gifted me this game when I talked about how much I enjoyed Shadowrun Returns from Harebrained Studios.I thought to myself: ""Awesome, more Shadowrun to play and with multiplayer? Count me in!""... now I know better.Shadowrun Online is a frustrating experience that leaves you wondering what the hell where the developers thinking? The graphics are low quality, there's little customization, no online world, no hub, no nothing. You are forced (condemned you might say) to play the badly put together ""campaign"" (a series of somewhat interconected missions that don't make a lot of sense... if any). The difficulty is extremely hard and even in online coop you'll find levels to be impossible without lots and lots of LUCK, not skill, LUCK.You can also play some random missions, but as I said, difficulty is terrible all around. And you know what? It's not the fact that the game is hard, because - honestly - that's not enough reason to call a game bad... it's the fact that it doesn't feel like Shadowrun and that its NOT fun.Do not buy this game... do yourself a favor and buy Shadowrun Returns... doesn't have MP, but at least you'll be getting a much better experience for your money.EDIT - Christmas 2014I was bored on christmas day and decided to give the new patch a try...The game has gotten better, to the point that it can actually be enjoyable to play. It's still ultra-rough around the edges, character customization is very limited (but now at least you can choose what weapons you'd like to specialize in and there's some very MINOR progression) and the missions are very simple and feel ""stiff"" at times, meaning that they are very very linear.The game is still hard, but now with the co-op mode and the henchmen system it's possible to finish missions. Sometimes you'll still need some luck to get past them, but it is possible.I'm completely confused by developer's intentions though. They allow co-op but only between 2 players, when there's 4 party members in a run. Each player gets to bring a ""henchman"", which functions pretty much like another player which you control. Why not allow people to make 4 man groups? I don't get it all.I still wouldn't recommend this game, as it is far from being a satisfying product and you'll get - at most - a couple hours out of it before you get bored.Who knows, maybe in another six-months it could become a product worth 5 to 10 dollars.EDIT - 03/14/15So now they change the name of the game to Shadowrun Chronicles ""Boston Lockdown"". Apparently people were getting confused with the last name...Yeah, you see... People saw Shadowrun Online and though it was an MMO type of game. Obviously this is not the aim of the devs, they just want you to be able to play with other people if you want. Like, getting help for quests or in PVP arenas...I can see how people would get confused. After all, there's a lot of companies that make the same mistake. You know... like Lord of the Rings ONLINE... or Warhammer ONLINE... or DC Universe ONLINE... or Dungeons and Dragons ONLINE... or EVE Online... or Hello Kitty ONLINE or... well you get the idea.Come on devs, what the hell is going on here? Did you spend all the funding and can't finish the game now? Do you intend to just slap a new name on this product, rush it down the pipe line and cash in while you can?DO NOT BUY until things clear out here.			"

Early Access Review
								Shadowrun OnlineCliffhanger StudiosThe Shadowrun IP has experienced a veritable rennaissance as of late. Shadowrun Returns and the expansion Dragonfall [Calling it DLC would be an insult] have met with mostly favorable reviews; I know I've enjoyed both quite a bit despite, of course, a few limitations. The pen and paper tabletop game, Shadowrun 5th Edition, has hit the ground running since its release last summer. Catalyst Games has said the core rulebook has broken all of its sales records. A deck building game, a la Android: Netrunner, a tabletop miniatures game, a la WH40K, and, a Euro-style tile-based board game are all in the works. So now we have Shadowrun: Online thrown into the mix. Right now it's PVP and 4 short missions. There is no tutorial - which is fantastic, btw, because tutorials are creepy and always trying to hold my hand. This means the art of war in Shadowrun Online must be extracted through trial and error. I actually felt relieved that I was expected to use my brain. The first time through I didn't pay much attention to what I was doing and got clobbered...fast...by the AI. The second time through I paid a little bit more attention, and realized some of the basic principles. After that, it became quite enjoyable. The world itself is pretty much non-existent at this point. But the game play is definitely there and it's good. The two characters you use throughout the missions synergize really well.One thing I would like to see would be a limitation to spells and ammo. One of the spells is kinda broken, not too much, but a bit. If they added spell drain, like in the tabletop, spellslinging would become a much more serious matter - right now it feels a bit OP. I also think ammo should be limited. There should be the danger of running out of ammo, in fact. I think that could add a lot to the tension of each match.I'll say this: they are very blunt about the current state of the game on their page. I found the warning to be commensurate with the build.Getting it now means you'll get to know the game play, but not so much the world of Shadowrun. I recommend reading some background material here: http://www.shadowruntabletop.com/game-resources/shadowrun-timeline/Also, head over to amazon and order a used shadowrun novel [ .05 + 3.99 shipping lol]Edit: I want to mention that this game works really well with touch controls. Playing it on a touch screen laptop or tablet is lots of fun. Turn-based games and touch controls just make sense, and I'd like to see other devs follow Cliffhanger's lead on this.			"

												TLDR: I want to like this game. I want to recommend it, but I can't. Too many problems despite great promise.I have played the hell out of this game, wanting to figure out what it was I was screwing up that kept me from ""gettink gud"". Unfortunately overall it's a screwed up design all around.The Big Problems (Many others have given much more in depth reviews on this)1. Really watered down skill system, no attributes, detailed stats, no meaningful multiclassing.2. They tried to design this MMOish thing that didn't quite take. Short version? Henchmen are weak, but there's no LFG function in the game. Just have to go through chat ala Warcraft 2003 Ironforge/Org. That's assuming the game doesn't break your mission and everyone has to restart.3. Armor system is seriously screwed. Every attack eats away your armor. Ok, so, build an evasion defense, right? One hit will blow through both your armor and your hps at higher levels. GG. Also, no overwatch, so yeah... Flanked=dead.4. There is no Adept tree, a classic of Shadowrun. Why does that matter? Crap armor design + no other mitigation options = a dead street samurai. Also, you only get two consumable slots. Need a heal? Too bad. Also, no mage healing...really? No regen... really? Don't even bother with melee.5. There are one or two builds that basically destroy everything. There's OP and then there's DAAAAMMMMNNNN... they got fudged up!I want to like this game, but, damn it... they just messed with the basic design of the Shadowrun IP so much that's it's just an exercise in frustration.It's turn based combat, on a Shadowrun IP, and they screwed it up. #fail			"

												Pros: Graphic style is very similar to single-player Shadowrun: Return games and I like it. Coop mode is unique experience. It's similar to Divinity: Original Sin but gameplay is much more fast-paced (less roleplay, more action). Decent storyline, tons of side-quests. Nice difficulty. Success is based on tactics, not luck. Great cosmetic customization. Dwarf in bikini? Splinter Cell elf? Everything is possible! (you can find many cosmetic items in missions from random loot). Buy2Play. No extra microtransacrions. No F2P ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Cons: No roleplay, no branched dialogs, linear story. It will stay as it is because that's how game designed. User Interface - developers changed a lot of stuff recently and it's very new and unpolished yet. Many elements look out of place. No customizable henchmens.  No PvP (but it's planned in near future). Lag. Servers under heavy load and such amount of players wasn't tested properly. "

												I had SUCH high hopes for this game during the Kickstarter campaign - this is the third thing I ever backed.  And then, they choose to set it in Boston - the city of my birth - as the setting, and I very nearly ""squeee'd"" in delight.Sadly, none of those hopes panned out.  The game just doesn't really feel like Shadowrun.Character Creation leaves me completely uninspired, from the UI, straight through to the mechanics underneath some of the choices.  Building a character in PnP was always about balancing your choices, deciding what to prioritize and what to marginalise.  Do you want to be a skilled elf mage?  You're likely to be woefully strapped for cash, then.  Top-shelf Rigger or Hacker?  No magic for you, and either you're stuck beign human or your attributes (strength, agility, those kinds of things) are going to be a bit wimpy.None of that is in the game.  Indeed, you don't CHOOSE anything except a background (with attendant small modifiers), and race (with even smaller modifiers).  You don't decide if you're going to be a mage or not - EVERYONE has basic magic skills.  You don't decide if you're going to be a hacker or not - EVERYONE has basic hacking skills.  Imagine my dismay when I discovered I had, and could sell, the starting equipment of EVERY type of character.  Imagine my dismay when I realised I had the first skill in EVERY archetype's tree.::sigh::I didn't expect a 1:1 translation from the PnP ... but I hoped it would be at LEAST as ""eh close enough"" as, say, Shadowrun: Dragonfall is.  That, at least, FEELS like Shadowrun ...t the mechanics, the writing, the setting.  This game, however, simply does not ... on ANY point....If you're a huge fan of the Shadowrun IP, and the Paper-and-Pencil games?  Give this a pass.If you're just looking for a pseudo-MMO with spells and guns, maybe this is the game for you.  But I'm afraid, if that's so, that my opinion on your taste in games will be filed as ""questionable"", at the very best.			"

Early Access Review
								I wanted to wait for the release date before I write anything, and now that the game has one I guess it's time to write a commend...  so why don't I recommend the game (at the state it is) ?Well I don't know how you guys play ShadowRun, but for me the ""legwork"" is the most important part of the game, the ""roleplaying"", the interaction with other characters, the information gathering, connection establishing, alternate route finding...  not the ""dungeon crawling"" and not the ""fights"" (or dice-orgies as I use to call them).As I'm experiencing the game right now, it has no legwork at all, no attributes(!), an absurd skillsystem (i gotta skill pistols to pick locks? shotgun-skilling helps me use explosives? And whats up with the strange race-boni? There are no social-skills of any kind since you don't need them.) it's just not a roleplaying game.(Skillsystem had a slight change since I wrote this, not enough to rewrite everything but I want to be fair so I add this, it's a little less absurd than it was before, as non-combat-skills have been moved to 2 new trees but still no social-skills or attributes)So what is it? Think of it as XCom, but only the battles and even those are not as good as XComs or Xenonauts.Yes there is kind of a hub in between the missions, but so far there is nothing important there. You can buy stuff, just like  in the village in Diablo, just less roleplay than in the village in Diablo (yeah hard to believe I know).			"

Early Access Review
								First off, I'd like to say that I will *gladly update my review* if this game comes to fruition, however, after reading other reviews and experiencing this game myself before and after the last update, I'm extremely doubtful.Going for a Q1 2015 release? We'll, we're in Q1, meaning the devs have less than 3 months to move this game into a release ready state.What is missing? Umm, everything?This game is in a state of ""hey I put something together for you to *look* at"" - this is not, imo, playable in it's current state.Sure, you can ""play"" but there are no MMO elements. No player to player transactions, I've yet to even see another player outside of a multiplayer mission.Right now, things are extremely clunky, extremely unfinished / unimplemented, and unless there's just massive updates that the devs have ALREADY DONE and have not released, there's just no way in hell this game is going to be ready for a Q1 2015 launch. Based on the commentary from the devs, it seems like we're pretty much getting things as they get completed, which means in reality, for this game to be ready for a launch in a state of actually being finished and a true 1.0 version, I'd say you're looking more at like, 2017, based on the frequency of updates and the fact that the game's already a year behind.I'm a big time fan of SR, and was really excited about this game after SR Returns and Dragonfall.The distinction needs to be made that this is not being made by the devs of the two games referenced above. Cliffhanger Productions has chosen their name appropriately, because right now they are hanging on a cliff, and I'm not sure how much longer their grip will last.			"

												--**FULL REVIEW FOR SHADOWRUN CHRONICLES - BOSTON LOCKDOWN (SRC-BL) INCLUDING DLC**--[Initial version: May 11, 2016]+SUMMARY: A simple turn-based online game that squanders the tremendous potential of its franchise and genre. If one must purchase, play with friends and definitely wait for a sale.+SCOPE: All story-specific content that has been released to date, which includes the main story campaign and the Infected DLC. All remaining content is effectively grinding gear and Karma (exp), and will have its own section.This review is also completely SPOILER FREE.Oh, and for clarity: SRC-BL is NOT an 'MMO' in any real way, save for the mandatory servers. There is no resource trading to speak of (even between a player's own runners), and open ""grinding"" isn't an option until after the end of the main story.For all practical purposes, treat SRC: BL as a turn-based PVE game with the option of inviting human players along...and it's all hosted online.-GAMEPLAY: The short, dirty version is that the gameplay is way too simple and ""streamlined"" for Shadowrun. If I had to use a relative comparison, I'd say it's like XCOM: Enemy Unknown, possibly even a bit simpler.There's ZERO ""legwork"", no real resource trading or management, no Matrix runs or even Shadowland banter (to be fair, there's a good story reason for that), and character building is bare-bones even compared to its sister game series, Shadowrun Returns.Normally I wouldn't hold something like this against a game, except it's supposed to be SHADOWRUN; and in an era where online games as complex as EVE Online remain popular and viable, I don't think it was too much to ask for at least a little bit more depth.-ENGINE, GRAPHICS, AND AUDIO: This game is low-budget and it shows. The 3D graphics look ~12 years out of date vs the modern high-def bloom-fest of current gen gaming. Personally, I have no issue with that, because the visual style fits well enough (well, the models could afford to look less ""toony""), and it isn't an offensive departure.The main campaign has some voice-acting, and it ranges from 'passable' to 'plain ol bad'. Nothing painfully offensive, but I routinely found myself re-reading text and doing better takes than most of the droning VAs, in-situ. Yikes.Music...it's completely unremarkable. I have nothing to say about it, good or bad.-INTERFACE: Best thing I can say about the interface, is that it's ""functional"" (not great).There's a number of improvements I can and will suggest, including:-Please add a spot ""ping"" button to highlight specific spots or zones to other players. It would immensely help coordination.-Remember which skill the player last had highlighted; regardless of whenever another action or event occurs.-An effective range checker, or ""valid target"" area indicator. Mostly to check whether you can fire on a target or not before you move.-Please add discrete movement, with queueing.There are times where moving around specific hazards in a single turn isn't possible, despite having the total movement available, because the game automatically uses the shortest path for everything.Using movement queuing (that is, letting the player map a specific path before confirming) instead of always forcing ""shortest distance jog"" would allow for more in-depth hazard design.-STORY, DIFFICULTY AND OVERALL PACING: The story is pretty meh, with one, maybe two really interesting moments in the entire thing. The difficulty curve will depend heavily on how many player character runners you bring along, and at what relative ""level"" each one is to the mission.The base campaign's story missions curve up fairly evenly, with only one or two anamolously hard missions along the way. Post-campaign missions are (initially) off the charts in terms of difficulty, spiking WAY beyond what you had previously dealt with (barring possibly the very last mission).One big upside I will mention, is that at least SRC-BL has pretty damn accurate/honest Hit%; it doesn't hide the enemy's personal evasion bonuses or quietly skew successes like it does in Shadowrun Returns. Or at least, I didn't embark on any of my ""Miss 3 shots at 95%+ in a row"" streaks like I did so often in SRR.-INFECTED MISSIONS: This DLC is...pretty bad IMO. All signs point to a rush job.1) There's no voice-acting, even for all the characters that previously had VA. This wouldn't be so bad if not for the fact that this forces the player to read the text...which brings me to my second criticism of the Infected DLC...2)...The text is LITTERED with errors; mostly typos, but more than a couple of flat out broken sentences.3) Little original content. Apart from the maps (and the Ex-Pacis faction mobs), most everything else is a reskin of previous content.4) The difficulty spikes are wildly uneven.The second mission was an unwinnable slug-fest the first time; second attempt it was a slow cakewalk. As in, the encounters were very different, despite having the same characters and resources available.4a) Oh, and making Achievements purely luck-based,  is a stupid enough concept. Making it so you only get ONE crack at a given story mission achievement with that character is just cruel.OVERALL: I would wait on a sale, or possibly just pass entirely. I don't want to leave the impression that I hate this game, not by a long shot.It's just...as a long time Shadowrun fan, it's far too simple and bland. As a generic turn-based RPG, it will kill some time, but is otherwise not terribly memorable.I really want the Shadowrun video games to do well, or at least well enough to warrant more ambitious Shadowrun projects; hence the length of this review. If you're a fan looking for more SR lore and story, I'd stick to the tabletop, novels and the last two SRR games (Dragonfall is an excellent story, and Hong Kong has been pretty great so far).Boston Lockdown has a strong potential setting, and pulls a couple of big name-drops in the story's crisis, but ultimately leaves no lasting impression.(it also makes many mistakes with the in-universe physical laws; namely involving hacking and magic, but these changes were clearly done with the interest of gameplay mechanics in mind, so I let them slide purely on those grounds. It still makes me roll my eyes watching drones say IMMUNE TO MAGIC when a POWER bolt hits them)			"

												Game does not play like the actual Shadowrun games. This is an MMO with no ability to revive yourself in the game. Only so many turns to complete a quest if your main character dies and your team members survive.I did not like this game what so ever. I enjoyed the actual Shadowrun games on here but this... this game sucks. I got a refund on this.			"

Early Access Review
  Introduction             THIS IS IN EARLY EARLY ACCESS!!  Shadow Run Chronicles: Boston Lockout came into early access Mar 31, 2014, and should have a full release on April 28th 2015. I believe they have a long way to go, but with that said let's get into exactly how i feel the game is now. To start out the game has its main gameplay elements and they work great. It contains a decent amount of customization and skill trees, but it still has a long way to come until i can say 100% buy this game. Along with the limited customization the story is very short and the missions can get very repetitive. This being said, everything i have said as negatives the devs have said they will fix or expanded upon. I really can’t wait to see what the devs can do for the full release.   Pros                Core Elements are all here  Fun combat  Regular Updates  Show tons of potential for the full release/future updates  Multiple races  Multiplayer     Cons               Needs more customization  Needs more missions  Can become repetitive   It's just not finished      Conclusion                                 Don't buy Shadow Run Chronicles: Boston Lockout unless you can be patient. It's not finished, but the updates that have come out up until now really show promise. The core gameplay is finished and is tons of fun. If you can be patient for the development process this is definitely something you should consider picking up.  -HiPFiRED   If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

												This review is mostly for tabletop RPG fans(esp. those who have played SR tabletop). To all others: this is a really fun, turn-based tactical game in a really cool setting, that plays well in both single-player and multiplayer! So buy it for sure, if you like those kind of games!OK now for you tabletop RPG fans:2 things about SR Chronicles I REALLY like:1)  Hackers/Deckers are a completely viable, distinct form of combat all their own. They interfere with opponents’ cyberware & gear which can stun, damage, and debuff opponents. They can also buff allies, giving them bonuses to hit, for example. This is far superior to the tabletop SR game IMO. The great part is they do NOT need any LOS(line of sight), effectively “shooting” thru walls etc. (since they are using the matrix and/or wireless to access opponents), so go ahead & hide your decker behind walls, large cover, etc. Of course they can also use guns, magic, and/or rigging if built that way, but no NEED to!2)  No Increased # of actions in combat! Just 1 movement + 1 action per player per round. I have been saying for YEARS multiple action passes in combat need to go (in tabletop SR). They slow combat to a crawl. This game all but eliminates them (some few exceptions) which makes combat FAST, and much more FUN. Speed can still give you other bonuses, and yes, in a few cases an extra action, but it’s rare and doesn’t slow combat too much.As you can infer, it’s skill based, no classes. So you can be a Mage/Hacker/Blademaster if you really want to. You can also just specialize in one or two things if you prefer. Some very viable builds: Melee (melee does more damage than ranged in this game), Automatics (obvious), Hacking(see above), Spellcasting (tho nerfed compared to tabletop, to balance it). Rigging is said to be one of the best in single player campaign mode, but not good (ie. very challenging) when you get to the endgame/multiplayer. People seem to dislike summoning(they say it does less damage than everything else).All in all, it is a fun game. If you like turn-based RPGs, tabletop RPGs, or the pencil&paper version of SR, you should definitely check this out! The Boston setting is something different, too. And…Dragons!---https://steamcommunity.com/groups/graywalkers : upcoming supernatural, post-apocalyptic, turn-based tactical RPG!			"

												This game isn't bad, not bad at all. It's fun, actually. If you like the genre, you are about to have a good time.Sadly, this game has a lot of unused unfulfilled potential. It could have had deeper tactics. I bought this because it says ""Shadowrun"". And although it has cyberware and metas and magic and dragons, it lacks the flair, atmosphere and spirit of our most beloved cyberpunk version. Something that ""Shadowrun Returns"" and ""Dragonfall"" were all about.Still, this is a lot of fun.			"

Early Access Review
								Okay, if you're coming down here to read reviews to decide if you should jump into early access, then the answer is simple.  Don't.It's not that the game is bad, it's not *good* but it's early access, it's going through puberty right now.  It'll grow out of some things and stubbornly refuse to change others.  Eventually it'll be done.But you're not going to gain any special insight by joining early.  Personally, I would rather have spent the money on something else, but hey, this was my first early access, I was young and inexperienced.I still have to smack the thumbs up button, because the game is progressing and it's decent, but like a pot of rice, ain't no point in taking a taste when it's still cooking.

												So, a caustious recommendation.Here it is:Pros:This is an MPO shadowrun. The game captures the feel of shadowrun in the single player experience, or when running the content with friends with level appropriate characters.It is fun, and a good TBS-RPG hybrid.The community is mostly very good and fun.Good value for money for a pay-once, play till it dies MMO.Cons:It is not massively multiplayer.There is no real endgame content at this point. Once you finish the plot, you have 2 repeatable challenges. The infected DLC is some help, but this still puts it at ~25 hours per character to solo if you know the game well.It is not extremely dynamic, and the short development cycle and lowish budget are definately felt in comparison to more polished and funded MMOs.Matchmaking consists of yelling in global.In end-game, it is an RNG grind for loot at present.

												While this game has a nice foundation, I feel like it still lacks depth. Each of the skill trees are linear and looking at them there is a lack of variety of skills. For example the Spellcasting has 5 spells most of which are required to get further ahead in the skill tree, all the others are passives. Same goes for every other tree, skill points buys you drones which you all have to get in order to proceed down that path. Results? Mages will all look alike even if you cross train to be different you'll just look like every other Mage/shooter or whatever. Occassionally you will get a branching choice which will lock you out of getting it's opposite later on but for the most part these do little in diversifying characters. I can't recommend this game at this moment but hopefully they will expand on this later on and it will be worth it's price.			"

												Short and sweet; If you liked the depth, the quality RPG and the tactical element to any of the previous shadowrun games, avoid this. I haven't been so bitterly disappointed in a game in quite a while. And that's after Evolve (That I rather enjoyed), Watchdogs, etc. There's no classes, no Overwatch, no difficulty settings, no 'AP' or ability points, ie, a set amount of points used to move, fire a certain amount of times. Instead you have 'Move'. And 'Shoot'(/melee attack). If you do the latter before the former, that characters turn is just over. All in all, the amount of things sacrificed in order to make the game easier and more.. 'user friendly'?? for people to pick up and play co-op, drastically outweighs the constant, unhideable chatbox that counts for player interaction. If you want a game for your kid to get into 'tactical' turn based RPGs, this is perfect. It feels, (and sounds. Ughh the voice acting and sound quality!) like a facebook game. All it's missing is an energy bar telling you to buy in game currency to continue. To clarify, there are no microtransactions in the game, but honestly, even if it were a f2p game, I'd of been disappointed with it still. So sad to see such a good name like Shadowrun, watered down so drastically. Either go full MMORPG, or stick to the singleplayer. Here's hoping SR:Hong Kong will go back to what we loved.EDIT: When the kickstarter says 'We've changed the name from 'Shadowrun: Online' because people were disappointed with their expectations of the product', I instantly thought, 'Oh cool, a standard singleplayer game'. How misled I was!			"

Early Access Review
								DISCLAIMER: I have worked with the devs before (and will work again in the future).That being said, I actually had fun with this game. I rarely have fun in MMOs, due to grinding or just lack of sustainability, but something kept me coming back to this game. True, Ive played mostly solo, but the missions on offer are a lot of fun due to the XCOM like aproach to turn based tactics. If anything, its more traditional since theres no such thing as overwatch, but definitely many ways to customise your tactical experience. (also, the missions are littered with possibilities to gain extras, not like Mass Effect where it was essentially ""Press E to Gather Extra♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; but you need to have team members with those qualities (Lockpicking, destruction, organharvesting, hacking).Now, the provided weaker NPCs teammembers are enough for the simpler missions, but it gradually becomes more challenging, to the point where you need to start relying on other players.As to the progression system for players, there are a bunch of skill trees where you can modify your player from, they range from the standard weapon types (pistol, SMG, shotgun, melee) to the fantasy & cyberpunky (Enchanting, hacking & rigging (drone warfare)) and they branch a bit, and you can generally upgrade after almost every mission for the first ten or more, keeping it fresh and giving you a good motivation for continuing on.The story is better than average, the mission design is varied. But I think enough has been said about how the game works and so on; I had fun. It definitely had that ""Just One More Turn!!!111"" quality for me. Admittedly, Ive only played less than 10 hours, but I think those hours I did have time to, it was worth it. And with a bit more polish and hopefully enough content to last a lifetime, its a nobrainer if you like TB combat in a technofantasy setting.Now excuse me while I play some more.Edit 24.04.2015: Grammar & forgot a line.

								Shadowrun Online has been in Early Access for a while and the game has changed quite a bit since it appeared on Steam. The December update really has started to put some meat on this bone, content-wise. Maps are a lot bigger and varied now, and Coop is a blast. There is some stuff to do outside the missions, quest givers, skill trees, etc. Visual character customization is really above what you'd expect. Still ways to go, mind, but you can see that the game is going in a good direction by now. Obviously it's not done yet, but that feeling of playing a Shadowrun game is already there. If you're into the setting, want to see it grow, or just want to play a turn-based game with a friend, I recommend it.			"

								I own shadowrun online for some months now and i must say the game has come a long way since my first try. i never imagined putting all this together for the little funds they raised on kickstarter. i mean seriously have you ever made the calculations on how long that money will last for a small company? i'm really impressed they still managed to keep working on that game and release updates every month or so and it seems they also really care about user feedback (or at least they say so in their dev diaries).So what about the game: I really like the tactical base gameplay of the current version and think that especially the coop mode is very funny. I'm looking forward to the upcoming features and versions - however i still hope that they put more focus on the coop since this is the real thing!I'm counting on the devs to give their best. Keep on the good work guys!			"

												Genre - MMO Turn Based Tactical Sci-FantasyI have played the other turn based Shadowrun games and had no idea what to expect with this one. When I first loaded it up and I realised it was an MMO I was very surprised to say the least. Thinking it just to be a standard RPG that allowed you to play some missions co-op.I have played the game for about 8 hours over last two days (that should tell you something straight away) and I am really enjoying it. There is currently an active player base and you can do 'runs' with characters at all levels, this might mean you are a bit OP in early missions so I wouldn't recommend this if you like a challenge. However, if you can't get real people at a similar level you can always take the AI henchmen.The game has you starting in a standard MMO town area with shops and npcs to talk to, and all the other human players milling around. It doesn't take long to get your first quests and make a team of willing volunteers or AI slaves. Each mission is a turn based combat affair. However, all your moves happen at the same time. So no waiting for one player to decide what to do. The weapons and abilities are as varied as in other Shadowrun games with e all the races to choose from. As you level up you get to make your character more unique with ability choices, although be careful here as there is currently no way to re-skill. You can also hack turrets and use abilities to loot secret areas, which is a nice touch.I think this game is an innovative addition to the turn based combat genre and I hope other developers will learn from this model, and we will have a lot more co-op simultaneous turn based combat in the future. This would be a great addition to an X-Com or Jagged Alliance games. Hint, hint.			"

												The long wait is over. The game that was kick-started as Shadowrun Online is here now as: Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown.Why has it taken so long to get here? For those unaware, there was a complete turn-over in the development team. A player can see this for themselves when they look at the long list of those credited with working on this game. Cliffhanger Productions took over development and has brought the game to those who dreamt and paid for this game as kickstarters or as early release players. Cliffhanger and their talented crew have excellent experience in working with the game engine and have a solid history of releasing updates and new content with their previous projects. As developers they are uncommon in their excellence by frequently listening too and communicating with the game community on desired features and improvements. This means, that they were able to provide a relatively polished game at release with the full promise and expectations for new story, material and addition to be expected to enrich the game experience and storyline. What does this mean as of today, release date? You can expect that there might be a few hiccups like with any game at release. You can trust in Cliffhanger's development crew to squash bugs, balance gameplay, add features and with the assistance of official Shadowrun story creators, you can cut a razor sharp line as you navigate a new and developing adventure in the Shadowrun Universe. Also, any complaints from backers or 'traditional Shadowrun gamers' should take into consideration that this game almost didn't happen and the developers picked up a failing project and still brought it to market because of their love of the source material.The story takes place in a city that has not ever been included in the deep history of Shadowrun. This gives the players and official Shadowrun storytellers to create a new experience in a rich world of cybertechnology and magic.As a player, you can create your own meta-human and customize it in your own unique way as you journey through the current story. A player can make their own arch-type as they see fit. You are not limited to the standard tabletop pen and paper rules. This means your own imagination and planning gives you an experience you control. Yes, using cyberware does limit a player's ability to use magic. That still is there like those familiar with the standard game would expect. But, you can have your own mix of skills being a combined summoner and rigger using spirit beasts and deadly drones as you prefer. Or, you can mix ranged hacking skills with channeled mana attacks. It is an open skill system to explore just as much as the adventure of the story.What else is there to say? Jack-in, lock and load and summon the magic spirits and join others in the alleys of Boston to become a legendary shadowrunner!POST NOTE - SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: I am having no problems running this with my this with my dual-core 2gb ram winXP desktop. Wereas, my newer single-core 4gb ram win7 laptop, it is a bit sluggish. So, even though system requirements do not say anything about winXP - chances are you can run it on that OS if you have good systems gear.			"

								A great looking and fun tactics game, anyone who enjoys titles like ""xcom"" will probably like this too. For Shadowrun-Fans this is a must buy anyway. Still somewhat rough around the edges, as it is expected from a early access title, but it already has improved a lot in the last months. Great Potential!			"

								This game is ""Early Access."" And for what it is right now I'd say they've done pretty damn good. I remember what this game was like in its first stage and I gotta say that it has come a LONG way from that. I'm looking forward to the new features and can't wait to see what they do with it.			"

								This game is a real blast when playing with a friend.I realy like turn-based strategy games, but playing such a game with a friend beats the whole experience by far :)It's still an Early-Access game, so not finished yet, so there is still some room for improvement.			"

												Shadowrun Chronicles: Bawston Lawkdown (Cliffhanger Games - 2015)The Shadowrun universe is ♥♥♥♥ing cool. Originally a pen and paper RPG, it's set in a dystopic cyberpunk future where the coming of whatever age heralded the return of magic to the world. What results is combat involving rifles and electronics hacking alongside orcs with high tech axes and mages slinging fireballs. Large corporations hold most of the power and tend to have their own private armies ('Wage Mages'), making things difficult for the Knight Errant, the equivalent of the Police force.Gameplay wise it's a top down turn-based tactical RPG. Think XCom with more focus on the RPG elements. Unlike XCom though, Boston Lockdown is crippled by a lack of depth. The missions are generic: either kill everyone or kill everyone before they can get to a map point, the characters are shallow, the RPG development is wholly linear, the enemies are repetitive and predictable, and the maps are limited: within the first dozen missions we had played the same map three times, once starting from the other end. In terms of tactics, you have two options: move or shoot. There is no 'hunker down' or 'overwatch' option like seen in XCom, all cover is full cover and makes no noticeable difference to your defence.The turn based system is totally broken. The game gives your turn as a group, allowing the player with the fastest hands to move first. You can be mid way through selecting an action when the camera snaps to the player moving, forcing you to follow along before snapping back to your character and resetting your actions to the default selection, making you start planning again. This is even worse when moving multiple characters you control, as even if you move the camera while one character is moving, it will snap back to your character when they have finished moving, often ending up in misclicks in the gaming equivalent of having a website shuffle around on your phone just as you're clicking a link. Worse than that is when all of these happen at once - which happens with alarming frequency - causing a character that you didn't select performing an action you didn't choose in a place you didn't want.Currently on Steam for 30 ameribucks. Spend the extra 10 bucks and buy XCom: Enemy Unknown.'You are not authorised DocWagon personnel'1 star			"

Posted: May 6, 2015
												Just two quick notes, before I set into this review. First, I'm going to be comparing this game to Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall a lot, because it's the only other really equitable game to compare it to. Second, I'm ignoring the server lag for the purposes of this review. It's a known issue, and the developers have been very straightforward about trying to find a fix for it. They're a small studio, so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt in that regard.First up, we have the good:1) Pretty graphics, relatively speaking. Chronicles obviously isn't going to set any records for having pretty artwork, but what's there is eye-catching and does a good job of setting the cyberpunk mood that Shadowrun so requires. The character portraits are hand drawn, coupled with decently detailed three-dimensional character models. From a character model standpoint, I'd say that it's prettier than Shadowrun Returns - though not by much.2) Adequate soundtrack. It's not something that will blow you away, but I found myself occasionally tapping my foot or my finger in time to some beat or another while I was killing badguys.3) Solid combat. It's not the most detailed system out there, but the combat system is adequately detailed (especially for a game that is in part being aimed at portable devices). Much like the more modern incarnation of XCOM, Chronicles uses a streamlined tactical combat engine with a square combat grid, directional cover, and percentage-based attacks. There are a variety of special attacks, and things like range, cover, and positioning will have a direct impact on what strategies you want to use during combat. Enemy AI is acceptable, with enemies generally making use of cover and doing an adequate job of trying to catch you off-guard (focusing fire on exposed targets, attempting to flank, using their own special abilities).4) Interesting, if linear story. The game is very linear, which can be a good or bad thing depending on what you're looking for, but what's there is fairly intriguing. It's not fantastic, but it at least has a good general grasp of the setting, and does a decent job of setting up a few big twists as it progresses. An important thing to keep in mind is that where Shadowrun Returns was set in the 2050s (surrounding the ""Universal Brotherhood"" incident), Chronicles is actually set in the 2070s. Technology has advanced to the point where things like bioware, nanotech, and wireless technology are commonplace. This is a small but important detail, especially for those who have previously played Shadowrun Returns or Dragonfall, but aren't otherwise familiar with the setting.5) Character customization. There are a decent number of options when building your character, including character portrait, gender, species, background trait, wardrobe, and a small number of starting skills. While there could always stand to be more options, there are a fair amount currently available. Physical options such as gender, species, wardrobe, and cyberware are all reflected visually on your character model.6) The community is great. Thus far, the community seems friendly and genuinely helpful. You get the occasional bad apple in the bunch, but most players will be quick to offer help when you need it, whether it's the answer to a question or another runner to help you through a tough mission. The system is set up so that ""griefing"" is difficult, with limited friendly fire and a ""shared loot"" system that prevents people from swiping your hard-won nuyen or karma out from under your nose. The devs even pop up on the Global Chat from time to time, to answer some questions or address concerns ""in person"".And then we have the bad:1) Streamlined = Simplified. Shadowrun Returns used a stripped down, simplified version of the Shadowrun rules system, but Chronicles goes one step further by simplifying it even more. There are currently only nine skill trees in Chronicles (seven weapon skills and two utility skills), and you can only use four of them on a character at a time (two weapon skills and two utility skills). Equipment progression is fairly linear, with most new gear being a straightforward upgrade without any need for real thought about how to equip yourself. You're occasionally presented with an option that actually matters to an extent (such as whether to use Cyberware, mutually exclusive skill options, or what two ""tactical slot"" items to take with you on a mission), but these kinds of decisions are few.2) Poor documentation. The game is still in a state of flux, because it's freshly released, and it went through a lot of revisions during the late testing stages. Some of the ability descriptions are poorly explained in the tooltips, and in rare cases they're actually incorrect (such as in the case of the Bioware Reflex Recorder or the Manabolt spell). Certain basic bits of information are withheld from you, though not deliberately - they simply haven't added in certain amenities yet. A detailed character sheet, for example, is very much needed. The devs have stated that they intend to address these issues, but they are currently low priority due to bigger issues (such as the server lag).3) Limited functionality. Much like with the poor documentation, there are a number of things that are planned but simply haven't been added yet. There's a Chat system, but it's currently very limited in what it can do. Certain basic functions such as ""Ignore"" or ""Whisper"" are not currently implemented, though they are planned. There's no buyback feature at merchants, so if you accidentally sell something, it's impossible to buy it back. There's no character respec system, which (coupled with the poor documentation on some abilities) can lead to great frustration when you pick a skill that you THOUGHT would be good but turns out to be useless. During missions, the sometimes clunky interface can often lead to mis-clicking or accidentally skipping your turn.4) Mildly lazy character/level designs. This is a debatable point, especially for a low-budget title like Chronicles, but it's worth mentioning since some people find it more annoying than others. While there are a lot of visual pieces of cyberware and clothing, many of them have clipping issues or odd limitations. Wearing a hat, for example, causes your hair to vanish. Wearing a longcoat causes your pants to vanish (though you can still equip some basic pairs of pants in your ""underwear"" slot). The pointed ears on most metahuman races WILL clip through pretty much any hat or helmet you wear, since they're all obviously designed for human heads. Maps are visually appealing and present tactical options, but many of the maps are re-used multiple times. They'll often try to obscure this by adding some new set dressing, or having you enter the map from a different direction, but you'll quickly start recognizing certain maps (such as the ""Warehouse"" map) because some are used for three or four separate missions.5) Limited content, lacks enough variety. What's in the game is fairly smooth and interesting, but there's just not enough of it - especially for a multiplayer game. The largest degree of variety you're going to run into is the runners created by other players, but the actual game itself is very limited. When it comes right down to it, there are only about twenty enemy designs in the game - which sounds like a lot, until you run into your fifteenth pack of barghests. Similarly, there aren't enough meaningful options for gear, or skill options, or character portrait options. The main story is ""only"" about twenty short missions (thirty if you count sidequests), which you can blow through in about a day of solid gaming.Final Thoughts: All told, Chronicles is a promising start to something that could be a great game eventually. For now, it's best for someone looking for a casual strategy game, or any enthusiast of the Shadowrun 5e setting. "

												[Note: this review was written based on the first playable version... An Update for the actual game is coming soon. But in short, I really think they delivered a great game! :D]Shadowrun Online is so far still a very early Alpha, with just a few of the core mechanics implemented. By itself it's barely playable, so unless you're a true SR fan, you should really wait for a later phase in the development. But the things already working are truly beautiful and show the massive potential this game has!Currently available is only the tactical fight, with a few very limited options (as there is no character customization yet). But most things are already clearly visible (as different AOEs with explosions or shotgun spread or taking cover), it's fast, hard and unforgiving, but other than other games still challenging and (most importantly) doable! The game is as brutal as it should be, but it's finely tuned, so with smart moves you can take on the enemy regardless of them outnumbering you! And this is exactly what a Shadowrun is all about, isn't it? ;)			"

								Awesome Cyberpunk RPG game with solid Co-Op and Online features. Really enjoyed it playing with my friends. The setting and atmosphere are fantastic. Liked the idea of mixing cyberpunk and fantasy worlds together, especially how it is done in this game. Gameplay is good, its turn-based but its still fast-paced in coop so you wont get bored while waiting for friends and opponents turns.In the sea of multiplayer games today, this little gem stands out on its own. Really unique game that you can enjoy yourself, or with friends, or with people online. Community and players are good and friendly!			"

Early Access Review
								What can you say about this game? When it came out, it was just some very basic controls, and a few missions. Cliffhanger has really done a great, and I mean GREAT job fleshing it out, and giving it life. While not a MMORPG, the game does allow for you to group with friends and play through every scenario together. I play full fledged mmos, and most times I am in a four man party on those games, the same as in this game. So while you cant explore an open world, this world is just as exciting. Its gritty, it has fantastic genre music to immerse you into the Shadowrun world. The combat is seamless and enjoyable. You have great character customization availiable (skills) and even visual customization isnt bad (though most would say they wish they had more options, which I am sure they will add later). I think the absolute BEST part of the game, is that the dev team is in constant contact with its playerbase. Not only that, they take player feedback very seriously, and to heart. So much so that they completely recoded and revamped the game from scratch. They also did the same with the skill trees, using player feedback to sculpt them into more attactive and to be more viable. So if you love turn based combat, and cyberpunk mixed with magic, with a gritty storyline and ambiance; I encourage you to give this game a go. I predict this game being one of the hidden gems on the steam community.			"

								Turn based games are Oldschool and Oldschool is cool! :)Played Shadowrun in the 80's and 90's and I have to admit, yes, Shadowrun Chronicles has of course a little bit of Jagged Alliance and Xcom but it feels good.In my opinion it feels like Shadowrun and this is the most important thing.I think, many people do not really know what kind of game they buy here and they expect a ""World of Warcraft""Story is cool and interesting so far and I'm looking very forward to go deeper and deeper into the sprawl of Boston with my character.More options with the camera view would be very nice. In my opinion in some scenarios it's a little bit tricky to keep track in general.A mini map would be also a great help in larger maps.I really like the skill tree where players have to choose wisely the right set for their character. The skill tree gives you enough freedom and the optionfor various characters with a big band width of skills.Character creation menu is nice and absolutely adequate. Lots of different clothings and other nice gimmicks.For new players and players who are not that familiar with the law of Shadowrun should the devs install a more detailed tutorial.Sometimes I miss some help and a better description for things I have, I can buy or find.Overall I can say it's a good game with an interestng story and a must have for fans of turn based games and of course a must have for all Shadowrun fans as well.

								İt is a pretty good scaled game for an early access game. Graphics and sound effects are good. Game mechanics and character progress are in good shape but character customization still need some work. You play with your main character and at beginning of each mission u can choose some company that will go on mission with you. I hope devs continue their good work up. Some X-Com game was needed at market at the moment and this game seems satisfactional for people who await for such a game.			"

												This game has a good concept. A multiplayer turn-based tactical game sounds great, and the Shadowrun universe has a ton of depth that can be explored to make it interesting.Unfortunately, what we have here is an essentially unfinished game which the developers have abandoned to go work on other projects, and as such I can't recommend buying this game at this time.

												A fun X-com lite Shadowrun experience, better than many games released to date.Seemless Singleplayer / Multiplayer integrationLinear but quite engadging fun storyline.Good customization Character and equipment.Multiple classes which all have their place.No pay to winGreat and friendly communityHas had few bad issues in the past (most games do these days) but they pretty much all seem to be ironed out, the game is a great infrastructure for future expansions and additions, even as is i would say totally solo no friends you can get between 50-100 hours worth of Shadowrun game play from this (and that is just one play through (one character)).Honestly while a slightly different game play experience to Returns, Dragonfall and Hong Kong i wouldn't exclude this title at all, if you love Shadowrun setting and X-com type mechanics i'd snap this up asap, it is very fun.Adding to it the Developers seem interested in their game and the community is really quite cool.

												Im a big fan of turn based strategie and rpg in the likes of xcom, AoW, HoMM, Final Fantasy and so on. So a friend of mine got me this game to play co-op.The first few hours i had the hope the deapth of the game and story will unvail, but after nearly 5 h of gameplay -nothing- had changed. The same town, the same items, the same dialogs (i didn't even bothered anymore) and the same dull combats. This game feels like an early alpha. And in my opinion you could have changed the Shadowrun Setting with everything else and nobody would have recognised.I like the shadowrun universe from P&P but in my opinion this game failed miserably to transport this universe in a believable manner. I have no idea how the team thought they could provide this game as an MMORP... because this not even a real RPG.. its just a lobby for a turn based RPG with minimal tactical deapth.So i recommend to save your money for an AAA title like xcom2 where you get real turn based strategie with RPG elements, a decent (in my opinion great) story and hours of fun for nearly the same price.This is a 3/10 for me, sorry.

												I played and loved all the Shadowrun Returns series from HSB, but not liking this game Shadowrun Chronicles - Boston Lockdown from Cliffhanger at all.  This game completely pales in comparision to Shadowrun Returns series of games.  The only redeeming quality this game has is the multiplayer Co-Op quest playing, which Shadowrun Returns series does NOT have.  The thing is the multiplayer is laggy, buggy and has potential to crash or servers will close if the game developer folds.It is more challenging playwise solo than SR, since you Don't have in-quest healing, do have lower hitpoints, limited armor and limited gear slots.  The shaman class is limited, so i have read.  Limited magic spells compared to SR.   Deckers do have more to do in combat, but no matrix runs.  Character creation is weird, you are given a sort of hybrid avatar, then you have to spend your earned karma points on what skills you want to make the avatar into a class.  Does have early job skill buffs choices.  Does have more alternate path skills to learn like lockpicking, demolishing, organ harvesting, but those do take points away from combat skills.  Has an Either / Or tiered system of picking skills. Does have some better looking maps, npc and avatars than SR and has conversation voiceovers for avatars and npcs, with a Boston accent. Actually, good chance this game will fold, since the developer has been in bankruptcy. This game company has my sale price money as a donation.  Buy this on deep discount only. If you like Shadowrun PnP game, Shadowrun Returns series of games and turn-based Co-Op combat, you might like this game.  Read more reviews, forum and wikis, then watch playthroughs on video.

												the TLDR Section : I Recommend this game even tho the Lag is pretty bad at times.  And think most complaints are dumbNow the Real ReviewThe Major Negitive :Lag - The Servers are having issues the game did not get tested for Stress and what knock and as SUCH the game is suffering for a turn based game to have a 20-30 Second delay behind each of your actions is kinda Stupid and is a legit reason not to get this game.  I can see people saying they dont want this game becouse of this issueThe Mix : Alot of people are complaining about random BS.  Like paying 60+$ For this I have no clue where they are buying this considering its for 30$ (Basicly 29.99) on steam,  Wtf is up with the people screeming at the company for them being scammed?Some of the in-game issues people are ♥♥♥♥♥ing about dont Realy seem to excist at all By that I Mean,  Essence Loss from Cyberware is a bit weird,  But dont take your hate on that just becouse you hate it that there is no Respect in the game dosnt mean it should burn in a fire pitI mean you cant have 2 differnt Cyber Skulls ... just think about that you now have 2 heads/2skulls that dosnt work / wouldnt work quit thinking it dos!or 2 differnt pairs of legs? ER WHAT? I mean people are ♥♥♥♥♥ing becouse you cant have 2 differnt pairs of cyber legs?The Co-op is a bit strange,  By that I Mean If your on Mission 6, And your buddie is on mission 8,  You both cant go back to Mission 4 inless you find someone on said mission.  The co-op is mostly the HOST World,  So if you join your buddie your going to go back in time or into the future which can cause spoilers or a few other things on that line.  The Loot system however works for whatever Mission / Story progress your on.  So if your on mission 6 and you joined your buddie on mission 12,  Your getting mission 6 Loot while your buddie gets Mission 12 Loot.  Makes sence if you ask me,  He gets paid for the finish mission you dont,  But you both get the Karma and Loot (Even tho the loot is differnt and randomly Determined)Positive : Its playing Shadowrun with your buddies with Voice acting (Something SR/Dragonfall and such dosnt have much of) among other things.  So alot of the positive things from SR/Dragon Fall are basicly in this game,  Sep you can now Co-op.Edit : The Lag Seems to be getting a fix, while not 100% Playiabble i would say its not a Face palming i wanna toss my computer out to the street bad anymore and seems to be improving over-all give it another few days,  I would say maybe a week? Maybe more? less? not sure.  But it dos seem to get better slightly over time.			"

								The game's getting better. Changes are very slow and painful, but there's undeniable progress from ""How could I be such a moron to buy That?""  to ""Oh, nice map, will have to check it in several months"". I can recommend only to follow the news and  check the reviews from time to time because the game can go both ways from the current state. Now it's not worth the money and isn't playable. But let's hope for the best and wait for Shadowrun they promissed us on kickstarter.			"

								It's in the very early stages of the game, but I wouldn't call it an MMO. There is no persistant world. It is just a single player game that has the option for Coop. Right now only two can coop, but I hope that changes when it goes live. For a coop game, it is fun and I am finding the story interesting. It would be nice to have an area where we can see the other players, make it a true online game. I understand that cost is an issue, but letting players pay to test can be a bad thing.  Some will understand that it's early access, but most will not and judge your unfinished game a little too harshly. I see the potential in it and I love turn based combat. I would recommend this game to those that enjoy the world, if you are looking for something with a faster pace... then Call of Duty is waiting for you.			"

It isn't bad just not what it claim to be and unless the dev is holding back on 95% of the game (with a Q1 2015 release) this will not become a MMO nor an RPG just another interesting tactical shooter. The IP, however, deserves so much better than this, so I would not recommend is you are after a Shadowrun MMORPG.			"

								This game has definitly come a long way since it was first released on steam. With the latest update character customization has quite a lot to offer now and the addition of skilltrees is great. Graphics in general have evolved quite a bit as well. With the new missions starting to outline the story a bit I'm quite curious as to what will be happening there.Generally already a good game, especially if you like Shadowrun and even more so if you're into COOP.

								Finally a Shadowrun game that you can play with your friends in CO-OP or Online with other people! Now, you dont need to  go on Runs with generic NPCs when you can team-up with friends or people online which can be very interesting. Coop is fluid and fast even for turn-based game like this. Combining different classes and skills on the field (from melee to ranged weapons and magic) leads to pretty interesting tactics and options when approaching different missions which you can complete in variety of ways. Add real people in this mix and you can have a Run-To-Remember and a lot of Fun in the process :)Visually it looks pretty good and art style is interesting. It has the atmosphere of the original Shadowrun games (Returns and Dragonfall). Comparing to previous games, this one is fully 3D so that you can rotate the view in the game, which gives you a better view of the level and opponents. This can be really helpful when you plan your next move. Also, I liked the RPG elements and customizations that game offers to a player and its character in game.Story is interesting and keeps you invested to want to uncover more and go deeper with it. This is especially interesting when playing with friends where you can discuss story on the go, and have your own theories about events that occurs in the game.I would really recommend this game to old fans of Shadowrun and new players eager to try new and interesting gameplay and new aproach to online coop story-based games.

												Do buy or do not buy? This is not the question for I CANNOT recommend it. I am really sorry cause I really enjoyed the other SR games (especially Harebrained). But this one is a huge disappointement.Pros:Nice storylineHigh customisation for your charrace and starting bonus are unique and cannot be regained laterNuyen & Karma are hard to earn but increase scaled to your progressCoop (though it has some flaws)Cons chars:90% of runners change name, appearance, skills and gear after each run -> time waste on every run for new researchSome runners are great while others are crap (i.g. melee shotgun with no armor) but you cannot always pick the same ones -> random, no continuityRunner selection is poor cause you only see three at a time and have to click them instead of getting a tab comparism -> lots of scrolling & clicking for nothing, more time wasteRunners only have a main weapon and cannot be equiped which makes later missions extremly frustrating (see more below)if a runner dies you can still select him afterwardschars have no classes but their ""class"" is depending on which weapon three you max -> no classesyou can equip only two ""stuff"" slots which have to be filled before a missionOnly two actions per char but it is usually run & ""action"" cause an ""action"" (except for reload) ends the chars turn -> no double ""action"" (except for a few skills)NO OVERWATCH which would be really important for this gameno real dialog cause you never ever can choose anything (no negotiation, not differnt paths, nearly no 'good-or-evil-decisions' [only 1 in the whole game!!!] etc.)dialogs only continue per click, no backward or skip buttonssome are with sound while others aren'tyou only see the actual line but not the chat historysome dialoges reappear though alreay spokenskills like organ harvesting, demolish etc. suck hard cause they do not add any real value - just a bit of cash - to the game but block your skill pathCons levels:levels are linear pipesyou replay those pipes several times just starting at another position (end game gets more diverse but thats far too late)99% you kill everything or you run as fast as you can cause you cannot kill everything -> no tech, no sneakingno minimap, no map scrolling buttons, only mouse scrollingno map information in advance (important for runner selection), not even buyablelater levels (after finishing chapter 1; infected) are extremly frustrating with hentchmen (NPCs) cause they are far too weak compared to PCs; even with lots of discipline they may end up dead buy one missplaced movement which is far too unforgiving and really frustrates the player (at least me)end boss chapter 1 is frustrating cause its very hard (mass stun, hordes so big that you cannot fight them etc.); though won in 3rd attempt it was really frustrating cause I had to rely on far too many luck shotsenemy scaling is very unbalanced which ist the same problem with missionsusually you fight large hordes which you can only win cause the AI is really stupid -> frustrating due to being helpless and feeling of not having earned some victoriesvery obvious and cheap triggers (click and new enemies appear, how suprising...)ALWAYS combat mode so you cannot run fast from A 2 B when there are no enemies -> more time wastingthere is NO MATRIX mode like in SR returnshitpoints, armor etc. are not display in numbers on the screen only when you do mouseoveryou get Karma & Nuyen after the mission and after talking to your Johnson -> time was, why not make it one triggerthe sounds are monoton and boring espacially the wounded ones in the later market scenesmission minimap is static and the infection & riot warnings useless cause they do not effect you nor can you react to themcannot coop with friends in different ingame time zonesSum up:Very poor usabilitypoor NPCsbad scalingFar worse then SR Returns vom HB studiosFar worse then XCom though using a similar fighting systemDo not buy it nor waste your time!Sorry! Really really sorry but that this game turned out so bad for I hoped to find another gaming pearl. Better luck next time... "

								It promises combat gameplay (currently) and it delivers. It's smooth and intuitive. Voice work is terrible, but you'll see a few other people agree with that! Graphics are already somewhat more polished I think than SRR. In-game dialogue is pretty decent, in-between mission text needs some work, perhaps some translation problems (since I believe the team does not have English as their first language) but that's easy fixed. Objectively, a cute experience that shows potential. It's clear that the dev team understand what Shadowrun is (like the Harebrained Schemes team) and are attempting to implement their vision. This is nothing like the terrible Shadowrun FPS of yesteryear which was apparently created by people who didn't understand the franchise.			"

												I've got to be honest... Shadowrun Returns and it's sequels are a lot better.Lets go over what this game does well:The character customization is good, you get a lot of options for how your runner looks.The voice acting is a nice addition and I do like the graphical quality.Now... lets go over the bad:1. No dialogue options. For a game like Shadowrun this is a fatal mistake right off the bat. After Harebrained Schemes came up with their Shadowrun Returns series (the series that got me into CRPGs to begin with I might add) you kind of expect them. It adds immersion and makes the game more enjoyable as it makes you feel like your guy is an actual person in the world rather than just an avatar for you to move around in it with.2. The combat is just... eh, kinda there. It doesn't feel as intuitive or engaging as it does in Shadowrun Returns.3. Why is this an MMO? No really, why? It really takes me out of the game when I'm trying to get into my epic cyberpunk adventure and in the lower left corner are the words 'LFG Daily PST' over and over. If I wanted that I'd turn my WoW account back on.Overall, you're probably better off spending your money on Shadowrun Returns, Dragonfall, and Hong Kong. I only got this because it was part of a Humble Bundle and I'm finding I'm rather glad I didn't spend full price for it.			"

								i have to say that i was quite surprised by shadowrun chronicles. i am usually not a big fan of this kind of game (roleplaying/turnbased) but i got bored of fps and thought i give it a try.  to put it simply - i hate and love it and thats when you realise that the developers did a great job of balancing. difficult as hell and at the same time motivating, every kill feels great and eventough i usually despise this kind of crap - the character-customisation features really add up and this helps the cause of falling in love with your funny/morbid/brutal troopers - everything comes with a wink and there is a whole lot of love in the dialogues - i guess if you like the humor in GTA you will also enjoy this game in this matter - if you like battlefield this thing might be a bit to advanced for you. if you like gfx-porn go and play crisis. if you tend to start crying because you failed a mission play ORI, if you like challenges, tactical fiddling and morbidity try this one.

								As a fan of the franchise and a huge fan of XCOM I just had to support them on Kickstarter.With the failure of Jagged Alliance: Flashback I grew suspicios if the team could manage to deliver the quality needed.And hell yeah, they did!They went through development hell but in the final product nothing of this is to be seen.The gameplay is smooth, graphic is fitting (even if I personally (!) don't like the artistics, but they nonetheless did well in the given art-style,The freedom of the character-creation (which will be expanded through the coming updates) is even for the small team a great task and really fun to experience.The story is quite rewarding, with some nice twists and turns, which include some nice hints at the shadowrun-universe in whole, it keeps you motivated to go along.The gameplay is also smooth and well calculated, motivating you, keeping you on the edge without beeing unfair.All in all I would absolutely recommend the game. All who are looking at it sure as hell have the Shadowrun-game by Harebraid games in their library, and yes, you also need this one, these are two different games, both with their own greatness, so to speak.Get it, support your indie-dev and have a blast playing this game, there's not much reason not to!

												This game is a good pick for people who would like to play within the Shadowrun universe with their friends.IMPORTANT NOTES-- This game is NOT made by HBS.- This game is more of a combat strategy game than anything else.- The only real ""RPG"" elements are the Karma point distribution and the gear selection. Is this like the other Shadowrun titles? No. But it is entertaining and maybe a good way to get your friends interested in Shadowrun in the first place if they don't want to play the HBS games or haven't played the tabletop game. Two large notable cons are the lack of diversity in the enemy tactics, and maps that are constantly reused. Also, the character models suck.			"

								Like many others I was like ""Wow, a Shadowrun game you can play online and with friends and / or in groups""So of course I joined the early access and I do not regret it a second.I am totally hooked already.The setting is fantastic and there definitely is the Shadowrun feeling I know so well from years ago during countless PnP hours.I had some difficulties with the controls, especially the camare, but as soon as you get used to it, it is really good to handle.It is not an open world, but the hub allows a lot of interaction and in a game like this an open world is not really something to be missed.From the first beginning I was totally in love with the characters; I mean a cigare smoking elf or trolls in a suit, how cool are those options? Well, it is Shadowrun, isn't it? :)I read that some people are moaning about this game being too simalar to for example X-Com, but in my opionion that does not matter a single bit.The devs knew what to do and are experienced in that kind of gameplay and so I am totally fine with building something on a base you are experienced with and deliver high quality results instead of trying to reinvent the wheel and have some jolty results together with probably competely dropping the ball as it happened too often in the past when a great brand was the base for some devs with high dreams.This studio made the right choice: They built something really solid on existing experience.Sure, there is still a way to go in some parts, but I am sure, it will all turn out great in the end.To make a long story short:Thumbs up for this exciting and entertaining game.

Combat is centered on cover usage (which might confuse you sometimes) but is generally fun and offers you a wide variety of options how to beat your enemies.On the downside the campaign is very short and some features seem incomplete.

								I really like the game and how it developed since the first launch almost a year ago. It makes a lot of fun but the difficulty is still damn hard!! (especially for me because I'm not that type of guy that plays a lot of turn based games). But anyways I guess most of the people enjoy the difficulty level of the current version;)I also like the art style and the new voice set. From my point of view they boost the atmosphere so much that the game remembers me a bit of Army of Two. And they add more personality to your characters which is really important for me!But I also have to criticise some of the controls. Don't get me wrong they work fine for me but they could have been made better... especially the shop or even the gear menu (feels like the gear selection of a 1st person shooter). Or even the character customization: I want detailed previous of the item when I hover over its name.... not select it, then press equip and only then I see what kind of item I get! That is not very innovative! It feels like the developers were a bit in a hurry or did not have that much time to polish those menus! Maybe we see some further great changes in an upcoming DLC? I hope so because there's so much potential in that current build and it would be a pity to release it without any future support or new patches/DLCs. So pls keep up the good work!At least I can recommend that game to anybody that likes Xcom or similar games of that genre, but seriously I can't say if it is the perfect Shadowrun experience for the true PnP Shadowrun fans. What matters most is that it's fun to play and you guys should definitely give it a try! THX			"

												Very fun game, really captures the essence of Shadowrun well. The missions are compact and new player-friendly, without holding your hand. The ""Chronicles"" part of the title would indicate that this is going to be an episodic game, like Dreamfall Chronicles, and I certainly hope that will be the case. Unfortunately, the game is currently plagued by very high lag, which during peak times can make the game practically unplayable. I'm not sure if this is simply due to high stress on the game servers, or if there are other issues under the hood. but I really hope Cliffhanger can sort things out quickly. There's a lot of potential here, and it would be a real shame if the game disappears into obscurity because of server troubles.			"

												Surprise, surprise! Well, I didnt expect anything from this game. My buddy gifted it to me so we can play something in co-op, and I was like - meh, OK, ill give it a chance.And in short: Im sure glad I did. I've never played a turn based MMO, and it was a real refreshing change, from all the MMORPG-s out there. Classes, skills, leveling - its all there, and its done very well.  Especially when you have in mind that there are not that many cyberpank games out there. And since its TURN BASED (coming from a guy who grew up on Fallout 1 and 2) its so nice to see that. You can plan and organize every move, only without hectic mumbo jumbo that follows classic MMO's.And no, i dont want to sound like a hyped teen, cause the game as any other game has its flaws. Its still a bit rough around the edges, and there can (and will be improvents) in the future, since gamedevs are constanly realising patches and addons for it.So, to wrap it up, if you are into some cyberpank turn based action with your friends - then Boston Lockdown can be your pick. And even if you're not - might as well give it a try. Its definitely something refreshing on todays games market.			"

												If you like the world of Shadowrun, this is for you!After the first few minutes I knew it was full of Shadowrunie goodness. Good use of Shadowrun words and phrases in the voice acting. The world seemed legit to a Shadowrun universe with the real and VR elements. You will recognize names of statistics and skills, cyberware and weapons but its handled totally different. The game itself plays like a Silent Storm, or X-Com style which I personally love! No Adepts! There are not adepts of any kind in the game and a Physical Adepts is pretty impossible to make currently.I have not yet found a way to use a medkit or item that I just found in the game like; You start the map with your loadout which lets say has NO medkit. If through the course of the map find a medkit, it is not useable until you finish the mission, exit and then equip the medkit from your inventory. Little funky things that make your brain hurt a little but overall VERY FUN!			"

												Its a nice mix of shadowrun returns and the newer xcom game.Since its a mix of both, it lacks much of the story and rpg elements of Shadowrun Returns, and lacks a bit of the depth of the combat system of xcom. The result is a ""light"" version of xcom set in a shadowrun world. Its fun, its still going through its release issues, but its still enjoyable. If you have played shadowrun returns and ever wished ""Man, i wish there was more combat"" or if you have ever played xcom and said, ""I wish this took place in the shadowrun universe"" then you will most likely enjoy this game.Give it a few weeks or so for them to iron out the issues, the devs seem really dedicated to improving the game.

								I was really surprised by this game. Positively! As a fan of the Shadowrun univers I have high expectations. And gladly I like a lot of featureswhich are already implemented and make the game an atmospheric experience. I especially enjoy how fluently the missions play and how I can quickly exchange tactics by just switching out the team I bring alongside my main char. So far I only had a peek at the first 6-7 missions, but these where already surprisingly tough and winning them very closely felt enormously rewarding. I can imagine having a real blast with this in coop and I#m looking forward to the release when I will revisit with a bunch of buddies.Verdict: Extremely underrated! (It is already so much better than many 80+ score games, but I guess we Shadowrun fans are harder to please and other backers who did not understand the concept of kickstarter or what was pitched now abuse this rating system)			"

								I was a kickstarter of this game and was pretty dubious about it at first since development has taken ages but it looks like this game is finally taking shape and I can definitely start recommending this now.  They still have a lot of work to do to polish and add more content but what is available is pretty enjoyable and it finally feels like a Shadowrun game :)			"

								From what I played so far I can safely say that I absolutely love what Cliffhanger has done with the Shadowrun-Franchise! I loved the latest XCOM-Game and Shadowrun perfectly adds to this formula. Coop is a blast and the stylized Graphics fit the  overall Game very well (on par with XCOM)! Worth the bucks!			"

												I am new to the Shadowrun universe.  I ran across it when Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall were out awhile, and really loved those.  This one is a bit different, and it may be unfair to compare this with those.  Different companies involved, different approaches.Overall, I do like it a lot.  Gives me the Shadowrun ""feel"".  Now I haven't gotten too far into it, so maybe I'm reviewing this premmaturely, but the game is a great turn-based game, and pretty challenging.  The AI has its moments, but is pretty smart, which is a refreshing change from a lot of other games out there.  Graphics are nice.  Music has that ""feel"" too.One other thing I'll mention is that I normally like games that are more single-player focused.  I was told by one of the developers and vets out there that this is a multi-player (co-op) kind of game, that CAN be played like a single player if you want (instead of playing with a live human being, you can just sub a henchman, or AI, as your partner).  For what little time I have to play, that works out perfectly fine for me, and so far doesn't seem to be a problem.What people interested in single player MUST know though, is that whether you are co-oping or playing ""single player"", you MUST be connected to the internet.  There is no offline!  To many, like me, that's not a big deal.  I'm always connected.  But one drawback I have found out already, is that because you are playing with other players in a hub area, you WILL fight lag.  Hopefully once time passes and the devs get things more stabilizied, there will be little-to-no-lag.  But right now, there are times when I click on something and it can take upwards of 10-30 seconds for the command to be executed.  Other times it runs perfectly smoothly.  So be aware of this!But I would overall recommend it...			"

												Shadowrun (SR) Chronicles is a light turn-based strategy game with a SR theme. Unfortunately, the game mechanics have nothing to do with SR whatsoever!The graphics are nice, animations are good and so far I've encountered no bugs. The variety of possible actions on runs seems to be quite limited: walk, run, interact, shoot/cast spell/summon/hack... no overwatch, no steadying weapons, no hiding, no hunkering down. Possibly some of this will be available later in the campaign or via perks.Speaking of perks, there are loads of them and they are what differentiates characters. Here SR really is only a theme on top of a different game. Reflexboosters increase your accuracy and crit chance, heightened initiative lowers your chance to get hit and there is no turn order based on initiative. Plays like a basic version of the XCOM combat mechanics with much higher amounts of perks.Don't buy this if you're expecting SR game mechanics from playing the tabletop versions or SR Returns!			"

								Great graphics, the sounds are worked well, and the story line is awesome! What is also nice is the interaction possibilities in game with the badass characters (Smedley is just awesome aha!).I didn't test the multiplayer system yet, but I heard some good things about it.The only one thing is maybe, it would be nice to explain a little bit more the missions, personally I didn't have any problems so far, but I can understand that someone who never played this kind of game needed to read more carefully. But it's definitly an interesting game, as it is in early access, I assume it's gonna be even better in the future !			"

								From what i play i have really enjoy it so far . The game needs alot of work but what do you expect it is a early access game and not the full release yet . So im only doing a review as im tired of seeing people crying about how bad the game is .. ITS IN EARLY ACCESS . Stop taking it as the full game has been release and this is all your gonna get . There still lots of work to do and stuff to change. So i feel people should stop leaving bad reviews on early access games till its close to end of beta or is full release. If you like shadowrun you will like this ONCE its full release the coop in it right now is only 2 players but is going to be up to 4 later on and i do hope they up it alittle more Beyond 4 player coop. I can see this beeing really good onces its fully out and at full release so Please give it time. If you really want to try it keep a eye out for a sale on it dont buy if your someone who thinks EARLY access means full release game.			"

Early Access Review
								While this game is still in early access and there's still some ground to be covered, the improvements made since the early access version of SRO was launched are quite impressive. The most important aspect, to me, is that the devs have proven themselves to listen to the community's feedback, which makes me feel my time spent providing feedback is worthwhile, even though the game doesn't deliver the experience of a full-fleshed Shadowrun game just yet (although it comes closer with every update). People who are excited by the idea that their feedback will help shape Shadowrun Online should definitely look into the early access version - people who'd rather spend their time playing a polished, final version of the game and do not care too much to raise their opinion should probably wait a little longer. In any case, I am thrilled that the latest version finally added, among other things, attributes and differences between the metatypes (Orks, Elves etc.) and I am looking forward to the next update already :)			"

								First of all, when I backed the game I was really excited on gatting a 2070s Shadowrun RPG game where I could play with my friends from the Shadowrun community.With the latest update, I have come to get quite impressed. Narrative is good, the missions are interesting and I'm thrilled with how the story is evolving. However, there are things missing (I suppose they'll be out on launching day) such as the footwork before a run, and the matrix system (I am not seeing any interest on playing with a decker for the moment) as well as the astral world.At this moment, I recommend getting shadowrun chronicles, but be aware that it still has many possibilities for improvement that, I hope, we will see in the near future.

								It is fun and challenging, although the makers need to input some options for players and possible customers to their website, such as;Players-  need more than 3 slots of characters                access character info from steam; including changing name, screenshot ability so that paying player can see the neat outfits found and created                access to rules and game help in and out of the game, such as; what is  combatsoft rating or ecmsoft rating?               info about cyberware can no longer be removed because the player cannot have human parts put back onoverall... the game is challenging.. but not too terrible for ragers to quit, but just enough to make you want to keep trying and rejoice when you get that hard mission done.nice to see the co-op 4player added as well.Defintely a good buy for the money and I look forward to expansions (hopefully higher levels of new cities for created characters)			"

								Shadowrun Fan since the 80's. I have to admit, that Shadowrun Chronicles makes me feel good. Turn based game with a lot of Shadowrun lore in it. Nice missions for a nice game. Yes I know it's not an open world game but it's a good game for people who want to play a game which is not that time consuming. Community hub works pretty well, missions are possible to play with your NSC gang if you have no player group, skill tree is nice for the beginning. I really hope we will see some more special missions later and not only the street runner quests.I could imagine that we will see some more decker or hacker quests in the future, would be absolutely great. Maybe some riddles, black ice and so on.Looking very forward to the story and I'm pretty sure it will be very exciting to be more and more involved in the story of Boston.			"

								A ""Real"" early access review.. ok first.. to the ppl ♥♥♥♥♥ing about pros and cons of an early access game not having enuff of anything should please kindly shut the F* up.as an early access, I.E. beta tester, you need to focus on what is buggy and needs to change, fill out a bug/suggestion form and send it to them, that *is* why its early access. If a person liked Shadowrun Returns or Dragonfall then they should defintely buy this game. Shadowrun Chronicles plays, looks and feels the same as the previous two single player titles.Graphics are smooth and the art is both familiar and polished. The game engine itself appears to run smoothly and seems error free. This installment will do very well emulating the previous two, it feels very Guild Wars-ish <part 1>As a multiplayer game, the replay value will largely depend on the player. Shadowrun wasnt really intended for ""high"" level characters, So hopefully they dont stray too far in attempting to keep toons in the gameworld. Shadowrun was intended to be played across many mid-range characters. I can honestly already see the KARMA system is being messed with. This is a game that needs to stay true to its source books and not be ""watered-down"".Too many instant gratification kiddies out there have ruined grinding, created a market for micro-transactions and many other ways to circumvent leveling.While I personally find the aforementioned practice to be distasteful, I can say without reservation that my opinion aside, it will ruin this game to deviate from the sourcebooks.

												First off, let me say: THE LAG IS GONE! YAY!Now that i have that out of my system...Shadowrun Chronicles has come a LONG way from the original mission i played back in april of 2014, during the first days of early access.I weigh heavily on the likeness to the pen and paper, as i was introduced to this franchise while it was only a tabletop dice game, so im a bit bias to the IP. -Fair Warning-While easily shuffled under the blanket of ""XCOM"" and ""FF Tactics"" games, this one shines on its own, at the very least because of the Shadowrun brand. Gameplay mechanics are basically the same as those mentioned: Move to cover, preferably while flanking the enemy, shoot, and hope your enemy doesnt have enough AP left to move in for a cheap critical attack (Hoping they add an overwatch system sometime).While not completely like the pencil and paper classes (your ""background"" actually has more to do than just modifiers in combat in the P&P.) They have done a decent job of making basic skill trees, each with thier own special perks, though at this point they are a bit limited (10 ""levels"").If i remember correctly from my tabletop days, Karma was REALLY hard to come by. In this, not so much. You get around 7 or 8 karma per storyline mission. Making those 10 levels of skills easy to come by if you have friends to rerun missions with. Not a game breaker, but it limits your character progression/ available skills as you can attain a full 10/10/10/10 before even getting close to the end of the game thus far.Im ok w/ the streamlining of the combat system and abilities (for now). Your choice from the onset is 2 main attack skills, I.E. Assault Weapons and Blades, or Decking and Blunt, etc.BUT, you can also have 2 Casting skill sets if you feel like being behind the lines all day, like a traditional MMO Squishy. Not reccomended for the newer players. Im not even going to attempt it till they flesh out the casting/ rigging/decking system.As you advance your character through the story, your main 4 skills will be the defining factor in your characters abilities. While you can put your Karma into whatever skills you want, you want to focus on your 2 main attacks (guns/ swords/ casting/decking/rigging) and splitting the rest of your points between Mind and Body. You can make an uber toon who can cast one mission then swap out and be a frontline bullet sponge the next, as long as you have invested the points into the skills and have the correct item equipped. Case in point: i started a summoner, and put some points into casting. i equipped what i THOUGHT was a summoning totem. Got into battle and was only able to use my caster skills.READ THE ITEMS BEFORE CLICKING READY. Nothing worse thasn hearing your party griping about the dumbass who cant cast the buff we needed is no good.The story is getting pretty good so far. Not going to spoil anything, but just be ready to fight a LOT of dogs. A LOT.Pretty run of the mill storyline, if youre familiar with the twists and turns involved in a good Shadowrun. Getting to point B from point A doesnt always involve the easiest path, and usually there is a few steps between A&B to add some drama and opportunity to get some decent loot.Gameplay is getting better, now that the lag is almost completley gone. I play with friends (up to 3 buddies at a time. 4 player co-op is where its at!), so its still a bit on the laggy side, but thats mainly due to everyone being able to move at the same time (your team, then enemy team), so you click somewhere, your buddy does too; its hangs up a bit to figure out who gets to move there first. Other than that, the gameplay is as solid as any other Tactical game ive played thus far.Graphics:They could be a bit cleaner, but ill gladly sacrifice a bit of polish for being able to spin the camera around to see the map from different angles, like this game does. I would love to see a POV addition (just for targeting), just to settle my complaints about what my toon can actually see vs what i think he can...Equippable items/ clothing:Meh. Lots of clothing options, so you are pretty much guaranteed to not look exactly like the dude standin next to you.Guns/ Weapons:I really hope there is more levels of guns and such to buy after the point im at. ive had the same gun and sword for the last 7 missions. The enemies get more HP, i still do the same amount of damage.Cyberware:Would love to see more cyberware options, as well as higher prices on said items. its kinda cheesy to be able to do a few runs and be able to afford to replace arms and legs for under 15K Nuyen. AND for over 2 essence. I dont know how many P&P fanboys agree with me that the essence system is garbage, (but effective for the blatant PvP skill tree setup this game is leaning towards). I mean a full essence for a datajack? frrrrt chummer... Even by the second edition rules a basic cyberarm replacement was only going to run you 1 essence, with only a .1-.4 additional essence loss for bonuses on the arms. Yes, point 1 to point 4 essence. not 2 full essence for a basic arm/ leg/head/torso upgrade.Prices for cyberware... jeebus drekking crust my chummer... In Shadowrun, cyberware was supposed to be expensive and hard to come by, making the struggle to be the best chromejockey out there; a bit tougher.As for Decking and Rigging.... oh boy.. heres where i have some complaints:Rigging:They have boiled/ dumbed down those classes into basic caster types. yes, CASTERS. You attain your Bots through your rigging skill tree. you dont buy them like items, so basically evey rigger has the same bots available, just depending on what skills your points are in is dependant on what bots are stronger. Yeah... So basically Riggers are Techno Shaman.Hackers:ugh... just ugh. There is NO MATRIX in this game. Thatrs right. if you played Dragonfall or Shadowrun Returns as a Decker, be ready to be rendered ineffiecient in Chronicles. Your role as a decker basically boils down to being a Techno Caster. Buff your party, and mark your enemies. Not that decking is not needed. As you attain better skills, the mark ability will help out your party more and more, I.E. Salvo 2 (Assault Guns ability) gives you a bonus burst if attacking a Marked enemy. Dont quote me on this, but i think that each weapon skill set has an ability that bonuses on marked targets. Comes in handy when youre facing an enemy with 50+ HP.Music/ soundGood for what it is. The voice acting, while sporadic, is well done; though id like to see an option for different voices based on character race/sex. Kinda funny to hear the same voice when i play a Dwarf as when i play an elf..The music is pretty decent. i turn it down not only since i stream but also to hear everything else going on. this games sound isnt quite optimized. its still a bit loud, regardless of settings. Sound effects are well done. Guns sound like guns, swords make the swooshing noise a sword usually makes in games.Overall, I would say this game is running a solid 8/10.While i base that soley on the things i HOPE they add, its not a bad thing. I am well aware that they plan on doing a lot more with the game.I just hope, for thier sakes, that they lean more towards the full skill sets from the P&P version of Shadowrun. I mean, they give you current P&P rules and an adventure book (this games story!) in PDF format for buying the Deluxe/ RPG package. Why would they NOT give you the skills from that eventually?TL;DR version:Buy this game.Its fun, and improving week by week.Can be Solo'd, but running with 3 of your friends is where the game is at its finest and funnest.

												Firstly, before this review a disclaimer; I like the Shadowrun setting. I was introduced to it through Shadowrun returns and Dragonfall and like it very much. Also, this game is made by a different developer and is not to do with the ""SR returns"" games so don't go in expecting that.Synopsis:This is a tactical ""XCOM"" or FF Tactics style online turn-based grid RPG The plot revolves around a quarantine being enforced in Boston after a virus breaks out. The idea is the entire area is cut off from the rest of the country. You play a shadowrunner trying to make a few Nuyen and get to see the events which lead up to that.Good points:Combat: The combat is extremely fun and addictive. I personally played my first character all the way to the end of the game solo using the ingame henchmen. The game is unrelenting if you are not prepared but very rewarding when you beat it.Co-op: This game really shines in the co-operative department; despite as mentioned I finished this game initially solo. On playing a second character I opted to try the co-op gameplay and it is extremely enjoyable and sometimes a lot more tense relying on other people. There is a great deal of camaraderie felt with the people your playing the missions with.Customisation: You have a great deal of customisation options over the character you create. There is a wide array of clothes/hair/tattoos etc you can equip your runner with. You really identify that this is your guy. There is also a heap of these which are unlocked through the game through RNG item drops so you can chase your perfect outfit if you so desire.	Ontop of that the game has several customisable skill trees you can spend your skill points/Karma into so if you want to play a Decker moonlighting as mage who is a male troll with high heels...go for it!Lore:The Shadowrun universe is very deep and far reaching. Characters in this game such as your fixer/Mr. Johnson has made appearances in previous Shadowrun novels/sourcebooks. It feels great playing in a universe which such an expansive back-story it feels these characters are in this city for a reason not just because it was made that way.Community: The community in this game is very open and friendly for the most part; the ingame chat is not full of the sort of things you would see in the Barrens chat of World of Warcraft. People seem genuinely friendly and helpful if you ask for it. Developers: The Developers/Community Managers at Cliffhanger are frequently seen on the steam forums replying to posts as well as the official shadowrun forums. They seem genuinely interested in Shadowrun universe itself for the most part and wanting to help make the game a success.Problematic PointsLag Upon release this game experienced problems with lag between actions. The reasoning for this being that this game is online only. However, it has greatly improved from release and while its still persists partly it is being worked on and everyone is being kept informed. During early access which I played prior to the game this was not a problem so sadly for the Developers this only started since release. Patches have been churned out frequently and sever restarts are happening to prevent it becoming a problem.Unbalanced Classes Some classes such as the rigger seem unbalanced for the moment where at some points it feels definitely OP to play as one. In that same sense only 2 character controlled minions are allowed in one group which affect the summoner class also. Causing problems if two riggers/ or a summoner and a rigger is in the same group. However, this is being discussed with a community and headway is being made on what to do to address this problem in the forums.Mission vareity In the context of a tactics grid RPG there is only so much you can do; the missions currently boil down to the following:Kill all the enemies.Find x and leave.Stop x enemies from going to the exit point.Explore x and continueAccomplish x objective with x turns	Personally I don't mind that as the story and enemy variety makes up for the current mission shortcomings although honestly the enjoying the combat on my end is a big part in not being bothered by the above.End Game The game is quite lengthy and enjoyable ride till the end of the story missions. Currently however there is no repeatable missions or anything to do other than stand in the hub and talk. You can get invites from other runners and join a co-op and run with them on a mission they are doing if you want your Shadowrun fix. However, if you group with low levels you essentially are too OP for the enemies. Although some people willingly do this to unlock extra Karma so may not be a downside for some people.Final ThoughtsPersonally I find this game highly enjoyable to play and not made a secret that I find the setting and lore very interesting personally. If you love Shadowrun this is probably a no-brainer. If you are not so inclined to the universe yet I'd still say this is worth a punt or if you want to investigate further watch one of the numerous lets plays of the game and see if this looks like something you would enjoy. It definitely a game you can play solo if you like a game that's not going to hold its punches if you play sloppy. In that token its also perfectly fine to play co-op with friends or hell make some new ones like I have playing this game. More content is going to be churned out for this game in the long-run including endgame content. They've made a hell of a enjoyable game so far so I can't wait to see where they go with it.			"

Early Access Review
								Some first impressions from a friend. Before I get more requests.this is NOT a review. Contents of the game consist of 4 missions and a 'pvp' map. Missions last around 5-10minutes. Dialog before and after missions does feel like shadowrun but will need more fleshing out in future updates. Banter between party members is minimal. The voice over work is rather average but the rest of the music and soundfx fit the game and environments well.Characters and npcs have issues turning directions until they stop moving or face a new cover. Amusing as most seem to strafe around backwards. Game scripts failed on me 3 times with npcs completely stopping in their tracks forcing a mission restart (known problem).User interface and fonts currently do not scale correctly for higher resolutions. You are left with odd sized buttons that still have a few placeholder images at work. Global chat that cannot be disabled but can be hidden.RNG needs to be tweaked.Seems like all negatives but it has enough positives that it should really turn into something nice. I would suggest that currently ""antisquad' is further along in development and quite the bargain price if you need a turnbased fix. Personally I picked up the deluxe editon of SRO and don't regret it at all. Just advising if you don't have the cash to throw around it's better spent elsewhere, for now. :)Definitely give Shadowrun Returns and the wonderful dragonfall expansion a go first and foremost.Guessing, I would give it about 3-6months for a reasonably enjoyable product with some decent content. Maybe 10-12months for a 'finished product'. Voting as recommended for now with a proper review/update when it's polished up and more content is added in future.Cheers folks.			"

												It's not what I expected when I backed this game 3 years ago but it's still a solid release and looks to be quite a bit of fun.Edited to add: I've put a fair bit more time into this and while I probably wouldn't play it solo it's surprisingly good with a couple friends on voice chat. Preferably friends who will make fun of the absolutely terrible voice acting for some of the characters. I'm hearing that there are going to be some pretty big updates coming in soon to add replayable end game runs with a higher difficulty on them as well as some quality of life changes.I've found the community very friendly and helpful as well, lots of folks willing to help you get your bearings on those first few runs or group up with you for some of the harder ones. Honestly, if you plan on playing this solo I'd give it a pass for now. If you want to play co-op though either with friends or strangers (there are always people on global chat needing more runners) then it's definitely worth a purchase.			"

												This is an enjoyable experience for anyone who is a Shadowrun fan, and especially so for those who are Shadowrun: Returns fans. Shadowrun: Chronicles features fully customizable avatars that give you plenty of choice to designing your own unique look. The scene takes place in a future Boston, and you start out on the street like most runners. Socialize with the townfolk, grab a soykaf and your nearest chum to assist you in a cooperative mission, or stay solo if you're the lone wolf type. This game has me hooked, and I am so glad I am part of the early access. Shadowrun: Chronicles has a bird's-eye view interface, where the story is driven forward through single missions that are interconnected through the story plot. Optional missions are also available, but can disappear if not completed before main story missions.  The interface is simplistic, and an understanding of the Shadowrun background is not required, though, it can enhance the enjoyment of many aspects of the game, such as dialogue and storyline. The developers are constantly adding more to the game, and so it is often a new experience when you play from one day to the next. I really love the supportive and upbeat community that exists in this game. Come check it out for a brand new experience and throw yourself into this cyberpunk setting that is Shadowrun.			"

												I've been playing this game with my RL pals for the last couple of weeks and I must say that I think it's been given a really bad rap. Sure, the Harebrained Schemes titles are far better RPG and single player games - of course they are, that's what they were designed for! Boston Lockdown is simply about four mates getting their co-op on Xcom-style in the Shadowrun universe. I know Xcom is over-used as a comparison in reviews for isometric turn-based games, but in this case the similarity runs deeper than the format. Boston Lockdown uses a skill system which is akin to the way you advance troops in Xcom. You equip your character with 2 weapons, each of which opens a corresponding skill tree. Advancement on a skill tree offers many either/or decisions at given levels, so you must choose wisely as there is no going back. Yes, it's pretty simplistic - but nuanced enough in the choices you have to make as you invest in the trees to feel rewarding. Synergising your skills with the people you run with is pleasing, too. I think if one views this game as having more in common with a title like Helldivers, it would better serve. Don't bother with pick-up-groups, just get three of your pals and work the campaign together, arguing about who goes first during your action phase or whether that grenade was meant to bounce off that wall.To surmise, I played pen&paper Shadowrun RPG in the late 80s and this is the closest I've felt to actually doing a run with my buddies since. Sure, it's got it's quirks - but there's nothing else out there like this.			"

												Okay, maybe i am comparing it to much with Shadowrun:Hong Kong... but this game really has some issues...1. Combat is bad. -Enemys spawn from from nowhere. -There is no UI Indicator that there is someone so you can really miss enemys. -Action Cam forces you to watch a enemy slowly die... while something else happens with your team. What ? I dont know i cant see s hit ! -There is a huge delay after you do something with your squad; This delay makes some squad mades run out of cover to run to the last guy i just shoot... so he is going to die now.. -Nothing tells you if an action will cost one or two turns... So its just pure luck if running to that thing will uncover enemys and your guy will just die... 2. Boring Euipment - Yes you have a lot of Clothing, Tatoos and stuff... but armor ? I saw like 4, polymer spray, some kevler thing. And the same stuff with a ""used"" before the name, slightly lower stats. - If you like to use Rifles in example you get one... ""used"" then the better version... Then you are forced to do mission and you cant return to the arms dealer to get the 12.000 Nuyen gun... wish is just a bit better then my own.- But hey ! My squad gets better guns and armor... while on mission. If there was a way to buy something ? I havent found it -> Bad UI.- But honestly there is nearly nothing here for euipment. Every Archetype has 4 items ? Compered to SR:HK thats really nothing... and it feels compared to it very weird.3.Story- The Story has it pluses. But you cant really talk what you like, your character talks like he wants... so why do i play this ? I dont know i stopped playing it...- You dont have any choice in this game, you just run the story down... thats all.- And just taking the corridor left or the camera trap corridor right is no real choice !Hell i really dont give bad reviews normally. But as a SR GM and player and fan of the frenchise i just cant recommend this game. Really i cant.Its not even Early access... this is supposed to be finished. Its not, it a prototype. sorry.			"

Early Access Review
								The story has come a long way and I'm totally psyched to get the whole picture once the game's released, being a fan of dystopia and all. As for the missions, I really liked the more complex maps, like the one in the stadium, where you get the feeling of immediate danger and have to make a run for it. Game still needs more work in the balancing department and some polishing but I grew to like the general direction it has taken with the latest updates. I'd recommend playing it in co-op as it can be lots of fun, but hope the whole inviting and grouping will be optimized soon.Good luck! "

												I got this game and decided I would check out why the reviews were so mixed. I'm an avid Shadowrun fan. I have played the Table Top since 1990's. I had Sega Genesis Shadowrun, I had SNES, I got all the Shadow Run Returns... So yes, I am interested in the franchise. As an avid fan, how bad could this be?This is a game that feels as an example when Developers don't seem to be fans as well. The game lacks a soul. There are bits I felt the game did right. I was happy to slap a halloweener's face paint on. However, the voice acting actually detracts from the immersion for being so bad. The stories aren't anything that really engages you.There are even parts where it doesn't even take into account the character you selected when speaking of your character. Make a female? They call you ""Him"" and ""Sir"" and junk. Just shows the sub par quality of the game. Is it a piece of #($*(#*? Not really, but if you want tactical shooters, X-COM blows this out of the water. And if you want Shadowrun done right, Returns/Dragonfall/Hong Kong blow this out of the water.Seriously, I find it hard to believe the developers sat around the table designing this game and didn't think people would dislike it. They had to know.			"

								I did not play Shadowrun in years so I was really looking forward to playing the game - and that is exactly what I have done for the last 14 hours. It was a bit tricky in the beginning and there are a few bugs left but it is a great game, good storyline, fun dialogues and tricky quests. Not quite a cheap game but worth it.			"

												I am fairly disappointed in this game so far. Considering how long they took to get this far I thought the mechanics would be more complex and interesting then Shadowrun Returns. No insult to that great game. Just a mater of scale right? Well, to me this feels far less complex with many of the fun mechanics of the shadowrun game not represented.I'm not saying its a terrible game. It's just not even near what I was hoping for and my disappointment is keeping me from giving it very much time to evaluate it.			"

												SHORT VERSIONSRC is a fun game with a decent story. Where else are you going to find a story that starts by having a Dragon crash into Fenway and cause a zombie uprising?If you like easy to learn turn-based games and have a group of friends to play with, you should give this a go. Although solo play (with internet connection) is supported, there are better single player titles available. Despite that, the story is still worth experiencing.Want to know more? Read on!---------------FULL REVIEWShadowrun Chronicles traveled a long and rocky road to release. They had a huge problem with lag during their release week and their final product isn't what a lot of people imagined. Despite that it is a welcome addition to the Shadowrun license and provides a long awaited multi-player experience.GAMEPLAY SRC is a strategy game with four player co-op support. The gameplay is easy to learn yet unforgiving of poor tactics. There are no interrupts or reactions - the player goes then the AI reacts. Each unit can do up to two actions but attacking may end that unit’s turn earlier. A good summary would be X-Com Light. Each character has a handful of abilities determined by the weapons they equip. A PC can equip two while the NPCs each get just one. Using two different weapon types will give you more options while using two of the same will let you use specific actions more often. I suggest diversifying! Certain dual wield combos are game-breakingly powerful. *cough* dual wielding riggers *cough*---------------CHARACTERS This game pretends to be an RPG, but the progression is too linear for that. At least you have the choice of several fantasy races as well as clothing and appearance options. You start out with a LOT of clothing choices and they are the most common item drop. A clothing shop will also be implemented in the future.There are 11 different weapon and skill trees allowing you to choose different play styles. Unfortunately within a weapon tree you only get a few choices which leads to little variety. At least the body and mind skill trees require you to choose between two options at each tier.---------------STORY Theoretically our actions will impact the Pen and Paper Shadowrun universe. I can't imagine how as I am in the final act and the plot has been completely linear so far. There are ZERO choices in what to say or do. That being said, if you don’t mind being railroaded the story is interesting and provides a good introduction to the world of Shadowrun. My big complaint is that the story starts with an “amnesia escape mission” and then the rest of the game is a flashback. At least the epilogue, and the promised future missions, should be back in the present!---------------GRAPHICS Though some people have complained about the art style I am very happy with the graphics. I keep playing, hoping for crits, so I can get good screenshots of my character during the crit closeup. The maps themselves look excellent as well. It's a shame the maps aren't larger and that several are reused.---------------AUDIO Many of the NPCs have voice-overs with rather obvious Boston accents. Surprisingly, as a Boston local, they are well done. Regrettably due to their low budget, you do not have a choice for your own voice and that breaks the immersion for me. As for those who can’t handle the Boston accents, don’t worry, you can skip the audio and just read the text.---------------REPLAYABILITY In its current state there is NO replayability. You cannot play previously completed missions without rolling up a new character or finding another player who wants your help.Cliffhanger has plans to add a PVP mode and more end game content, but for now once you play through you are stuck waiting for an update. On the plus side, a single play through can take a sizable amount of time.Over all it’s worth playing! Its a much better multi-player option than a certain Shadowrun FPS.			"

												The game has changed DRASTICALLY during the course of the development. I've bought the DELUXE package which at the time should include a lot of DLC. Now with the game done, I only get 1 DLC which actually is €10 more expansive than having bought the regular game plus that one DLC - I HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF BY THE DEVELOPER!Then as said, the development has taken a drastic turn. Where in the first installment this game was marketed to become a full MMORPG, it's now nothing more than a co-op HUB game with very badly written quests.IMO if you want to play the Shadowrun games, stay away from this one and buy the pretty well written single-player games.

												Comparisons will of course be made to Dragonfall, but Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown follows a different path. While the deep role-playing isn't the focus here, it makes up for it with a ton of action and the flavor of the pen and paper game. Plus, the ability to easily group up with others for missions makes this one a real gem in the world of paper RPG to computer RPG conversions.

												If you want a 1-1 accuracy on Shadowrun rules, you won't find it here. If you want to be a Prime Runner with all the trappings and ""feel"" of  a Shadowrun (Cyberpunk + Dungeons & Dragons) then you've come to the right place. Shadowrunners are horrible people that shoot people right in the face for money. You will form extravagant plans, something will go completely wrong, but you will Improvise and get paid anyway. You will then fence the loot to feed your crippling drug addictions and reliance on cyberware that you acquired so that you would have the build points to better shoot more people right in the face. This game portrays that well. Play it with friend's, you will feel half as guilty.Game is a little rough around the edges. Mechanics are a little basic. But the game is mostly solid, with a small but strong community. I didn't expect the story twist and my dwarf rigger kicks all kinds of♥♥♥♥♥			"

Shadowrun ftw!Character creation and also built is easy and so is the gameplay.Not always clear what the quests want you to do, but shooting / slaying / flashing the bad guys always works. :DSometimes a little tricky to solve some situations, but those who want it easy can go and play some match three stuff. :DHave not tried the grouping other than with my sis but was fun already.Thumbs up!

												Tl;dr: Pretty bland game that doesn't really get the setting or mechanics right. Playable with friends.I'm a fan of the Shadowrun setting and I liked Shadowrun Returns, so I thought this game should be fun as well with the ability to play co-op as well. Well, I was partly right, because it is pretty decent as long as you have someone to play with. The reasons I'm not recommending the game is:- I'm a fair bit into the story, but shops never sell anything new so it feels like I'm just accumulating nuyen (money).- Skill trees feel very bland and at higher levels you need tons of karma (xp) to advance in a seemingly pointless skill.- Magic is done wrong. A pure mage can't really harm robots in this game, while in the game system there are plenty of spells to do so with. Also, troll mages seem to be the best choice, because they do more magic damage. No clue why.- Speaking of magic, hit% is really weird. Often I can have a 90% chance to hit with an AoE-spell and still miss, and every time I miss the spell hits one or more friends instead. Like, why would I throw a manaball backwards just because I missed the particular tile I was aiming at? This is almost game-breaking at times.- The further you progress, the more you realize that the developers were lazy and just reused the same levels over and over again. The only things that change are where and which mobs are placed.- Story isn't really engaging, so far it's mostly been ""meh"".This being said, if you'd really like some (simple) turn-based shadowrun action together with a friend or two, go ahead. I'd recommend you to first look up some gameplay-videos on YouTube though and get the game on a sale.			"

								If your a fan of the new Shadowrun games, then this will certainly be enjoyable for you, I will however point out this being effectively a limited demo at this point, makes it hard to see the promise it holds, it will still take a lot of time for this game to reach it's goal.Either wait for it to reach beta stage, or back it now and just hold off, it's just too early for this game to be judged. The only thing I can say is if you enjoyed the last games, you'll likely enjoy this one.			"

								This game is rather fun and worth checking out- I highly recommend it to others. It is an interesting challenge having to plan out your party ahead of time to make sure everyone has proper skills to execute a mission. So far the only problem I have is that the text in pop-up windows (like the briefings from Jane) could be a larger, clearer font. The difficulty seems a bit high, but if it was easy- it wouldnt be fun. I cannot wait to see how this game progresses and grows into a finished product.			"

												Like most Shadowrun video games, doesn't quite capture what I liked about the table-top game (which would admittedly be hard to capture).  The mechanics are still an interesting adaptation, though.  Was waiting to review it until they fixed the lag problems, which they seem to have at this point.   Hopefully they can move to more fine tuning, and content updates soon.   Overall a decent game.			"

												This game looks like a soft X-COM clone. It's not overly complex and combat is fun, so if you're looking for a linear tactical turn-based game with a low barrier of entry, this might be a good choice. However, there is a very annoying lag going on every time you click something, and I can't recommend the game until this is fixed.UPDATE 04/30/2015: The game is easy to get into, but it's pretty challenging, which is a plus. It's not really fair to compare it to Shadowrun Returns, but if you're coming from SR, imagine that game without the role-playing aspects and with a total focus on combat (including online multiplayer capabilities). In fact, this game even succeeds in a few areas where SR/FD fall flat: I've played SR as a decker and was frustrated because my abilities weren't very useful in combat, but deckers in Shadowrun Chronicles have some pretty interesting skills to affect the flow of the battle and are way more fun to play than in SR.I don't really like the voices, but thankfully the developers allow us to mute the characters. Music fits the game pretty well up to now, I even lowered the sound effects (which are also good). The graphics are good but lack polish, as you'll see lots of clipping (it gets REALLY weird at times), but what really matters is the action, and it looks solid.Chronicles has a few rough edges, but the core of it (the combat) is fun, deep and works fine. There is still lag while I write this, but the developers are hard at work on the game and I believe this and other minor problems will soon be fixed. If you like turn-based combat games, like the Shadowrun universe and is not expecting much in terms of exploration and role-playing, you'll probably have a blast with this. It's still a ""not recommended"" because the lag is still a thing, but as soon as it's fixed I'll change this into a ""recommended"".			"

								This is a ruleset with loads of potential.  Whether it lives up to that or not will most likely depend on things outside of what we've seen in this Early Access appetizer.They don't hold your hand.  You've got big, stylized icons that are fairly intuitive, and most of the powers associated with your magic/weapons have useful tooltips with what you need to know.  The characters bark very quick recommendations for what you should be going for, but those disappear quite quickly and don't stick around in any obvious accessible format.  That's fine for right now, as the only elements that objects in the environment provide are 'will this give me cover' or 'can I shoot this'.  Movement options are done with a nice color-in-color effect to determine whether it'll take part of your character's turn or all of it, which is an appreciated touch.  So far, most objectives are go here, shoot things that are shooting at you, then shoot the things that aren't but can be targeted.  Nuanced morals-driven narrative delve into the Sixth World it ain't, chummer.  But for demoing the combat mechanics, we ain't asking for much.  The combat is brutal, bordering on arbitrarily cruel.  If you're outside of cover, you're likely gone in one or two shots.  One of the characters has an impressive damage mitigation power, but the cooldown/recharge is too long to rely on it.  Even in cover, 'shrapnel'/spall can eat away at your health, and sometimes cover just doesn't seem to help you as much as you'd think.  Enemies use it well, for the most part.  I dread the appearance of AoE spells or grenades in their toolkit.    Enemies have a nasty habit of spawning right on top of you based on event triggers, and since triggering the spawn is usually something that costs you your turn, this is a bad thing.  Overall, the missions seem like they want you to beat your head against a few failures so that you can go in knowing everything before you win; this doesn't bode well.  Hope this gets refined a bit more.  Do I recommend it?  That's a very tough call.  It's Shadowrun, and the team seems to enjoy the cyberpunk aesthetic and tactical combat.  It's a guarantee that I'll get it.  I'll have to hold off on recommending it for anybody else right now, though.			"

												Currently the game is definitely NOT worth it's full price. And I'm frankly appalled that they released it in the state it's in, because it isn't really a full game yet. My annoyance is further compounded by the fact that they did actually have an early access period, but were apparently unable to produce a full game upon release.The devs are working on the game's problems and adding content, so I hope I can change my mind about it later. But just how much later is currently indeterminable.			"

												I'm pretty iffy about this game in all honesty. As a massive shadowrun fan, I naturally bought this game (Deluxe package) with some pretty high hopes. The co-op is practically the saving grace for the title, even though I've never actually managed to play co-op with anyone other than my girlfriend. We ended up skipping through the side missions since we'd just get our asses kicked by swarms of enemies with no real tactics involved. The options are shallow entirely, from character customization to the abilities to level design. There is no depth, and I'm unsure where the meat of this game even lies.  All in all, if it didn't have the Shadowrun brand attatched to it, I'd be more accepting of the game, but it's pretty much just a turn based co-op game with limited stategy.Still, it's not without fun, and you'd probably have to hate turn based strategy games to completely dislike this game, and the cyberpunk setting doesn't disappoint.

								First off understand that i love the singleplayer shadowrun games, played through them several times. That said..This is an absolute failure, multiplayer is so horrid its not even comparable to the singleplayer games's mechanics.Character customization is non-existant, no skilltrees, no arsenal of weapons and spells to choose from, no racial differences besides body size and skin color.In addition, No dialogue, No story not even a series of mission or interesting challenges just a few very short maps.This game has received over 1mil in funding from several sponsors (excluding kickstarter). After almost a year in 'alpha' still no new content or added features like the aforementioned above.Phrases like; 'But its still in alpha/beta' Have been used too often now to justify lackings.I have been in over 20 pc alphas and betas and it has taught me that when a publisher slaps on the alpha or beta tag, they believe the game is nearly finished.What you see now is the core game upon which a development team MAY build on, I say MAY because there is no guarantee they will significantly add/change anything. They could very easily now just focus on bug fixing. Don't be naive, Don't be a dumb consumer, Do not support this blantant attempt at milking more money from what was their fanbase.Personally, before the start of alpha i paid only 10euro's to them to gain acces to the alpha, there were donation options leading up to 10.000 . That and experience caused me to be very cautious. I feel very disapointed, once again i made the mistake of hoping. Conclusion;They should have just added multiplayer functions to the singleplayer games.			"

												As a bit of background, I should be clear that I'm pretty into the Shadowrun universe and lore (I started with 4E and have been really getting into 5E as of late, as well as the HBS Shadowrun games). A buddy of mine and I have a weekend game day each Sunday and we were looking for something to try, so I pitched this game to him (I knew very little of it when I started out, other than ""hearing things"" that people had said about the state of the game). With that in mind, we started the main campaign together and hoped for the best.For my buddy, I'm pretty sure he had a good time despite him having little understanding of the Shadowrun universe. Myself, on the other hand... I fraggin' loved this game for what it tried to accomplish with the limited resources available.The best analogy I can give is that it's like X-COM with light MMO elements. Abilities have cooldowns or use mana (which regenerates per turn). Cover provides evasion bonuses, so position on the battlefield matters. Missions are based in instances and start off simple but ramp up in difficulty quickly (by the Infected! expansion, the difficulty spiked a LOT - can be a real sticking point for some players, but I enjoyed that the runs got more challenging and required more of a plan of attack). The story takes a while to get going, but once it builds its momentum it does a good job establishing the basis of the most recent craziness to hit the Sixth World.But the main feature that drew me in to the game (and why I'm leaving this review) was that it was a game that allowed me to share an experience with a buddy of mine together. If you're even slightly interested in the Shadowrun universe and have a buddy who is as well, and the two of you enjoy turn-based tactical gaming... then this game is a really good value for what you get out of it. I logged 50 hours - all of them playing with my gaming buddy - and we had a blast together every step of the way.The game isn't perfect, obviously. A lot of resources are reused, some interface and tooltip descriptions aren't clear, and there are occasional typoes here and there. But given what the developers had to work with in terms of funding... I really think the final product here exceeded my expectations. I really hope that I'll be returning to the shadows some day, whenever the next chapter unfolds.-Grimm "

												Early Access Review:This game is presently pre-beta.  There are some great ideas in combat, and the art direction is very good.  The camera, persepctive, and color is better, I would say, than Shadowrun Returns.  The grid-tactics style seems more well done than in SRR as well.  The writing is interesting, and the voice acting is quite good.All that said, there is almost nothing there yet.  There are two charactes, four maps, and no options.  There is really no taste of what this game will become.  I'm going to give this game a yes recommendation, because it can be great.  I believe that it will be great.  But for now, it's not great, because it's not really anything.  Once this game is even half finished, I think this will be worth your time.  The direction it's headed in is enjoyable, and there are lots of things to appreciate here.  The game itself just isn't one of them yet.  Keep your eye on it though.Post-launch review:Just some quick notes and changes on the former Shadowrun Online: SRChronicles is an intensely interesting concept for a game at its current stage.  The look is fantastic (better than sister game Shadowrun Returns), the tactical gameplay is solid, and the atmosphere is awesome.  Right now, the servers are laggy as a mug, but they're working to fix it, so that should improve reasonably soon.  The character customization is still a little light as well, but it's expanding from the beta in a good way.  The worst thing, at the moment, is the relatively light interaction avaliable from the characters or areas.  Shadowrun is a world filled with garbage and rats, but the streets in this game have almost no interactable environments at this point.  While the characters there are interesting and unique, they don't have very much to say or do right now.  Things are just a little to linear from a story standpoint.That aside, I still had a blast with this game.  Once it's a ltitle more lived in, I think this will be THE definitive modern Shadowrun game.			"

												Picked up for 1.5€. For playing through the base campaign, coop with friends (one is enough, each gets to pick and control one henchman as missions are 4 man coop), its a lot of fun. If you give the campaign a bit time to develop the story its actually well told. The story writing is not comparable to SR dragonfall or hong kong though. Nice and friendly community.Update: Playing through the base game campaign (all side missions), took around 25h. This does not include the challenge missions which become available after the campaign.Update2: Love that you can play all content/ get the achievments, even if you don't own the DLC(!); you just cannot be the player who hosts a DLC run. The infected or missions DLC runs represent some kind of endgame beyond just playing through the campaigns. There is enough endgame gear / vanity stuff to keep this endgame motivating.Update3: Needed 70h for 100% achievments. Last update.			"

Wonderful game all around...  except for the lag.one beef: my male characters have never gotten any skimpy clothing, but my female charater has received four (yes 4!) skimpy tops?!  Enough skimpy tops.  Where are some nice stomping boots?   biker gloves?  something that at least looks useful!p.s. if you eventually add crafting, and let me weave the skimpy tops into a hot pink full body armor (P 10 M 10 T 10), then all will be forgiven.

But, I must say that in this earliest of incarnations, that is true glimpse of greatness.  It is not my job to tell others to buy or ignore a game; It IS my job to inform those who may be on the fence about this game to do it.  You will enjoy the gameplay, the story-lines, the universe.

								I just bought the deluxe edition because I want to support anyone doing Shadowrun development. I think the others address the game mechanic issues and the game being a year late. My major problem however, is the ending. I litterally had to try it 40 times and then I just quite. Endings should be hard and death may happen (like Dark Souls Two.. and I died a few times in Shadowrun Returns: DMS), but in the kickstarter video this company claimed they had experience in making video games. If so, you should tailor the level of difficulty (when there are no med packs) and know a little bit about game theory. This game is fundamentally flawed. Why would you advertise a full 3D game (kudos on the art btw), and then lock the screen as if its 2D isomophic. I thought you were working with the Shadowrun Returns team? I wanted this game to work sooo much, but now I'm going back to hoping someone makes a GTA V Shadowrun mod this summer. You can't advertise open, persistent, player driven worlds when you can't even make an ending enjoyable for the average gamer (and actually I consider myself a hardcore gamer, so I'm not sure how many people actually beat the ending).

								So far this pre/early alpha seems very promising. Despite the small amount of content I had a blast for at least two hours. The setting, mission plot and chatter between characters seems very in keeping with the source material, even if the ork's voice is a bit irritating.The few bugs I encountered (chat window not scrolling correctly, game seeming to stall when changing to enemy turn (rarely) and the armour spell occassionally not  actually applying armour to it's target) are surprisingly few for an alpha or especially a pre-alpha game. A lot of the damage and cover mechanics seem unbalanced, but that is of course issues to be addressed in beta. I suspect you'll see a lot of reviews for this game in the coming day that sway between people praising it's potential and hoping it stays on track, like myself, and people who seem to buy every early access game and review them yet never come to understand that early access/alpha/beta means incomplete, test phase, ""things are going to be super broken, yo"" etc. So take those reviews with a grain of salt.TL;DR. It's fun and promising and gives me no reason to doubt it's eventual release, but it IS, as they state several times on the store page, a alpha game. Expect issues accordingly.			"

								Wow,I am really amazed about this game. When they announced a new shadowrun with an online focus I was pretty concerned that its gonna be a pay for win game like any other out there. But boy was I wrong. It rocks! Its tactical, tricky and pretty funny. The focus is pretty much on tactics and its very nicely balanced. I really got the oldschool vibes with the turn based combat mode and the well designed characters. Its nice to finally see a game where the characters are balanced and unique at the same time. And dont forget the best part, I mean the really amazing one: CROSSDRESSING!!!!!!!!!!!!Theres nothing like an open minded orc in a rocky-horror-outfit. Because hey, why not go on a killing spree while wearing something that looks like you stole it from a ladyboy. :)I really wished more games would have the courage of this one.Bottom line: Great game with a wicked touch and true to the shadowrun source material.

												If you are not familiar with the Shadowrun series, here's the basics: SRC-BL is a turn-based, tactical RPG in isometric view.If you're not into this kind of game then you might want to spend your time elsewhere.Also I write a lot, so if you're not into reading, then scroll down to the end and read the verdict (if you care, that is).Thanks for reading....Ok, so I'm 20+ hours in (40+ hours on my last update), and I think it's about time I write what I think about it.I am aware that Cliffhanger Productions is struggling, and there are enough people bashing the game already, so I'll try not to be too harsh.I don't know who had the idea of making a ""turn-based coop/MMO"" out of SR, but I don't really think that idea works.Me, for example, I play turn-based games like I play chess: I like to take my time and analyze the situation I'm in from every angle, going at my own pace.Also, I want to be in control. I like to call the shots, so to speak... I like to have a Shaman, a Spellcaster and a Rigger under my command, while I go fully Automatic.A team with 4 Autos? Doesn't work... Or one Auto and 3 Shotguns? Never.On the top of that, I really dislike the whole ""Coop"" thing with a passion. I'm a bit of a misanthrope when it comes to dealing with people in online games.So there's my rant regarding Coop, and most of all, regarding a game genre that just doesn't work as a Coop....Now back to SRC-BL...This is by no means an easy game to be played, especially if you don't have previous experience in tactical turn-based games.If this is your very first experience, then brace yourself for some angry moments. I'd recommend you first play Shadowrun Returns and/or Dragonfall in order to warm up and make the most of this one.In a nutshell, playing this game is all about what skills you bring to the battle. One class completes the other, and you cannot possibly win a battle with a 4 Autos or 4 Melees or 4 Spells team, and so on.At least one in your team should be able to dish out AoE attacks, also you should have one class capable of spawning extra NPCs (Rigger or Shaman). Even though Spirits and Drones are not that strong, they can still do some damage while alive and/or serve as decoys.Also, strategy: some maps favour a ""retreat to cover"" strategy, where it's best to draw enemies back to narrow passages or places where you can be better positioned so you can easily ambush them with AoE while concentrating attacks on the highest HPs.In large maps with little cover and mob waves, you might have to spread your team around or concentrate on the strongest mobs.Always pay attention on hit chance: it's better to hide or reload rather than waste a turn attacking an enemy with less than 50% hit chance.Finally, expect having to repeat the same runs over and over. It can be quite infuriating sometimes, but learn from your mistakes and see what works the best....Now for the +s and -s...The +s+ The game looks pretty good.+ Your character, and NPCs involved in main quests have their own voice overs, and the acting is pretty good, also the script is well written.+ It runs very well, no lags, no glitches, no crashes, etc.+ It plays like the previous SR by Harebrained Studios. So no gameplay learning curve.+ The AI can be quite tough at times, and enemy NPCs are usually one step ahead of you in terms of gear and power. Although they can also be quite dumb too, which works in your favor.+ Storyline is ok, obviously not an original formula (Deus Ex anyone?) and you can smell the plot twists miles away, but at least it fits the SR universe with their ""Iluminatti"" (dragons, in this case) and big corps struggling for power and population control/reduction/etc. The -s- No graphics adjustments and no changing key bindings. But hey, you'll be treated with 5 different adjustments for audio :)- Character skills are a bit misplaced if you ask me. Example, in ""Automatics"" there's a skill that gives you extra 3 hitpoints. I'm confused... shouldn't that be under ""Body""?- Weapon/Armor availability is terrible, sometimes you have nothing new for ages, then suddenly the vendors are flooded with good but expensive gear you can't afford.- No respec. You spent karma on the wrong skill, you're stuck with it.- Difficulty curve goes from gentle to steep between missions, not sure if that's a bug or a ""feature"". An example is the very last mission. More like you are fighting a god rather than a boss. So save your nails for that one.- There are no ""choice and consequence"" scenarios. My first character (""character"" I said, not ""toon[www.urbandictionary.com]""...) was a Auto, now I'm playing a Spell, and I am just skipping all dialogs because I know most of it from the top of my head. Plus, I'm not even talking to NPCs anymore (except when they have side runs), 'cause I know it's pointless and they won't have anything new for me.- The maps are pretty small and they are reused more than once in main/side missions. That and also the lack of ""choice/consequence"" mentioned above affects the replayability for me, in a pretty bad way.- No healing class. And no medpaks for sale at vendors. So save medpaks you either find or are rewarded with like you'd save your own.. ahem... ""chastity"" for that special someone. Or in this case, for that special NPC or even your own character.- Interface is unfinished and bugged. Example: you and two others finish their moves, then along comes the rigger who summons a drone. Everyone's ""move bars"" are filled up again, giving the impression that the enemies had their turn and then it's our turn again. Very misleading, but I got used to it now. Still, it's a bug. Other examples are: overlapped text on other elements, tiny text on certain parts that is very difficult to read.- Camera drives me crazy. You move a hench or a drone, for example, and have the camera at its destination because you want to see what's going on there. But instead of staying there, the camera moves back to the next hench. That gives plenty of possibilities for misclicking or even wasting your turn altogether. Plus, the way the camera keeps moving from one character to another across the map gives me eye seizures sometimes. Annoying.- Kill/Critical cameras. You can't disable them on the Settings. They last for ages. You can't take control while they are playing. It takes your view off the battlefield and you miss out on a lot of important stuff (like seeing who's got hit, who's dead, etc) while you are stuck watching the stupid camera angle. Very annoying.- Apparently, the henchmen (NPCs you can hire if you want to play solo) list is composed of other people's characters when they are offline, and they are scaled up or down according to your current level. That would be ok, if not for the fact that there aren't many people playing this game, so your choice of henchmen is a bit too limited. Me, for example, I have to always choose the same Spellcaster (Batshit), the same Rigger (Thunderb0tz) and the same Shaman (Angelica), because they are quite possibly the only 3 players who didn't go for either Automatics, Pistols or Shotguns.The verdictThere are a few bugs and annoyiances here and there, but nothing that is really game breaking.Weighing the +s and -s (and I know that there are way more ""-s"" in my list), this is still a pretty good game and you shouldn't miss it if you are a fan of the SR series.7/10			"

												I would recommend this game if you play with a regular group of people (perhaps with something like voice chat) and enjoy interesting characters and a decent story. Me and two of my friends have been playing it all week for several hours each evening and are still looking forward to finishing the storyline, so there should be enough content for all. Note that this is NOT as in depth as some RPGs, but it is still good for fun with friends.			"

												I have been a fan of the Shadowrun universe since shortly after the release of the Second edition PnP table top way back in the day. I ran my own campaign for years, and have played a few of the video games released for the universe. After playing the game for a few hours, it is unfortunate that I struggle to find any redeeming qualities to be had in order to give Shadowrun Chronicles a positive review.After loading up the game and starting, I was assigned my first mission and when choosing to go do it, I found myself stuck at a load screen for minutes unable to do anything but choosing an option to exit the game. I had to reload the game three times before the mission would actually load. A few hours in during a mission into a stadium, the game got stuck on the enemy's turn. I can only guess the cause was me closing a gate, trapping the enemy on the other side, and the game was stuck trying to process a way to have the enemy be able to path out of the enclosed room.Character creation is simple, though choices made are permanant, without the ability to respec. Considering Cliffhanger Productions decided to not use the standard stats and skills common to Shadowrun, but use a system of their own creation, this is quite the folly. Made a mistake with choosing one skill over another while leveling up? Too bad. Reroll the character. Character portraits are woefully limited, around four different onces per race. On a positive note, clothing customization is huge, and you can find more later on in game, at least allowing a unique look for youself.Voice acting is horrible. It sounded more like Cliffhanger opted to hire a highschool drama class, instead of actual voice actors. It does not help that the writing is mediocre.Combat is simple, and not overly challenging. This is not XCOM, or Valkyria Chronicles level of tactics here. Little thinking and strategy is needed in order to progress through a mission. Other than a few moments of bad luck with the RNG, my team made it through without a scratch.Though the game encurages co-op, you can use henchmen for solo play. About once an hour, hechmen are rotated on the roster, giving you a wide option. This would be alright, if it wasn't for henchmen being randomly assigned skills for your account. As such, I did not have a single one with the ability ""Organ Harvesting"".Graphics aren't that great. Normally, graphic quality doesn't bother me. However, especially when you zoom in, you can really notice the low rez textures. In general, this looks like a game that comes from the days of the PS1. Characters have blocky faces, hands that look like baseball gloves, and everthing look flat.Much like XCOM, Shadowrun Chronicles has a Action Camera that plays randomly when you're taking an action. However, the camera is poor here, and most times I found myself staring at a zoomed wall while the action happened.Sadly, due to my having purchased this game two months ago, it does not qualify for a Steam refund. To anyone else thinkng about getting this, I say look elsewhere for a good tactical game.			"

												THE shortest review in my, oh way too long, career:This game is cool!And this summons it pretty much... Never played table-top version, did played (and enjoyed) Dragonfall and Dead Man Switch, and this is different... but COOL!Cyberpunk. Archetypes. Intrigues. Multiplayer, if one wants it, or single-player, if preferred.EDIT: Cross over Intrigues. Perhaps in the future. I don't want this to be misleading, story IS linear.And MULTIPLAYER IS THE HEART OF THE GAME - community is probably THE BEST online community I've met. No badmouthing, all-knowing pre-teens who critisize your every move (both good and bad) - in short:MAJOR LACK OF TYPICAL ONLINE COMMUNITIES FLAWS.People will enjoy MP, and more importantly, it's done in such a way that player level (or skill, or experience) really doesn't matter - players are awarded for helping new players - furthermore, it's the main source of post-campaign character development.Original, continued:----------------------------Could go into a story-telling techniques, and how it's somewhat inferior to Dragonfall (and still adequate for a game, face it - how many good games you just skipped through dialogues) - but won't...Probably differs substantially from table-top and its strict codexes - to acheive balance for SP and not to rely on some game-master to 'honour' players choices - but doesn't matter...It's still in development process, but honestly - couldn't notice anything *seriously* lacking, so it will likely get better and with more options. Don't know about endgame yet - it is usually VERY important to me, but from what I understood, it's just started with first mission. I'll edit this later...[EDIT]:200+ hours of game and still can't get enough. Of the endgame, that is, campaign is not overly long, but HARD for a single player, and endgame is consisting of:a) helping new players to pass the campaignb) doing the challengesGame is updated, people would like it to be more often, but independent studios don't have the luxury of huge fundings. ""Game is not finished"" is a common 'reviewer' whine. It's not true. Game *could* have more content, *should* have less bugs - but it IS very, very playable and lots of people enjoy it. Me too.""Devs destroyed the balance"" is another common 'reviewer' whine. I put reviewer in quotes, cause my firm believe is that person writing it should know something about the balance. It's PvE game, some skills are better than others, but it doesn't matter. One doesn't find 100 exactly-the-same character 'as seen on youtube', and 50 of path-less-travelled and nothing else. Runners are colourful, skills are colourful, rebalanced from time to time to 'refresh' things a bit. And it's cool. If one stopped playing after 200h because 'dual-pistol doesn't do as much damage as it did, and something else now does more' (you can switch freely, by the way), that person shouldn't write about balance. Reason - lack of competence.And I am looking forward to each update. And not trying to break router if I disconnect. It happens, but the game atmosphere is relaxing, the coop players doesn't get mad (someone keep controlling your character, and can finish the mission, after which you can reconnect).Very relaxing, very friendly and relaxed community... Can't see when I'll get enough of it, really...Original, continued:----------------------------All this comes to one conclusion (and one not given lightly, not by yours truly):This game is cool!You could very well buy it, even for (or, indeed, BECAUSE) it's in development stage. There is a campaign, and free-character development, so it's worth at least a few replaying, even without endgame. Moreso, if engame proves good and satisfying. But I'll update this after some more playing...[EDIT]End-game is fulfilling enough to buy it immediatelly. After some legal/financial troubles, updates continued (hopefully, there won't be more such problems) and I know EXACTLY what I will buy for birthdays of friends who love similar games. One more thing - game doesn't suck out all your time:- typical mission 5-10 minutes (nothing forces you to continue after just one)- 'easier' challenge - 30 minutes- 'harder' challenge - 45 minutesAlmost as a phone pass-time game, yet so much more depth. Of course, nothing keeps one away from playing 16h in a session.			"

								Best Turn-Based Tactical Gameplay since XCOMSRO totally blew my expectations – not only does it look and feel great, the tactical combat is a huge achievement. It is a lot of fun to put together your characters and their skills to make a runner team that can blow the resistance away. AI enemies are smart but not unfair, so you will know immediately when your tactics improve. There’s a lot of skill combinations to experiment with and the versatile missions make time fly by. I am not a big fan of the original Shadowrun, but I am willing to get any Johnson out of drek, if it means playing another mission in SRO ;)			"

												I'm a Backer of SR:O/SRC from the early Days.Of course i love SR RPG(Pen&Paper) and of course the Promises in the Kickstarter Campaign i gave a lot of Money.There are a few Problems left but it is remarkable that the Projecthead communicates very well with the Community on the Steam Forums.I like the Game and how it plays!But be aware of the Fakt, that this Game is a turn based taktical Game, that takes plath in the World of Shadowrun 5th Edition.It is not Shadowrun 5th Edition as the Pen&Paper Game is.Nor is it Shadowrun like it is written in Novels.You have Skill-Trees to develop that enable Attack- or Support-Opptions.You have Cyberware-Like Augmentations, that effect the Hitpoints, the Damagerate, the Accuracy or the Skill-Chance of your Charakter.You have Weapons that effect the potential Damage you can deal. And this Weapons are Rated, so a high rated Weapon deals more Damage.You have only a few Spirit-types to summon and only a few Spells to cast.You have no Matrix.You have no Astralspace.In SR5 you have Attributes and Skillrating that effect the Skil-Cchance AND the Damage dealed.In SR5 there are no Weaponratings.In SR5 you have Augmentations that effect Attributes and Skillratings and more.In SR5 you have a dozen Types of Spirits you can summon and you have tons of Spells you can cast.In SR5 you have 3 Worlds, the mundane, the Matrix and the Astral Space.SR:C is a cool Game and it's fun to play.But it is not Shadowrun.The Atmosphere, the Dialogs and the Story are Shadowrun as it should be!!!But the Gamerules and the missing of two Major-Parts(Matrix and Astral-Space) make this Game to something that is not Shadowrun as it should be.I hope the Game will grow an become a good Shadowrun game in the Future...Regards  SnakeEye			"

												SC:BL is another turn-based isometric shadowrun game, but this time it's built around co-op.  Unfortunately this game is made by a different studio than the other shadowrun games of late and while their take on the classes is interesting, their balance between them isn't.  The game looks pretty good with the exception of the ragdoll physics, and the core gameplay is solid.  The music is absolutely standout, really harkening back to the shadowrun games of old.  Unfortunately there just aren't enough maps for the story campaign to not feel repeatitive, and the end game content is a brutally unforgiving series of challenges meant for people who have maxed out their character after a long grind replaying story missions with others.  Given the lengthy problems that the studio has had with the game as well as the disappointing sales of their first DLC, it seems unlikely they will ever add more content.  It's a shame, because this could have been quite a gem with a bit more development.  I can't recommend it at full price, but at $10 or less it's a fun experience.			"

												It's just not a good Shadowrun or Turn-based game...For the Shadowrun part of it:It's missing soo many weapons, spells, and other unique things that make Shadowrun. If you're going to roll as a Mage, you're going to really only have like 2 spells you use... Seriously... I don't mean you'll only pick 2 out of X. I mean really.. There's like 2 spells... In the entire skill tree. No sniper rifles like in Dragonfall.  There's just so much content missing from this game. It's like an Alpha version of Returns. And the story is just god-awful and uninteresting.  From the turn based part of it... It's just repetitive. Every mission is the same frikken thing. It doesn't function the way Returns/Dragonfalls' gameplay does either.  Action points are spent differently, and it kind of ruins it. I could go into more detail, and i could nit pick . But I just don't think this game is any good. I know the devs have other obligations, and they have limited funding... But this game isn't complete at all.  Multiplayer is also pointless. There's nothing unique here. It's a super repetitive, poorly designed turn based RPG with very little RPG, and a Shadowrun paint job. Dev's im sorry. But, you still have a lot of work to do.			"

OVERVIEWDisclaimer: I am a long-term Shadowrun fan and have played 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Edition P&P Shadowrun, as well as every computer incarnation of the IP that I have ever heard of. I am, without a doubt, a SR 'fanboi'.SC-BL is NOT what was promised in the Shadowrun Online Kickstarter Campaign. It is also NOT, in my opinion, a role-playing game. And it most definitely does NOT implement any of the official Shadowrun rules. It IS, however, a very fun turn-based strategy game in our beloved Shadowrun universe.==========================================================----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------==========================================================Graphics - The graphics in SC-BL are a mixed bag. The effects are nice, the interface graphic icons are consistent and tidy, and the level assets are mostly good, and generally exhibiting a Shadowrun-esque feel. Even the enemy models are pretty good, although without much variation.However, the player models are pretty disappointing, especially given the focus placed by the development team on player customisation. There's only a small number of character profiles to choose from, so you'll see each one multiple times while recruiting henchmen during the campaign, and very few of the plethora of clothing and accessory options actually look very interesting. Hands of the player models are particularly ugly.Sound - Music in the game is good, and most of the sound effects are decent as well. Voiceovers are, for the most part, awful, although the scripts are quite well written and with very few grammar errors.Gameplay - The game is split into two parts: a 'hub' area for dialogue with NPCs, gaining and completing missions, buying and selling gear, and upgrading your character, as well as very limited social interaction with other players online; and the mission / combat part of the game.The mission/combat side of the game is where you'll spend most of your time. If you've played any of the XCOM games, Jagged Alliance, Frozen Synapse, or anything like that, then you'll know what to do, but probably be a little disappointed by the limited options. Each mission has you controlling up to four runners, each equipped with two weapons (for human players) or only one (for NPCs). Each turn you can move once and attack or use an ability, or move twice. Abilities are essentially limited to buffs or debuffs, with limited summons available to shamans and riggers. Unfortunately the summons are not as effective as they could (or should) be, as a maximum of two summoned entities can be active at any one time, completely removing any options for all-rigger parties, for example.I attempted to play multiplayer -- one of the big draw cards of this game when compared to the more traditional Shadowrun RPG games from Harebrained Schemes -- but after spending hours hanging around in the 'lobby' area, posting various 'LFG' messages to chat and inviting others to join in my games, I was unable to join up with even a single other player. This aspect, then, was rather disappointing, although from what I can gather the gameplay is essentially the same, just with a another human PC in place of one of your hired henchmen.PROS AND CONSPros:+ It's a Shadowrun game, in the Shadowrun game world, with magic, and orks, and dragons, and cyberwear, and guns, and drones, and decking ... oh no, wait: it doesn't really have decking.+ Some of the levels are nice and well thought out+ Reasonably good balance between most character type makes multi-displinary teams funCons:- Only two summoned units allowed in the party (in singleplayer, at least). WTF!? Why can my rigger only summon her two drones if the shaman hasn't happened to summon her bear spirit? That doesn't make sense!- It's not Shadowrun Online. It's not a MMOG. It's not a roleplaying game and doesn't implement Shadowrun rules.- Almost everything boils down to just another attack or another way to pick locks; decking is just another weapon that may as well just be a stun gun, hacking is just another % chance to open a door.- No real 'end game'.- Repeated levels/maps used over and over again through the singleplayer game.- Character customisation at first seems quite varied, but everything sort of looks the same, so it's actually not that great.- Doesn't cope at all well with network issues -- a few seconds of disconnection and the mission freezes up, requiring a restart, with no way to reconnect to the mission or recover your progress.- no deckingCONCLUSIONI waited a long time to try Shadowrun Chronicles - Boston Lockdown (SC-BL for short). I ummed and ahhed about backing it on Kickstarter when it was still to be Shadowrun Online, and after the first year of updates on Steam and seeing where the game was heading I was very glad that I hadn't outlaid my hard-earned dollars. I had written off the game before even playing it, and that was a mistake.I wanted to wait until reaching the end of the campaign and at least trying the limited end-game material (two repeatable arena challenges) before writing this review. I also wanted to play multiplayer, but I was unable to find anyone who would accept any of my invites or invite me, so from that aspect at least, it doesn't look good. But there's a fair bit of content in the campaign and I had a lot of fun playing it by myself, regardless.Am I disappointed? Yes, sure; I really wanted the Shadowrun Online that was promised.Is this a good game anyway? Yes, definitely!7/10 "

												There isn't a class system, wich is a good thing, but spend your Karma carefully. The story is well written, make sure you talk to the NPCs after each run if you what a full picture of the story.  Try different henchmen to get an Idea of what playing with other skills could be like.  If I had to give my favorite type of character it would be pure rigger, but that is just me.

												This games server is crashed in its first day of release lol. It should have explain a lot, simply dont buy it.The sentence above...You know i am usually pretty stubborn about this kinda things and i hate doing beta testing for developers. But let me tell you this after this review one of the developers gave  response with a pretty mature attitude and did some explaining, Its laggy and buggy for now but also pretty enjoyable ""if"" you can play it. So No harsh decisions, maybe i dont know enough to make judgements about this game yet.  They are trying for their game and for their community			"

It's action oriented, turn based cooperative shooter (but you can play solo using henchmens available for hire as I did), so if you're looking for RPG experience you'll be dissapointed (in this case pick one of HBS games - Shadowrun: Returns or Shadowrun: Dragonfall.

												well I see these guys bashing the game with less than 10 hours  on it, complaining about the lag, the story, well got 132 hours on the game now and the Devs seem to have  whipped the lag problem with  a marathon session of patchs that shows they care about their game and their players. This alone gets a thumbs up from me. I've really enjoyed playing the game solo and even more with other players espically when they present different ideas to completing the various missions. I like the idea that we can try out different builds for each character and class and to see how they work with others. So far the game for me has been a excellent gaming time. I look forward to see what else the Dev's have in store for us in the future. I recommend this game esp. if you like the Shadowrun Universe and tactical turn based combat. "

												I picked this up back when it was still called Shadowrun Online. I've watched it change and evolve into the current game that it is. It is a decent tactical turn based game. If you liked Shadowrun Returns this is like a striped down version of that game. It is a mission based MMO with a hub. You build your character from a selection of skill trees using up to two weapons skill sets at one time. It has as vary basic cybernetics and gear progression. Over all the game is vary fun and easy to get into. The only draw back at this time is the limited options which is something that can always be added to after lunch. Right not there is an bit of an issue with lag. But the Devs are being vary open and verbal with us as to the state of the game. It is nice and it shows they care about how the user base feels and are focused on making this game the best they can.If you are ok with some lag then I say this is a good deal as it is.			"

								For an early alpha, I think they've done a pretty decent job. Yes, there are some issues, mostly lack of depth, but what do people expect? The basic mechanics are workable. There's a couple of things I'd like to see added, but those will likely come later as we get closer to beta anyways so I'm not complaining.The challenge level seems about right; not too easy, not too frustrating, just difficult enough to keep you engaged and interested. Overall, I am fairly impressed by this first showing. I see potential, and don't regret Kickstarting this game, even if it is a bit behind schedule. They may not have delivered ontime, but if this is any indication, they intend to deliver something that is worth the wait.			"

The fact the the game is episodic is a pleasant surprise. I look forward for more. And I have played only solo so far. I can't wait to bring my old Tabletop mates to play the campaign co-op. The dev's goal of emulating a tabletop SR campaign, with streamlined/simplified rules/gameplay, as befits a computer game, is reached. WIth further content and tinkering, this is going to be a great game.If you're a Shadowrunner oldtimer, very recommended. "

												OK, here is my abbreviated review of this game. I might come back with more later.First; this game is having issues at launch, lets get that out of the way first. Second; even with the lag it is a fun and engaging game. When the fix the lag it will be pretty awesome.I would recommend it at about the 25-30 dollar price point right now, they should keep the sale going until they get the lag worked out, but ultimately it is a good tactical game. The single player experience is fun, but the multi-player is even better. Once the get the lag figured out, it will be worth the 40$ asking price with room to spare.The real challenge will be the end game / new stories.			"

												Shadowrun Chronicles is more than the sum of its parts.  You can play single player or multiplayer, but the multi-player aspect is where the game really shines.  It is a nice refresher from other MMORPG because being turn based, there doesn't seem to be as much of a focus on DPS etc.  The game is fairily short, but has a lot of replay value (again because of the multiplayer community).  The storyline is pretty good, though not as in depth as other RPGs.  This works out well because it gives plenty of room or mulitplayer interaction.  There is more content planned for release (hence the ""Chronicles"" part of the title) which would expand it even more.  While no reflection on the quality of the game itself, the company is at present having some issues which will undoubtably slow down the update of content, but the company has also said that the game will continue to be supported, even though they have to cut down the staff working on it.

 How to spoil a great license. Just no, absolutely no. Very very disappointing game. First of all, you need to stay connected all the time, even if you want to play single player... the character creation definitely sucks, poor mechanics, no depth, meeh graphics, no actual roleplaying, an uninteresting story, the voice acting is bad and dull, and horrible and... no real strategy here, very frustrating experience with a nonsense hardness, the chance of winning are based on luck and not in your skill. It is not well balanced, percentages without any sense (being in front of an enemy with a 40% success rate, flank it and still have a 40%. This is a common thing), bad technical decisions, not very fun (ok, you can enjoy, a bit, the strategy in co-op)... and of course this is not Shadowrun, this is a generic turn based combat game with the Shadowrun name attached on it to call the attention.The developers have not known how to do it and still don't know. A promising game totally wasted. Many improvements needed to make it a game that worth your time and money.			"

												It's a very engaging turn-based strategic combat game. You have a number of background options when making your character, and then when you gain Karma from missions, unlock elements of the skill trees with that. The missions are not very easy, which keeps them interesting - I tried one mission 5 times with one setup, and failed, then switched a hired gun for a hired hacker made all the difference. Each skill tree basically has an associated weapon type: Blunts, Blades, Handguns do what you'd expect, but then you have Sumoning Foci and Channeling Foci for shamans and mages. However this means any character can use anything, only with as much proficiency as their allotted skills in that given weapon's skill tree allows. Weapons progress in power as you progress through the game, as does cyberware.Making teams is presently mostly over global chat, and goes quite well (although some people report being able to invite others, but being invited fails). There are layers of chat - Global, which is everyone on, and Hub, which is everyone on your particular ""version"" of the city's hub where other runners are between missions.   The voice acting is good, but odd (the opening voice lines sometimes sound like they were amateurs, but then the actors got better as the recording session went on or something). The music is nice, though some more sound assets for blown-up robotic enemies would be nice as well. Visually it's quite rich and evocative of the environments depicted. The story isn't spectacular but it's the ""main"" campaign for now with others planned for later release. Cons: - Once you've done the missions, you know where everything is. I don't think a MMO/(actual)RPG is a thing. - There are (as of May 4) still lag issues, which I'm only mentioning because it wouldn't be a helpful review otherwise. The developers have made a long statement about it and what they are doing about it. During some hours it's not that bad (nighttime NA).With it going on sale after release there is little reason to wait to purchase it (assuming a turn-based Shadowrun-set team game interests you) because of the lag - just wait to play it if it gets too much. I just mention this because this is an online game with no subscription fees, or in-game purchasables, whose developers made a mistake in their server tests. It bothers a certain contientious side of me to think all the time and investment into the game and its infrastructure would lose out to vocal consumers that expect flawlessness in every way from a small game company that has turned out a high quality product in all other aspects.Edit: Lag is fixed!

												Updated for InfectedThe new DLC Infected adds tremendous to the game. Not only are the levels now huge, also tactical challenges and skills increased. Most fun I had in this so far. New addon contains finally bioware so your character can switch between mage and guns and overall the rebalance adds a new layer of tactics and fun to the game. Finally default mana skills are 0 cost and most guns got 1 or 2 new skills. Excellent !!! Those Technomancers are a new twist to the enemies!---------------------------Most fun I had in a long time in a tactical turn based action game. This has everything - shadowrun, cyberpunk, skill system and very well designed runs. Graphics are fantastic, but still runs on older hardware. Mission length is also manageable and developers put a lot of detail into story and design. 100% recommended!Yes - there have been issues at launch, but so far the development team has handled everything in a very dedicated and fast manner. Looking forward to the next updates and to see you in game.Soon there will be pets too !!!			"

								The Shadowrun universe is a great setting for an online mission based RPG.The game as is (29. August 2014) is pretty barebones and doesn't contain much content - a few combat-missions and a combat focused campaign. I wouldn't recommend buying this game as it is now - but backing the game is something you should consider.I would love to see the roleplaying and multiplayer aspect of this game to be developed on - features like decking, the astral plane, charisma and stealth are very important in this setting. Another thing that this game is totally missing is the off-time of Shadowrunning - laying low as to loose heat, contacts and exploring. It would be nice to see the posibility to handle situations in many different way - there is no non-lethal way to complete missions right now, and no charisma-archetypes like in the original roleplay systems where you would need a fully rounded party with a facer, decker, rigger, street samurai and magician.The developers would be doing the game much good by expanding the meta-phase and maybe aiming to be similiar in some ways to Divinity Original Sin.

								I'm a TT Shadowrunner from the first edition days until I had to ""grow up"".  Recent events have shown me that I need a little escape now and then, and I was thrilled when I found Shadowrun Online!  Before you read all the negative reviews, let me say that this game ha A LOT of potential.  It has a long way to go, but the foundation is good.  As of this writing the fourth update was just released, and from what I can tell, the in-game combat resolution is about there for the basic weapon/spell types.  The artwork is great, and the music is spot on.  I feel confident that I will recommend this game when it's done.All that being said, the development has a long way to go on the peripherals that are going to make this a great game:  the away-from-combat storylining, the character customization, and just general depth that can (and I'm confident) will be incorporated.  Right now this feels more like an alpha release than an open beta, so if your looking for an immersive Shadowrun experience, I'd give them some more time.  I you're passionate about Shadowrun though, get in here and let's help these guys out in creating what could become a fragging awesome title!These guys need our ideas and encouragement!			"

												Yup, the game is fun. It is simple turn based Shadowrun goodness.  The game is linear. Don't expect any open world areas to explore. You have a tiny hub area where you pick up quests that will send you to specific story locations. I am playing it in COOP with a buddy and it is entertaining. It is filling a void that Divinity Original Sin has left behind. That being said, it is no where near as good at D:OS. But it is fun, turn-based, COOP tactical gameplay and there isn't too much of this around these days. I am happy I bought it. Would do it again.			"

								Heyyo, Shadowrun Returns got me excited for Shadowrun Online which is being made by a different company but uses a lot of the same formulas and so far the Early Access has been pretty good... hopefully the campaign turns out as fantastic as Shadowrun Returns.			"

												As a disclaimer, I played this game a bit during early access and I didn't like it. It had no features or content and the interface was pretty bad.Well, that game is gone, and in its place is a title worthy of a spot next to Shadowrun: Returns. While the writing and plot in the base campaign of Boston Lockdown isn't stellar, it's definitely Shadowrun, and the tactical combat is more than worth it. Cliffhanger did well, and I'm glad I backed this game.			"

												Finally a Shadowrun game that you can play online with your friends (or total strangers). The storyline is engaging, character development is fast and not too complex while still giving you a lot of options. The missions are challenging and the only thing I am really missing is PvP (which is supposed to be available in a future patch).All in all I am very happy with the purchase (I got the game in early access, but never played it a lot during that phase). Would recommend to anyone that likes turn-based strategy games and of course the Shadowrun IP.			"

												been a digital SR fan since SNES. leading up to the release of Boston, and thro it, i was scared to purchase this game. i thot it didnt look dark enough..too cute or something, idk..so it wasnt until recently that i decided to bite what i thot might be a bullet and try it out. i So deeply regret not doing it sooner.best and worst part of the game is the community. good because there are absolutley no toxic players at all. (i could not believe it). they are very helpful and knowledged of the game. the bad part of the community is there is not much of one. prob due to no future updates and content etc.. so this means you can play all day and night but there will be gaps of time where coop might not be an option bc no one is online or are busy.you can play solo or coop thro the story and the DLC campaign. game is more difficult doing it solo bc you will need to hire henchen instead of real people with more skill and options. good challenge solo but prob more enjoyable with coop.tons of replayablity with different character classes and backgrounds. fair steam achievements. and good new friends.there is no overwatch but you will get over it fast : )			"

												I've been psyched to play this game from when I first heard a dev team was working on this. It was a dream come true! I remember anxiously waiting for 2 years for a multiplayer shadowrun. I been a long time fan of shadowrun since i first discovered it during the 90's. Naturally everything I say will be positive of anything shadowrun related. This game however had a bad first impression as people began flooding into the servers on full public release. The dev team could not fortell how badly people have been wanting to play this, and thier servers could not handle the strain of so many people flooding in. Which made the game hub very laggy and unreliable. The graphics are not on par with most big title games, but visuals never mattered to much to me. And today you could probably get on and find the servers almost barren save for the average shadowrun fanboy/girl. the skills are not perfectly balanced but its still fun to try different character builds out. it lacks any character interaction with the story other than the end where they let the players take a global survey which choice will be canon in the next installment. I still like to get on and try to make a meager existence in the boston lockdown, so see you in the shadows chummer!			"

												Many reviews will speak of lag and gameplay issues with negative context - and yes it was a serious problem for the first handful of days post-launch.  The devs have put in workarounds in place to keep the game very functional and playable while they address the root issues in code.This game is a very straightforward and enjoyable tactical-turn-based (4x without micromanagement) action game with some RPG elements tossed in.  The story is rich in Shadowrun classic themes, and for nostalgic types, you'll get that giddy sheen you can expect from a cyberpunk themed game.  If you're used to Shadowrun RPG rules, some of the mechanics might throw you for a loop, but it doesn't take away anything from the game.The best part of the game is the co-op system.  It's fast and easy and doesn't have any crazy dependencies.  You just find-a-friend, party up, and go on a mission.Just be careful you don't start a run when there's 5 minutes left on the reboot clock!			"

The game have a very basic tutorial that only help people who never played turn based strategy games and don't explain the features of the game. Maybe worth something for the fans of Shadowrun series.This game have not appealing. The missions are very boring and don't make me feel playing a strategy game. I will not talk about pros & cons, have lot of other reviews that cover it well and I not played enough to do a good one.			"

												Captures the spirit of Shadowrun, and is a ton of fun both as a co-op title and as a single player campaign.For turn-based fans, you may find that it lacks a few of the mechanics that we're used to (Overwatch, stances, etc), but these have been sacrificed for a faster game-play experience, and the game is better off for it. It's fast, it's easy to play, and it really shines with 3 friends running with you.A lot of users are concerned with lag atm, but these devs certainly wear their hearts of their sleeves, and the roll-outs of patches and lines of communication from them is frankly some of the best I've seen, especially considering the small team responsible for this love letter to the universe.The in-game community is fantastic, and you'll rarely want for someone to help you out/go on a run.There's tons of customization options for your 'runner if you like Digital Barbie (and who doesn't!), and the freedom of choice to build a character how you want is a breath of fresh air in these times of class-based, cookie-cutter action-RPG's.But it's the smaller things that have captured my heart. Although the game is never in danger in winning any Graphics of the Year rewards, the attention to details in the levels is something special. Glass blows out of windows as the concussion of a grenade hits them. Car alarms echo down the road if cars are shaken by explosions. Steam jets out of pipes when a stray round hits them. Music from a nightclub fades the further you pan your camera away from the door.

												I love cyberpunk and I love Shadowrun universe, so after having played the Shadowrun games from Harebrained I decided to give this game a shot. I've heard a lot of complaints about it concerning constant lagging, bad optimization, poor graphics and such. Well, all of that is true to some extent but this certainly isn't a bad game. In fact, at the moment I've spent over 20 hours playing it and am going to play it more. This should give you an idea of an approximate length of the base game without expansions. The game is quite self-explanatory and I had a lot of fun creating and customizing my character. Plus, it allows you to play it in a co-op mode with 3 other people which is a totally different experience from when you play it on your own. All in all, it is a decent game for the price,I bought it when it was on sale and it's totally worth the money.			"

												When I first heard about this game, I figured that the bar would be set pretty high for it. Alas, it was not. After having played Shadowrun Returns, Dragonfall and Hong Kong, I have to say that I was not impressed. The upgrade/skill/ability tree system felt pretty dumbed down and kinda underwhelming. The aesthetic gear/clothing was an interesting touch, but after a point I stopped caring about it. Though, the duplicate aesthetic items were both pointless and annoying. As for strategy and tactics, it didn't feel like it was there. Although, I was expecting something along the lines of the last title with this game. Basically, load out with class types only mattered so much. If you didn't know what to expect, bring a decker and a ranged class along for certain. Especially if the mission had lots of machine/drone type enemies, and you chose to be a mage of anykind.Definitely glad I got this when it was on sale for cheap. Between Black Friday and Cyber Monday, I believe.			"

												For fan's of Shadowrun the storyline is great and the gameplay is it's self is allot of fun. The Infected DLC extends the storyline by a few missions and is a nice ramp up in difficulty but almost requires co op to complete. The Missions DLC gives players 4 repeatable hourly missions and a chance to acquire substantially better gear but doesn't do much in regards to the storyline.Replayability is a bit limited and certainly get's stale fairly quickly once you run out of story missions to work on. If you enjoy tactical turn based game play and / or you're looking for a dose of Shadowrun the base game is without a doubt a great buy. Just don't come into this expecting to be playing for month's on end and you wont be disapointed.			"

												I've been playing Shadowrun for years now. From 1E to the SNES version to SRR to this. When SRR came out I played through it and thoroughly enjoyed the gameplay. What I wished for was co-op gameplay and Boston Lockdown provides that. Now, as far as combat goes it's about like SRR - point-and-click with some strategy and I will say the difficulty is a bit harder in this one (which I like). The only thing I don't like is that if I want to play single player I can't go offline and play the game. It won't work without being online. I mean, it's a live co-op so I it makes sense. I just wish that it could have an offline mode so you can play the game in case your 'net goes out or something. But to me that's the only drawback. That being said, I only have one character which is a decker. The class (or skilltree. Whichever) is pretty well done. I wouldn't know about any of the others as of yet. But all in all, as an avid player from start to now, I give this game a positive review. What can I say? I like it.			"

												It's a very solid foundation for what could one day be a fantastic game. The skills are perhaps overly streamline and the atmosphere/storytelling thin on the ground for a shadowrun game (two area's in which this one would profit if they lifted some influence from the harebrained schemes shadowruns) but it's enjoyable and somewhat gritty non-the-less.At the moment, it's an adequate game, but I give it a positive review in the hopes that more people will buy a copy and it can grow into a good game or a great sequel.5/10 for the game as it stands8/10 for the potential that it's reaching for.

								Ok, here we are, about 6 months from my last view of this game, and it definately feels like they got it all together after scrapping the previous code. The rename only works in favor, as this is not an MMO, it is simply multiplayer. There is still plenty of work to do, but things in general are on the upside.Not many games have been able to impress me with this kind of reversal.			"

												The main campaign is quite fun and well worth playing and the end boss is one of the most interesting fights I remember on a turn based game.The story may not be great but I really enjoyed the combat and for me that's more important than any story. Unlike many may think you won't miss overwatch on this game, it plays really well without it.Although the multiplayer is a big part of this game I tried it but honestly prefered to play solo with henchman because that gave me the oportunity to control the full party and play with diferent characters and builds instead of just my own character, but overall the multiplayer is well done and no longer has any technical issues like some people reported earlier when the game was released.Despite having enjoyed the campaign quite a lot the game was clearly designed with endgame in mind and tbh I think that's where it fails miserably.The endgame repeatable missions are tedious and there's no real reason to do it except if you want to see how far you can push your character build. Rerolling to try other builds is suposed to be another replayability route but I don't see any reason to do it because the missions and the maps will be exactly the same and since I played most of the game solo I already got to play all available archtypes by recruiting henchman.Overall I give this game a thumbs up because despite it's flaws the main campaign offers a very good tactical turn based experience and unless XCOM is all you'll ever want to play then Shadowrun Chronicles is a good alternative for some solid 30h of fun.It's certainly not worth the retail price though, so wait for a sale :)I also bough the Infected campaign but to be honest it didn't feel as good as the main one, so I would recommend you skip that. Just get base game for 6€ and enjoy the main campaign, skip all DLC.			"

												Update (2015-05-10): No more lag now! I have removed the part about Lag in my review.Pros- Shadowrun feelings and lore well done. This is really a Shadowrun game, not a tactical game playing the cyberpunk card.- Missions are fun and some of them have nice twists to maintain the interest.- Solo mode is perfectly possible, playing coop is not mandatory. Some people complain that the henchmen (the people running with us during a mission) are weaker than the players, but it does not prevent me to succeed and have fun.- Customization of the character is a nice touch.- Developpers are pretty open and talktative in the community, so we can expect some nice updates and support for this game.- This is a funny and nice community. I am not a coop or MMO player at all and I was not that happy at first that the coop aspect was in the game. After a few chats and a few runs, I can say that I am happy with that point now. I still prefer solo game, but coop is okay in my newbie book.Mixed- Story : As I've said, nice Shadowrun feel for the whole game, story, character, etc. But it's not a strong story ride as in Dragonfall.Cons- Lack of some features. In the near future, some changes/additions should be make : a more complete character sheet, a little more NPC's to talk to, log/journal of previous missions/side-missions and story evenments so we can look back at what has be done (can help to choose an appropriate mission when looking to play coop), possibility to do re-runs for certains missions (probably the more heavy-fighting ones, so people just not farm on and on the same 2 easy missions). - Music. It does not compare to the awecome soundtracks of Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall. It is not bad, it fits the game and setting well (some missions have quite good music actually), but since music is a major aspect of my enjoyment in any game, I had to put it in the cons columns. YMMV, I realize this is not an important point for everyone.Conclusion : Adjust your expectations accordingly (this is not Dragonfall or Shadowrun Returns and it's not a full MMO) and you will be quite satisfied with the game. I know I am and I am having a great fun playing it. Fortunately for me, the game can be played both solo and coop, so I can play whatever I want.			"

In time they could have delivered if you had verbaly supported them!Ofc we would love more variety than shot to kill but considering the failed start they had with the game as well as the small dev team they have had post release we are content with what we have.My thanks for the dev team for working on half or no wage to make the first release and update possible! Your effort did not get lost on us! Our collective thanks to you all!!!			"

												The server issues have been dealt with, taking care of the biggest problems with this game, leaving a fun co-op experience.Are there some issues? Sure. But it's a lot of fun to stomp through missions with a group of friends. This is not meant to be played as a solo game, enjoyment is optimal with four defective characters stumbling through a run, with the male troll putting on ladies' clothing and smoking a cigar, and the mage ""accidentally"" hitting the street sam with a manaball.  Again.ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS:Shadowrun Chronicles has massive server issues. If the hamsters running around in the server haven't been poked in the last hour or two, there's some massive input lag.That said, this game is a blast.It's a very simplified take on the Shadowrun rules, but it works. Co-op is a ton of fun, and they have the ""feel"" spot-on.And it takes place in Boston. That's wicked awesome.Should you get it? If you like co-op games and can either tolerate the servers being on fire or can wait a couple of weeks for them to get them functioning clearly, yeah, it's one of the better ones.Oh, and you should absolutely play with a ""if you find a cosmetic item on a run, you MUST wear it on your next one"" rule. It's important, trust me.			"

												Imagine a role-playing game without any roleplaying in it at all.Imagine X-Com with all the tactiacal choices removed, instead all you can do is move and attack, then wait for the enemy to move then attack.Imagine X-Com without any useful items your charcater can use other than his primary weapon and a pistol.IMagine X-Com without being able to see any meanful information about your squadmates.That is how I would describe Shadowrun Chronicles.Imagine a shadowrun game that does not feel like it is anyway related to is source.Buy Harebrained games instead, they may have their faults but they are much better than this!

												This game is the definition of 'mixed feelings'.Pros:- Character customization is great, you have tons of options- Very challenging, some missions will require a lot of gunning&running, some will require careful planning.- Great community, easy to find groups, easy to get answers.- The story is great (to everyone complaining that it's linear...well, returns, dragonfall and hong kong are also linear and I don't see you screaming about it)...Cons:- Lack of polish. Many very basic sistems are not implemented (whispers, ressurection...).- Lack of endgame. Not a lot of things to do once you finish infected.- The decker\hacker is just another spellcaster\ranged-controller. No matrix to be seen.Its not a roleplaying game per se, but it's a good game. You don't have dialogue choices until the very end of the first campaign, but if you are looking for a tactical cyberpunk experience, this game is worth it.Overall, if you can get a friend to play with, you will have a great time.

This game is a sorry shadow (pun intended) of what is actually a very cool concept and the others (I realise not the same companis that produced it). But silly quirks which are meant to make it fun and interesting just make it tedious.Choose another turn based RPG as this is rather 2-dimensional. Sorry to say it.

												Firstly, the game is having serious lag issues and problems right now, you *will* experience this and it will be frustrating, the current resolution is restarting servers every 2 hours so watch for messages announcing this to be sure you're not mid run. (as of May 7, 2015)Edit: Lag is far better as of May 22nd!Now, that said, the game itself is excellent. Story is interesting (if railroady) and makes it well worth talking to everyone to see what they have to say and how things are effecting people, the actual runs are really good, as the game goes on and you get deeper into it they become progressively harder and require more thought and tactics from you. These runs can be solo the entire game using hired runners or if you prefer, you can recruit friends or people from chat to run with (thus far this seems exceptionally easy to do so, people are always open to running something). The combat is interesting and fun, the skill trees give you a feel of actually learning new stuff mostly and whilst focusing on one or two is rewarded with more powerful skills it's still very workable to be a jack of all trades and pick from many trees to get a good all round build.Overall, definitely recommended and worth it if you enjoy Shadowrun, best with friends but good regardless.

Give this game a try.You want a fun turn based combat game? Definitely give it a try.You want a good, entertaining, story with some good voice acting? This game is for you.You like Shadowrun lore?

												Shadowrun Chronicles is a nice, fun game that I came to enjoy a lot - although it took me some getting used to.I bought this game just after finishing Shadowrun: Dragonfall and did not like it at first. It is a very different game and although set in a Shadowrun-like universe, there are noticeable differences. The integration of Decking/Hacking as another form of ""real-world"" combat instead of a standalone matrix probably being the most striking example.Nevertheless, after playing the game for some time I adjusted my view and moved away from expecting it to deliver a sucessor for Dragonfall. And I started to really enjoy Chronicles: It is a fun, fast-paced, round-based coop game with a strong Shadowrun flavor. I quickly came into the ""just 5 more Karma, only one more run"" mindset that then means another hour of playing.Sure, there are still many issues with the game: The worst lags are gone by now, but there are still lots of things that feel somewhat incomplete (e.g. some stats can nowhere be checked, some descriptions are not very precise etc). The developers, however, do a great job in communicating with the players and I am quite confident that they will continue to significantly improve the game!Bottomline, despite some negative points, the game is fun to play and therefore gets my recommendation!

												I've been really enjoying this game.  I think it used to be Shadowrun Online?  It's not the same makers of the first two games, so the graphics are a little rougher but it still feels like the same universe to me.  I still enjoy the combat and story and feel of the shadowrun world and it feels like a continuation of the other games even though it's from someone else.  The combat is very X-com except I wish you could set up ""cover fire"" or automatically fire on someone who runs in your path with a play use.  But that's just a personal gripe.  I don't get why some of the other runners find this game THAT inferior to the others...  Just go in expecting it not to be a Hairbrained game and you should be fine.  If $40 is a lot of money to you, which I totally understand it being, it is to me, and you don't LOVE shadowrun you might want to pass this one up but I really love all things shadowrun (Shout out to Harmontown for playing it live every week!) so this was worth it to me.

For me it's worth every cent spent on it and every single minute I played it.Even with small team and many issues developers are trying to take into account maximum player suggestions.And as I mentioned before the game has the best community I've ever seen in games.

												So people seem to forget this game just came out of early access and is in beta. This means there will be bugs and unseen problems that were not expected. The real DL about this game is the game potential and the developers are actually communicating. Did i buy this game because i played shadow run dragongall and shadowrun returns? sure. This game while the combat can be compared to X-com should not just be based on that. This game is still in beta and I am sure the developers have a lot more ideas and plans ready or in their thoughts. So let us begin. Pros: Nice action based combat and a nice story so far.Decent customize options even if i am tired of getting the same clothes multiple times. Combat does require some thinking so you dont get geeked from the start.Cons:There is a slight lag problem but the developers are working around the clock to fix the influx and server problems.story is linear with side quests. I would like to see it more open world ish maybe a personal node we can use as our own base to invite friends. Maybe at a later date?So in summary does this gem need polishing? sure but that comes with time. Is it a fun game with a good community, Yes absolutley I have not seen a problem of people cussing out others for mistakes and getting the mission failed. Would i pay to buy this game? yes and i did when it was a early access game because of the love for this franchise and type of rpg. People who wrote negative reviews sure they are entitled to their opinions, albeit wrong and their hours ingame show they havent spent enough time to actually evaluate the game. I rate the game a 8/10 I enjoy it while i play it and once the lag problem is fixed it will easily get a 10/10			"

												Adding a bit of inovation to Shadowrun, some might think it is even more simplistic than it was, with less items and possible actions, more generic missions, but that is replaced by permanent possibility to play with other players. You can take some grunts with you, but it is far better to play with other people. It is very easy to join other players, or for them to join your game and this element makes it better for those who want cooperative tactical mission action.			"

												Great Fun game if you like a bit of tatical combat, x-com style... but better ... cause you and your buddies each control a single character..... well that kind makes it better for me :PThough if it is your cup of tea you can go by yourself and hire hencheman to help you controling everyone if you rather play it ""singleplayer"" so to speak.Now if you know the universer and are a Shadowrun fan......welll then you probaly already bought the game XDThe game just came out of early acess as of this review so, lauch day problems abound, one specifc that annoys me that it seens that there is no provision to whisper/PM anyone.But that aside still healla of a fun time I started playing it today, net droped, game crashed, had to reboot my comp... but I started right again, hell even made a new char, spellcaster, for the hell of it... and now as I write this I got to bed... nearly at 5am lol and steam tells me that I have played..... yea 13 hours of the game...........I mean maybe that is just me......but if were to possibly be a bit less humble than I should......that probaly means this is a DAMN fine game, so go and buy it damn it, it is evne for sale now ^^P.S. it is really fun and I was interested on it and kept my eye on it for a long time now..... but the price fell too high for me, so I only bought it today during sale... would I have bought it anyways for full price now that I know how fun it is? .............. probaly....still feels a bit pricy without the discount though, so if you are reading this at a later date and the game is no longer on sale.... well keep that in mind. If you are a fun of the universe you probaly will find it still worth anyways, if the mecanics is what seen to attract you.... well you may want to wait for a sale..... or not either way I dont blame you.Make you pick folks and whichever way you go have fun and see you ingame ^^			"

								A very rare co-op online tactical RPG game that finally offers the opportunity for you and your friends to build up a character while going through a turn-based isometric combat adventure.  Each patch gets better and better, and it's definitely playable right now!Edit: IT IS NOT A FINISHED GAME.  Just be prepared for an unfinished game if you want to buy access, because ""playable"" doesn't mean ""finished.""			"

								If you are a fan of turn based games then i do recommend purchasing this game as being one of the supporters in building a game that has so much potential. You may find that spending this amount is not your worth since its still in early access and its not a full game yet, but i bought it knowing the full detail that by supporting the game and the devs, they will of course with your money spend build and grow the game into something good.I was not a fan of turn based games till i played shadowrun dragonfall, and oh the feels of the game keeps me going. will be buying shadowrun returns soon. But hey why not invest in a game that has so much potential and be one of the prime people that helped build and invest in this game. Only con i can provide = Early access with much more slowly being released. Pro =  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it, its shadowrun ONLINE WHOOO ok sorry, its just so good to me =)			"

								Won't compare this with Shadowrun Returns.. right now. SR:R is very much a successor to the '90s SNES/Genesis title in that there is a roaming mode for exploring/RPG events and a separate turn-based mode for combat/tactical moments. In it's current Early Access state, Shadowrun Online is a series of turn-based combat missions with two characters (controlled in offline play by a singler player). Storytelling is accomplished in text-based narratives that break down the plot. In-mission, the characters delver voiced banter and commentary that is genre-accurate and well done. Combat is quick, brutal, and easy to access/figure out with an elegantly designed UI that doesn't leave many questions unanswered. Shoot your gun, ammo goes down, use an action phase to reload. Simple. The AI is sharp. Pushing to cover, hitting you hard, and making you eat drek. Expect to get greased, Chummer. Graphics are excellent. A superior engine that delivers mood and environment clearly but without being cluttered or feeling like it's on rails (which it is, really, but at least it -looks- like you have an environment outside of the combat zone).All-in-all, a good experience. I'm excited for the full release and look forward to Workshop content if available.			"

												This was a really solid strategy game.  My main complaint is that there wasn't enough of it, and replaying beaten levels wasn't a realistic option.  There wasn't enough options in the skill trees once you chose a particular class.  Playing with friends who are a different level is not handled well.  We had connection issues that would cause some wierd behavior.  But overall the game was very enjoyable.  Plenty of strategy and teamwork in co-op play, yet still be solid single player fun.  The NPCs are plainly weaker than a teammate, but not so much so that single player play is impossible as with some co-op games.  The endgame is insufferably difficult such that you need a perfect strategy, perfect team, and perfect luck, and it becomes a TPK if you have one bad roll.  While not perfect though, it was a good game.			"

												Well.. to be honest, this game had a quite rough start!After release on steam, there was mayor issues on lag, witch seemed to be unsolvalbe. This ended up in alot of bad review's even tho the developers where working day and nite to fix it.After a couple of patches, and the problem didnt go away, people got really rough in theire review's of this game, and understandably enough, cuz who want's to pay for a game that's essentially not working as intended?For those of us who stayed through the troublesome week of mayor lag, we where finally rewarded. Not only did we recieve an offical statement/apoligy from the developers, we also got handsomely rewarded with cyberware ingame, AND not only that.. they actually fixed the lag! - YAY! -It seems that now that the lagmonster is finally gone (it was a freaking letter (D) in the code that was missing) they are working on extra content for the game, and so far i can only say that;I was expecting a more like SNES kinda universe with multiple city's and possible location, but instead i was met by a hub from where all the run's go out from.I was expecting a matrix sorta like platform where hacking/decking was incorporated like the old SNES version, but instead they integrated deckers on a whole diffrent way. Deckers now have the possibliy to hack into certain items, (oneclick action) and or enemies to either stun, or deal damage to them. Overall this is not what i expected, but nevertheless its not that bad when it comes down to the diffrent kinds of characters you can play within the game. Deckers still have theire unique ability, witch comes handy ingame and no group can survive without one.Gameplay-wise i would say i was kinda dissapointed at first, since i was expecting a more ""online"" kinda universe, with more interaction between players then just a global chat, and i was further dissapointed when i saw the lack of tradeing possibilies and the lack of hardware/weapons we where able to buy.After doing  a few mission that kinda changed my view. Cuz even tho most of the mission are quite easy, and dosent invovle alot of typing or anything in that matter, it is still a game of choises, and tactics, and a game of makeing the best out of it, even tho people are thinking diffrently from  your own style of play. - Take for instance an easy mission.. one guy on your team, dosent know that there is 20 mobs behind a door, and he opens it, JUST before you thought he would.. Well now you gotta think fast.. And that's what makes the game unpredictable, and fun in the long run..Anyways, back to the essential thing with this review. Ive spend about 100 hours in the game i would immagine.. most of them with lag and unbearable many restarts and patches, but nevertheless can i totally commit to the chronicle-series and im willing to stay for a longer periode of time, cuz the developers are now looking into adding more content, fixing minor bugs, and adding more possibilies for personal chat and stuff like this.You could call this game a gem in disquise. Im sure (with time) that the Cliffhanger Production will make this brand one of the big ones.Immaging this:What happens after boston? .. New city? .. Could you possibly tranfer your character to the next scenario? .. will the next scenario have further implants? .. better cyberware? .. will the enemies be tougher? .. kinda like a good old fashioned D&D where the levels gets higher and higher? ..I think its going to be amazing, and i will deff. hang out to see if that's what's intended for this game, cuz if it is.. IM GONNA PLAY EVEN MORE! :DIm still looking forward to a ""true"" online version of the old SNES game, but who knows.. its just a matter of time.. in the meantime, this is still the far best (and only) online'ish multiplayer shadowrun/cyberpunk game out there, and its a start..

												This game is loads of fun!  Unfortunately it released with severe latency problems which the dev team struggled fora while to resolve.  They stuck to it and experienced many sleepless nights trying their best to please the fans and realize their goal.  It seems to finally  be resolved now and I for one hope that anyone who was frustrated at launch will come back and try the game out now.  It is not a sandbox open world MMO, and it is not the most strategicly complex turn based strategy game in the world but it is a very fun version of shadowrun that shows a lot of promise.  I enjoyed it enough that I played even while the issues were ongoing and the lag was nearly unbearable and although it was a bit frustrating I had enough fun to put up with it for hours at a time.  Now that the issue seems to be fixed I will be playing even more and I recommend it to any shadowrun or turn based combat fans!  You can do shadowrun combat missions solo with other characters that you control or with your friends! who hasnt wanted that since they played the first shadowrun console games or even just the original pen and paper?!  A good time for any fan!  Cheers to Cliffhanger Productions and their awesome team who lost at least a week of their lives fighting to get us the gaming experience that they set out to provide!  See you in the shadows, chummers!			"

												As the lag problem is fixed by now I can totally recommend to play this game with your friends in coop mode.+ The makers of this game are doing their job with passion. They love their game and Shadowrun.+ Coop which is very well done+ It is a cyberpunk universe+ The atmosphere of the game is good and the music is great + Its storyline is good as far as I have seen it and it is well told+ The community is nice and friendly. Trolls can already be identified by their looks.+ It just makes fun to play- It will not be the Shadowrun game you would expect if you know its Pen & Paper origin, character creation and development is totally different and lacks of the freedom and variety you get in P&P games- You cannot plan your run, you cannot try to be a sneaky shadow runner in the shadows- The graphics and animations needs to be polished. Especially some of the player and non player charater models seem to be just some unfinished first alpha version dummys.- Not everything is voice overed, there isn't any lip syncing at all- The difficulty level is unbalanced. It is 4 times harder to play the missions with NPCs than with your friends. @Devs please make the NPC companions a little bit stronger or more versatile in their skills. And on the other hand increase the difficulty by every human player in the group.			"

Early Access Review
								After a lot of thought, and some interaction with the developers, hearing about their upcoming plans, I  have come to the conclusion that my original review was overly harsh, poorly researched, and just all around bad and inaccurate. I am going to continue updating this review as the game progresses. So got wind of a new update for the game, and decided that, fair being what it is, I'd check it out again.A lot, and I do mean a LOT, of things have changed for the positive. The combat system is much friendlier now. The graphics are a bit less horrid, there is something like a story, which is good. You have a bit more freedom in choosing your team, although there are still no customization options for them. The available runners also appear to change randomly, forcing you to make choices, and switch up your composition, rather than go with the one thing that works.So what all is missing still? Most of the things I complained about in my earlier review are still very much in play, but I feel a glimmer of hope that this may become something very good down the line. I reccomend giving it a look.			"

								You can see my early access review below. In the meantime, the team has made big strides and completely rebuilt the game from what it was in the beginning. Todyay it's an engaging XCOM style tactical RPG with an interesting story, fresh looks and great customization options. Bet of all it's set in one of the best tabletop universes: Shadowrun. A must for anyone into  cyberpunk, tactical RPGs and online co-ops.OLD REVIEW: Still in early stages. Having to restart whole mission because of one misstep is aggravating and makes me just regret my purchase. Some kind of a low power healing would be nice. And beware of accidentally clicking with wrong mouse button you will immediately move there instead of having to confirm your movement first. The game is too punishing at this stage.

												Here goes my take on SRC-BL: There is some good, bad and ugly here, I'll break it down.The Good:I love the art and combat style, more so than the Hairbrain version of the game. Shooting NPCs and watching them ragdoll replete with blood slowly flowing from their headwounds ...lends itself to an awsome sense of violent immersion. (Be forewarned, if such is not your thing...then move on.)Missions are not ball-busting yet, they're not mind-numbingly easy. They take ample tactics and forethought. They got ths one just right.Sound is comparible to its predecessors.Some have complained about lag though performance for me has been adequate (getting around 60 fps on my humble rig.)Character creation is awesome - nuff said.The Bad:Hencemen cannot be customised, any gear you find can't be equipped nor can their skills. You're left choosing from a list of prefabbed hencemen the skills and equipment of which automatically advance as you advance.  The skill tree is rather shallow compared to the HB version of the SR games.The game can become a grind of: kill this,..return; escort that...return and so on.The ""hub"" (where you buy gear, pick up quests) is significantly smaller than in previous SR games.The Ugly:First thing I noticed was that there was no ""collision detection"" in the hub. I would spawn on top of other toons and walk through them. (the Hub needs work.) Maybe not a big deal...but it sort of kills the immersion for me.Don't come into this game expecting a huge MMORPG experience. I would say that this is more/less a co-op version of the typical game. Rather disappointed when the focus was changed from online to ""lockeddown"". Voice acting vs. text. The voice acting is plausable though not  good enough to resist the desire for the interactive text-based version that allowed you to choose alternate direction/personality to your mission objectives.  Conclusion:All-in-all I enjoy the game, short-comings notwithstanding. If your a SR fan, you probably will too...if not, don't bother.  "

								So i randomly jumped on to see what's been goin on. gotta say, it don't hold a candle to harebrained, but, it's really solid. i thouroughly enjoyed the hour or two i put into it. this is what i was expecting to see after a year or so in develpment, after i signed on as a backer. i'm eally enthused forr what this crew have done, and eagerly await the finalized release version of  the project, and as for the half brain dead comment left by seelenschmied, durrrrr, but after a year in development you need to have more than proof of engine, it's called a business model, and i wou;d say this game was way off track from a successful model last september, it's starting to catch up, which is good considering the impending release. they've come a far piece with these last few months, and i'm thrilled. but don't go tryin' to educate me on the development process, you need a business model, and i know how slow crow funding can be, and how tedious it cn be to generate enough funding to keep a project on schedule, but that does not alleviate a responsibility to your backers, to your fans, to deliver a reasonable product in a reasonable time. to think that it does is just horrible business and leads to the destruction of the fan base that youl so desperately require for funding. glad to see they pulled their drek together and we'll finally be able to slot this thing soon. hope you guys keep kickin' up the quality. only thing i'd like to see is some sort of matchmaking service, just something to help like-minded players come together to help generate the experience they desire, i get how challenging that might be, but all in all, you guys have really got it back on track and for the dozenth time, i'm very excited for the finished product, keep knockin' it out. shoot straight, conserve ammo and, never cut a deal with a dragon.

												I have immensely enjoyed this version of shadow run.  It is a well balanced and challenging multiplayer campaign and more.   The added challenge missions were and still continue to be exciting and requires strategy and teamwork.   I love that no matter how skilled you are there still and chance for random chaos to ensue.  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy and team play.   There are several classes of characters to pick and I've played them all.  There are almost infinite ways to customize from background to training choices.  The variety of clothing items , rare drops and the ever coveted challenge mission prizes keep you coming back for more. Im looking forward to the next challenges and helping new players.			"

												Not quite what I expected: It's a fairly solid multiplayer game, but has only a superficial gloss of Shadowrun.Instead, it's a pretty enjoyable tactical strategy title that takes it's lead from the more recent XCOM title. It has a fairly decent story, but limited replayability at this time.Still worth a look if you like tacticals though.			"

Early Access Review
								I had high hopes for this game at one time, but that hope is fading.  Updates are few and far between and clearly the release date needs to been revised and communicated to the players.  I would be very leery of this game until it shows more progress.-----------------------------------------------------------------Update 03/09/2015 - Based on recent work and communication from the development team regarding a revised release date, I am feeling very hopefull about this game and am changing my review to positive.  There has been quite a bit of work done since my initial review, and the game is coming along nicely.  That being said, it still has a way to go, but as long as the team continues development post-release, this game holds a great deal of potential.			"

												If you want a good shadowrun game, stick to ""Shadowrun: Dragonfall"" or ""Shadowrun: Returns"" (haven't played Hongkong yet). In this you have no dialogue choices, not even a good dialogue, you are always in the same, bland looking area to buy stuff (as far as I can tell). You cannot buy drones, you get them, magically. The spells seem quite simplistic and not interesting and the ""Summoner"" (you know, the mage or shaman who can summon spirits now has an own class) has a summon that seems laughably bad compared to the rigger.I got this through Humblebundle.com (help charity by buying games) and I am glad, I did not pay so much. I will be looking for some deals for ""Shadowrun: Hongkong"" and maybe I can forget I ever played this.			"

Early Access Review
								okay...after a good while i´ll edit my review, because the game has come a LONG way in the last few months... constant updates have made a fully enjoyable game out of what was a few random ""test"" missions last year...the devs are AWESOME,and considering their rather low budget, they got way more out of the Unity engine than i expected... I hear alot of ppl complain that it´s not ""true to the pen and paper original"", but i see it differently... it IS a shadowrun game, it is just another iteration of the universe... what it does, it does right...it tells a deep story, offers challenging co-op or solo round tactics missions, and what they have planned for after release sounds great, too... i burned myself alot with early access and kickstarter games, but seeing how this game developed (and keeps doing so) fills me with joy... an old shadowrun AND round based tactics fan finally gets what he always dreamed about: a good shadowrun PC game and a good tactis game in one go... looking forward to more to come :)			"

												I think this game is quite decent and actually comparing it to Harebrained Schemes series is a bit senseless (and I'm writing this after finishing all 3 shadowruns from H.S. + some user missions). Shadowrun's touch and atmosphere are definitely present here and really (like others written before me) it's really a choice between well executed X-com style game and complex RPG (H.S. series). I say - go for both, if you're a fan (like I'am). About the game, now.  It's basically simplified RPG (sometimes it's no sin at all), turn-based tactical shootout with shadowrun storyline and possible co-op - as it all stands in the game's desciption (no lying there) and that's what you're buying ;) I believe understanding this is crucial for your potential opinion on this game. Despite some minor flaws which don't spoil my fun anyhow, I appreciate quite realistic combat (where enviroment matters), in-game events, clear skills development, decent storyline and finally awesome character customization (don't tell me you did not spend first hour having fun with the character creator). I also believe players got a little to spoil ;) while most of negative opinions about this game is saying it's decent - why giving it thumbs down? And looking for minor inconsistencies with shadowrun universe - really ? Yeah, like we have dozens of shadowrun games in the market ;) Good luck with that. Travel safe in the shadows, chummers...

												First off it is Co-Op.  Not solo like the Shadowrun Dragonfall game.  With the first intro mission being Solo and the following 4 missions being 2 player Co-Op. Later it becomes 4 player Co-Op.These missions are only playable once for the host player with max money and Karma reward.  All other players in the mission get no money and 2-3 karma it seems. Everyone gets the items that are found though in the mission so money can be got for other players that way.The game is REALLY hard and is design as a story for you to play through once with your shadowrunner.  Your toon will then be able to go onto the next campaign set of missions when they are released.  In a simular way to what Payday 2 seems to operate.Currently the Boston Lockdown Campaign consists of 32 Missions. That is all the info I am going to give ( Dont want to spoil it for you ) other than if you play them all solo you will be having to hit the forums to find out the best NPC's to take.  If you play with friends you will have a good mix of skills with fellow shadowrunners whos skills will be growing as well as yours. Plus its more fun.Solo you will have to move not only your character but also all the npc you take. If you have to babysit an NPC, the host player controls them.It's not a fast paced game, more chess like.  Think XCom with friends being able to player the other squad members when this is played Co-Op.Cons - Personally I feel there could be more to explain the setting up of your equipment and your character, letting you know that you WILL NOT be able to skill up every tree you can see. Stuff like that to stop confusion.The netcode for the game is still a little twitchy if it is busy at the hub. This will no doubt be sorted.All in all I like what I see so from from this small company and I hope that it continues to produce missions and grows.			"

												Unfortunately, unlike SR: Dragonfall and SR: Hong Kong this game completely throws out the unique 'classes' of Shadowrun and opts instead for classes built around whatever weapon your holding.  The 'classes' in this game are called Skills: Blunt, Blades, Summoning, Spellcasting, Shotguns, Automatics, Pistols, Rigging, Hacking, Body, and Mind. The games graphics are a mixed bag.  The players and npcs are poorly rendered however the backgrounds are gorgeous.  You can customize your characters looks (and the game gives you plenty of options to pick from).  You randomly get new “loot” during missions by finding new pieces of clothing for your character to wear to further customize your appearance. There is one saving grace for SR Chronicles and that is the multiplayer component.  You can higher NPCs to go with you however they are by far weaker than players.  The game really shines when you take friends with you on the very difficult tower defense type missions that you normally have no chance at winning solo.  So far this has kept me coming back to a game that is only SR in name.I can only mourn what could have been here.  If this game used the same assets that made SR: Dragonfall/Hong Kong (Physical Adepts, etc.) AND the multiplayer aspect here then this game would be a must get.  For now, skip it unless you are willing to overlook that its only SR in spirit,  fun co-op game.			"

												Shadowrun Chronicles seems like one of those games you'll either love or quickly lose interest in, depending on your preferences. I wager the 270 hours I have clocked in so far firmly place me in the former camp, though.SRC is essentially a turn-based squad tactics game with multiplayer support. If you enjoyed combat in XCOM, Jagged Alliance or similar games, you should be able to have fun with this one as well. Unlike these other titles, however, SRC has a stronger RPG factor in that you are ""closer"" to the Shadowrunner you create, and usually only control this one character, unless you skip on the whole social part that makes this game stand out and play exclusively with NPCs in your team.Combat itself is easy to learn whilst still challenging the player with tough encounters, some of whom may require multiple attempts. The absence of unlimited healing a la Shadowrun Returns' mages prevents fights from turning into wars of attrition, instead rewarding quick manoeuvers with clever use of cover. Notably, there is no Overwatch/Interrupt due to the developer's reasoning of such actions penalizing movement and melee combat too much. This is a game where (generally) you aren't supposed to hunker down and keep shooting, but instead to try to get close and flank the enemy.The level designers' attention to detail deserves a special shout-out, for whilst the environment is not truly destructible, just about any furniture can and will get damaged in a fight. Windows burst, computers get wrecked, vending machines spill their drinks, and fire extinguishers spill white clouds of CO2 as they are damaged, which adds a lot to the immersion as your team kicks some corporate hoop. The visuals as well as the (all-voiced) dialogue truly manage to convey the cyberpunk atmosphere of Shadowrun, evoking the right feelings of this world.Another notable and RPG-like feature is the customization, which is setting a new bar for this subgenre. Albeit not quite covering everything you could ask for (stances, different faces and recoloring would be nice to have), the amount of clothes you can combine and wear is massive, easily allowing you to create a truly unique Runner. And you can bet that you will see some truly weird people hanging out in the hub, as dress-up games have become almost a community minigame by now.Unfortunately, there isn't much going on in terms of roleplaying, as the game does not fully support such activity yet. Social areas like clubs were a feature planned for some time after release, but with the studio being in financial troubles it remains to be seen just when they get around to adding this. Private chat channels as well as private messaging are other features badly needed, but in theory you can at least RP with your team when attempting a mission.Right now, the only endgame is a rather grindy ""challenge"" that does not quite manage to capitalize on the game's strengths but at least gives people something to do. Personally, I'd rather recommend rolling up another character, as even multiple campaign playthroughs remain fun thanks to the base mechanics. Though the studio is currently having a tough time staying afloat, they are still working on new content and have recently announced plans for an expansion. Lack of an SRR-style editor is a shame, but no deal breaker.In summary, whilst this may not be a perfect Shadowrun game, it absolutely manages to be an enjoyable one. Of note, I also don't believe Shadowrun Returns was a perfect SR game. To me, the perfect Shadowrun game would be something in-between SRC and SRR. But if you enjoyed Returns, give Chronicles a look, too, as I feel it simply approaches this perfection from the other angle.tl;dr:+ solid turn-based tactical squad combat, difficult but not unfairly so+ incredibly fun in co-op with a friendly playerbase+ awesome character customization+ nicely catches the dystopian atmosphere of the Shadowrun setting- desperately needs some Quality-of-Life improvements (private messaging)- no level adjustment means endgame runners invited to low level missions will trivialize them- sadly no level editor like in Shadowrun Returns			"

												Feels like a poor man's Xcom in Shadowrun setting. So if you here for a story and RPG, play Shadowrun Returns, Dragonfall and Hong Kong instead. If you are here for a tactical strategy, play XCOM or Invisible, Inc.What's even worse, Shadowrun Chronicles tries to be an MMO, but offers nothing except friend lists and coop, while still requiring you to be connected to the game server. So if it's down for any reason, you can't play the game. The upside is that it's not really worth playing (unless you are a huge fan of Shadowrun and completed all games by Harebrained Schemes).			"

												Shadowrun Chronicles - Boston Lockdown, how should I say it... It is simply a masterpiece, no other game is able to compare to its monumentally amazing aspects. Firstly, it boast a fanastical system from which you are capable of customising your character to fit your preference. As well as this, the gameplay features much to be enjoyed as it has a very pleasing skill system which has been simplified to be fitting for anyone who wants to get straight into the action. The ability to reset skill points on demand would be much appreciated. The missions are not groundbreaking although they do provide a lot of amusement especially with the game's integrated co-op mechanic, making it fun for the entire family. Sound design on components such as weapons and actions are favourable and suitable as for the voice acting, ""wew lad"".""Overall I would rate it a 3/5"" - Mojang			"

												Imagine you can play Left 4 Dead turn-based, Able to upgrade your character with more skills and weapons? That't what SC:BL is about. No usual MMORPG stuff like grinding, stupid repetitive quests: just raids in all its glorious beauty. Team up with 3 random dudes, and go for it! 1 quest if you feel hasten; 10 quests if you have your time! Each quest takes 15-20 minutes of your real time, so you can plane in advance.Co-op it the greatest feature of the game for me. I always liked co-op board games like Pandemic, Arkham Horror, Battlestar Galactica, Shadows Over Camelot etc. I don't know about PvP (which is yet to come), but Co-op is just great and that is exactly why you should buy the game. There is some content yet to come, but for me it is already a masterpiece.			"

												I've had extensive experience throughout the development of this game, having bought it the minute it showed up on steam and played throughout the early access/beta process. For me this is a very fun game to hop on and do a few runs with friends and then hop off again. Its very much a casual game. It catches the feel of classic turn based combat very well in my opinion. Yes, it does not have things like overwatch or take cover/hunker down. According to the developers at one point they claimed that was intentional, and in truth any X-Com player knows that overwatch in particular is very easy to exploit so its understandable. Its important to understand that though this is Shadowrun flavored and certainly catches the spirit of Shadowrun, that it is NOT Shadowrun ruleset. Things like skills and cyberware/essence are handled very differently in this game. Don't let that scare you though as the system they do use will still seam very familiar and it doesn't detract from the title for anyone but the most hardened Shadowrun purists. To me the thing that most lets the game down right now is the chat system. Its SUPER basic and lacks things like the ability to PM other players, ignore people, or even just switch it off. The group chat is fairly buggy and overall its something that in a social game I would hope is a priority for them to improve apon. I'd also like to see some kind of queue system for quick joining in runs which would only improve on the ""hop in and have a run"" feel the game projects. Another negative for me is the voice acting. The main characters voice (for females anyways) is HORRIBLE. The accent and the acting. I get that its supposed to be a game set in Boston so credits for trying with the heavy Boston accent but its horrible to listen to on a daily basis especially with a nasally tone to it. Another thing I don't like is the fact that the story voice over takes into no account your skills, so if for example you play a decker you still get voice over of your character moronically not knowing what a grid access point was. On a positive note I can't say enough about the character customization in this game. I loath to draw a parallel back to X-com but again it has that kind of depth of customization and honestly even shames many true ""MMOs"" in its ability to let you get your character looking unique and like you want it. Even this however is a bit let down to me by the limited number of character portraits so though you can make an amazing character sprite, the portrait for it will be cookie cutter and almost never match the character. Still as a launching point for a future series of modules and gameplay Shadowrun Chronicles is an excellent way to integrate multiplayer and the Shadowrun experience while maintaining a familiar style to the other Shadowun games and good turn based experience. I'd certainly recommend it to people, both fans of Shadowrun and people just looking for a casual, quick fun experience.			"

												---1 MAY UPDATE---New idea for implementation ...- Characters need some sort of rating scheme (like a ""level"") to make it easier to group with others of equivalent ability. Right now people are advertising themselves in chat as ""Decker LFG, 4 Hacking, 3 Automatics"". That's way too clunky. Should be able to say something as simple as, ""Lvl 4 Decker LFG"". Or maybe give characters a Karma rating so they can use it to identify their ""level"" more easily.---LAUNCH DAY UPDATE---I made some changes to my ""April Update"" below. I'm very much enjoying the game, but as I've been playing some things have come to mind that I would like to see implemented.---APRIL 2015 UPDATE---A lot of updates occurred in April. The game is starting to look like a cross between Shadowrun Returns (SRR) and XCOM. Fans of the PNP RPG might be disappointed in the character creation process as it is not a literal translation of those rules. At this time there are no traditional PNP attributes like strength, intelligence, etc. They are reflected instead in broader categories such as Body (which encompasses health, strength, and dexterity), which is labeled as a ""skill"" along with traditional skills such as Blades, Pistols, Automatics, etc. As you spend karma in a skill set (I'll use Body as an example) you have to make decisions at each purchasing point whether you want to increase your health or dexterity, dexterity or accuracy, health or reaction time, etc. I'm not in love with this method, because I'm one of those who would have preferred to see a literal translation of the PNP rules. However, I understand the realities of creating a game, and I understand that compromises have to be made based on aesthetics and resource limitations. Harebrained Schemes had a significantly larger budget to make every iteration of SRR, and even Jordan Weisman (the creator of the Shadowrun IP) decided to alter their approach in making SRR because the PC game version did not need all the elements of the PNP rules to be a good game. Cliffhanger has taken a similar approach with Shadowrun Chronicles (SRC), and while it might serve as a turn-off to diehard fans of the PNP game, frankly all those differences are forgotten once you start a mission. Once inside, one's only care is completing the run and getting out alive.A few things I'd like to see that are not (yet?) in the game:- Matrix, but I'm sure it's coming. Right now all cyber actions occur in Augmented Reality (AR).- More character slots ... three is not enough for the variety of character choices!  -- As a KS backer, I got an additional 2 upon launch. Or does everyone have 5 now?- Rifles (right now they only have pistols, shotguns, and automatics)- A larger hub. It's already obvious to me that the hub is going to be very crowded.- A place to buy Doc Wagon contracts in the hub! Maybe this appears later in the game, but I see no reason it should not be included from the start.- Secondary weapons for NPC runners. They need a go-to when they are out of ammo. Players carry them, so NPCs should have them too.- More weapons, cyber gear, and cosmetic items for sale, or at least visible, from vendors  -- They are in the game, but you can't see them until you progress in ""level"", then they start showing up at vendors. Still, it would be nice to see the assortment of vendor weapons even if they can't be purchased yet.- Unarmed combat (there is no skill tree for it)- An item to revive fallen runners during a mission- Ability to shoot-move, in that order. At present, standard actions such as attacks end the character's turn, and according to an in-game tooltip, that's intentional so it's unlikely to change. Still, if you can make two actions during a turn, I don't see why choosing to shoot first should deny you the second action.- More carrying capacity. Hired Runners have no tactical items, so they can't carry medkits, grenades, etc. That means the only person who can act as a medic is the player, but players can't carry enough medkits to treat everybody. Possible solutions are, 1) give players the ability to equip hired runners with tactical items (that are returned at end of mission if not used), 2) significantly increase player character carrying capacity (ability to carry a minimum of 4 items), or 3) increase the number of times a medkit can be used.---MARCH 2015 REVIEW---My complete opinion is still TBD, but for now I'm voting this ""up"" to balance against the knuckleheads who voted it down because it didn't fit their definition of a MMO.I backed this project when it first became available on Kickstarter under the name Shadowrun Online. Yes, the devs referred to it as a MMO, but ***if the complainers had actually paused to read the description of the game*** instead of throwing thier money into it because it contained the words ""Shadowrun Online"" and ""MMO"", they would have known it was ***always*** marketed as a turn-based co-op game. Seriously, go back to the original Kickstarter announcement and read what it says. At no time did the devs ever mislead anyone about what they wanted to make. So anyone who is disgruntled or disappointed because they didn't get the WoW-like MMO they wanted has no room to complain. But of course, that won't stop them.As for the state of the game, it is coming along nicely ... but aside from the fancier graphics I haven't seen anything yet that really makes it stand out from Shadowrun Returns (SRR). I have faith the devs will continue to improve it since this project was for them as much a labor of love as a business venture. But as of March 2015, the only significant difference between Chronicles and Returns is that Chronicles offers community interaction and co-op play which SRR is lacking.			"

												Updated for Final Release.Finally making its way through Early Access, a name change and several updates. Shadowrun Chronicles is now complete and handing out the nuyen and contracts like a mad Johnson. I am happy to say that the developers have finally brought this game to state that I can enjoy. Delivering a full game experience. With the ability to create a unique runner, skill sets, and up to 4 player co-op. Now while there is plenty of that has been improved and even fixed. There is still some areas that need a bit of shining. However that doesn't stop this from being a very enjoyable title. Using your crafted runner you will bring something unique to the mission. Rather that be guns, hacking, or maybe a little magic. The story of SRC is not as in-depth as its compatriots. Being mostly linear and devoid of RPG elements. The graphics are good enough, as is the aesthetic of cyberpunk. Although the zoom features lets you see the block like shapes of the characters. In all SRC is a game that Shadowrun fans can enjoy and includes a pivotal element that other Shadowrun games missed. Multiplayer. For this reason and more. You should check out Shadowrun Chronicles - Boston Lockdown I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												Shadowrun Chronicles is a fun tactical RPG. Note: this review is mostly relevant for the campaign. I haven't touched the end-game content yet.Currently the game works best in Single Player. Most of the current player-base have end-game level characters, so playing pick-up Co-Op will make the missions way too easy. If you are playing with a friend of similar level, then Co-Op would be fantastic, but I haven't been able to try that.The game plays like a simplified version of Shadowrun Returns, with elements of X-Com. Its not much of an RPG (no exploration, no branching dialog) but you do control one character through the campaign and can choose a progression and item selection. If you play alone, you bring along 3 other NPCs with you on missions. They level up automatically and it doesn't matter if they die.This game is good if you like Shadowrun, and want something to play after having beaten all of HBS games. Most missions are under 30 minutes in length, so its a great game to play if you are short on time.			"

												The game is less complex than the other 2 recent Shadowrun games but very similar. The campaign story is interesting and the fights are challeging if you play with npcs.I would not recommend doing missions with high lvl players in your team as it makes them trivial and you will not have fun. I found that playing the campaign with npcs gave me a more enjoyable challenge.Use the online co-op for end game challenges or if you are stuck in a mission.			"

												Pros:- Solid co-op x-com combat (the only place I have found that strategy system in a co-op environment).- Solid graphics (although not ground breaking some of the maps are just amazing, better than x-com, and the detail such as exploding windows in such is nice.)- BEST community! ( only have about 17hrs at the time of writing this but EVERYONE I have run into in game has been nice and helpful. Alot even rollplay in chat during games, which adds to the environment). - Shadowrun co-opCons: - Its all about the combat (nothing else really takes place in this game, no side hacking like in other shadowrun titles. No talking your way out of situations like in the Hairbrain games, every mission is kick drek and take names. Possible a Pro for some people but I have noticed alot of complaining in forums about its lack of deversity).- map variety (although as stated the map are amazing, having not completed the campaign I am already seeing repeated maps in storymode).- Chat system is lacking (for a multiplayer game that requires grouping you can't whisper/tell people or even those on your friend list!)- Singleplayer lacking (you have the ability to play the story singleplayer and multiplayer but the companions for singleplayer are lacking compared to other players making it difficult to solo and forcing people to play multiplayer). Overall it doesn't follow Shadowrun PnP to much and it isn't one of the Hairbraine games so I think alot of people got down on it. However it is a great multiplayer x-com style co-op game that I am now sure I will be getting my return on in fun.			"

												The game is fun and it has potential. However I can't say that I'd recommend this game to someone. The balancing of the game nerfs the team cannot have rigger and other summoners on the same team, cannot deploy multiple riggers. Theres a lack of bad guys you fight most of them are simple gunners. Next is the lack of ability to revive a teammate, a teammate goes down and you have 5 turns to finish the mission and escape. This is not how shadowrunners work in the RPG a guy goes down you get the job done regarudless. There also seems to be a lack of ability to revive a someone after they go down. Medkits or the basic ability to heal you or yourteam mates have to be found and your limited to 2 of them per run. I'd rather a weight system, I can only carry two medkits but I have cybernetic limbs... which is silly. I think if they work on the balancing it could be a lot of fun. Yes 4 riggers could swarm a map, so put the ability to hack drones in so they loose the drones.. you swarm with 4 riggers and your going to be in a world of hurt.  "

												I'm haapy with how this game turned out. It's different from the single-player shadowrun game. It feels like the devs are committed and I am quite enjoying the experience.Pros: - the campaign is nice and long- skill trees: while I wouldn't say no to more options, there are quite a few nodes and you can always take a few picks out of trees that are not your primary/secondary to pick up some goodies- good atmosphere - it feels shadowrunny- the game is mostly voiced- The launch was plagued with serious, debilitating lag. But the devs response to the lag was very good - communication on what they were doing, how their troubleshooting was going, and appoligies. The lag is now gone.Cons:- there aren't many differet types of gear, and what gear exists is pretty easy to get ahold of. I haven't had to wait on gear from a nuyen standpoint in a long time, I just have to wait for it to unlock in the shops and instantly buy it. I wish there were more gear and that you could see available before being able to afford it. Also, there are some extreme dry spells - I've gone a dozen missions in a stretch without having access to any new gear.- the voice acting is heavily-accented Bostonite. It is a seriously unpleasant accent (think hyper-aggressive baby talk). I get that the game takes place in Boston, but there's no reason to pick the most heavily-accented voices. I'd much rather be able to listen to the dialog without cringing. Also in the voice acting domain, there is a moaner in medical settings that is particularly irritating. You'll hear it - it's someone moaning like a fire engine siren. It's weird and off-putting.- the tooltips when choosing skills from the skill trees are pretty light on information. This makes it difficult to make an informed decision about which option to choose at branches. There is no karma reset, so once you make your choice, you don't get to go back and try the other option. This will be easier once the wikis start filling up with info.TL;DR: It's a solid game, with committed devs. If you're into Shadowrun, pick it up :o)			"

												I been here threw thick and thing, from the earliest bata to rocky release. I enjoyed every moment of it, I have over 200 hours logged on this game and recently got to the final act.The plot twists and story kept me guessing I didn't see some of the story comeing because they were hidden in other plot twists.It a great game and one of my favorites.I was not paid to say this. I paid them 1505 as a backer and still glade I did.Look for my character and items in game, you can own a little bit of the Mechaphantom			"

												I am really enjoying Shadowrun Chronicles. It takes the standard Shadowrun series gameplay (SR Returns, DragonFall, Hong Kong etc.) and simplifies it down, then makes it multiplayer. I would really go as far as to say, while being one of the most simple Shadowrun games mechanic wise I feel like the addition of multiplayer and extra character customization with the large amount of player cosmetic options really goes a long way all on its own. Even if you are not really interested in playing cooperatively with other players on your shadowrun team, you can still play through the missions with a team of AI shadow runners of your choice. To go into more details about how skills work in Shadowrun chronicles, each weapon type has its own skill ""helix"" Two separate paths that you make choices from, each level unlocking a skill from either the top or bottom path. There are no ""classes"" in Chronicles, but your skills are determined by your weapon choices. Each skill set is different, as an example guns are broken down into types, pistol, assault rifle, shotgun etc. while magic, summoning, rigging, and decking are all on separate trees. There are also Paths for Mind/Body that deal with passive abilities that can benefit any weapon choice/ play style. Most player interaction takes place in a hub area in downtown Boston, where in between missions you will meet other shadowrunners, stock up on supplies, sell and buy new gear, pick up side missions or simply change your wardrobe. There is not a whole lot to it other than that, The campaign Boston Lockdown also is centered around the characters you meet here, and as you progress the main plot the hub world changes a little at a time. Story wise I have been entertained well and am enjoying the plot, even if it feels a little shallow and lacks player choice almost completely. There is a strong feeling of mystery around the events that unfold during the main plot and I cant wait to play more.Overall I recommend Shadowrun Chronicles to any fans looking for another Shadowrun game to play, or to anyone looking for an Isometric RPG they can play Co-op.

												This game had quite a rough start, but it's definitly worth the wait. As an avid SR Pen&Paper player, I really love the setting and tone this game has. The world, the slang, the style - they capture the feeling of the sourcebooks just perfect.One question I hear quite often is if this game is related to Harebrained Schemes SR:Returns and Dragonfall and what the differences are. First of all: All three games are great (Finished both HBS games, pledged the third on KS and currently playing SR:Chronicles), but they are made by two different companies. So, apart from the world and lore, they are not related in any way.Both use a turn based XCOM style combat system as a core concept. HBS games are much more text heavy, while SR:Chronicles has full voiceacting and less text.Due to the Multiplayer character of SR:C, its playing much faster than the single player HBS games. I really love the community in this game, the chats are full of people who know and love the lore and even speak in the slang. It's a little bit like playing on a RPG Server.The inventory and weapons system looks much larger than HBS system.One thing I personally love ist the fact that equipment does not alter your characters appearance. You can change the style of your character at any time in the hub for free. And the list with clothing, tattos, shoes and more is quite impressive.One thing I really miss is the matrix. You have short moments in matrix nodes as hubs, but there is no ""combat matrix"" like in HBS games. I hope Cliffhanger will develop something similar for future campaigns.So, if you like quick, action packed runs with a good community, play this game.			"

												Keep playing.That's the basic advice I have for this game. Look beyond the initial missions. Look beyond the poor graphics in the hub, or in general. Look beyond the voice-acting.Just keep playing. You'll see why soon enough. The game itself is actually superb, be it the mission design, the storyline, the overall RPG system... it's good stuff, thoroughly enjoyable now that the server-side issues are dealt with.And you can pretty much play it by yourself with NPC parties, if that's what you want. This is *not* a game that forced me to group with people to progress, or to see content. It's a game that can be played by yourself or with others, and it's a worthy start to what can be much, much more if expanded upon.So keep playing. You'll thank me later.			"

												Having put a fair bit of time into the game on multiple characters, I've seen a few of the ups and downs SRC has had to handle and to be frank?  For what it is, it's a good game.  Now, I'd like to preface that with the statement that I've been following this game since it was announced some years ago, back when it was still called Shadowrun Online, when all the game really had to offer were a handful of unpolished missions and character options.  That said, it has come leaps and bounds in what can honestly be called a particularly ambitious project for a small studio like Cliffhanger, and you know what, I think they did a pretty good job all things considered.Admittedly, they have had some stumbling blocks, from early launch lag issues to missing or broken items and even in some cases surprise gamebreaking bugs, but through all that their Dev team was very responsive to the community's questions and concerns and tried to maintain as much transparency as they could concerning their efforts to fix said issues.  Even after the fact, they tried to make reparations to to the community as a whole as an apology for the trouble, which, in my opinion, speaks very highly of Cliffhanger as a whole.That said, and onto the game itself, its a hex grid, turn based isometric centered in the Shadowrun universe following the adventures of your shadowrunner through (for the sake of being spoiler-free) the events of what could be called the Boston Incident.The story itself is creative and unique, and well written besides, with tolerable voice acting where it applies (though the Boston accent can get tiresome during subsequent playthroughs) and does stay loyal to the Shadowrun source material.  That said, and I can't emphasize this enough, the game is not a point-for-point match to the PnP source.  Certain liberties have been taken in regards to the game being both online and, well, being a game.  Certain facets in the PnP source are unfortunately absent, in as far as customization goes, and as of right now most missions center around a run-and-gun playstyle (meaning that no, there isn't a stealth option).  That said, what it delivers, it delivers very well in that the combat is well-polished, balanced, and fun, and the downtime inbetween missions does offer a lot of chance for backstory, worldbuilding, and customization.Bear in mind, what I said about the game lacking certain aspects of customization doesn't mean that the game lacks in customization at all.  In fact, it offers a wide array of options, both practical and cosmetic, both at creation and that which can be earned through gameplay.  This includes items that can be used in missions, weapons, armor, various types of cybernetics and spells, and a wide array of skills and abilities.  It opens up a lot of tactical options and allows players to approach objectives from several angles, which, in some cases, is absolutely vital towards the success of any given mission.Difficulty can vary from build to build, and while there's no expressly ""right"" way to play, there is a certain limitation to the number of playstyles you can use.  That said, there are a lot of variations, so the limits to what you can do are pretty broadly defined.The interface is fine for the format.  There aren't any outstanding bugs or issues at this iteration of the game and for the most part, it's very intuitive and easy to master.  Gameplay is in tradition turn-based format, and despite the game being online, it can be played in both single and multiplayer, both of which offer their own share of advantages and disadvantages.  That said, while the game is beatable in purely solo play, it is *significantly* harder to finish the content.  Harder, but not impossible.Ultimately it delivers what it promised.  I bought the delux edition when it came out and you know what?  As far as games go, I got my money's worth.  It had it's ups and downs, and while I really don't think the Early Access reviews give the game a fair shake at what it is now, compared to what it was, they do have offer a good look into what the game was like during developement.  Is it worth 30$?  I think so.  I go my money's worth, which is a lot more than I can say for a lot of AAA titles in the last few years.  Better for it that you don't really need a background in the Shadowrun universe in order to enjoy the content for what it is.So for me at least, I give the game a solid 4 out of 5 and with it my recommendation.

												I'd give it sideways thumbs if I could.  I like the game but I don't love it.  The following is from the perspective of playing it solo.  If you intend to play it co-op, I'd easily recommend this game.-Can't disable the multiplayer features. Namely, I keep clicking on the chat even though I want nothing to do with the chat.-Can't overwatch/guard your characters.-Can't save/load. Granted, each map is pretty small but you have to roll with the punches. If things go sideways, you might as well ""leave mission"" and start over from the area start.-I had money, I needed a better weapon, but none were available. For quite a while, the hired runners had better arms and armor than me. It's frustrating being the weakest link and there's nothing you can do about it until the story advances to a point it unlocks more store content.-Continuation of above: no options to adjust difficulty. There are some missions that appear to be unbalanced (like this one where I was attacked on two fronts and they were coming faster than I could kill them; finally completed it on my third or fourth attempted).-Unlike Harebrained Schemes titles, there's really only one mission I've seen that you can get through without fighting. Ehm, dialogs are linear and the story doesn't appear to branch at all.-There's some character development but it is shallow compared to the Harebrained Schemes versions.			"

												I'm finding the game gets blasted with a lot of undeserved hate on these reviews. If you were looking for a 'true' MMO; you'll be sorely dissapointed.This game isn't, and I don't have the impression that it tries to be.It's more of a ... turn based Borderlands. Grab 3 friends and go to town.The plot is forgettable, and conversation between me and my friends tends to go something akin to 'Why are we trying to shoot fat orc lady again?' - 'I dunno, it's the ojective. Can you mark her so I can salvo, or should I take a potshot'? - 'I need to resummon a drone, but let the hacker mark if you need it!' aaaaand we're back off to gamespeek.It's pretty unique on the market in that sense, it's a co-op turn based game that you can play with 4 people; but will have no problem playing with just 2 or 3 thanks to the henchman system.Don't expect a full fledged MMO going in, grab a few friends who share your love for turn-based and go to town, you'll enjoy it.

												Heres a fresh review-Gameplay is excellent. If you like turn based strategy games like, Final Fantasy tactics, Xcom: ufo defense/terror from the deep, New Xcom ect.. You'll love this cyberpunk TBS game. Coop is fun, community isn't filled with trolls, and the devs are social. 10/10 Hard earned Fun. Great character progression and fun customization 10/10. Fun gameplay 10/10. Story is pretty good 10/10.Endgame economy and mission selection is still lacking - End Game 7/10 Still needs work (this is raised from my previous rating of 5/10 and the previous rating 2/10 prior to that). The mission repeatables DLC helps take the edge off, along with the new duel repeatable missions- but untill they make an endless flow of missions (!! like the ability to reset the campaign !!) when the campaign is over, well endgame is still needs work.Known Bugs-1. Actions are canceled by otherplayers actions- this causes miss clicks. (still a problem like having dash 3 selected somone moves and you click then he doesnt dash)2. Action Cam can stress you out turn it off. (still moves some times even when you have it deactivated- still a bug)Game Needs-1. (they did it) removed-2. More suitable Decker class- Decker should not be a caster- They value data, hardware, and software, really takes away from the shadowrun atmosphere with the way they are currently played. There should be a mini game atleast involved with the hacking, client based.3. A group builder system, currently begging for groups in chat is a bit- well 2001ish. An automated group fill system would be sweet with seach perameters like - story, infected, red, blue, repeatable, and any.4. Voip- Voice chat.5. A way to reset campaign on current runner. (would make me give this game 10/10 across the board.)Shadowrun Fan-ByU			"

												At its original full price it certainly wasn't worth getting. But it got a reduction and now it's available for almost nothing in a Humble Bundle. First off, and the reason it has done badly, it's NOT what you would expect from a Shadowrun game after having played the HBS offerings. There is far less depth to story elements, there is no overwatch mechanic and hacking, lockpicking etc is reduced to clicking on your target and a seccess or fail roll. Missions are taken from a single central ""market"" hub contributing to its not being great in an RPG sense.All this said, it has a lot of positives as well and is certainly enjoyable purely as a TBS more geared towards co-op fun. You can play it fine as a single player game but it quickly becomes clear that this isn't where the main fun lies. My advice is to get it in its Humble package and only grab the DLCs if you find it's to your liking. Overall though it's a perfectly good tbs based in the Shadowrun world and quite unique in that it offers tbs co-op. It's really not the pig Shadowrun fans have made it out to be and despite its faults I'm going to give it a thumbs up overall. As long as you approach it ""eyes open"" that it's not like the other shadowrun games then you should enjoy it.			"

												This is an awesome adaptation of Shadowrun. Really lots and lots of options for dressing up your character exactly how you want him to look. Trannie trolls, dapper elves, you name it.Game systems are fun, non-linear progression trees with hard choices and party combo set ups. It's a turn based game best played with 2-4 players, and turns are simultaneous which makes the turns go fast. You can play it solo, and it's fun then, but more so with other people.It's X-com meets Jagged Alliance that you can play with your friends.There is no pvp yet, it's all co-op, but the developers promise a pvp mode in future updates.As to my very own 3 star rating: it has swords, it has elves, and promises to have pvp in the future. I give it 2.5 stars out of 3. :)P.S. First shadowrun computer game where making a character was a fun experience.P.P.S. First week had some server-side input lag and a lot of reviews bash this game based on that. They fixed the problem. No input lag now. Come on in, the water is fine.			"

												AS a fan of Shadowrun, i'm sad to say i can't recommend this game....First of all, the story: hem...well...it was...well see....THE character doing, hmmm, stuff like retrieve data, find something, obtain intel WITH is Drekking gun! always! no speaking, no roleplay, just a mindless ""tactical"" shooter. and even for the tactical part, the game miss the most important features: the overwatch. and, by the way, they're no story AT ALL!My character just bump in the hub with the speak to those guy and yay, let's shoot something -_-'So, if chronicles mean not solid story, it's ok. (strangely, i always think a chonicles was a kind of long story...)second thing: yes,  i've only play 2 hours. Guess why? c'mon, try it, it's fun!no? no one guess? even you, in the last row? it was bacause each time i try to play to this game, the server got down. It's not even a joke, i try to play, BAM, ""update"" i wait and connect myself 1 hour after....lag...more lag...server down....I don't want to be a crybaby, but i've buy this game in the state of mind to play with, not just stare at the title in my steam library (what i do, finally, pretty sad huh?)third: the character creation: so let see: choose a metahuman race: check! noteable difference betwenn? nope.rp backstory: yup. two line, three maximum. never use after that in the game, for what i could see.clothing: yay, ""lot"" of choice. impact on the game: nope.weapon: yup, one of each for the beginning.(then you been throw in the hub after a tutorial mission with the less creative thing i've seen in a videogame: you wake up, confusing, without any idea of where you are.....i mean, c'mon guys, the ""oblivious"" character background was so used, and missused, and re-used again....it's even not a good starting point for a scenario (and, after playing pen and paper rpg, it's the most common trick made by lazy people writing,  playing or mastering games!!!)did i miss something? oh, yes, my favorite part: tactical ! i've brievly write above the overwatch, but it's not the worse.the worse is when you realize whatever you do, or don't do, the enemy will come point blank, for the most part when you pinned down by a sentry turret. And, for some, like the bargesth, they cause fear, meaning you will go running out of your cover. Of course, you could shoot those mob before and...in fact no, you can't, because they're pop out of blue!for the end, the multiplayer aspect of the game: i've not try it, first of all because of the connectivity wich i mentionned before, and, actually, that don't really interest me much. I like to play solo, for discovering the story ....oh, wait, the game haven't one...maybe i will try, one day then...in short: if you like Shadowrun, do you favor: don't spend your money in this game. not now. maybe when the game was in full release, but now it's more an pre-release alpha, after the alpha and beta, if you see my point.Try, if you want a good story, Shadowrun returns and/or Dragonfall director's cut. Even the Infamous Microsoft Shadowrun / clone of CS/ not even a story/it's a FPS? game was funnier to play. "

												A heartwarming coming-of-age adventure as timeless as the world itself. Stars a young woman of color growing up on the unforgiving stage of the Boston underground and who against all odds, succeeds with the unlikely support of her scrappy band of streetwise friends. Lead protagonist Fantasia Dinklemore takes you inside her world, one which will charm your imagination and reawaken the young soul in your heart once again. It is whispered, among people of class and influence, that Fred ""fishfingers"" Manstachio wept with joy when this title was revealed to a shocked and surprised audience at the 2015 E3 pet expo & RV showcase.

												UpdateLag has been reduced to normal levels, and there are far fewer connection difficulties. I have since encountered different issues, such as the weapon vendor having a blank screen no matter how many times I restart so that I can no longer progress my character's weapons. Now that I've gotten a chance to play the game I'm disappointed that the only benefit I get from being a hacker, or a lockpicker is the chance to get an extra pair of pants or a skimpy bikini. I started a couple of other characters as well, but there is very little variation between the them. Hackers are essentially crappy ranged attackers with a couple of stun abilities. Gameplay is still very much like other negative reviewers have described it, you'll fall asleep if you don't have a friend goading you into playing and keeping it lively. The best Shadowrun game is still on a cardtridge or a piece of paper, and maybe if gamers stop defending every piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥cashgrab that caters to their interests you'll get a quality game someday.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This is the current experience.*TRY* to log into or create a character, this might cause the connection to hang requiring any number of restarts. Some of your characters might be lost to you for hours on end.Connect to your friend, sometimes spending hours wondering why your friend in the same room can't find your instance or mission lobby. When the server manages to find someone, it will still take forever while the connection hangs. During any of the loading processes, you may have to shut down the character and repeat the hellish login process.Once you're in a mission, expect 2-60 seconds to have every single action recognized and processed by the server. Turns that should take 10 seconds will take 3 minutes. The sync time between players will be radically different, so don't expect your horrible experience to be equal. During loading times, watch the same worthless human filth or games journalists that recommended this game on Steam explain that 'this is normal' on an annoying general chat, because even though this is a bad single player game with awful multiplayer options, it was retooled from an even worse mmo. Although not long enough to have the benefit of a persistent world, or  a group-finding system other than spamming the general chat with ""LFG"", ""DID YOU INVITE ME?"", ""SORRY I COULDN'T ACCEPT THE INVITE BECAUSE MY GAME CRASHED TEN TIMES"".The game itself is undeniably shallow but approaching mediocrity WITH a coop partner, and I won't waste any more time than that explaining it because you simply should not be buying this game.

												The game is unfinished as of this review 7/12/15. I'm sure they think it is finished and will release DLCs for future updates. If you think it would be fun to play a game like the SR Returns/Dragonfall series in multiplayer, this seems fairly appealing. The trouble is that everyone you will play with will be max level and trying to farm more skillpoints. Then when the story does end you're left to do the same. There is no true decking subgame. There are no custom missions or procedurally generated content, so the maps can get old pretty quick after you finish the story. Anything past the main story is very grindy and unrewarding.Sadly, I cannot recommend this as more than a $5 sale purchase, even then, only if you love shadowrun and want to play something that will feel like a grindfest. 3/10			"

								Current build is a mission grind, has no working skills, and of the tools, only grenades work.  Previous build had working tools, rewards for skills (& they worked), etc... No reason given for the removal of all rewards but a fixed 6 Karma for completing a mission.   Skill trees make no sense like needing ""Organ harvesting 3"" (costing 64 Karma) to get your Summon Bear Spirit for 81 Karma at end of summoning tree (That ""organ harvesting"" doesn't work is just rude).Development is slow, and took a step backward this month, still hoping it becomes a fully playable game someday.

IntroductionShadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown is a turn-based tactical game that has a similar battling system to XCOM. It's part of the Shadowrun series, but doesn't really seem to fit in with the other games that where mad ein thsi series. It has it's good and bad points, one of the main points being the new 4 multiplayer co-op mode that adds a bit more depth to the game itself from the other games in the series.GameplayShadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown starts with a really nice character design screen. ou are able to design your character, it has a large variety of tools that you can use to make your character unique and what you want yiur character to look like. Unfortuantly, this customization isn't carried over to the AI that are with you, letting the game down a little bit, but not by all that much. It would've been nice to be able to fully be able to customize your entire team, but it's not possible in this game. The missions do start off rather well, you might get a feeling that you are playing in XCOM, but with a cyberpunk feel and many different characters. Although to start off with the missions seem to be nice and flexible, it does start to get that feeling of just being the same mission, but with a different location that you are in and different enemies that you have to kill. The weapons that you can equip on your character seem to be all nice, and they all seem to be different from one anther. But in actual fact all the weapons that you find aren't really all that great, you don't really get that satifaction when you find a weapon in this game. I would say that playing co-op with some friends on this game would definatley be recommened, just because your friends will probably bring along useful items and equipment rather than the AI. It also makes it run a lot faster than having to play single player with the AI running with you as well.The graphics of the game are great, and what really helps the game pull itself back up from some of the negative things that I have listed above. The graphics of each area that you go into seem different from the last and gives you a new change of scenery throughout the game. The lighting and shadowing isn't really focused upon that much throught the game, but some points here and there did stand out to be rather nice looking and such.Pros+ Fun Cooperative play+ Great character customization+ Nice Graphics+ Trading Cards & AchievementsCons- Samey sort of missions- Not fully customizable squadResult / Final thoughtsShadowrun Chronicles - Boston Lockdown is a fairly fun and enjoyable game. I would recommend playing it in short bursts of say 30 minutes - 1 hour, as you may get bored of the samey missions and not come back to the game. The graphics are well designed and the character customization is well done.For more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Sometimes You Playing curator group here. "

												This is a good game.  The people complaining it's not strategic enough either have not played very far, or want it to be an exact clone of X-Com.  Although there's no overwatch button that you're forced to press about 1000 times per mission, it has it's own mechanics that make it interesting.  The game's storyline is not going to win any awards, but by the end I did want to know what would happen.  You can also click past all the dialogue if you choose to.  Shadowrun fans will be surprised to learn that Decking now does damage in the meat space.  However, after some thought, this makes sense both for gameplay and for lore purposes.  Throughout the game, the story seems to assume that datajacks now wireless and that every metahuman has one, two assumptions that would have been far-fetched in 1980s, but are obvious to today's cell phone culture.  Since wireless networks are inherently capable of peer-to-peer connections, I think it's actually logical that IC damage could happen even without connecting to the (server-based) matrix.  Of course, from a gameplay perspective, standing around while the team's decker entered the matrix would be pretty boring, so the changes are also necessary to make Shadowrun multiplayer.  For those who prefer single player experience: My Rifle/Decker character was able to complete the entire main story and all side missions with no grouping; only the post-game challenge mission requires grouping.  Some missions were a little tough, so there are probably some character builds that would require grouping for the main game.  For first time players: You will have enough experience points, money, and weapon slots to choose two of the main damage ability trees: Shotguns, Handguns, Automatics, Blades, Blunt, Spellcasting, Summoning, Decking (Hacking), or Rigging (using robotic drones).  For those learning the game, I recommend you choose Automatics or Shotguns for one of your two skills, and whatever you want for the second.  You could also pair Hacking with Spellcasting or Summoning, or Rigging with Spellcasting.  Don't pick both melee skills, both magic skills, or both minion skills (Rigging and Summoning), at least until you know what you're doing.			"

It's a classless system, and different builds allow for a nice selection of playstyles.Missions: Good variety and a fun overall storyline. I enjoyed my full, single-player run of the campaign.Multiplayer: The community is very open and willing to teach, and I've never had trouble finding pick-up missions.Here's to hoping the game receives future expansions - I'd love to play them.

												After playing the game through to the end a few times now, i do like the potential this game offers, though there is still much that could be done to improve it:- No trading as of yet, would be really nice to trade some of the rarer gear doubles i have for the pieces i actually want, i would like to see either player to player trading or a vendor you can exchange your good gear drops (from challenges) for the pieces you havnt been lucky enough to get.- The combat is good though i find myself missing constantly but at the same time find myself causing critical hits just as often, the luck component in the combat does make for some really interesting kills/deaths.- End game is a dead end, after you finish the story and the new infection missions, your only choices are to find another player who isnt maxed you can help through the story, make a new runner, or do challenges, being only two challenges they start to get boring.All in all the game is really fun and i find myself playing it every day, it really does emulate shadowrun nealry perfectly, and im sure the game will continue to take off thought please, add in that trading, and maybe some single player stuff for end game, challenges were not meant to be done with the henchmen :)			"

I am unimpressed due to a particular message 'no connection, server shut down'.  WTF it's 2015 FFS include an option to play offline for those that just want to play solo for awhile.  At the very least sort out the server so your players do not start to rage quit due to frustration.  Gave the game a thumbs up at first but that has now changed.  Boston Lockdown should read Server lockdown, the lag is once again horrendous.  Give the game a few months and it may be worth the money but at the moment it just isn't.			"

												UPDATE: I cannot recommend this game since it is Abandonware currently. The devs. are busy with other projects and not able to expend any effort for the game. It is not clear if and when the devs. will give their attention to the game again as of 29-Nov 2016. I'll keep my rate positive though, because I had a lot of fun with the game and basically it is a good one.---  I came to Shadowrun relatively late only in 2013 when the video game franchise has been rebooted with Shadowrun: Returns. Since then I became a huge fan of the series and played all released PC games so far, including Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown.I especially fall for the title made by Cliffhanger Productions due to its online/multiplayer feature. It is a really great experience so far and I must admit that I got addicted a bit recently. Let me summarize Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown:It's a classic turn-based strategy (TBS) game like XCOM (as often mentioned), Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate or the rebooted Shadowrun game series made by Harebrained Schemes and unifies the best aspects of all mentioned TBS games. Its simple controls and game basics on one hand and its partly very challenging combats and missions on the other hand are in sum appealing to both, 'old hands' and rookies. A bonus are the RPG elements and the skills system, which are similar to Harebrained Schemes' Shadowrun games, but slightly rearranged. Right now, there are already wide possibilities of skills and skill combinations, e.g. decker, rigger, shotguns, blades, blunt, shaman etc.  The game mechanics are based on the fifth edition of the Shadowruns tabletop game and its very potent licence, meaning if you're into cyberpunk, science fiction, dystopia and love the Shadowrun universe, this game is for you.Unfortunately, there are some drawbacks as well. Even though there are relatively much missions to play, lot of them are short or seem kinda inconsistent story wise. In general lacks the story in excitement and depth and gains momentum only late in the story progress. Therefor, some side missions are really interesting and challenging and a lot of fun (but are taking place on recurring maps of the main campaign though). The missions are more fun in cooperative multiplayer with fellow 'Chummers', but sadly it can take quite a while before you get fellow players together since the game is a little depopulated currently. In other words, you are depending on prebuilt henchmen sometimes, whose character development you cannot affect or control. Thus, they are a little 'underpowered' but should be enough powerful for the main story campaign. The interaction with other players is also kinda awkward, since there is no direct chat (whispering) implemented and basically there are only two chatrooms in total existing; the global chat and the party chat if you teamed up with other players. This can be a bit annoying sometimes but is still to handle.Good thing is the developers still add content to the game and have much plans for the future. The support by the game developers, Cliffhanger Productions, is outstanding; very curteous and extremely kindly (and fast!). That's why I rate this game positive. Again: if you're into Shadowrun, TBS and Fantasy, support the devs and that hidden gem and buy it! My judging:3.5/5			"

												SRR and its cadre were made by a bigger team with a much-bigger budget and more time to really flex. That being said, while Cliffhangar has worked their asses off and spent many sleepless nights slaving away, having the same expectations for SRC that you have for SRR is going to disappoint you.Does that mean SRC sucks? Not at all. I quite enjoy it, and I invite you to see my profile for the hours I've put into this and the Returns series. If you are a big fan of the Shadowrun lore and universe, I'd be surprised if you didn't like this one.This game does require a perpetual Internet connection, even if you're playing with NPC henchmen. The online aspect of this game is amazing and really helps prevent the ""ho hum doing this kind of mission again"" burn-out you might feel. We have quite a few character slots so you're free to explore different characters. The cosmetic options are pretty flexible and certainly helps capture the eclectic look of shadowrunners.Unlike SRR this game has voice-acting, although some people cringe at it's B-movie quality. Still though there were a few VA's I enjoyed. However your runner in this game is pretty static. You don't really have control over your personality or dialogue, so you won't feel the same you did in the SRR series.As for the combat, it uses a some-what simpler form of X-Com: EU and SRR. There's still cover (just half and full in this case), but combat itself is very brutal in this game. It's not uncommon for an average runner to only have between 15-23 hp. In fact, end-game runners might just barely clear 40 hp. So if you or an enemy make a mistake, you might very well die from it.Speaking of death, there's really no penalty. If your henchmen dies, oh well. They'll be there next mission, good as new. If a fellow player dies, a timer starts counting down (representing them bleeding to death). If you can't finish the mission in time, you automatically fail. If you do fail a mission, just brush yourself down and try again.Unfortunately, at this time there is no matrix. You have a few times you visit a node to chat with campaign Chummers, but no actual Matrix involved in runs. I'm sure down the line they will implement a more proper form, but for now you're stuck in meat-space. So what the Hell does a decker actually do in SRC then? They use their deck to shoot a dial-up laser of death, which deals a type of damage most enemies are vulnerable to. It also ignores cover and line-of-sight issues. Decking skills can stun or mark enemies, making them easier to hit.At this time the respec option hasn't been completed, so you are stuck with the choices you make for your runner. However the flexibility of your character is still there. You can spec into just about any role you want. Want to be a glass-cannon critting machine? Go for it. Want to hang back and use drones and/or spirits to wade into the fray? Go for it. Want to throw caution into the wind and go melee? Up to you.			"

												Great game. At first the turn play was off. Like I do not like how shotting ends your turn, still kind of don't. But as the game progresses, you can get haste and other skills that give you and extra turn. The progression allows for the strategy to become more complex and requires more planning and actually getting better at using your teams skills together.			"

												Cyberpunk Fun, but please let me carry my katana, and pistol at the same time as a deck and necklace(and the glowy necklace should go around the players neck). I can carry a sword and a gun while wearing a fancy watch and necklace, why cant my big bad game dude?But apart from not being able to carry stuff around, cut sceens just show walls half the time, and the fact that some vendors have no voice, and players dont move until you pick someone else sometimes, It is still good. I just like the world because its the only game you get to hack and shoot fireballs with your friends(none of my friends have this yet)everything looks great, the music is good, even with its problems I say Shadowrun Chronicles is theBest Hacking/fireball shooting chess game around			"

												I'm an unrepentant fan of the Shadowun setting. This meant that I ended up buying Chronicles sight-unseen on the back of my slightly hasty enthusiasm. The lag should have ended that enthusiasm and in a way it did... except somehow the strength of the core tactical game kept dragging me back for ""one more run"". The story is servicable, and the world-building slightly showing its seams, but the game underneath has sold me. If Cliffhanger make good on their post-launch content plans I'm pretty confident this is one I'll be regularly dipping back into for a good while yet as a fun bit of tactical filler.			"

												A great game, especially with friends.Although it does lack the depth and features of Shadowrun Returns/Dragonfall/Hong Kong, they are still adding features, albeit at a slow pace (due to legal issues over at Cliffhanger Games).I recommend this game, though, even with the flaws and shaky uncertainty of the state of the company at this time.  One glimmer of light was the July 1 letter/update that announced continued work on the game, a new patch (with features) to be released in a couple weeks, and a new addon planned for later in the fall.So, pick it up and give it a try, chummer.

												Beside the story this game has nothing to do with the Shadowrun I know and learned to love. If I could, I would want to get my money back. There is no strategic or tactical component in this turn based mess. If they had at least made it a bit like Shadowrun Returns and its successors it wouldn't be so bad. If you really want to buy this, you should wait till it's down to 1-2 € wich surely will not take that long to happen. "

												I really enjoy this game.  It's pretty much what I wanted, which is a co-op Shadowrun Returns.  Unfortunately it's missing some things like overwatch (which it really needs) and the mage skill tree is a bit bland.  But overall, it's a fun romp with a friend and plays like a coop X-Com lite.It might not be worth $30 (or $40 at full price) to most people, especially not solo players.  For me, I wanted to support the devs to add more features to this game, and continue a truly multiplayer shadowrun.			"

												Ok, so I buy this game while it was in Early Access; played it a few days, took a break from it and then came back. Nothing new, nothing inspiring and nothing to keep me playing it once I beat the initial campaign. Yes there are new weapons, cybergear, etc, but one thing I abhor in a game I've bought is the massive amount of grind time that's required in order to attain higher level stuff. I don't mind it on F2P MMOs, cause that is essentially the nature of those games. This one, however, I paid money to get. Forget that. Not happening. Oh and the DLC: the DLC costs so much more that the game itself. I'm a little bit new to the Shadowrun Franchise. Dragonfall was my first game of the series I bought, then DMS, and then Hong Kong, so I'm not too familiar with the player base nor their affinity towards the franschise itself. However, as a newcomer to the franchise I really believe that this game is one that can be totally bypassed and ignored by other newcomers to the series. This game is nothing like those games and you are better off playing anything else. Literally, anything else: whether it be an online game or single-player game. Just avoid this one.			"

												Update 04/2015: Since primetide took the time to comment on my review I in turn spent some time on another look at the game and updated my review to reflect the current state of the game. TL;DR: I'll take back that ""worst crap"" part of my previous review but the thumb will still point down. Sorry.What I liked- Co-op is implemented finally. I never expected it to become a full blown MMORPG. I actually like the online mechanics which are similar to the first guildwars (never played gw2, no clue if it works the same there). Good move to remove ""Online"" from the title, maybe a bit late ;). I yet have to discover the persitence apsect of the world though. Didn't jump right into my face from the first hours of playing.- Localization is on a good way, there are even localized voiceovers! You would not expect that from an indi game, some tripple-a titles even fail to deliver here.What I did not like- The original Shadowrun game is a roleplaying game with turn based fights as one aspect. Shadowrun Croncicles reduces the whole Shadowrun experience to the round based tactic part of it. ""Shadowrun Returns"" did a way better job transpoting the SR story/rpg elements to the player by implementing dialog decissions and dialog options based on skills. ShadowRun Chronicles is like what Final Fantasy Tactics was for the Final Fantasy franchise. IMHO it doesn't do the IP justice (although I must admit there have been way worse adoptions in the past *cough* microsoft *cough*). Yes, I AM a demanding customer :P- If a GM on a p&p session would have tossed the amounts of enemies at us like the game does - especially when you are low on level and skills and just started - we would have punched him in the face. From the three runs I did, I didn't manage to finish one without repeating it multiple times and still loosing at least one party member in the end. It often comes down to doing a run at least twice so you know what you got to expect and can manage better / do a better choice on the sidekick you take with you. Not my cup of tea.So while there are some positive aspects - for me the negative ones weight heavier. Overall I'd rahter have skipped buying that game. But since I did and the money is already spent I'll keep having an eye on the game and maybe even the thumb will point up one day if the game emerges from a SR rules based tactics simulator towards an SR roleplaying game.

												This game is unplayable. It keeps shutting down every 5 minutes with a message that the connection to the server was lost. I can boot iit right back up again, but I lose all my recent work. Want to save your game often? Nope- only the game can decide when to save. I can't understand why a turn-based game needs a constant server connection, and can't recover from dropouts. I can't understand why I need a server connection at all for a one-player game.			"

												Review Update 5/12/15With the lag problem now fixed I wanted to update my review of the game. A more detailed review to come after I have had a chance to put more time into the game.  For now I have changed the recommendation from no to yes, as I am having fun playing the game right now, and Steam doesn't offer any third option yet. The game is fun but flawed. It is a turned-based co-op game with parties between 2-4 characters with an addition 2 summoning slots for drones and spirits. You can fill out the party slots by hiring henchmen that you will control, by finding other people to join you on a mission, or a combination of both.  My experiences with the community have been great, always willing to answer questions I have and I have not had any problems finding people to join me on missions.  Most of flaws in the game come mostly from the game feeling rushed out of Early Access with parts of the game feeling incomplete or unfinished.   One big plus for the game is the Dev's are still working on the game and have been active in the community and seem to be listing to suggestions,  My main problems with the game right now.1. No whisper or private chat in game. There is no way to talk privately to your friends or just to discuss anything with community members.  So have fun filling the global chat with anything you want to talk about. I shouldn't say no way, you can invite them to your group to chat, but that is only if you are not already in a mission and your group isn't full.2. A lack of information in the game. There is a lot of stuff in the game that is never explained to you in game, and a lack of documentation makes some things very frustrating.  Some examples of this are in the perks you choose. Some will clearly start you will receive a 10% increase to damage or critical hits, where as others will only tell you that you will receive a boost to damage or crit, but never how much of a bonus. 3. No looking for group tool or chat. There is no way to find a group to join, or find members for your mission except to keep calling out in the global chat.  4. PVP focus of the game has Cliffhanger making poor design choices.  This game is focused on PVP, which is not even in the game yet, and because of that they have made a number of poor design choices too keep parity in the classes, rather than focus on a good co-op game.  An example of this is Rigger and Decker  have just been turned into magic users with the Rigger being a Shaman that ""summons"" drones instead of spirits, and the Decker is now a mage that cast ""tech"" spells to attack the enemy (yes, you read that correctly, Decker magic). The Rigger will also compete with any Shaman on your team for a summon spot, as your team is only allowed to summon 2 things.  -original post-Finally, some real game innovation as Shadowrun Chronicles takes a truly unique approach the the turn-based strategy game. With the introduction of new Lag-based™ gameplay that gives people time to multi-task other activities as they try to find time in their busy schedules to play games.  Do you have a book that you just never got around to reading? Well, Cliffhanger Productions has the solution for you with  Lag-based™ gameplay! Thats right, just issue your command to ""walk accross room""  or ""examine item"" and then take your time to leisurely read a page or two as Shadowrun Chronicles waits to complete your commmand. But wait, theres more!  If you buy right now, you will also get to experience the thrill of the new Never-Sure™ technology. Thats right, as the tension builds as the seconds tick away, you will experience the glory of Never-Sure™ as you think to yourself ""maybe this isn't lag, maybe I just didn't click the mouse"". Yes, Never-Sure™ technology will have you questioning your sanity at the 20 second mark, and have you convinced at the 30 second mark that this time you really did forget to click the mouse button; but then as if by magic your charicter finaly opens the door and you breath a sigh of relief.  Never-Sure™ technology will ensure each move you make will send you on a rollercoaster ride of emotion; hope, fear, anger, sadness, will all be yours with each command you issue.			"

												Having enjoyed the other Shadowrun games I got this expecting more of the same.  I was dissapointed to say the least.  When you spend more time picking out your characters underpants than their skills something is wrong.  You have two ""Statistics"" both of which offer bland variations of combat upgrades and one or two skills that access locked off rooms in a map.  Melee you pick Blades or Blunt, but don't worry they are effectively identical with the only real difference being a bonus against a particular enemy type towards the end of the line.  Yes, line as skills are simply there to give you abilities that use that item.  You have basic proficiency in every skill from the start and the only real gain from putting points into a skill is a shorter cooldown on some abilities.  Ranged you have the greatest variety of options with a whole THREE skills to pick from Pistols, Shotguns, or Automatics.  Magic is reduced to only two options as well with one featuring different ways to summon the same critter and the other containing both direct damage spells in the game.  Tech based skills get the same gutting as everything else with deckers being possibly the furthest deviation from archetype I have ever seen in a game.  Deckers do not jack in or access the Matrix, instead they have been reduced to crippled mages.  Supernatural enemies are immune to tech damage so there is an entire third of them who you cannot effect and you have only a direct damage ability and an aoe with a medium cooldown.  The mission hub is tiny and could have been completely replaced with a post mission debriefing screen where you decide if you want to buy one of the two upgrades you have for your items and then pushes you on to the next mission.  Instead you have a different vendor for weapons, armor, magic and tech and each has between two and nine items total since there are only three variations of any particular weapon and only two options for armor.  Cyberware? nope none for sale.  All in all if you want a bland easy turn based non tactical blast em up to play with a buddy buy this crap on sale, or better yet buy a couple nerf guns and an egg timer you will have more fun.			"

												This game emulates a recently revived beloved game, but not Shadowrun: Returns. This game feels like XCOM: Enemy Unkown set in the Shadowrun universe except instead of a focus on building your base and squad, it's all about building up your one character. Every mission is heavily combat-focused, there's no dialogue options or speech-skills. Instead the greater focus on combat means missions are built with this in mind with lots of fighting however they're usually quick affairs with longer runs being broken up into several encounters. The game is co-op focused however if you're running solo fear not! The game has a very interesting henchmen system whereby if you are going solo or below the game's (generally) 4-player size requirement, you can place into your team characters made by other players under your control, meaning you can cruise through this game solo if you want.TL:DR - If you want a Shadowrun RPG with a bit more of an XCOM flavour, you've found it. Very good game, 7/10.			"

												Shadowrun Chronicles is a tactical coop game based on the Shadowrun universe which isn't quite finished yet. But on a very good way.Shadowun Flavor:Yes, this is NOT the Shadowrun from Harebrained Schemes, it's not even like it. This Shadowrun is a different approach, a new interpretation. If you just can stand original works, this is not your game.Developement:This game had its bad days, where it was nearly unplayable. This is quite the past and the devs are making great progress. There is nearly allways some of them in the forums and they do care about the opinions of the players. You can see that they are commited to their product and the players. Content: There is enough content to keep you entertained for some hours. If you want, you can play through it in one or two days. After that it gets a litte bit repeating with running the story. But repeatable missions are in the making and should be soon released.Community:Great guys, not many (yet), but mature. Conclusion:If you like Shadowrun and like tactical games, you want to give this a try.If you are looking for an exact multiplayer copy of Shadowrun Returns, Dragonfall or Hongkong, you will be disappointed.

												Having played Harebrained Studios' excellent Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall RPGs I came to Chronicles with information like this is an online-only co-op focused game made by another studio and which initially had some pretty terrible reviews that have since improved with the regular patches. Being a single player person I was wondering whether this game would do it for me but after giving it a chance I have to say it is a good game.While Boston Lockdown may not have the full-fledged RPG mechanics of SR and SR:D (favouring a somewhat simpler skill tree) it is a Shadowrun experience with turn-based tactical combat, good 3D - if simple - graphics and - more importantly to me - you can solo the story campaign without problems if you build your character carefully. The story is interesting and there is character building across the campaign. One thing to bear in mind is that multiple aspects of the rich Shadowrun world (which is a long running pen and paper RPG first) are not fully introduced so it would be better if you play another Shadowrun game first to familiarise yourself with the setting so as to fully enjoy it.Of course this being an online co-op-focused game, the game's hub is one relatively small map that acts as a stop-over shopping and discussion location where you will see other players walking around but you can solo the whole thing without problems. As the main story progresses the hub changes to reflect current events and you do get side missions regularly after the introductory missions are over. The only thing preventing this being a serviceable offline SR game is the always online requirement (saves are server side) and the small easy to ignore chat window on the bottom left. As the developers do not have the rights to make an offline game this is an understandable compromise but I do hope it gets a full offline mode sometime in the future so the game lives on past the servers. The difficulty especially in the beginning is quite high which makes for an interesting challenge and pushes you to plan and execute carefully.So TL;DR: Yes, this is a good Shadowrun game for single player types and scratches that turn based Shadowrun itch in between the Harebrained studios core entries.

												A wonderful chapter in the greatest setting of all time.  Shadowrun is, without a doubt, the best game world that has ever existed.  Some people will disagree with this, but they are wrong.  And Shadowrun Chronicles gets it.  They really have created a product that grabs the vibe of the Shadowrun world as it should be, and they have given us a game that gives you the feel of really scratching for survival in the shadows.  I heartily applaud this chapter of the best fictional setting ever created, and I encourage everyone who stumbles across it to at least give it a chance.			"

												It lacks the depth and scope offered by the other Shadowrun games, but I think this game was never designed to match agaisnt them.What it does offer is some easy-action co-op in a fantastic setting, the visuals and sound are fitting and while no part of this game will amaze, the core of it offers enough for some fun to be had. Perhaps it may be best to see this as a gentle introduction into Shadowrun game format and lore.Only really suited to those that have pals wanting to join them, or willing to find others to join up with, as a solo player game you would be far better off getting one of the other Shadowrun titles.

												I picked up all of the Shadowrun reboots and recently finished Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun Dragonfall. If you want to play Shadowrun Chronicles, be sure to play it before playing any of Harebrain Schemes' games or else you'll be disappointed for sure.Graphics:There are more special FX in this engine, but they use some sort of overlay system for symbols. So if you pan your screen, the symbols will float as they strive to catch up with the background. The spectrals look good and there was a neat effect where I missed a shot and hit a car whose windshield cracked. They also try to do some sort of cinematic zoom-in periodically when you kill stuff. That might be neat when used sparingly, but it did it when I killed a Lvl 1 dog... which was silly.Sound:Music is decent, but the previous Shadowrun soundtracks are more catchy. Voice acting feels like it was done by a bunch of C-list actors. The quality is there, but it doesn't feel believeable at all. It might be because some of the lines that they have to read are terrible, or maybe the lines feel terrible because they read them poorly. In either case, I found myself skipping past most of the voiceovers once I finished reading the text.Gameplay:This is just a Shadowrun themed game, so don't expect it to feel the same as the previous Shadowrun games. The skill trees move away from RPG style characteristics and instead focus on skills. If you played Dragonfall, remember the options that you had for upgrading your secondary characters? It's similar to that except you have to use the same pigeonholes for your main character. Also, hackers hurt people by... hacking at them? They don't have guns, you just click on someone to hack and then little blue data beams fly over and hurt them somehow.			"

												Early Access Review So, imagine a game that's NOT shadowrun.  In any shape or form.  It's a combat only game with no spell variation for mages, no real spells for summoners and NO MATRIX.  Now, take this turn based combat only game and put a drekkin fragtard shadowrun candy shell on it... and that's what you have.If that's all you want... then wiz... this game is for you.  If you want ACTUALLY Shadowrun, then you're drek outta luck - just geek this game now and wait for Shadowrun Hong Kong, because this is NOTHING like shadowrun, other than combat only.To give you an example, deckers cannot deck into ANYTHING and ""hacking"" is a skill anyone can take on the MIND tree... not even on the hacking tree.  If you're a decker, you're basically a ""techno-mage"" with tech based ""spells"" that somehow affect metahumans and tech enemies (robots, drones, etc) but not animals.  If you're a mage, it's just the opposite... you have like 5 spells total... manabolt, manaball, shield, haste and mana surge.  That's it... those are the only spells you will ever cast. And most of them won't affect tech enemies.  And if you get a upgraded spell too early, you may not have enough magical endurance to cast it.As for traditional weapon based skills... you have a whole skill tree for each weapon type (auto, pistol, etc.) You get a massive clip size of 2 or 4 depending on your weapon type, so plan to reload every other turn or so.  Not only that, but the game controls when you can get upgraded guns.Cyberware is EXTREMELY limited, pretty much just making it combat oriented only - with essence cost being an underplayed afterthought.This is a turn based combat only game with a shadowrun wrapper.  But there's nothing Shadowrun under the hood.  As long as you want the ""idea"" of shadowrun and not Shadowrun itself, you should like the game.Edit - Now that it is out, I have only one word to describe it - LAG.  The game is so laggy that you can literally wait 10 minutes to complete one turn, then another 5 minutes for the enemies to move. It's unplayable for all but the most dedicated fanboi's.  No communication about changes, patches, etc.  10 minute notices for server reboots, which fix the lag issue for about 15 minutes.It's terrible and inexcusable.  There wasn't a single STRESS TEST during the entire beta/early release time.			"

												I backed this game early to try and help the development of a Shadowrun game. The results have been disappointing.  It doesn't have much Shadowrun in it, the tactical mechanics are simplistic and uninspired, and the campaign mission tree is extremely unoriginal and  grindy.   Playing this version of Shadowrun gives me no sense what-so-ever of playing the PnP game or the MUCH better Hairbrain Studio games.  It's a weird mix of componets from other tactical game systems without a sense of how to put the parts together.  If xCom and ""Jagged Alliance Online"" got together...this would be their r3tard3d baby.			"

												The dialogue is about as cheesey as it gets. Painfully so. I like shadowrun because it's gritty, but with dialogue and fake boston accents this corny it really takes you out of the game.So far every mission I've played has been nothing but a choo choo train. Toot toot all aboard the one directional missions with almost no extra or side content!The starting area, I assume there's more later, is severely lacking in items. There's only the ♥♥♥♥♥iest cyberware available, not a big selection in weapons and there doesn't seem to be ANY armor.			"

												I find this game frustrating and it has promise. However you have to be online to play and put up with chat bars and lags ruining your gameplay. I wasn't aware of this until I brought the game, not impressed. It needs an offline option. I probably won't play until it does, there goes $30. :(			"

												This game is a very tough Tactical Strategy game and that is a great thing. I love the setting and enjoy the feel of it and some missions trial and error choices are very interesting to try to run through. The gameplay is solid, the artstyle is beautiful, and I love that it is set in Boston and makes constant references to that effect which is a personal bias but it is a plus.Why don't I recommend it though?The servers are absolutely awful, there doesn't seem to be many people on them and despite playing a lot of missions without other players in the world, there is a tremendous amount of lag. Sometimes it takes a full minute for an action to carry out leaving you to wonder if you actually clicked the mouse button or not. If this gets rectified, I will definitely change my review to a thumbs up and would love to play the co-op with friends.			"

												To sum it up, this is a fun online turn based strategy game set in the shadowrun universe that you can play with your friends and aquiantences. Is it perfect? nah... but what really is in this day in age.  This game really scratched my XCOM itch with the strategy being a shade lighter although the expansion deepens this up quite a bit.  I would recommend this to any avid fan of shadowrun (especially if you want to experience a fun boston based story) or to anyone who enjoys squad focused turn based strategy.Pros:-Interesting Story-Solid Gameplay-Online play with friends-Nice voiceacting (this is debated but imo a pro)-Enjoyable soundtrackCons:-Lackluskluster hub area-gets the job done but could have been more-Cameral angles in my opion can be pretty rough, often times staring at a wall or ground while the action is happening-Depending on hours of play can be tough to find a group of players although expansion has brought the population up quite a bit			"

												I bought this game during it's early access stage back in February (Yay taxes!), and I've watched it grow since then. I would pop in and out from time-to-time to see the companies' progress. I have to say, I am truly impressed with how far this game has gone. At the time I'm writing this, yes there is lag, but when isn't there lag on a game that gets first released? For those of you who know nothing about the game, lag is an issue right now, a big one, but it's getting fixed. The company is active and trying to fix the lag issue. Besides that, I haven't run into anything else. I'm really enjoying the story so far, and if I wasn't busy studying for finals, I would be binge playing this game massively. The graphics are cool, and the customization is fun to play with. I strongly recommend this so far, and if I run into any issues are have more to say, I'll edit this, but for now, go out and buy it. It's worth a shot.			"

												I was talked into buying this by my sister and her boyfriend. I wasn't really convinced at first, but when we started playing, it was actually great fun. We were usually playing together, so I can't tell how easy it is to build a group without knowing players IRL. But with a group leveling up together, it's a neat teamplay experience. Also, it's a game you can play together with your nongamer girlfriend, since you don't have to be a APM genius to play this game, as it's turnbased, and still face a decent challenge.Positive:*) Interesting Skill System*) Diverse Teams pay off, covering each others weaknesses*) Quick Gameplay, one mission usually takes only 20 minutes or something.*) Challenging Gameplay: After the first few Intro missions, you quickly discover that charging in just gets you killed. The game rewards a commando-like gameplay, which I liked.*) Interesting plot. The scale might be a little TOO grand, but maybe that's just me.*) Very interesting characters. I really liked the dialogues, and I also have to really praise the voice actors at this point.*) Going through the campaign once with my friends took me about 30 hrs, although we played a few missions twice when someone had to catch up. I think that's alright for a game that costs 20 bucks.Negative:*) The last few missions were too easy. You got a lot of fancy new skills and equipment, while the enemies didn't get stronger by an appropiate amount. (Thankfully, at least the very last mission was pretty hard again, and a good temporary end for the campaign.)*) The Chat Window is really weird. If you close it, you can't chat with your teammates (and you can't open it with ENTER, just with the mouse). If you leave it open, it stops you from clicking on a considerable part of the screen.*) If you happen to change to a different skill right as one of your teammates does something, the active skill will reset back. Which, when you don't notice it, is extremely annoying and often dangerous. (e.g. you're on a melee skill and wanted to switch to a ranged one, fail to notice it resetting back to melee, and suddenly you charge into a group of enemies.)Generally, I learned to live with the above problems. Sometimes they even made for some very fun moments you could laugh about afterwards. Still think they could improve that, though. TLDR:Surprisingly fun game. Playing it with your friends is awesome. It's a bit like a good action movie.			"

												I currently haven't finished my playthough on the game, but since I'm stuck with the lack of skills description and don't want to frustrate myself choosing poorly or not 100% optimal for final build wise, I'll give a break, until someone cleary my doubts. Though I've played enough to point some flaws and some positive points from the game, so let's start.Positives:++ A new skill system which works very well, all classes are very fun to play and pretty strong on their own ways. Surely riggers is a pretty cheap build to exploit and also pistols seems to be a little too good in comparison to the rest, but since this system is totally new, I've to say, it's pretty good.++ The combat is fun to play, but the same thing, would happen if the consumer buys another shadowruns title, or a similar game from this genre, such wasteland 2, age of wonder 3, xcom, fallen enchantress, endless legends, divinity of original sin, and so on. So, while I do enjoy the combat system, this isn't anything revolutionary, which could be found on another titles, with way less issues, more real content and better price tag offer. + Customization, is both good and bad. It's good because it's a new feature, and welcoming one, still some clothes should've a better texture and polishement.Negatives: --- Lag, some times it spikes from 3 seconds to 15 seconds, from some one who owns a 10mb internet, it's pretty to much. Also, the player may face disconnect on middle of the match, or keep getting a friend disconnected. Yesterday I was playing with a friend, and he got DC 6 times in less than 3 hours, also I just got a DC from a single player game that I was doing, I was very close to finish the match, and since I'm doing SP since the beginning, isn't as easier than co-op, there's no excuse for that.-- The player cannot remove a cyberware part. While some people may argue that this wasn't allowed on shadowruns universe, let me just resume that this game was been made by a different team, different developer, and more than half of things on this game aren't exactly the same from other titles, so there's no point of remove this, to keep a ""balance"" when the system is completely new. Let me tell you what's gonna happen, if you're a new player and found a cyberware piece for 1 essence cost, and just decided that I'll buy them all, because you have 6 essence and it only cost 4, the next improved version will cost 2 each, which means, even if you replace the obsolete version, you'll be unable to upgrade 3 slots and will be forced to stick with 1 useless slot, and another weaker version of something. In resume, you would need 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 essence, but if you buy 4 cyberwares you'll have 2 + 2 + 1 + 1, so 2 slots with junk. There's no wiki, there's no warning, there's NOTHING to tell which items the player will receive and can properly plan ahead, in other words, either you start again from the scract or keep playing with a weaker build.-- Summon limitation. Do you remember how cool it was to choose one rigger/decker, one shaman/socerer, one soldier and another melee or a similar kind of combination, from the older titles? On this one, you can have a maximum of two pets, if a rigger summon 2 drones, means that your shaman cannot summon an spirit (main focues of his tree) or if a shaman summon his spirit the rigger would not be allowed to summon all of his drones (mainly focus on his tree.)Basically, the devs said: ""We've made a very strong unbalanced build, so you're not allowed to play with it, we don't care about how much you want to play with your class abilities, we'll not propely balance it, you'll just not play with it, face it.""-- If you've played shadowruns returns or dragonfall, you'll notice the amount of text lines, and how well detailed always have been. Here everything it's superficial, and most character are extremely annoying with complety redundant texts or lack of. The overall plot however, seems to be ok, ins't a master piece, but isn't lame as above.- Limit of character creation. Do you ever wanted to try all possible combinations and classes? Happens it's not possible, the consumer is allowed to build up to characters and no more than that. - No respec system. What makes it even worse is the fact, a good amount of skills has a terrible description, which means if the player chooses a wrong skill, either he'll stick into it, or restart the game from the very beginning. So it definitely punishes the player for trying and discovering, and for playing, since some skills doesn't gave a proper description for this kind of set rules.- There's no category on hair type and colour, which means instead of choosing 1 hair and then go to another, you'll have to pass from all colours until reach the next type. This is extremely time consuming, and there's only two possible reasons to: 1 - Lazy team.2 - They wanted to give a fake impression of quantity, to deceive people from noticing that there isn't that many amount of hairs types. (Yes, the player is abled to choose a hair type, once the character is created, but why there's no such option for the character creation screen?)- There's no sound track on character creation, and the noise is way too loud when you keep changing things. It's extremely annoying. I've turned my sound off, while I was finishing my character creation.- Bugs. Some skills doesn't worth as description says, some times people are unable to buy things from vendors, sometimes people can't organizate matchs with his friends, some times people can't login into the game. In sume, if you haven't played any shadowruns title before, don't think twice and go purchase dragonfall right now!If you've played shadowruns returns and dragonfalls, and is wanting something new... I would advice you to look for something else instead... This game ins't even close to the predecessor titles quality, it's still good, but not as.They're a different developer team, same than jagged alliance, which some of you guys may be familiarized. Wait 60 - 80% price drop, or move around, that's my suggestion.			"

												After failing to complete every mission in game due to lag time between 5-15 minutes PER move, I was thankfully forced out of current game due to a ""server reset"" announced 2 minutes beforehand.

												Ok right now the game is plague with terrible lag, but even with that I'm enjoying this game.  I mostly play solo.Near enough dragon fall to be a shadowrun game. Use a combat system more inspired from Xcom ennemy within. No playable matrix (at least didn't encounter one).Ambiance good, music great.Art great.I still not finish with the story, so I don't know if I'm right but, not enough weapon / armor / stock in general to upgrade our runner. At least for now. Maybe I will unlock new stock later in the story.If new content appear, I will buy it. Not cosmetic one ! new quest, equipement, level (for now feel like theyre are not enough map at least for the side quest, that happen in the same place (or really look alike place)). I'm curious about the endgame content.I hope it will have a random quest generator and some way to spent your ingame money.You like Xcom and shadowrun, go get it, you are in for at least 10h of gameplay (like a said im still not over with the story)			"

												This game is fun until you run into a single enemy. The infected gangers. They have some broken♥♥♥♥♥LMG that you can't beat. I just lost a mission where 4 of them just sprayed bullets at the guy I was supposed to protect from like 15 squares away, Taking him from 4 armor and 20 HP to dead in just one turn. Like WTF! They make cover completely pointless and there are for to many of them. Since most of the time in this game you have like a 40% chance to hit they just fire 6 times in a cone and will take out all of someone's armor and start into their health WITH JUST ONE. And in a side mission they threw about 10 of them at me along with melee guys and dogs, so I fell back and took most of them out. Then after they have been in almost the same spots for 2 turns shooting at my guys on the last turn they just light up the mage and boom I lose on the last turn because magic. Other than that I really like this game, although overwatch is a must, I cant beleive that isnt in there. The defence missions are nearly impossible without it. Please fix the bloody gangers. They work fine if their are just a few of them but you put far to many of them in the game. Guys with LMG's are supposed to be ""support"" not the entire force.			"

												Summary: Shadowrun is an incredible setting for those interested in SciFi settings and (especially) cyberpunk roleplay. This game is an excellent choice for those who enjoy the Shadowrun single-player games and want to bring a friend in on the action. Good (but not quite great) co-op fun for those who love the Shadowrun tabletop game but for whatever reason either can't gather together in one physical place, or would prefer a computer handle all those pesky rules. Shadowrun is set in a cyberpunk future that combines science and technology with magic in a beautiful coupling of SciFi and Fantasy. Character choices range from the exact precision of the sniper, to trigger-happy run and gunners; from spell-slingers to always-online hackers; from summoning monsters or building and remotely controlling machines to do your bidding, and more! This is a top-down turn-based tactical RPG that (arguably) offers slightly fewer choices in every round of its combat than other great games of its genre (like XCOM: Enemy Unknown), but makes up for that by (arguably) offering a more robust roleplaying experience... THAT YOU CAN PLAY WITH FRIENDS! But in my opinion a few (minor?) setbacks keep this game from reaching its full potential:+ All players act at the same time, which sounds like a good idea in theory (less waiting) but in the end proves to just make co-op strategies more frustrating than they need to be. Take a few moments to plan your perfect strategy? Oh, a half second too slow so your faster friend shot at (maybe missed) your optimal target first. Take another few seconds to device an alternative, finger moves to click confirm but BOOM, your other buddy ran right into your blast range and shagged that up hard. Better have a good voice chat (or have everyone in the same room) and willing to talk strategy or this is gonna get REALLY frustrating. + Because of the above, your view will suddenly shift and yet your input isn't always properly locked out while they act, so a lot of accidental clicking (on actions or on the wrong target area) will occur. You may lose friends over this. Again, communication is key. + The game doesn't adequately explain how having some abilities can't be combined (effectively) with others. I was several new abilities deep into skill trees before the game made it clear that I wasn't able to use more than two types of skills in a mission at one time. This is due to most requiring the player to equip an associated item that enables that skill, and you can't carry more than two of these at once. Example: If you want to be casting spells you'll need to equip an item for that; want to use a sword, you'll use your other slot for the sword. If you then start a mission then you won't be able to summon anything in that mission because you don't have an equipment slot free to add the item that permits use of summoning abilities. + The game doesn't adequately convey that abilities within a skill will NOT generally affect your effectiveness in other skills, regardless of whether their description sounds like it should (Simplified example: Spells and guns are classified as ranged attacks, but the ""bonus to ranged attacks"" ability in one of those skill trees won't make you any better at the other). + Selecting NPCs to accompany your human players in missions is needlessly tedious due to most of the important information you'll want to see about them at a glance is only visible once you've selected them, navigated to that section of their info, and then if it's not what you thought/hoped navigating back to the big list... rinse-repeat.Bottom line though: This is quite probably the best modern co-op turn-based game on the market today.

												This game was on my Wishlist.This game was much anticipated.I was a terribal disappointment.Reasons for not buying this gameYou want an RPG: - It is NOT! and RPG. you get to make 1 choice in the whole game, getting 1 of 2 outcomes. Everywhere else you just play a movie.You expect a challenge and being abe to fail, atleast partially or fully depending on Main or Side quest: - It's but a slight challenge, and failiure is not an option, as you simply replay the level.You expect the Shadowrun RPG system, atleast the core functionallity and system setup: - a few of the same terms and words are the same as the RPG, but it is absolutely not the Shadowrun 1st., 2nd., 3rd., 4th or 5th edition of the game, not even an X.5 edition. It this is the 6th edition, then in sticking to the older stuff. You expect to experience the Astral realm and the Matrix, doing battle and the like: - You never see the Astral and the only scenes in the Matrix is the VR ""living room"" of your Johnson.You expect your active skills and/or knowledge skills to play an active part in the game: - Well the would require it to be an RPG. This part of the RPG system is in no way included in the game.You wish to play a new story on par with Harebrain Schemes's Dragonfall or the intro scenario to the core: - You should go buy a Harebrain Schemes game, and keep on the lookout for who made the game, just like I should have. I got blinded by the lovely ""SHADOWRUN"" name.What did they get right/not-wrong: - The game looks like a shadowrun game, spells, weapons, rigger equipment, decks, drones have the right names. - The language the characters use fits like a glove. - The story in itself isn't bad, about as good as the one in the Shadowrun game Harebrain Schemes started with.The end feeling:  - Someone tried to get this game on the marked at leat a full year too fast, and too late to just use the core/expand on the core, which Harebrain Schems made and placing the story there.  - Too much focus on grafix, and too little on the system.  - The end product is something that calls itself Shadowrun, but either fails in being the RPG system or they wished to make their own system, which makes little sense besides the brand			"

												7/10 Pro: Challenging, Good replay, Much costumization, Good story, Shadowrun franchise. Good and easy co-op.Negative: The infected DLC  solo is so difficult that it really is NO FUN. Gave up in third mission. I miss all the dialogue and detail from the previous games. "

												I havent been paid to review this game ...This game is one of the best turn based games on steam. Better then shadowrun returns & beats the crap out of xcom beyond.The skill tree is well designed allowing you to form synergies & playstyles of your own, making it far superior to shadow returns & xcom beyond.The skill tree looks simple at first, stick with it & level up a 2nd tree, such as a shaman for buffs or rigger for extra damage, or melee for manuverability.This is what makes Boston chronicles vastly superior to shadowruns dry gameplay, which penalises you for branching out of the skill tree.Wanna make a perma haste decker, or a melee wielding runner & rip up maps with great multiplayer? Or a cram addicted crackhead? This game allows for a customised experience, mix & match skill trees with little in the way of penalties This gives it a more interesting, well designed gameplay & faster paced gameplay then shadowrun returns dragonfall. Boston Chronicles has alot more personality with voice acting instead of the dry & sjw writing of shadowrun returns, which shoves a leftist agenda down your throat.Boston chronicles also has better customisation then shadowrun returns, with thousands of options for clothing, facial & hair options.No player looks the same, with free drops for neon glow in the dark tattoos & even cool looking glowy shoulder pads ...The solo game is also great, allowing you choose over 20 mercs to help you.It needs a match maker, & a few more maps, but theyre all due for release next week.The deluxe version gives you extra character slots & alot more weapons & customisation options.

												Don't buy this if...You are looking for a story and feel like Shadowrun Returns/Dragonfall Hong Kong.  It does not fit the bill.  The voice acting is not particularly good, the story seems light.You are looking for your Shadowrun tabletop ""fix"".  While it bears the name and uses some of the lore and concepts (hacking, rigging, spellcasting, races...), the system looks very little like the Shadowrun tabletop game.Do buy this if...You are looking for squad based strategy RPG with a cyberpunk theme.  It is a nice game in that regard. "

												This game has simple but aesthetically pleasing graphics, nice character outfit customization with a large variety of items (gotten at random from missions) and gameplay which is easy to learn but can be hard to master. It's turn-based strategic shooting in the same vein as Fallout Tactics or Xcom, though with less focus on the story aspect.The game has its faults, chief among them the chat system which at this time offers no way to communicate privately with other players, as well as frequent disconnections from the servers which ejects you from the game entirely. However despite this, the enjoyment factor is extremely high and the game is never more fun than when you have four players in the same experience range taking on a mission together.The co-op element, whether you are two players with a NPC each or a full team of four, really makes me happy with this purchase. And as it stands, this is my favourite co-op game of the year (and in several years). If assembling groups was a bit easier, the communication more streamlined and the characters a little more customizable, it would a must-own title.As-is, I would recommend to to anyone who likes tactical co-op or shadowrun/sci-fi. For anyone else it might be a gamble.			"

												Things I like: - the combat system; turn-based fits this perfectly, 2 actions/turn works well in keeping things challenging but still leaving every mission possible to complete.- the leveling system; you can have any combination of primary/secondary weapons. EXP is not earned through killing, but instead through completing missions.Things I dislike:- Skill trees are too simplistic.- You cannot trade items with other players.- You cannot trade money with other players.- You cannot sell extra pieces of clothing.  (Why do I need 5 of the same top?!)- It's neat that in a 2-person party you get to each add a character on 4-man missions from the available runners for hire.  It sucks that some missions give you additional NPCs on top of that to control, and they're all under the control of the party leader.  If you're not the party leader you can be waiting for them to move up to 4 characters (including their own) and any summons they've got as well.  Kind of boring.- You see the same maps over and over.- You do the same quest over and over...just with a little extra story flavor, and on a different map then last time.  ""Go protect a 2x4 area of this map.""  ""Go protect a 3x3 area of this map.""- Very linear storyline.  No reason to play again after beating the game.- There should be a confirmation message when buying things instead of the game just taking your money.- Why can't I instantly resell something I've bought on accident for full price?  I haven't left the store.  Why do I only get 1/10 the price I paid back?- The voice acting is kind of annoying.  Why doesn't every shop npc have a voice?It's a fun game, but I don't ever see myself playing it again once I've completed it.			"

												Summary: Shadowrun is an incredible setting for those interested in SciFi settings and (especially) cyberpunk roleplay. This game is an excellent choice for those who enjoy the Shadowrun single-player games and want to bring a friend in on the action. Good (but not quite great) co-op fun for those who love the Shadowrun tabletop game but for whatever reason either can't gather together in one physical place, or would prefer a computer handle all those pesky rules. Shadowrun is set in a cyberpunk future that combines science and technology with magic in a beautiful coupling of SciFi and Fantasy. Character choices range from the exact precision of the sniper, to trigger-happy run and gunners; from spell-slingers to always-online hackers; from summoning monsters or building and remotely controlling machines to do your bidding, and more! This is a top-down turn-based tactical RPG that (arguably) offers slightly fewer choices in every round of its combat than other great games of its genre (like XCOM: Enemy Unknown), but makes up for that by (arguably) offering a more robust roleplaying experience... THAT YOU CAN PLAY WITH FRIENDS! But in my opinion a few (minor?) setbacks keep this game from reaching its full potential:+ All players act at the same time, which sounds like a good idea in theory (less waiting) but in the end proves to just make co-op strategies more frustrating than they need to be. Take a few moments to plan your perfect strategy? Oh, a half second too slow so your faster friend shot at (maybe missed) your optimal target first. Take another few seconds to device an alternative, finger moves to click confirm but BOOM, your other buddy ran right into your blast range and shagged that up hard. Better have a good voice chat (or have everyone in the same room) and willing to talk strategy or this is gonna get REALLY frustrating. + Because of the above, your view will suddenly shift and yet your input isn't always properly locked out while they act, so a lot of accidental clicking (on actions or on the wrong target area) will occur. You may lose friends over this. Again, communication is key. + The game doesn't adequately explain how having some abilities can't be combined (effectively) with others. I was several new abilities deep into skill trees before the game made it clear that I wasn't able to use more than two types of skills in a mission at one time. This is due to most requiring the player to equip an associated item that enables that skill, and you can't carry more than two of these at once. Example: If you want to be casting spells you'll need to equip an item for that; want to use a sword, you'll use your other slot for the sword. If you then start a mission then you won't be able to summon anything in that mission because you don't have an equipment slot free to add the item that permits use of summoning abilities. + The game doesn't adequately convey that abilities within a skill will NOT generally affect your effectiveness in other skills, regardless of whether their description sounds like it should (Simplified example: Spells and guns are classified as ranged attacks, but the ""bonus to ranged attacks"" ability in one of those skill trees won't make you any better at the other). + Selecting NPCs to accompany your human players in missions is needlessly tedious due to most of the important information you'll want to see about them at a glance is only visible once you've selected them, navigated to that section of their info, and then if it's not what you thought/hoped navigating back to the big list... rinse-repeat.Bottom line though: This is quite probably the best modern co-op turn-based game on the market today.

												Nice visuals, atmosphere and gameplay, but just too many problems to really be fun. The worst issues for me:1) Expect to crash about once or twice per hour. Any crash means a mission restart, although so far that has only happened to me at the very beginning of missions and at the hub.2) The lack of overwatch simplifies combat so that there is little tactics involved - just head for cover and shoot.3) There is no offline mode. Not a big problem for me atm, but would be nice to have, and can be a huge problem if you don't have good unlimited internet. Not really a fan of having other characters standing ""inside of me"" all the time at the hub either.			"

												This is a great Tactical Combat game.The background is set in the Shadowrun World, The story is cool (Not awesome, not terrible either). There is a Multiplayer HUB with merchants and a Street Doc where you will gather almost all the quests of the game. When you got the streets to do the runs (quests) you enter a turn based combat with 3 friends or NPC henchmen. The combat is really good. It also gets a huge improvement when you have a friend or two (or three) to play with. Henchmen are really hollow and one of the downside of the game. The progression system is awesome and the grinding is fun enough and encourage players to help one another. The devs seems to play a lot of attention to the forums and player feedback, wich is great.The biggest downsides for me are:01: No PvP,02: No Trade,03: Hollow Henchmen.I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes the Shadowrun Universe and Turn Based Combat. The RPG (In a story sense) is good, but won't hold the game by itself.P.S.: Also, I'd recommend you to get the Deluxe Edition or the Infected add-on. It add a few (really few) missions, but those missions are HUGE!!!Peace,Leos.			"

												Boston Lockdown may not be Harebrained style RPG, but it's still a proper Shadowrun experience. It's basicaly what Fallout Tactics was to Fallout 1&2 - a tactical game in universe you can't get enough of.  The writing and story are decent and even if it's (very) rough around the edges, it still gets ""the feel of Shadowrun"" right and thats probably the most important thing. Oh, and the humor is great - the protagonist is a true shadowrunning wiseass.Sure, it gets repetitive and after few hours you will be running the same locations over and over again (with different story behind the run though), but it's still a game I'd recommend to Shadowrun fans. Others may want to wait for a sale.			"

												Rateing: 7/10TL;DR:This game is made to be played with friends. Its not a ""true"" port from the table top experience but it adds various tools and takes away some of the more time consuming aspects of the table exp.If you want a game that is fun to mess with, and pretty fun when ever you want to play a table top RPG but don't want to get TOO involved in it, this is your game.It's fun and not too involved making it a great game to jump into and play a couple missions on.The main point is the teamwork aspect, making this a great 4 person co-op game. Great runs filled with great laughs.The setup of the runs are great and offer a plethora of multiple avenues to take.When you move in position just to get flanked by 4 jazzed gangers only to be grenaded by your fellow chummer means you're gonna have a great time.If you don't have friends you're going to find the game a bit boring and not that fun.The story is lackluster but it peaks at certain points.The lore is nice and the atmosphere is quite immersive but if your looking for a great and enthralling game this may not be your cup o'tea either.

Early Access Review
								I'm fairly disappointed. Now, let's start with the good. Models and graphics are pretty good, actually -- ragdolls are nicely done, too. Visually, this game is decent. Soundtrack and setting tend to reflect the universe very well! It's almost like a throwback to Shadowrun Returns for me, especially with the organ mission. The game itself feels clunky and customization fairly limited. Where I looked at my character in Shadowrun Returns and even Dragonfall, and was in love, I couldn't quite say the same. Understandably, the skill trees have been condensed and simplified, but it doesn't help someone who came from one game where it felt like having complete say in a character to one of the same setting and having very, very little. Comparatively, there's little -- if any -- attachment to the lore or setting. All of it seems very arbitrary. All in all, not worth the $29.99 charged, but also not a terrible game in its own right. I do wish I had tried something else, though.So far, for early access -- not bad. Not bad, but not very encouraging. I'm hoping things develop more along the way.			"

								Actually I am pleasantly suprised at how addictive this game can be.The things I like so far are:*Easy to just get right into things, there is enough just in the storyline to spend quite a few hours upgrading skills, searching for loot, upgrading gear etc.*The cybernetic implants add a nice boost for non spell casting toons.*Shaman and Riggers can get pets/droids, learn skill updates etc which provide good support options.*Grouping was easy, just a click and done.*Grouping is enjoyable and being a turn base allows time to think out your next move.I recommend this game if you are on the fence or looking for a new MMO to time sink your life away.Good fun.

Lots of lost connections, lag and server crashes. Highly recommend waiting till the game is ""functional"" as it cannot be played offline.Now as far as the game/content. Fun! I'm a huge fan of Shadowrun and it's nice to see some Shadowrun story emerge. For Shadowrunners, please be aware the systems are completely unlike the RPG. The system is clean, easy to understand and the interface is clear. The turn based combat system is perfect for people who want an enjoyable online RPG but are distracted by other things (like kids).			"

												I bought this game because I really like Shadowrun: Dragonfall. I regret it. This thing is terrible. First: There's no tactical depth. You cannot set your guys to overwatch. You can't even bloody shoot and then move (it's move and then shoot only). This results in a game where your 'tactical' options consist of blandly moving from cover to cover and tossing dice at enemy soldiers. Is it ""hard""? Sure. You'll take a crit to the face and be decked. HP is so low and healing options are so limited that that'll probably be it for you. But is there any strategy to it? Very, very little. This isn't XCom or Dragonfall and options are too limited to make it a true tactical experience. Second: The story is rubbish. You don't get dialogue or roleplaying choices, just some (horribly acted) dialogue that strings together some incredibly mundane and uninspired missions. ""Go here and shoot these guys for some contrived reason"". I like the Shadowrun universe, but if you're going into this expecting to find anything resembling the Glory side story from Dragonfall, then prepare for disappointment. Third: There's no enemy variety. For the first few hours of this game all you are fighting are shirtless dwarves with baseball bats and dogs. You could at least change the colour of the dogs or something guys. Everyone also uses the same sound file, so expect to kill a bunch of female enemies that grunt like men when you drop them. Talk about lack of polish. Fourth: The game is plagued by bad design, bugs and lag issues. Take a look at the community hub and see the company begging for forgiveness. It's pathetic and these guys clearly weren't ready for go-time. I've had to Alt-F4 out of the game multiple times because I joined the party while talking to someone.  Sometimes I'll use a skill and have it go into cooldown and nothing will happen. You can moan about this being the first week of release or whatever, but that doesn't make any of this♥♥♥♥♥♥close to being acceptable.Fifth: Every time a mission ends, you have to spend a minute slogging back to a green 'mission complete' zone to end it. This is ♥♥♥♥ing tedious and makes me sick. All in all: This game is about a year of design away from being even remotely good. Do not buy it, not even on sale.			"

												This is by far the worst game with the name ""Shadowrun"" that i ever encounted. Everything roleplay specific is so much reduced in this game, that it could almost count as point and click adventure. Ok there are Several different skill trees to invest the karma into but..each purchased ckill a skilltree gives a different bonus, so that it is im impossibe to fully focus on hitpoints, to hit or dodge untill you feel satisfied. Its rather a jack-of-all-trades skill system. that leaves you almost no choice to specialize. Oh and two hits on your char means..death..wow. I mean perhaps i am spoiled with HBS shadowrun games but ..well the only thing in this game what is better than in the HBS games is the creation of the avatar..to a degree.I cannot and will not recommend this game.Raiting 1/100			"

												I have all of the Shadowrun games, they are all good and fun to play, but this title is the best of the lot the multiplayer makes it great its alot of fun and very immersive, tonnes of choices for character builds and cool powers for each class to use. At the moment the only problem I'm having is with lag in game and this seems to me a temporary thing just seems they underestimated they sort of player base they would get after the steam launch!Even still, very enjoyable, has replayability and loads of immersion, its an 9/10 for me!I have to edit this because unfortunately while the game is alot of fun and I personally love playing it and can deal somewhat with the lag, I have to mention it's current state. There have been a few launch hiccups (personally I think they underestimated the amount of people who would buy the game on its launch on steam) so, release day there was some serious lag and disconnect issues, which at the moment are being handled by server restarts every 2 hours, which isn't really ideal but the game can be played between resets. I am still reccommending the game but think you need to know there is a temporary server issue.ok as of today 5-0515 the lag seems to be fixed, I could play fine anyways, it's a great game with alot of fun elements, without the lag issues it plays like a dream!

												It's not what I expected, and it's far away from what was announced on the promo videos. There's no legwork, the interactivity of deckers and mages with the elements of the map is so poor (well, for mages there isn't any as long as I know), the coop missions is just to repeat previous missions once and once again... And then there's the 20 daily server restarts due to technical and lag issues, which is funny because this is a heavily instanced game with not so many players to justify these problems. The current state of the game is a bad copy of Shadowrun Returns, with poorer mechanics (for example, no matrix gameplay) and story. It looks like they took away all the interesting points when they changed the name. I hope it gets better soon, or it will have a really sort life.

												Huge dissapointment:( I'm an enormous fan of Shadowrun series and what made me fall in love with it is:1, 2 and the 3 - the intricacy, subtlety and the level of suprise of the story. It's a first game in my gaming history experience that presented a challange in language sense (I mean how often do you use words like 'myopic', 'reneg' or 'eidetic') and I love it!  Every sentence was gem. As a result every character had character, their own idenity. Characters, places, moments..4- Music - very indulging and allowing to really dive into the story.5 - Graphics - beautiful...locations, places..everything6 - Gameplay and interface - great, not perfect, but very good imho.I was so excited to hear of a new episode, Chronicles, then I bought it instantly and that was a shoot in the foot. And here's why:1. Graphics suck! Srsly, are we in 2002 again?? Not only the universe, but the interface as well...guys, did someone actually bother to QA the game? There are spelling errors and the font is just bleah...2. Voice over is B+ average. I did miss voiceover in Shadowrun, but with this I'm happy to go back to no voice at all. And what's with the half voiced and half not? And this clicking after every sentence...3. Character buildup - weird, it has no connection to the series at all. The perks are odd (why can you pick 'hacking' 3 times? What was wrong with using classinc numbering system?)4. Gameplay is a pain - sure, I understand the strategy element, but since you can't really scroll away to far, it almoast feels like you're moving in turtle pace. How many moves do you have to do to get from one corner to the other.5. Interface is confusing - my character died on my first mission and there was this odd icon that appeared stating most probalby that I have 5 turns before I..I don't know...like die completly but I had no idea what to do with it. I couldn't clik on a character, my NPCs where standing directly on her in a desprerate attempt to maybe save her like you would normaly with Trauma Kit in the old Shadowrun but nothing happened and I faid the mission.General look and feel is just revolting. Sorry. From the moment my character woke up in that hospital I was like...whaaaa? what is that? Is this Shadowrun? Reeeeeally? Please, tell me it's not...All in all, if you want to have it, at lease wait for a sale and get it for $4 as in my opinion it's not worth more, and definely not $20 I paid.			"

												For the kind of game that it is, it's rather mediocre in my opinion. I think if you want a co-op tactical game, your money can be better spent elsewhere.Subjective note:Personally, I CBA to play it. I got it in early access, should have known better. Back then it was called Shadowrun Online which may not have been so much misleading as it led me to mislead myself but whatever, that's not my problem with it. Shadowrun in classic terms is an RPG and this is most definitely not that. It's just not my kind of game. Wish I could apply Valve's ""under two hours"" refund rule after 30 days.			"

												This game is far from being a Shadowrun game, Ibought it because of the name, and I truly regret it.  Asking for a refund.If I wanted an ""Online-only"", interact with others kinda of game, I'd be playing Warcraft or such...  Single Player should be handled locally, without the use of a server, and without having to be online, I play the shadowruns games for the story, not for social purpose.So if you're like me, and want a ""Standard"" Shadowrun game, don't buy it, if you're into multiplayer experience, then have fun.Still saying it should be better indicated that this game is online only.

												Siempre he sido un fanboy de Shadowrun, pero me temo que Chronicles: Boston Lockdown no lo puedo recomendar. A nivel de jugabilidad, reduce las cuatro fases de un run (encuentro con el Johnson, legwork, infiltración y pago) a básicamente una (infiltración); a mayores, incluso esta fase le han quitado todos los aspectos de contacto, planificación y sigilo, dejando solo un juego de estrategia por turnos que, en realidad, es una copia cutre de XCOM. A mayores, aunque los no roleros no lo noten, se salta por completo la mecánica de juego del juego de rol, ignorando cosas como que la matriz es wireless o que los espíritus no se invocan x turnos sino por servicios. Al final, por todo ello, la personalización de las clases es bastante menor de lo que debería ser. El coop opcional no lo salva, la verdad.Junto a esto, a nivel gráfico tampoco se salva. Shadowrun es un universo oscuro y cyberpunk, distópico y con muchas sombras... no un despliegue de colores con estilo cartoon. Y no sólo a nivel de texturas y demás, sino el diseño de los personajes es en la mayor parte del tiempo ridículo. A nivel de sonido el juego cumple sin alardes, la música lo mismo, y no tiene voces dobladas. El resultado es un juego que podría haber dado mucho pero no lo da. No sólo no llega a la altura del juego de rol sino que, como videojuego, ni siquiera puedo decir que sea bueno. Un 4.			"

												Ok so for all the people hating on this game. Real talk they said ""Warning this game is tough and it is designed that way"" so for all you haters saying this game is unbalanced or OMG! I got 2 shotted and died its because you probably suck. I've enjoyed the game and the boston accents. Lets just keep it real approx. 12-15 hr main story which honestly isn't bad. HBS is about that long and if you say it isn't thats probably cause you afk or again you suck at it. The Co-op aspect is fun and the community is really nice and role play like there really in the universe of shadowrun. Also i'd like to point out that the people that say this is the worst game ever are dead wrong the worst shadowrun game in history is the FPS released on xbox. Also I see people complaining about graphics but, really come on now? Has any shadowrun ever been graphically nice. NO! I'm a Spellcaster/Blade user and I love it. End game is a bit tidious (also I don't give rats butt about my spell check so if you feel the need to be a grammer nazi go waste your life else where.) I think they did a good job! Waiting for more content since apparently I finished chapter 1. So I assuming there will be more which means it will be longer than a normal Shadowrun game. Anyway thats my review.			"

Then this game is for you.Learning curve is a bit sharp but a few youtube videos of how your character creation effects game play are easy to find.Wish you could make hyubrid classes? This game does not force you to pick a class, you just learn what you feel like doing and go with it. Summon monsters, bring in drones to fight, cast powerful spells, all up to how you want to build without the boundries of ""this is what you picked from the start, cant be good at melee as a spell caster or monster summoner..."" etc.I like it and the people are cool in game.

												I have over one hundred hours clocked in on this game and I simply can't recommend it, as it's blatantly obvious it still is not a solid release candidate.While the gameplay, when you are actually able to experience it, is quite enjoyable, it is marred by a lacking UI, character information and frequent bouts of server lag and other connectivity and game engine flaws that make the bulk of the experience utterly frustrating.As of the time of this review, yet another problem has cropped up: the inability to even log into the game. For over 24 hours, hundreds of players have been unable to play any of their characters, or create new ones as the game's Friend and Chat server already has their accounts registered as online, and as with much of the development team's experience with online multiplayer has shown, a massive oversight has ensured there is absolutely no user-side method to log off such a connection.Combine this with a woeful lack of support communicating with the players and you have yourself an experience tailored strictly for those with a deep passion for the source material, or those with wavering standards for quality in gaming.

Early Access Review
								I can't recomend buying this game just yet, especially because HBS is  making some amazing Shadowrun games that are cheaper than this one.  I understand that Shadowrun Online is still in Early Access, but in the time it has taken them to polish and re-polish this ""Online"" game, HBS has created 3 Shadowrun games.  I really want to love this game, but if you are thinking of buying it, I would say steer clear and just wait for them to do a final release, because it is just so clunky compared to the HBS line of Shadowrun games.

												There are a LOT of problems with this game but I'm just going to list the big ones. 1. This game is inferior to shadowrun returns/dragonfall in almost every way. The writing is worse astheticly the game looks a lot worse with the use of lower quality 3d models as backgrounds as opposed to the digitally rendered art used in the aforementioned games and the game as a whole feels alot less polished than returns. The only way in which it improves upon its predicessors is with Co-op.2. Lack of dialogue options. They have essentially removed the RP part of an rpg. In the 3 hours I played this game can you geuss how many different dialougue options ive seen? 2!! 2! ""hello"" and ""goodbye"". The entire game is scripted with you playing a character whose personality has been determined entirely for you. The ability to change situations based on your characters chosen etiquette (something you cant even do in this game) has been a core mechanic of EVERY shadowrun game, both tabletop and videogame. 3. BUGS BUGS BUGS BUGS BUGS....BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGSSSSSS. Models glitch out, there is clipping everywhere the game is super unresponsive (this may or may not have something to do with the fact that it tries to check in with the server like every 10 seconds)4. It tries to check in with the server like every 10 seconds??? Why? I dunno cause screw you its ""Shadowrun Online"". The current game is experiencing issues similar to Diablo 3 before they added an offline mode. Oh! did I mention that there is (as far as I can tell) NO OFFLINE MODE. 5. This game is heinously overpriced for what it is, I could maybe see recomending this for $ 10-15 once they fix some of the bugs.....maybe.			"

												Our dream come true: an MMO based on Shadowrun.  Only the world is not a true MMO, and the game is basically a linear shooter with some multiplayer capabilities.  MMOs have a wide range of activities you can follow.  They offer RP, crafting, exploration, public kudos, and best of all, when done right, a nonlinear story line that assure if you do not like a few adventures you are not stuck - you just work around them.  The city is a single dorky square with five vendors in it, whose weapons slowly get better as you do.  You never find better weapons on adventures, and while the clothing system is charming it is also limited.The most disturbing thing is this idea that the entire charcter advancement system to endgame is nothing more than a normal MMO's noob area, and that at the end you will get to see the rest of the city in all of its glowing and really start playing,  Only there is no evidence that when you get 10 ranks in two or three areas that you will be released into a huge world, only that the MMO will have ended with a fizzle.On the good side, the game is essentially a late alpha release with a Final Candidate price tag - a not uncommon experience.  That means it could grow.  Open the city up, expand the adventures, loose the linear designs, introduce housing and bars and mass transit, and the rest of the game experience and it could be a winner.			"

												Don't bother, the game requires constant connection to their servers which cannot be fixed and cause horendous lag after two hours of up time. This requires them to restart the servers without ingame notification. There are huge imbalance issues with fighting mobs, unless you are a rigger then you kill everything while your team watches. Expect to die and restart the first mission and every mission after that until you get lucky, as the random mob generator and random number generator can easily wipe out your team.All in all I am dissapointed, I am a fan of the Shadowrun universe and this just renforces the fact that not everyone should be allowed to use the license. If it wasn't gifted to me I'd be clawing to get my money back.			"

												The game was off to a disastrous start with ALOT of lag problems but they seemed to be fixed for the most part.But my big beef with the game is the following. At the kickstart they promised an immersive game where you could more or less roam free and make choices that would make a difference in the world. They promissed a wide range of options/skills/magic etc) They got alot of money via the kickstarter and via sales on steam and after a ridiculous amount of time (two years after Shadowrun Online which started at the same time) they managed to produce:- a rigid gameplay that is even too simple for a SNES game and graphics to boot- NO choices- a ridiculously restrictive skill systemThe ONLY redeeming features are: except for the solved lag, pretty bug free and 'it is shadowrun...barely'I am so disappointed that I want to puke. For me this feels like a major 'take the money and run' operation.			"

												I realize that I have very few ""seconds"" in this game but I arrived at my score VERY early.  It is a ZERO fun game.  Not worth the 0.33 cents I paid HB to get this pile of crap.  In the second level I have a guy with a SHOTGUN! who can't hit the person JUST on the other side of the door.  It is WRONG of so many levels.  Just the second mission, still in the tutorial faze of the game.  And a shotgun from around the corner of the door.  Misses completely and then I get stomped.  To be honest it is not a FUN ""game"".  If this was a high level addon, then it might have served its purpose, but as an ENTRY level it kinda suchs.			"

												I am an avid turn-based strategy/tactics/RPG player and liked the previous Shadowrun games, but this one isn't up to par: Badly written story - a Dragon *and* nanites *and* and AI *and* Cyberzombies *and* two Multicorps?!  I really did not get into the story, esp. with the fairly repetitive scenarios (see next). Badly designed scenarios - no tactics required at all: Go in with henchmen that fill in for your own character's weak spots, kill the first group of enemies you encounter or first wave that appears, reload, get the next group, etc.The only scenarios that I had to play twice to finish them were the one where one must protect a mage and the ""Showdown"". Online playable only - or at least I could not find a way to play the single-player campaign w/o being connected to the server.May be more fun when playing co-op with others - there's always someone online.  But I'm not interested in co-op/multiplayer, and I'm really not interested in replaying the campaign with another character.So if you like online co-op, the game may be for you - but I can't recommend it as a single-player RPG.

												It Is NOT the same as Return to Shadowrun. Very basic system. Combatsystem is closer to jagged alience than RTS. So beware if You think you will continue you adventures from RTS in better graphic's. They have very little commen ground.Also importaint to know its aimed at multiplayer co-op. If you Tend to go solo you will have to struggle with a very lowbuged henchman system were you take 1-3 (i guess either playermade or random generated) henchmen with you for that mission. Theres no party and you cant manipulate the henchmen. They are equipped pre-teamup, and use to very poor equipped. You yourself have 2 itemslots, but only players can utilize that option, hence the npc-henchmen never have a granade or a medpack. Not even a pill to help them. The enemy does. Your party have to share the 2 things you choose to bring. Theres is also no revives, stabalizes or anything in that direction other that the medkit. Did I say your party have to share those 2 things. Your combat options are also very basic and constricted. You have a main and maybe a secondary, most npc's only the main which makes them very specilized to handle enemys. Some are immune to magic and hence the mage have to find other targets to engage as his or her attacks cant harm that enemy and they havent got any options to use melee or alternative weapon. So very arcade'ish. Hopes for the future depth of the combat system complexity isnt high.  If you want online player co-op turn base and dont mind the low complexity this might be fun. If you have standards regarding that you will be happier with the top-down RTS:dragon fall or other. Ufo-series (not x-com). X-com enemy unknows is good though!			"

Most group members die in one hit. I could see how this game would be easy if you got advanced players with no business in such a low level mission to walk you through it. It is a shame. I really looked forward to playing this game, but without any connections to twink me, it is a huge disappointment. Save your money for another game.			"

												Little bit of my background with Shadowrun. Got somewhat addicted with the universe from Mirrorshades from itmejp. Before played in Shadowrun Returns a while ago (wasn't impressed) and couple of days before playing this game, I finished Dragonfall Director's Cut (liked a lot).Visually Boston Lockdown looks bad... very clunky models of characters and that ""sexy edge"" which some outfits should provide is fall flat on its face... fall hard! Probably the best example came to mind - Vampires the Masquerade Redemption. Remember Christof Romuald from there? Models in Boston Lockdown are worse. Excuse me for beginning this er... opinion thingy from graphics, but they are very noticable... not in a good way.Gameplay side in here is also far from scratching me in good places. I was super confused why my character decker had no idea what matrix is even after hacking was in background of that charcter. Also major issue - game is way too much action oriented. Basically hacking is not even close to that level of usefulness as it was in Dragonfall. Gameplay on the field is like XCom. Get to cover, move to flank enemy, shoot to kill! You barely need to use any skills. So far the best class - shotguns and AR. Just flank, shoot. Repeat.Rather disapointing game. I'd even say extremely disapointing to play this after Dragonfall... sad. Had high hopes for it.			"

								After quite a long wait, Shadowrun fans are now finding out that ""Shadowrun Online"", recently renamed to ""Shadowrun Chronicles"", will not become an open world MMO. In fact, the hot mess that it exists as presently will make up quite a bit of the Shadowrun experience.I'm incredibly disappointed in the linear garbage this team pumped out under the title ""Shadowrun Online"", and I -hate- that at the last second, they've chosen to change that name and stick with producing ultra-linear garbage. Consider, as well, the Shadowrun titles that have come out as of late; Singleplayer campaigns, a poorly made deathmatch shooter, and now this.We can only hope some other startup happens to capture Neuromancer a little better than Shadowrun did in the first place.

								Second review - Still a waste...I was asked to reconsider my negative review, but these updates didn't change much. I'll keep what I said before and add more:1. Character creation and stories are still overly simple and dull. Come on... Shadowrun is a complex system and games based on it are supposed to make you think much more than this. Sheesh... Are you making a game for babies with all these ready made choices and these silly dialogues?2. The interface is a mess that lacks lots of usability concepts, the music isn't synced to events, and the game is still performing horribly. As a software engineer myself I'm becoming curious as to what technology can be so bad to make such an unresponsive and clunky game... It's either what is being used or the competence of both designers and devs is not so good. Seriously... If I were a dev in this team I'd either vote for a complete reboot or quit my job because I wouldn't be able to stand our own product.This game makes me want to tell this team to stop trying, which is a damn pity and makes me feel ♥♥♥♥ing bad too because I want to love every single thing based on Shadowrun but man... Getting back on this game to ""check the updates"" has given me depressive thoughts and kind of ruined my night.First review - Don't waste your money at least for now.I'll go straight to the point.This is still in early access but I bought this game months ago and it hasn't been worth it up to now.Stories are shallow, the animations and overall graphics are very unpleasant, and playability sucks because it doesn't even perform well or fast enough.This game reaches the point of being a lack of respect to the cyberpunk community.The worst workshop campaign of Shadowrun Returns / Dragonfall is much better than this.

								Stay away... far awayOk guys this is just a generic game with as much reference to shadowrun as your Saturday SIFI channel movie. Gameplay is non existent. Aside from the empty promises, all you get is a cheap generic campaign. Please ignore the Online on the title and the RPG and MMO on the description. At the moment there is only a small ""campaign"" that you play , exacly the same thing you see in games like ""breach and clear"" and the like. The game is hard because of the lack of content and broken UI, yet the devs want to pass it as a feature . I run shadowrun on my local shop, I played the previous games including the best one for the SNES, this is not it. Dont waste your money here, go and buy Shovel Knight or better yet , buy Breach and Clear and name your characters as the races on Shadowrun, i assure you it will be more fun and closer to the original fluff than this !!!

								The amount of work this game needs is extensive. If you like Shadowrun 5th Edition don't expect this game to scratch that itch right now. I think it has potential for sure. Graphics are solid, gameplay is fun, although some missions are too hard. I like where the game is going and hope the money I contributed helps to make the game come to fuition. This needs to be the attitude you go into this game with. If you want a good Shadowrun mmo in the future then I say support this with a purchase but you will NOT be getting that expected expereince right now and it's going to be a while before you do. I hope that some of the simplistic elements are overhauled. Deckers can't do anything close to their counterparts in the pen and paper version. Magic is way too simplified and needs expansion. Combat, however, is fun. I look forward to seeing what they give us in the future.			"

												An X-Com:EU clone with a degree of focus on co-op multiplayer.The devs stepped up and put massive amounts of polish into the game before launch, it's now slick and pretty playable.  The problem is that it's still very content-light; it lacks the features and depth you'd expect of competitors like Shadowrun Returns.The progression system and gameplay diverges heavily from the Pen-and-Paper ruleset, and is pretty unremarkable.  The game has potential, but there is so little content that you can see pretty much everything on offer well before the end of the main story.The lack of class / XP limits means it's only a matter of time until all characters have maxed out abilities in all fields - so there is pretty much no individuality between characters - and that's if you ignore how superficial the choices presented in the skill-trees are.The Shadowrun setting is well realised and atmospheric as ever, but unfortunately the game just doesn't do enough with it to justify buying it at present.  That said, it's not ""un-fun""; it can be strangely addictive despite its flaws.  But there's better examples of both the game's genre, and of cyber-punk settings, out there to play with.			"

												I tried to give this game a chance. I'm not anti-change, so while my previous Shadowrun experiences were with Shadowrun Dragonfall and Shadowrun Returns I was prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to this game's distincly different mechanics.Unfortunately, the game is worse in literally every way than the Harebrained Schemes releases. It's so bad that I'm writing a review to complain about how bad it is. If you like your RPGs to have a story and NPCs with actual background stories, I would skip this game. To make matters worse, there's no control over the difficulty setting and limited opportunities for in-game healing. As such, the game is unreasonably difficult to play successfully even in the early runs.  "

Early Access Review
								Per the developers' request, I've revisted the game, briefly. It is a game that I want to like, because Shadowrun is a fun universe, but the project still feels slightly sloppy. First impression remains excellent, and has improved due to more robust character generation (although I'm not sure why you do that at two separate points in the beginning of the game) and the gorgeous environments. But the systems remain opaque, the combat remains simplistic, there's a distinct lack of characterization and choice, and there are embarrassing issues with character models (why does someone co-locate with me during 50% of my NPC experiences. If the HBS Shadowrun games are Fallout, this is Fallout Tactics, but without the expanded tactical options or the polish. Maybe it'll be great someday. The dev seems pretty dedicated to it. But it's still not the Shadowun I'm looking for.			"

								At this point of development, I can't recommend this game (as much as I like Shadowrun). When you can't even finish the final mission in the tutorial, there is something wrong. I've attempted this mission about 20 times now. Always the same outcome. The player characters miss most of the time. The NPC's rarely ever miss. In some cases, the NPC's with the swords can take down the player characters in two hits. Seems to be balanced toward the game defeating the player. This is bad design as if you can't progress, what's the point in playing. There are plenty of other games out there.Maybe the dev's will bring some better balance to the game when it hits it's final release, but if not, this was a waste of money.			"

												In the current state this is one of the most awful games I've played in years. So laggy it takes MINUTES between triggering an action and the action taking place. Constantly locking up during loading screens. Patches with no patch notes. Downtimes with no warning or posts about it on any medium. Constant nerfs. No way to respec your skills even after they ruin skills you picked despite the promise of refunding points if they make skill changes. shops having items for sale at the correct mission progress but once you can afford them they're not on the shop anymore. Only viable way to play is be a cybered up elf with automatic weapons because cyberware gives you crazy bonuses that non-cyber characters can't even compete with. Hell the highest auto in the game is vastly superior to any other weapon even before you add cyberware. No information at all, be it in game like what exactly this skill does, or any info from devs about what changed this patch, when they're going to take down the server. No ignore function to block the toxic ""should be playing league of legends"" players. No whisper so you can talk to people without trying to get your message seen in global chat through all the complaining about lag. No LFG function so you just have to spam the already spammy global chat. henchmen allow you to run a NPC person on the team but they're so bloody weak compared to players with their bad skill choices and lack of secondary weapon that you're stuck LFG until you find 3 people or just get tired of waiting and quit.Developers are so busy posting video's of themselves PLAYING shadowrun when they should be FIXING shadowrun. Most of the rules we know from the books are thrown out so forget the paper rule books as none of it applies and you'll end up having to remake your characters if you base decisions that way since there's no real data to go off of. (manastorm: DEVISTATES enemies in a large area... 16 dmg is devistates? when everyone has 30-50hp by then??? and it takes ALL your mana???)Decking is called Hacking but tehre's also a ""loot skill"" called hacking so it gets confusing when talking to potential team members (can you hack? yeah I'm a hacker. *invite, start mission* hack over here, oh I can't hack those, I didn't get that skill, thought you asked if I used hacking weapon) They decided to remove the ability to sell cosmetic clothing items but you still get multiples of the same items when looting in missions ending up with tons of duplicates you can't do anything with or get rid of, even clothes YOU START THE GAME WITH!!! Everyone takes their turn at the same time, it's advertised as a feature but it's a problem. team members are constantly running into area of effect attacks, made even worse with all this lag. Sure you can warn them but it never helps since they have to read chat first.bought this when it was Shadowrun online, before any real info was out, hoping for an actual MMO but instead I got a very poorly done, cheap chinese Shadowrun Returns, with multiplayer capability, knock off.And, I'm sorry, but ""it's launch week"" and ""we didn't expect this many players on a STEAM game"" haven't been acceptable excuses for over a decade. Do some damned research before making an online game. we got 20+ years of examples showing what can happen on launch week and what happens when you launch on STEAM. games that were out for years without issues and choose to go on STEAM have these problems all over again. I know it won't eliminate all the issues with launch but it will reduce the issues and make the company more prepared to quickly resolve those issues.I'll check back in a month. But, for now, ♥♥♥♥ this game!			"

												It looks nice at first glance.  But once you get into the game, you realize it's flawed.  The combat mechanics suck.  And the dialogue isn't great.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have to read all the dialogue (because they didn't want to pay the voice actors, I guess?).  It just seemed like this game had so much untapped potential.  The whole game just seems rough around the edges...like they just half-@$$ed it.			"

												The third go at the recently reinvigorated shadowrun series can only be described as a sad attempt to take the series into the modern world. The first two games atleast had a well thought out plot and fun maps. This poorly executed game hacks the singleplayer appart in favor of a quasi mmo, which doesn't work with a game this shallow.I can not express how dissapointed I am with this game.

								[HR]I TOLD YOU SO !!![/hr]2015-04-15Considering all my posts/comments gets deleted by Primetide, I will do this here. I am finally jumping off that sinking boat and getting a refund in the next few days. Thats over a year of owning the title and wondering how to properly ask for a refund.Audio: 3/5Music: 3/5Voiceacting: 1/5Graphics: 2/5Map: 2/5Gameplay: 0/5Shadowrun: N/APros:- 1st of all, let me talk about the positive stuff concerning this ""game"", I sent an E-Mail last weekend to ask for a refund and I should get my money back in the next few days. Thanks Florian.Cons:- This is def not the Shadowrun game you are looking for.- As a matter of fact, this is a ""AErena had a baby with X-Com"" kind of clone, with Trolls skin.- I would go so far as to say that this isnt even a game to begin with.- The dev started with a kickstarter project, then half the team ran of and those who stayed used the game funding to make another game - AErena. Then they had to drop most of what they initially had planned for the game and came out with that ""good enough"" pile of crap that is scheduled to launch in less than 2\two weeks...- Each time someone speak their mind to let the dev know they failed, and bring constructive criticism and ideas to improve the project, Primetide and his army of ""Trolls"" come in and work hard to justify all the BS and crappyness. They go so far as deleting posts and complete threads, with the occasionnal ""accidental"" merging of threads followed by more excuses as to why they have no clue what they are doing...- Anyway, the Audio aint too bad I guess, Music falls on my nerves but it could be worse, the Voiceacting is just horrible, Graphics are cartoony and have a huge AErena feel to them, Maps are wayyyy to small but the different elements fits well together nowadays, the Gameplay is pure BS and its Shadowrun by name only...All in all, if you like Shadowrun, stay clear of this title or you will hate yourself for wasting money on it.If after reading this review you still feel like this ""game"" is worth a try and dont believe its as bad as im portrayed it to be then be my guest and buy it, then whenever you feel yourself doubting your decision of buying this title, just remember the 1st line of this review.You guys have a good oneJPThis is not the Shadowrun game you are looking for!!!~This review is dedicated to Primetide, with love.

								As great as these games are this is not one of them. Clunky controls, limited powers, no equiptment upgrades and poor turn base options makes this game a horriable installment. Sorry but this plays more of a puzzle game than a tactics game and  this is obvious in the first mission of the game. Now i only played through 3 missions but after being whiped out the 11th time becouse my guys could not hit a target at point blank with a sword i decided to call it quits. It also dosnt make since that your guys can die in  2 to 3 hits while the enemy can take 4 or 5 and out number you. There is no armor or ways to heal in this game so again i revert to puzzle game instead of a rpg. This game would had been better if it was done for a phone app and call it ""try to have one man standing in the yellow zone at the end of the round without whipping"" becouse that is how the missions play out and how you beat them. No real skill just know how the puzzle works just like most puzzle games and youre done. Please add substance to the game and a way to actually make a bad♥♥♥♥♥toon and i will change my review. The skill tree even though is nice idea and hacking does somthing in the real world is nice the lack of upgrading and a money system to buy items to help in the game is going to hurt it a lot. I also dont understand why you have races with no traits except looks? just like the clothing that does nothing in the game i guess.If you want to see how this could had been done right then play shadowrun returns or the returns directors cut and you will see what i am talking about.

												Shadowrun Online - Now Chronicles Boston Lockdown is literly an abortion.After Cliffhanger in Vienna realized there was no way possible they were capable of fullfilling promises to fans and kickstarter backers they changed the name to Chronicles.  They scrubbed all original documentaion of development plans and goals from Shadowrun.com.  The reason is that they are trying to blame the fans and backers for thinking the game was going to be an mmorpg...which was the original plan!Cliffhanger productions is the most unethical company i have seen.  All of their positive reviews on steam are from friends,  family and people they give free access codes to.  Once a month they have open houses and give away free access codes,  then asked people to review the game.  90% of the positive reviews on steam are free access users.  This is how they falsely manipulate user reviews. They try despertly to keep the steam rating mixed which should be, without manipulation, overwhelmingly negative.I don't have allot of time explaining how horrible this game is,  just read the negative reviews to get an honest review.  If you originally backed this project on kickstarter...contact kickstarter and inform them of this Cliffhangers lies and practices. With enough negative feedback kickstarter won't let this company have another fraudulent campaign to rip off fans and then blame the fans for their mistakes.			"

								After trying the latest version I have to admit that the game has improved consistently I used to be a gamemaster for the pen and paper version of the game during the 2nd and 3rd edition era and I have familarized myself with the fourth ed. I was cyked to see a Shadowrun game with a multiplayer mode but was very disappointed with the early version of the game. I like where the new version is heading but is still missing a lot of the quirks that made the Shadowrun universe such a great background to develop into a video game. For instance, I understand that the devs don't want it to be a clone of Shadowrun Return but that game used the fourth edition as a template and made sense to a table player. I applaud the new improvements and will be on the look out for other changes, I wish for the addition of the adept class and powers and more look custumization options... I will recommend this game when it'll meet my standards and taste as a Shadowrun hardcore fan...			"

												DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  It was advertised as an online mmo, they're changing it to go back to doing dumbass video games.  Total let down after having prepurchased, gone through the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of problems (including one where the servers actually werent big enough.... FOR THE SAME FEW PEOPLE THAT WERE ALWAYS ONLINE), and, finally, after deciding to hunker down, being told hey, no mmo, just another run of the same bs you can buy from the other Shadowruns.  Also, they came out with Hong Kong while, supposedly, working on the mmo.  Dumbass move.  You were way too obvious with trying to market the Hong Kong (another standalone)bs, so, you ♥♥♥♥ed the gamers that took time from other stuff to help you develop.  As a gamer that did so, i'd like to return the favor and add a f*ck you.  Thanks for taking my money and wasting my time.I can say this much, they've worked out the kinks in the toon development.  TOO BAD YOU DIDNT DECIDE TO CONTINUE   WITH THE ONLINE CROWD THAT SHOWED YOU WHAT THE PROBLEMS WERE.  I'd go more in depth, but, you'll pay for it, you'll play it, you'll like it for a few days, then you'll go back to your mmos, tbs, and rts.  Shadowrun Online my♥♥♥♥♥  Oh, also, that was the name.  They changed it when the whole Hong Kong, 'we're not gonna do an mmo now' thing popped, AFTER THEY TOOK MY F*CKING MONEY FOR AN MMO.AM I HAPPY?  Happy I left.			"

								One of the most disapointing games I have purchased in a long time. Has a very unfinished feel, I would not feel as bad if this was a beta, but I was not happy with the unfinished feel of this game. I loved the old platform games ( NES and Playstation) this game has less character development and skill development than the old games.			"

								This game is hands down a disgrace on the Shadowrun Name, ive made several attemps to beat the (picking the Clues) mission and no matter what i try or what i do its unbeatable, i have no money to buy better guns or gear so i just get beat every single time, i dont think i could be more upset with a game knowing now that i wasted 29.99 on a POS.EDIT:This game is now absolutly amazing, took them a while to fix the kinks and issues but now WOW, fits the Shadowtun Name PERFECTLY			"

												The game would be enjoyable if not for the fact that since the beginning I've had screen scrolling issues. Namely even with edge scrolling disabled, if I don't make sure my teammates are finished with everything they do any move I make can be ♥♥♥♥ed up or trying to locate my teammates using the keys or mouse can leave me with my camera stuck on the far edge of the map unable to do anything except quit my turn. It's gotten worse since installing Windows 10. Mostly because 10 is such a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥that no one knows how to code worth a damn for the thing, and most are still using 32 bit programs on 64 bit operating systems, which is made worse when you include the ♥♥♥♥s that are Windows 8 and up coding.

												What Shadowtun Chronciles is:A fairly decent isometric tactical four-player co-op game set in a world where magic meets technology meets post-apocalyptic cyberpunk. The missions can be soloed using NPC allies (though this can get tricky, especially later in the story). Game-play is okay, but maps feel fairly repetetive. Still, this is worth trying as a 4-player co-op game. It's actually pretty fun provided you find good people to run with. What Shadowtun Chronciles isn't:A polished, or even just finished, MMO. There's no trading anything with anyone ever; why, you can't even sell those spare clothing unlocks, either. There's no actual social hubs for the role-player in you. There's not even private messages. Heck, there isn't even a proper character screen letting you check important stats like evasion or what background and racial choice you made at character creation. (Good thing the latter at least is generally easy to tell from how you look.) There's nothing massively multiplayer to do.Verdict:Sold as an MMO RPG. Not actually good as that.Could be a thumbs up if it weren't sold as something it isn't (really).			"

												I think this game was rougher during the launch window, but as a fan of the Shadowrun Returns series, I also like this game.  The main campaign is fun so far, and has decent to good voice acting, and the tactics are simplified from Shadowrun Returns, but still enjoyable.  Honestly, I like the streamlining for the most part, although I don't like how you can't switch to real time travel outside of combat.  It's turn based all the time, even when you're done fighting and want to explore and collect things.That's the main flaw with this game, alongside the fact that it's got a mostly linear story with not much choice.  The graphics, sound and music are good, albeit low-poly with no lip-synching, but I don't mind that.  The character customization is surprisingly good, with a lot of fun clothes, although the small number of pre-made portraits can be disappointing, especially the 2 (count them 2 total) for the Dwarf Female.I wish there was a way to just use your avatar's 3D model as a portrait, and that you could just switch to real time for times outside of combat.  Other than that, it's a surprisingly enjoyable game.  I'm glad I took a risk and bought this game in the Humble Store's create your own bundle for THQ Nordic games.  Fans of turn-based strategy, story, and Shadowrun can probably find something to like in this game.			"

												Shadowrun Chronicles - Boston Lockdown is a solid game.  It offeres interesting tactical combat - for a while.  Eventually you reach a point where there are no new tactics to employ so combat becomes samey, especially since the maps start repeating.But it's worth a few bucks if you can get it at a discount.One thing I find unforgivable is the fact that you cannot play offline.  There is no reason to require connection to their servers when you're playing solo.  I've had their servers disconnect me a few times now.  There's nothing wrong with my internet connection.			"

												At least once a week I've been grouping with chummers from my clan to play through this game.Having an absolute blast. Playing for 4-5 hours at a time, per session. It's become our Friday night ritual. The co-op is very good.The random damage meter is very unforgiving.The character creation is good.Storyline is so-so.The missions are very tactful, well designed and requires some team work if playing a group. I'm having a great time with this.			"

												>>>> First update 22 May - and after finishing*** main campaignSteam still pisses me off with the YES/NO review scoring but hey - I have to give a thumbs up now. Not so much in terms of changing my opinion on the probs and bugs and lack of depth in many areas of gameplay but more so on the devs' effort and whether this developer deserves to be paid for their work. I still strongly  think this game should be in early access and slightly decreased in pricing as well for its current worth.I still see a lot of issues with the game but at least now it is playable, lag is not an issue now and co-op can be enjoyed.I will re-update the Review once more with an in depth bullet list of likes and dislikes once I have a good second run of the campaign, more co-op time and I have seen the first few content updates.***: Ok I have not managed to defeat the final boss fight.... At the mo I have just mentally declared myself winner and walked away :D>>>> Previous review Early MayThe game should not have released yet officially.It does look promising but its lack of depth, issues and bugs, and current server state is completely off putting. Had I not been following it I would have considered this price tag a rip off.Review will be edited when an update make this a fully polished  proper game and the beta state this is.			"

												Finally changed from a negative to a positive.  The devs at cliffhanger are working hard to still make this a better and better game.  They have had a TON of challenges to overcome, including some that kicked their asses during the launch of their game that ultimately resulted in the bankruptcy of their software development studio.  With a massive loss to their team as a result, they still work to make the game the dream they had going into it.Now, I am still not advocating a $60 pricetag.  If you can get this on Humble or Mad Orc then go for it.It has a good story and a simplistic yet fun turn based gameplay that is only better as a multiplay.			"

												Now, I make the second edit of my review. When the game came out it was unplayable, it took the developers some time, but finally the game itself is working smoothly. No lag, not a lot of updates or server shut-downs so I finally can review the game itself.When Cliffhanger Productions first announced that they would be making an Shadowrun Multiplayer game the two things that made me want it so bad were that they said back then it would be an open world RPG and that they want others to play Shadowrun online with each other (hence the original title ""Shadowrun Online"").I guess they either did expect more money from the backers or simply didn't have a clue what the backers were looking for, because what I was looking for was a place online to walk around with some runner chummers of mine and do some in-play roleplaying. And they have completely not delivered that.Shadowrun Chronicles is not a Shadowrun RPG to play with friends, it's a Strategy game that is playing in the world of Shadowrun and where you have only one place (instead of the open world they promised) where you can met with friends and do some Charplay. That place is the ""Hub"". And not even there are the people actually talking to each other. Baseicly all communication between actual players are in the Global Chat Room. And there is no inplay either it's just people trying to find a group to make more Karma. This game feels so much more like a free-to-play game like Jagged Alliance Online without the money leeching, than what it meant to me to play Shadowrun with my friends for almost the last two decades.And just when I thought everything is getting better with the coming updates they introduced pets. PETS?! Gotdamnit! In all my shadowrun years with all my characters I had so much to decide about. Which guns to bring, which contacts to squeeze which way to enter a building, being sneaky or brute force. Even who of my fellow runners I could trust. NEVER EVER have I worried about if I should get a friggin' squirrel or a dog. EVER!Maybe I'm just the only person that feels like the developers missed the point of a Shadowrun Online game. For me this is not what I was looking for so I don’t recommend it.			"

												Amazing game to pick up for cheap a few different places, not sure I would say it's worth the full sticker price right now. The game really shines when 2-4 friends play though together. The story telling is alright, but nothing to be amazed at. The character customization in terms of aestetics is fine, but skills are a little narrow (imo). However I still really enjoy playing the game and would recommend it for anyone who has looked for a XCOMesque co-op experience.			"
