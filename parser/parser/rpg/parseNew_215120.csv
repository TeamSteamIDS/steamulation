												TL;DR - Is this game worth playing? NO. If you are still looking for an anime style mmo try out Dragon Nest, Tera: Rising, Phantasy Star Online 2 JP (English patch and Ship 2 or 10) or upcoming Blade&Soul NA release. Read on if you want to know the full story.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rose Online used to be one of the most enjoyable and biggest games out there when it was first released. This was my childhood game and the memories will last forever.Unfortunately, the game has fallen on it's knees in my opinion. Rose online used to be about the community and leveling experience. Nowadays, there is simply not enough active people on rose to make it interesting because people have left. Junon is the only place in the whole game that is filled with players and 90% of them are afk vending. The leveling system is terrible compared to old school rose. 95% of players (I kid you not) use AUTO BOT programs to level. From level 40 upwards all you see is people multiclienting and botting with area of effect abilities. They don't move from the spot at all and just afk to level. This is the sad reality of the game (and it is actually allowed according to the game rules as long as you are 'present' to babysit the aoe bot)Game development has also stalled. The original game developers are not around so the new 3 person team is just adding small updates here and there. Only 3.5 of the originally planned 7 planets have been released. No new proper content has been released in years, it is basically going around in circles with skill changes. The game direction is highly questionable as well. Did I mention you can basically pay2win in this game when it comes to the best gear? I love rose but I would not recommend it to anyone anymore =(Edit: This review was initially posted in July and it is now November - nothing has changed. In fact it is worse. Don't be fooled by my 90 hours gameplay - I used non steam client for 90% of my gameplay. I recently re-entered the game to see how things have changed and the game is even more dead than before. Not to mention the lag and DCs. Current development is as always going around in circles a.k.a nowhere. One of the community developers also left the team. The recent patch decisions are imo irrelevant and opposite to what needs to be implemented to keep the game alive by enticing new players and keeping veteran players happy.Population is dwindling and there is still nothing new to do in the game other than spend real life money on Item Mall. There have even been talks of a server merge because it is so bad! But really this won't save the game when the development is in the wrong direction. Bots are still rampant - still AFK Aoe Bot Online.This may sound harsh but it is my and many others honest opinion. I can only voice my honest thoughts here because of the fact that on the Rose forums any negative feelings are promptly deleted and swept under the rug. It really is that bad. If you wanted the truth, here it is. Please vote this as helpful so others don't waste their time and money.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Response to Developer:So I would like to offer you some real ‘insight’ and feedback, in response to some of issues that have been discussed in this review. EDIT: The funny thing is that I typed/saved all before you created your recent ‘we are trying to monitor bots!’ thread. Lo and behold, instead of fixing and removing botting spots you are still bashing your head against the wall and doing exactly what you shouldn’t do – trying to monitor them when the game design inherently supports botting. It simply astounds me that the developers have been so short sighted. And whenever a post tells you the solution it is swept nicely under that rug of yours. That is exactly why I feel prompted to respond to your response which is filled with propaganda. It is misleading and luring players into believing your game is worth playing in its current state. A polished turd is still a turd.On levelling and Botting:While levelling is faster, that doesn't mean better. Nor does it reflect the flawed nature of the levelling system which is of greater concern. The real kicker is that botting is ok as long as it is 'supervised'. This lax rule isn't even a countermeasure and only in place because you simply cannot monitor or stop botting. Understandably this is because of your small team. However, even if you had the manpower it wouldn't matter.The only real solution would be revamping the system to focus more on active participation, requiring movement/timing/skill and less reliance on clerics/aoe classes and standing in one spot. But you will continue to ignore what needs to be done.A class representative even had to make a thread about botting!! For your team to actually ask for where botting spots are is an absolute joke – it just shows that you don’t even play your own game. I’m just trying to uncover the blindfold that you are trying to put onto potential players that come looking for a worthwhile mmorpg on steam. Better now than later.On Population and distribution:It is nice to see that the server merge happened. But what of it? Just as I predicted a year ago, your population is still in decline. Merging indeed did not fix the massive inherent problems with Rose.90% of your players may not be AFK vending, I never said that. But I can say that 90% of people in Junon AFK vend or multiclient. It is saddening to see that the majority of Rose's maps are now complete ghost towns. Junon is the only major planet city that is 'active'. Luna is dead. Eldeon is dead. Orlo is dead. On that note, have you introduced another planet yet? No. That makes it almost 7 years since new planet content right?Why has it come to this? Low population and mature population firstly. Secondly, faster levelling means new players breeze past these levels and don't stay. Thirdly, even if levelling was slowed, players wouldn’t even bother visiting these planets at all because other levelling spots (eg: oblivion temple where players generally stay from 80-170...over 90 levels in the same area which is simply ridiculous) are better. Thus, out of like a hundred maps over 4 planets, this is why you only see players actively use less than 6 of them. Is this how you envisioned your game? Full of lazy botters aoeing their way to max level in a few maps?I won’t ever be returning since I already know what is in store for me. More disappointment. I continue to encourage everyone to stay well away from Rose. Don't be fooled or enticed by false words.			"

												ROSE Online is my favourite MMORPG of all time and will probably be for the rest of my life. Of course, it most likely won't be for practically anyone who will play this game in this day and age, because the strengths of this MMORPG to new players now only revolves around the history and idea that it is a classic. If you played this game in it's prime, you would feel totally immersed in the world of ROSE and probably never forget the ride. It really felt like an adventure. An adventure that made me believe that this game would might aswell be a RPG that loved me in it's world. There are plenty reasons why this game would irritate, annoy or even anger an audience of modern gamers through it's art style, UI, stability and overall simple gameplay, but considering that this game was a free-to-play (not pay to win) MMORPG that was introduced at the time when the World of Warcraft began, it really was a nolstagic game that contained plenty of down-to-earth players that at the end of the day, you would never see again. I have picked up and dropped this game HEAPS of times and everytime I remember what made my weekends an adventure. I'm not saying it will make any of you feel that way, or if you will even get by 10 minutes of this game without poking fun at it for being last generation, but sadly, it is what it is and if you cannot accept that this game was one of the best in it's time than you haven't REALLY experienced the vast worlds of MMORPGs. This game ties with Dragonica on my favourites list and I would love to play it again, but year by year the community dies. Out of the several hundred hours I've poored into this game during my childhood, I've never regretted it one bit. I'm not telling you to try it or waste your time on a game that you won't ever enjoy, but atleast respect this game for what it is or even what it was. If you do try it, I reccommend downloading it from the main client. Seriously though, LISTEN TO THE SOUNDTRACK!			"

												i played the beta many many many years ago, and started playing again recently after a couple years of break... its not the best mmo, the mechanics suck, the ui is ugly and doesnt feel good,,, BUT i just dont know wtf it is about this game but i love it... played it for many hours, and i guess i just love the adorable characters, and dont get me started on the music.... conclusion: if youre a hardcore mmo player, love questing and such etc. you will not like this game... But if youre looking for a mmo where you can just chill, talk to people, farm mobs, farm loot, spend many hours buying or selling stuff to other people, this game just might be for you...			"

												I can remember playing ROSE waaaaay back when there were actually thousands of people that would play. The land was literally littered with hundreds of stands of people selling stuff. While the population is no longer that large I am surprised that there are still quite a few people that play. And the game is basically in the same form as it always has been. The biggest change upon my return: the Cash Shop. I am never a fan of pay to win and this game definitely has that. But for me there is a fair amount of nostalgia that makes it still fun to play. The game is a typical kill ten rats, ride the rollercoaster mmorpg. I should mention that movement is also point and click. The classes are fun and the storyline is lacking. But I will still continue to play.Gameplay:

												This game was the best mmorpg out there like 10 years ago, but sadly it has fallen to pieces.There are simply no more active players, just the ones who are afk farming/vending. I strongly suggest to try other mmorpgs.			"

												This MMORPG is behind the times, but for the past couple of years it has made many improvements since beta. The animation is smooth and the sound effects are less screwed up. It also has redesigned maps. Also you can travel between different planets and environments and has player levels over 100! However, it is a cutesy game. If you are disturbed by 3D chibi characters, then I suggest turn away.			"

												(Don't use the lack of playtime recorded as a judgement of my review. I played this game on and off since 2006, long before this game was put on steam and have continued playing it without steam)This is one of the best games out there in the mmo genre, could be considered the single best mmo when it comes to this type of graphical style, it's been around since  2006 and there are still a ton of people in the game and the developers have consistently added more to the game since then. The game has regular events, like Christmas, saint Patrick's day, World cup to name a few.The game is supported by a item shop, but realistically you could play the whole game without ever spending any money in it, most of what is sold on the item shop is cosmetic and the things that are not are mostly things that speed up your process in the game, like for example Exp boost. The item shop does sell a few skills, but you do not really have to get these and you won't feel gimped if you don't have them, that is the only thing you could consider needing to spend money on, but it is not required. A great thing about how Rose Online does the item shop however is that everything that is sold in the item shop can be given or resold to other players, so if you really did not want to spend money in the item shop but still wanted an item from the item shop you could easily buy it from another player who is selling it for in game money, be aware though that you probably won't be able to do this early on in the game, because the prices of item shop objects are not cheap.The game has an amazing crafting system, it may not be in depth as other games and may not feel as satisfying when you craft objects but it's massive. Nearly ever single drop in the game (like 90%) is used as a crafting component, the rest of the things that are not are gear, health/mana pickups, vendor trash or a gift box, which there are different types and contain something in it when you open it, like having a random chance of getting a crafting component out of 5 types, basically it's a dirty crystal and when you open it you find out what color crystal it is and crystals are used to craft objects.CAUTION, it is not recommended you sell your loot to the first few shops you find, there are a few people in the game that try to take advantage of new players lack of knowledge and will pay you very little for your loot (some people may call them scammers,me included, but they are not really, as a new player you should be cautious of things like this in any game) , it may look like a lot when you only have 200G and a player offers you 2.000G for a object you picked up 7 of, but you will kick yourself when you get to the second city and find out the average price you could have gotten for that item was 40.000G. Do NO sell any of your materials before you get to the second main city in the game called City of Junon Polis. When you get to this city take some time and look around at a bunch of shops, there are many players shops set up here, take your time go around and look at the prices of stuff when you have looked at a good selection of shops, you will have a better idea what stuff is worth and can make a better decision on how much to let things go at.If you want to craft your own objects, you will have to roll a Dealer, which is the only class that can craft objects. If you do choose to craft objects, do not go and pick up every crafting skill there is as doing so will make your character at killing stuff and thus be very slow at leveling. Crafting skills are part of your normal skills and putting a point into crafting means one less point into a damage dealing ability. Usually just pick one or two crafting discipline, and get a few combat skills and save the rest for your advanced job. Also to help you if you choose to become a crafter CON (concentration) increases your chance at succesfully crafting and objects and SEN (sense) increases your chance of getting extra stats on the crafted object. Carts,Castle Gear and Gems can't have extra stats so, sense is less useful if you want to craft these itemsThere are 4 basic classes and 8 advanced classes in the game, everyone starts out as a visitor and when you reach level 10 you can choose on of the basic classes, the basic classes each have two main trees, Muse (mage) has a healing tree and a damage tree. Soldier (Warrior) has a 1 handed tree and a 2 handed tree (1 handed is more for tanking and 2 more for dealing damage). Hawker (rogue/assassin) has a Melee tree and a Range Tree (and then melee has two types, Katar (firstweapon) and dual swords). Dealer has an offensive tree and a crafting tree (crafting tree has some offensive abilities but for the most part it's crafting focused). Each of the basic classes has a basic tree, which help them no matter what they side they go, Muse has increased INT, mana  and mana regen. Soldier has increased Strength, increased damage and increased health. Hawker has increased Dex, increased attack power and increased attack speed. Dealer has Increased CON (Con increases their damage also), increased SEN and increased movement speed.Try to always be in a party, Rose Online rewards you for being in a party, it has this system called Party Level, it starts at and can go all the way to 50. Party level gives you bonus EXP, the higher the party level the higher the bonus EXP is, this rewards people for grouping up. Some people even leave their game on to save their party level when it gets really high and then when they come back to play tomorrow they don't have to rebuild the party level and get increased bonus EXP from the start  You can be in a party and gain exp as long as nobody in the party is more then 20 levels apart from each other. Getting an AOE skill is highly advisable, what many groups do is go to a location on the map where there are a good amount of mobs, have someone pull a group of mobs and that that person brings the group of mobs the the party and then everyone AOE's the enemies down, this way you speed up your leveling by a lot.Hope this extended review helped you and have fun in Rose Online.

												ROSE has been around in some form or another since 2005. If you've never played ROSE before, give it a try! It's completely free to play and has several aspects to appeal to many different types of players; player versus monster, player versus player, a cooperative party system, a game arena, quests, dungeons, and more. If, by chance, you've played ROSE in the past, you might want to take a look at this game again. Lots of things have changed, and there is a new focus and new vigor reawakening player interest, though some beloved core elements have remained the same.			"

												A game that I never thought I would find myself coming back to after all these years.I downloaded this expecting to see a dead game with nobody online except a handful of people but I was wrong.In the tutorial area you will see players standing around sometimes buffing guildies other times just buffing any newbies.After the tutorial area and into the first city called Zant you will see a few shops open buying materials and selling scrolls as well as players running back and forth to complete quests or to level up.In Zant I spent a few minutes leveling alone until I saw another player killing the same mobs as me.I partied them and as time passed by we managed to get a full party going with a cleric buffing us up even more.It's the same in most areas.I am currently level 80 and have always managed to find a group to level with.The community is still active and as per most games there are kind players and the annoying trolls.Cash shop doesn't seem p2w in my eyes considering you can easily farm up 1billion or close to it the higher level you get and you can also purchase the items in the cash shop for in game currency.Even the premium 30 day service is available to be bought.The downside though is that the economy on this game is insanely expensive and it will take you a while before you manage to get yourself those nice costumes(some give exp and drop bonus)but if you are patient enough you will be able to get there soon.Another thing I like is that this game encourages you to be in a group.Not just for dungeons but for leveling in general!Sure you could solo level with a cleric in a high level area but if you got a group of players you would level even faster and have less downtime due to not taking so much damage!There will be a new update soon which is nice to see as it means the devs are still working on the game!TL;DRPros:-Populated-Group play is encouraged-not p2w-entertaining-still being updated-grindy(some players may like this)Cons:-Expensive economy-grindy(some players may not like this)-dated graphics "

												ROSE Online is a free to play 3D MMORPG. It worked, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok, was understandable.  It looks cute and simple.  Does not have WASD controls, uses mouse click to move, attack, interact.  Has a high level cap of 230, with four playable classes.  Has free mounts. Has grind base progression.Try it, maybe you might like it.For more info:

												I used to play this quite a lot. They did some things very well with this game, but eventually the experience turns into a really boring grind. I don't mind grinding if it's done right, like in Ragnarok Online (partially at least), but in ROSE Online it's just really tiresome and boring. It just doesn't feel very satisfying.At one point they changed things quite a lot so I'm not quite sure how good it is any longer. I get the impression, however, that it has dwindled. The game has always been advertised to offer 7 different planets, but after many years they are still not all there.It had (and still has) great potential. I doubt it's ever going to be fulfilled. In any case, it's now free to play, so why don't you give it a shot? Just be warned that you might tire of it eventually.			"

												ROSE Online is a pretty standard MMO for the most part, its not bad and I dont dislike it, but it does not do much to stand out, that being said if you are a fan Asian style MMOs and asked me, ""hey what are some free to play MMOs on Steam that are Asian/ anime themed"" I would probably namedrop ROSE among a half dozen or so other games like it on Steam.I feel like ROSE Online's largest draw is probably nostalgia from previous players.

												Red fower online is a very good game to play either by yourself or with friends. This game consists of killing things and leveling skills. This is very unique and enjoyable to do. The charactor customisations is where the game really shines. You can chose from a variaty of different faces and a fewer variety of hairstyles. A big plus for me is that you can only play as children. I believe this is very good because to many gave force you to play as adults.  The gamplay in this game also stands out in this game. it involves clicking on the target and waiting for the outcome. Later in the game you get abilities which make the fighting alittle more interesting. I give this game a five out of 1 on the fact that you can fight karate jelly beans which are green.			"

												It's hard to say if I'd 'recoomend' the game or not. If there were an in between answer, I'd have chosen it...And I will explain why.For the pros, the game has a fairly cute look and an enchanting world to me. I find the graphics to be overall quite nice, and story concept to be pretty neat. As well, the monsters are fun. I mean...I wanna just hit all the jelly beans so I can put them in my mouth!However, as for cons...The controls are a bit slippery to work with. if I move my mouse just the wrong way while I'm trying to do something, I suddenly don't see properly. It's also difficult to aim sometimes with the monsters for me...And my character just moves way too slow. If a worm monster mount can move triple my speed in my head, that's a problem. Mounts are supposed to be fast, and that's good- but my running speed is horrible. Also, my worm can't seem to cross a bridge.			"

												This game has a wonderful playerbase still, and the economy is booming effectively in trade aspects. The skills, builds, and avatar itemization can be fun, but the characters themselves feel a bit limited. The controls can be VERY wonky and hard to use, but overall is made up for with its simplistic style in the end. Its also a great game to make friends in and learn the ropes with other new players. Without the tutorial some newer players may feel like a challenge is thrown at them right away, but with time given, it can become much more easy to learn and quick to master. Overall, I'd give this game at 8/10, definitely a Free to play game worth trying.			"

												Rose Online crashed when I tried to play it but in the few minutes I spent in character creation I discovered the letter ""X"" is forbidden for use in names, and that it crashes instantly with a C++ error when the game begins.I made Sora from Kingdom Hearts in the editor though, that was cool. I give it 3/10 for that alone, you can make any anime you like in the editor, or at least a 12 year old version of them. Made a tiny (or ""chibi"") Goku, too!			"

												Ok So I decided to check out ROSE again after some a long long break. I was excited to go back to the game as I had spent a lot of time on it in the past and thought there would be some huge advancements. Sadly I was extremelly wrong. The game is still sucking in money through their item mall but bugs that were present some 10 years ago are still there. Simple things like getting stuck on bridges etc . Added with the lack of in game support and very slow ticket response times I would not recomend you wasting your time going back to it or even starting this game. Really let down after playing a lot of hours again only to find quest bugs that would force me to start a quest line that extends some 50 levels . Don't waste your time !			"

												ROSE is a fun game to play when you have friends to go through it with. For me, I got into it thanks to a friend who played it a lot and I got to play with them for practically every step of the way until I met other people. However, in my own opinion this game isn't too great if you wanted to play through it on your own where in most other MMORPG's where it was still fun if you wanted to try and solo it. Regardless, with a few friends to start with or making some new ones in your adventures, this game can be a great value for your time.			"

I haven't meet many people, just a few in some camp, everything else looked empty. For the first, and maybe not last, try it didn't impressed me and didn't made me stay for longer. It's free to play game, so you can try it yourself. Keep in mind that ROSE Online is old game but that doesn't mean it's bad. It was just hard for me to enjoy it for longer.			"

												I remember playing ROSE back in its open beta days.  I played the heck out of this game back when I was a kid and had nothing better to do.  ROSE ties with Silkroad for my most nostalgic MMO's.  I have so many great memories of these games.  I also bring this up for a reason, however.  The reason I enjoy ROSE is mostly thanks to those nostalgic memories.  I somewhat doubt this game will appeal to the newer generation of MMO players.  The grind is heavy (used to be much worse) and the economy is pretty terrible but is certainly reminiscent of any older MMO's where economies were generally left unchecked.  With most MMO's there a clear dividing line of prosperity between players.  So why do I recommend this game?  If you can get passed the old school MMO aesthetics, you're going to be able to find a ton of enjoyment from it.  It's a simple MMO with simple goals.  You may or may not sink thousands of hours into ROSE, but the time you spend in it should give you lasting memories.  How you look at it is up to you.			"

												ROSE Online is one of those games I wanted to try for a while but never gathered the nerve to - the childish graphics and chibi-like art style were both major factors in chasing me away. The other factor was that no MMO is worth playing for more than a while. This one didn't last nearly as long. So, what are the good factors?-Fast levelling...?-Long draw distance for easy targetting?Ok, not so many pros. Where does this game go really wrong? Well, upon starting the game up, you are greated by Zidane Tribal from Final Fantasy IX. Hello, Zindane. Didn't expect to see you here. Then again, I didn't really expect to see blatant Chocobo clones in Elsword. These manga/anime MMOs love their plagiarism. What else does this game do wrong? You can place several points into your strength attribute and it will make about a 1-damage difference when you strike. Did I mention you begin using a wooden plank sharpened into a spike? Yeah, mix that with your terrifying pink fairy wings you get as a stardard issue, and you have one hell of a warrior. Why, he's so good, he fights beasts that match equally his stoic stature...jelly beans. What could top such absurdity? Not too much, but there seems to be a pretty big problem with the enemies having HP pools deeper than the Ocean. You can hit a wasp so many times, you swear it had over a hundred health. You do, what? 10-20 right now? It definitely has more than a hundred...it has hundreds. Time to do what we came here for! Time for adventure! Time for exploration! Time to take a stroll down the grassy lands of Whateveria where there are some trees, lots of paths and...wow. This IS empty. The first town you enter has a few NPCs. There isn't a thing you can buy. Really. The equipment is too expensive and I got to level 5 or so killing beans n bees and I didn't gain any money. Sure, I could sell a few things, but that's just it - a few things. Enemy drops are very few. I couldn't find any quests. The first town has some NPCs, sure, and there's a guard who looks like he might have a job for you near a bridge, but no. They say something and the player responds with a short line and walks away. Same with this lone boy who appears to be lost and with a lot of goods. He HAS to have a quest. Maybe a bandit problem. Nah. He says some useless fluff and your character says ""Good for you"". Good for you? It's like your character KNOWS how useless these people are and is just annoyed to not be doing anything. Wait, what's this? A free mount! Kickass! I can go so many places! Maybe a bustling city full of quests! What's that? A little green worm that looks like he should be in A Bug's Life? Yeah, he's quick and all, but I'm hanging to the ground riding a juicy green bug. I can't even fight while I'm riding. Why would I use this thing? I have pink fairy wings and a wooden plank. I'm a warrior of great respect, not a child! Ok, I jest. Looks like everyone here is. Not the bear though...he's a bear. What the hell...			"

This half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game was concieved back then when it was still semi playable, but as all half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game companies are, it was abandoned abrulptly. Thinking of milking nostalgia-mongers and unwitting players for more cash, Gravity decided it was a good idea to 'remake' this (by remake I mean change a little interface and NPC positions).

												This was a terrific game and it was my favorite more than 10 years ago when it ws first released. Each role actually fulfilled their duties, and was the most balanced it ever was. As the game went on, it became sour, and the 2013 update changed everything. All the classes and their skills changed to the most unusual way possible. I was a knight class - I am built like a tank, and im supposed to attract enemies to come my way - how else can i do that? I have to taunt the enemy. Sadly, there was an update that broke that - i became useless. Changes keep happening. The game kept getting worse and worse - driving faithful gamers... away...  "

												I had a lot of fun over the years with ROSE and spent a lot of money to support developement, but unfortunately there is no developement. the game is still like 50% done only (after a LOT of years!!!), instead they ruined the skill and stats system, also a LOT of items with a major ""update"" they did some time ago. simply like ""we are too stupid to create NEW content, but we want to make money and don't care about to ruin our players work to earn even more""i spent a lot of time, love and work into my chars and they was pretty good. at least good enough to have a lot of fun with friends at ROSE. i also spent a lot of time in the newbie zone to help new players.but the update ruined it all. the new skills/stats system is simply crap, compared to what i built my chars up in past, they are pretty weak like toddlers now. and most of the items i earned hard or bought are ruined and completely worthless now.serious, i wouldn't mind to work another weeks or months to get my chars back to the point how they was like, but the way they changed the game to. This was a completely fail, from what i've seen they reached the completely opposite of what they was trying with the update. Old loyal players left, even less new players are staying. Fail.Keeping in mind that they scared away a lot of players over the years before already (because pretty EVERYONE is using bot's there, because all the bugs, because no developement, because no new content, because more and more restrictions in game play, because ruining re-designs of some maps, etc.), this is the End for me at ROSE (and also for most of my friends i had there).Bye ROSE. :( "
