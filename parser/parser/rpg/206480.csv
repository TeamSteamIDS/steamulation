												As you are reading my review please consider that I have played DDO since the beta. Not the beta for F2P either, we're talking 2005. I only downloaded it on steam because I discovered I could multi-box that way but 99% of my hours playing this game are not on steam. Yes, this reminds me I need a life bad because I realized I have 440 steam hours as well at this time.First I must say I have a bitter love/hate relationship with DDO. I am a huge PnP D&D fan and have been since I was a kid. The quests in DDO are second to none. The way it blends classes and makes rogues feel like a real class is simply amazing and gameplay is simply fun. To date it's one of the best combat systems I've ever used and I have played a LOT of MMO's. Since it's not heavy PvP it's one of the games you can max the graphic settings out and realize it was designed very nicely and not be gimped. I have level capped so many characters and honestly if you know how to build a character in real D&D you'll have a huge advantage over other players. I've never had a character I felt was anything less than spectacular and have always felt emerged in my characters. Though I feel strongly about all my characters, the artificer (one of the semi-newer classes) has really created one I enjoy. As I said, I've got a love hate relationship with this game and even though as of now I no longer really play the game, this was my favorite game of all time and I regret the actions of turbine that made me decide to leave. Now, on to the reason why I don't recommend this game anymore. Also why after bringing everyone I know and game with to DDO, they all left too. I'll spare you the trial and error details as this game has been forced to change and evolve. Despite many of those changes coming too late after they've lost tens, maybe even hundreds of thousands of players. All of these changes were not enough to drive me away (for good anyway). Many people left because of things that were later fixed like the lack of ability to solo or lack of content. Issues I don't find so much in the current game if you're a subscriber, but that's where it ends and the problem begins.Turbine has apparently gotten VERY greedy. As they've become short staffed, under budget, and now owned by big brother warner they've gotten outright insane with their cash shop and try to leech every player for everything they can. I'll start on this with their subscription plan. Lets just say if you don't have this they will punish you. You're availability of content will start off good up to level 6 and by level 15 become almost unplayable. I always subscribed for this reason but even as a subscriber you're punished because you lose all the F2P players to group with and run the paid content. They have ""guest passes"" but seriously, how long will you go paying peoples way into groups with your wallet before that gets old? (answer, not long). Beyond content you're also unable to open dungeons at higher than normal difficulty until you've completed the lower ones. This wouldn't be so bad except the bonuses for ""Bravery streaks"" (playing content first time on elite @ level) are huge and you miss soooo much experience not being able to do it. When you suffer from the lack of content F2P players have losing 50% of your potential experience just doesn't feel right.Now even this is not enough to push me away. So I kept playing and yes in time I will admit I dumped thousands into the cash shop. Yes, thousands of dollars and no, not paying to win because those options came later. We're talking buying buffs for my guild ship, buying guest passes, buying friends and family content to run with me, buying expansions, buying character classes, unlocking storage, character slots, and so on.Yes, that's right, even if you are a subscriber, you still have to pay for access to expansion content. You still have to buy certain character classes and so much other stuff it'll drive you insane. Yeah, you can live without it but you will feel the pressures of not having it. For example, F2P players don't get shared account storage. This game has tons of ""Bound to Account"" gear that you can pass to other characters on your account, but only through that storage.This was not enough to deter me, so I gamed on! Emptying my wallet into a game that got MUCH more expensive after it went free to play, I still loved DDO and couldn't stop playing. Then they added the hard core cash shop content. Books that add perma experience boosts per character, supreme stat tomes that don't exist in game and getting them the hard way would be a fortune and take forever, and eventually, the ability to buy levels. Yes, that's right, you can ""buy"" levels.It started with ""vet status"" to start at level 4 instead of 1. Then the new vet status lets you start at 7. However you take these level boosts on an airship and you can access the cash shop before taking them. You can buy all the cash shop exp buffs and instead of starting at level 7, you end up over level 8. This becomes a big deal because there is a cash shop item a level 8 character can use that makes them level 16 and gives them gear! Now, you can buff up hard, cash shop some more and instead of 16, end up level 18+ well on your way to 19 (maybe even with new stuff end up 19?). So for a game where you true reincarnate at level 20, you can start the game around level 19!? Talk about Pay to Win? I spent years leveling my characters now people can start off almost ready for TR? Regular levels cap at 20 before you hit epic levels that only go to 28. Which by the way you can't ever see without paying. Not only do F2P players not get access to the epic destiny feature, but there's almost no free to play epic content.By the way, even this wasn't enough and I played on! Figured it would at least bring some noob high level players to run content with (it didn't). Then the game killer for me came. After tolerating my favorite game becoming pay to win, they drew the last straw for me. DDO has had astral diamonds (cash shop currency for in game purchases) for years. You use them often for ship upgrades for your guild. There are few other things they could be used for, but nothing game killing. Then they did it, they added ""astral shards"". Astral shards, much like diamonds are cash shop currency. However they are everywhere. Need a buff? You can buy one. Want free stuff? Toss dice rolls for free stuff with it like craps. You name it and it has astral shards now and the big winner... the astral shard auction house! (seriously, wth!?).Now games like Diablo 3 (which blows hard) have a real money auction house, so what's so bad about this? Well, in diablo 3 big brother Blizzard takes a cut, then gives the money to the seller which you can then do what you want with. With astral shards, your real money auction house only makes them money. They take a shard cut from your sales, give you the change, you use it to pay for in game micro transactions (different and in addition to cash shop). So Turbine wants you to subscribe for $15/month (I paid $99/year as better deal).Pay for new content even though subscribers are supposed to get it as part of their deal.Then drop buckets in the cash shop.And now buy astral shards to pay for everything in game with micro transactions including the auction house.(yes, it has made platinum almost worthless)In game point rewards too small to do much with. You can buy very little.I'm sorry to my beloved DDO.I still visit from time to time, but I cannot play this game anymore.I decided originally as punishment for their greed, Turbine could not have any more of my money.Now I see a fraction of what F2P players see.As free to play, the game is not worth it.Sadly, this is the most expensive F2P game I've ever played.Although if you're a true D&D fan and have buckets of money to spend and not care.This otherwise would be an amazing game second to none.

												Awesome game. See that large number on the time played above? Yeah that has only been since it got on Steam. Yes the graphics are dated and some of the base D&D mechanics are creaking under the weight of all the add-ons done over the years. Most of the problems with mechanics tend to show up at the upper level ranges (20+) Many of the recent adjustments to classes has taken some of the difficulty edge off of the lower levels as power creep has reared its head. -----------For the absolute best DDO experience:get 3-4-5 friends that have zero experience playing. Have everyone go through the tutorial (it is solo only). Set up a schedule of play time and request that no one plays at all outside of the group time,  no spoilers!Dont go read about how best to play the game or the best builds , etc. The exploration and learning on your own when it is all fresh to the whole crew is priceless. Some dungeons have you thinking with your fighter ,barbarian or sorcerer you are the baddest MoFo ever. Next dungeon you are cheering on the rogue who is sneaking around a room full of big, bad Ogres, that would squash him in no time flat if they see him/her, picking up the soul stones(dead PCs) of the entire party to take them back to the shrine to be raised from the dead. ===========================Lots to do as free to play so no need to pull out the CC right away. If you follow the above plan for best experience by time you get to where you feel the 'need' to pay, you will gladly be screaming ""take my money, now!""  -----------------------One word of caution about making characters;Many of the older dungeons have the unfortunate MMO min/maxer design problem. You will run in to somethings that require X Strength score to open or Y skill points to trick an NPC will seem really high.  The desiginers couldn't make the stat requirements too low where a balanced character could complete with out making things trivial for the min/maxers.Just keep that in mind when building that maxing or nearly maxing your primary ability scores is suggested and likewise it is better to have a few skills that are maxed rather than a bunch of skills with low investment.  ~~~~~~~~TLDRStill haven't experienced anything quite like it after years and years I still keep playing.Noobstyle with friends is the best but super deep to keep even power gamers happy for a long, long time.

												Last week, I would have recommended this game to anyone who wanted a hack and slash romp in a Dungeon's and Dragons setting and in fact had; this week the twenty first update forced users to accept Akamai Netsession with an End User license agreement that says that Akamai can - at any time - turn on funtionality that would make your computer part of their Akamai content distribution network.I can not recommend that anyone install the game with such software forced upon the user especially with alternative distribution methods available to the developers.

												Sadly this was ONCE a good game I would have been happy to support financially. However, it has started using questionable practices as  a business. For a while I decided to simply not purchase anything in game and hoped that those in charge would get the message as fewer people used their software. However, recently, an update installed that broke the camel's back. Software known as Akamai netcient or some such tried to force install itself onto my computer when I tried to use the client. It was caught by my compter's security thankfully and was blocked. Upon looking further it sends bandwidth and your computer data in a peer to peer network. This is HIGHLY questionable and furthermore a major breach to your computer's security. They have recently stopped using Akamai netclient though I still do not like how they choose  to gouge customers for money since they literally cannot find any quests after about level 10 since they require you to buy access to the content. However, if you go for a subscription then it is likely a fun game, though only if you wish to use a subscription plan and get access to all the features and zones.Just checked it again. Turns out they went back to using Akamei. If you value your computer's security, AVOID TURBINE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!			"

												This is actually a hard review to write. I've played DDO regularly for three years, and irregularly before that. The community is great, it has one of the friendliest and most welcoming player bases of any MMO I've joined. The game itself is a steaming mess of bad coding and half-written abandoned systems pasted over old half-written abandoned systems. Content is released with quest-breaking bugs that (more often than not) are not fixed even while it's still the newest release. There appears to be little to no revision control in place, as the few fixes that are implemented are regularly lost in future updates and never replaced.The lead developer and his assorted team members all routinely admit to being unable to understand systems programmed by previous work teams, as well as not knowing the mechanics and how the game rules work.That all said, the players are great, and if you ignore anything added after 2013, the content is very fun.

												It was fun when it started, then it slowly began it's ascention into the obscure. Straying too far from it's origins, it began to evolve into somthing far too similar to every other game in this genre... too much pay to play content. You eventually get to a point and have to ask yourself, what the hell am I doing with this. Good community, fair system for combat and actions, the quests get a little redundant after so many hours. The voice acting can be abominable, but it's self awareness add a bit of campy charm.It's free to play so what the hell. Try it out. If you're a DnD veteran and a stickler for tradition, you'll be sadly disappointed.			"

												""We want to get back to doing what we REALLY want: running flavorful, hipster quests to see who can win the kill count, and blaze to the end chest faster than the speed of light of mother♥♥♥♥ing light while typing ""LERN2DDO NEWBZ!"" to the people who are lagging way behind, trying to figure out which way to go.""I am recommending this game to everyone who enjoys very complex MMORPGs with endless content and endless character build possibilities.The game started out with great free content. A lot of pay to play content was added but everytime they update the game they always add new free content. You can earn everything without paying if you farm for turbine points(there are plenty of guides out there).If you want to jump right in with spending some money, go on their website and purchase the menace of the underdark complete expansion pack. That is all you need to buy with real money, with all the TP you earn buy vale of twilight and the necropolis 4 adventure packs.Just like other games they also have cool cosmetics you can purchase and some give you buffs.Guilds in the game get Boats/ships that soar through the skys and sometimes if you look up you can see them.Compared to WoW they do have a druid class which has the most spells in the game.Everything in the game is rolled in realtime and the better gear you get improves rolls.Some of the named loot in this game will literally take years to obtain, so it is a very hardcore game.There are wilderness areas in the game(some are larger than the entire fallout 4 game) so you don't have to spend all your time doing quests for experience.If anyone wants to or is already playing on Ghallanda join the steam group. http://steamcommunity.com/groups/DDOGLand "

													Are you tired of playing painfully bland, skill spamming MMOs where all you do is farm monsters/quests just to level up a character whose class dictates what skills they get and you don’t get a say in its development? Do you want a truly engaging MMORPG that lets you control all aspects of your character? If so, look no further than Dungeons & Dragons Online (or DDO for short).	DDO is a free-to-play MMORPG that plays like no other. First off, there’s plenty of content to let you see what this game has to offer available for free, so you don’t need to grab your wallet just yet. You may notice that there are only a few classes available for you to play for free. However, none of the classes are inherently linear and you can tweak each one to your liking. Want to hack enemies to death with blades and still cast spells? No problem. Want to play a fighter that can disarm traps? A little trickier, but possible. Now, some builds are harder to execute than others, some either being impossible or require paid content to execute effectively. However, as long as you're not going for a super-exotic character build, you won’t be disappointed. The game recommends that custom characters only be used by advanced players, but I highly recommend doing it, even if it’s only your first playing because getting to build your own character makes the whole experience much more enjoyable. As long as you are at least somewhat familiar with RPGs, you’ll be able to follow the character creation instructions just fine. (even if you mess up your character a few times) Plus, there are plenty of great guides available, including a few here on steam, to help you if you are confused. It should be noted that this game, while based on Dungeons & Dragons 3.5, isn’t like any edition of D&D. The game plays very differently from its pen and paper predecessor, which may confuse and frustrate those who are familiar with it. Regardless, it works well on its own. One thing that should be noted about the deep character customization is that if you don’t enjoy character building and spending time planning out what kind of character you want to make you may not be able to enjoy the game to it’s fullest. Just a fair warning.	The overall gameplay is similar to most other MMORPGs out there. 1.) Get quests 2.) Kill/Loot 3.) Get XP. However, the way it is executed in DDO is very different. Each quest in is it’s own private instance, taking place in a unique location where the only people you interact with are those in your party, you only see every player in public areas. This gives the game a greater sense of adventure, even if you aren’t all that interested in the story. Also, unlike other MMOs, your health/spell points don’t regenerate, making it so you must manage your resources carefully, making the game much more engaging. Rather than target an enemy and spamming skills, you actually get to fight them as you would a regular Action-RPG. This really helps shrug off that icky MMOish feel that people like me have grown tired of, and really immerse you into the game. You level up much more slowly in this game than most RPGs. However, I can assure you that as long as you're enjoying your character build, this won’t be a problem as every level up gets you a lot more here than it would in another MMO, and you don’t need to farm the same quests over and over to get a good ammount of XP.	Unfortunately, with all the greatness that DDO is, it suffers from quite a plethora of issues. The first chunk of quests are all very enjoyable to play but once you get to the later quests you start encountering cheap ways to die. Traps become extremely cheap and deadly, even if you have a trapper, they can still sneak up on you and end you instantly if you’re not careful. This is almost always true on elite difficulty. Also, having good armor class is helpful early game, but later on spells are what really become dangerous and most enemies will still hit you almost every time, high armor class or not. Making fighting classes have a lower level of solo ability late game, and just less practicality overall. Also, there is a lot of paid content once you get out of the opening area. I can say that the content is worth paying for a subscription and by the time you get to a point where you need to pay for a subscription to continue enjoying the game you will have played enough to know whether or not it is worth it to you. 	However, the real problem lately is the lag, I don’t know what’s happening lately, but the game is getting more and more laggy, and seems to only be getting worse. The past few days alone I’ve experienced lag that has made me want to smash my keyboard and monitor because the game becomes literally unplayable. I remember having this game run smooth as butter several years ago, then watch it slowly get more and more unstable over the years until it finally has become a serious issue. Perhaps it is merely my system that is the problem but I know several other players have been having issues lately. This is backed by the launch screen that is rather...strange. With each download the overall progress always reads 88%, even if it’s nowhere near finished. Also the game will take a very long time to download all the update data, even after you finish downloading the game. It gets the job done, but they way it look always makes me worried that it’s not functioning as it should. I will Admit that all of these issues may be just me, however have heard that the current dev team behind the new DDO updates don’t fully understand the programming of the previous dev team, leading to quite a few technical issues. Hopefully you have a better experience. 	But after all those issues, one more thing that stands out in this game is the community. In an internet where people get incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and rage debate their irrational viewpoints over the most trivial issues, DDO has a shockingly high ratio of kind, understanding players. Time and time again I have joined random parties and time and time again everyone cooperates to get the job done. There are some toxic players out there, but they’re few and far between. 	All in all DDO is very unique MMO with extensive class building and filled with immersive adventures. It suffers late game with cheap attacks/traps and paid content but they still don’t ruin the experience. The only reason I couldn’t completely recommend this game is that the technical issues it’s been having lately can make the game completely unplayable. Perhaps later on this will be fixed but for now it’s the only real flaw the game has. But if you’re lucky you may not even experience the issue. This game is enjoyable solo and is a blast with friends. I strongly encourage you to play it, dabble in a few classes and builds, then if you like it, invite your friends to play and go crazy. If you don’t enjoy it, at least no money was lost. Pros:+ Has very deep character customization, especially for an MMO+ Each adventure feels unique and immersive+ No skill spamming found here, features true Action-RPG gameplay+ Has one of the nicest player community you could find in any MMO+ Did I mention unique character building?Cons:- Graphics are outdated and a few of the voiceovers are very low-quality, shouldn’t be too big of an issue if you enjoy the gameplay- Game gets cheap and you may die out of nowhere by a cheap spell or trap- Lag has been heavy lately, along with other technical issues it could make the game unplayable if you're unlucky. (Hopefully this gets fixed)- May find the game unenjoyable if you don’t like character building (and more importantly re-building)- PvP isn't great since not all classes are combat-optimized			"

												I've played this MMO for years, before it was even on steam. So really, I do want to recommend it to people. Some people looking at this game have probably felt the sting of Pay to Win games before, and to some extent for new players this can be their initial reaction. Ergo I wish to describe as fully as I can the things that made me a fan of this game, and also concede on points others would have in an argument against it.Pros: -This game is 10 years old. That may not seem like a good thing and, it isn't inherently. The way I found this out however, is through the events they recently had for it's anniversary. It celebrated the entire game from it's conception to now, players got to crash an anniversary party, cleave the heads off of some of the more prominent and sometimes frustrating Developers via NPC inserts, in jokes abound from things such as their old web ads and finally FINALLY finding brocolli. (An odd statement to anyone who hasn't played, I'm sure.) My point with this is that it has a very well founded community. A week before this event launched, the Developers had a live stream wherein they went to every server systematically, carpet bombed public areas with loot that you can ONLY be given by devs, and punished greedy players when they stuck around a little too long by spawning dragons, beholders, and giant killer robots in the public areas where they would never have been encountered. The Devs care about the game, and most of the players I've spoken with on my own frequented server are the kind of people you could hang out with without cusswords flung at each other, which is a good thing because...-This game is highly co-operative. It's possible to solo what easily amounts to 80% of the content, give or take. That doesn't ever mean it's preferable to run through everything by yourself. Honestly this was the one MMORPG I've tried my hand at where grouping together was genuinely appealing. If I'm playing a Cleric, Wizard, Barbarian, etc. it is, from the perspective of those classes, a very very nice thing to have a Rogue in the party. Every quest is in an instance, and you can either take 6-12 man teams into it depending on the quest/raid. Some of these quests are riddled with traps, hidden doors for extra loot and experience when you crack them open and head through to find some rare enemy that wasn't really on your to-do list. The traps range from easy to walk around, placed in an area you aren't required to go through, to being a repeatedly exploding ball of pure evil that attempts to also paralyze you when you activate it, and again with every blast. Rogues can turn off all of the above traps as you run your way through. That doesn't mean rogue is an easy mode class either, since when it comes to all of the enemies you'll face... playing a Rogue, you would have some of the least HP, and you do greatly increased damage to many enemies when they are ticked off at one of your pals, not looking at you. Grouping together in quests is actually really satisfying, since you can get much more done together than alone.-EXP availability is high. All of the quests you've done once, you can do again. Furthermore quests give bonus experience for going out of your way to do things like killing a majority, if not just all the enemies in a quest, finding x amount of secret doors, turning off x amount of traps, and even just plain breaking enough things (They had it coming, that table and chair set was ugly and my Barbarian has no care for social standards, earning more XP, Win-Win)-The sheer amount, and quality of content. Look, I'll be honest here, the level cap is 30. How much content can you possibly cram into thirty levels? Well... a lot, and it isn't poorly made in my opinion either. Since the game started in early beta, when the level cap advancing to TEN was a milestone, the developers have made every quest save for a few, and the stories behind them marvelously. When I hit level 15, one of my very favorite quest/story arcs is ""harbinger of madness."" Not to spoil too much, but what begins as an investigation into missing persons quickly turns into dealing with fashion obsessed denizens from a dimension composed of raw insanity.-It stays as true as it can to good old, Pen and Paper D&D. Everything you do in this game is on a dice system. Not one that is ever slow to respond (unless you have a connection lag, which is better than it used to be.) but immediately shows you information like ""Okay, I rolled a 20 with my great axe against this beholder. That means I vorpal hit. So, I automatically critically hit the enemy, depending on my weapon's stats and if they are dependant on that roll do a ton more damage, and since I have a great axe, deal triple my normal damage regardless. Hulk smash!"" but you don't ever have to wait on that line of thinking, or really pay attention to it in a lot of cases. It will roll for every swing, for granting you every point of damage in real time. Then, remember when I said rogues were great for disabling traps? Well, they have to roll dice the good old fashioned way. They have to roll dice to find it if it hasn't already started being a thorn in your side, and a check to disable device. This is a skill they can train, sometimes so high as to let them guarantee it turns off... sometimes not. When not so, it can hilariously blow up in their face (literally) and no further attempt to turn it off can be made, depending on how poor they rolled.-It isn't the most impossible thing to obtain paid for content. When you first step into the game, I have no doubt you will be intimidated by the amount of locked races, classes, and quest packs. However, unlike most games with some arbitrary ""Trade random player X amount of normal currency for X amount of ""paid currency"" it isn't the hardest thing to get said paid currency WITHOUT paying. Every time you run a quest for the first time on a given difficulty, you earn points towards getting a nice chunk of change in the form of Turbine Points. Even more so, the points themselves give you bonuses too. New players might want to get points with ""The Coin Lords"" for up to 2 extra, FREE backpack slots per character, all while earning progress towards currency to buy that class/race/quest you want, and most of which I've found decently priced... mostly.I could say so many great things about this game, and while I still recommend it, I can't ignore the negatives.Cons:-Plain and simply this is a damn buggy game sometimes. Some bugs are exploitable, some are debilitating, some are a particular place in a particular dungeon which will get you trapped forever, some are ladders which you just can't climb in certain places. The devs are always working on them apparently, and bug reports help, but the flyswatter hardly ever seems to fall on important issues. One of my character's abilities, at the time of writing this review, CAN ROB MY TEAM OF LEVELS TEMPORARILY! It's only supposed to do so in an aoe against the, you know, ENEMIES!-There are some content pieces which I can't deny, definitely appear to be unreasonably priced. While there are weekly sales which, especially near holidays, cut prices on certain groups of items from the cash shop dramatically... sometimes you can look at two items right next to each other and wonder why the more expensive one is actually more expensive. Like most races costing 995 Turbine points (TP) whereas the most recent costs well over 1,200-Some of the best quests are paid for. Especially my favorite listed above.-There is a serious lack of endgame content. The usual system is to, once you reach at least level 20, restart your character at level one, with a choice of any class/race you have, and be stronger every time you restart. However, content at level 20+ seems lacking in scale compared to everything below so... why even push to 30?			"

												""stay close to the edge, don't go into the middle of the floor..."", rapidly types our Cleric as we approach an apparently harmless room. But i read it to late. I've seen the sparkling chest nestled enticingly in an alcolve directly opposite our position and i rush towards it. Stupid. The floor collapses and i fall into the misty chamber below. There are bones strewn around the room and then suddenly an elite level scorpian erupts from the ground and immediately attacks me. The rest of my group - my guild mates - leap heroically into the chamber and we engage the beast together and manage to bring it down. ""we can't get that chest now, there is no way back up"", says the same Cleric. ""sorry"" i say, and imagine my character, head hung in shame, shuffling his feet. ""no problem :)"" says the Cleric. My Ranger searches the room and finds the lever that opens the chamber. A gloomy tunnel stretches into the distance. We heal up then move on.This is what D&D Online is all about and when it is at its best. The game has a number of large open hub areas but the missions will almost certainly lead you underground into a dark cavern or muggy sewer. In the hubs you can find group members, hire mercernary's, prurchase healing scrolls and potions, and upgrade gear and equipment, before venturing into the dangers below. Some quests ask you to clear out an infestation of spiders/kobolds/etc, normlly with  larger, more dangerous boss type near the end, whilst others may ask you to rescue a merchant's daughter or find a precious artifact. Throughout these dungeons there is the possibility of finding rare monsters with epic loot, normally only found by finding a hidden door or secret area, but only if you or one of your group has the riht skills. This is a game that rewards exploration, that encourages group play, and grabs wholeheartdly at that inner fantasy nerd that exists in so many of us.As a solo experience this is a lesser game. You can clear same level content no problem, even an elite dungeon or two with the right equipment and merc's, but the exprience feels lonely and more shallow on your own.The game truely shines as a multiplayer experience, which, to be fair, is exactly how the game is intended to be.I can over look the aged graphics and tired engine for the wonderful frill of descending into the deaths of an undead crypt with a group of likeminded advnturers. Most stuff is decided on invisible dice rolls and armor/will saves just like (almost) the tabletop game, but the combat has a degree of twitch and you can dodge incoming attacks with a well timed double tap. When you find a loot chest automtic rolls take place and loot is devidied up accordingly but you can transfer items to another group member if you want to.The community is very friendly and I was soon in a really helpful high level guild (this brings loads of perks to experience gains and buffs) and there nevr seems to be shortage of people to go questing with.Much like LOTRO the whole game is F2P with the need to buy quest packs for additonal content or unlocks for certain race/class types. It is fair to say that you will likely need to pnd a few quid t some point to advance th whole experience but the good thing is this can be done at your leisure and if you done wan to then, well, dont.I for one applaud this style of F2P model and for  a game that provides this much AAA fun I had not issue with spending money on it - i just purchased all of the DLC for just over £14 in the sale and thats good value by any standard.If you like D&D, fantasy, and group style play then i can highly recommend this game. If you don't or are looking for another WOW style experience then keep looking. D&D online isnt trying to be WOW or Guildwars and I am glad of that.As an fantasy adventure maker this game is top notch and you should certainly give it a whirl - 8.8/10			"

												I decided to re-write this review which I did 3 years ago. A lot of things have changedDungeons & Dragons Online (DDO) is an MMORPG where are both explorable areas and different dungeons and raids you can do with your character, which depending how you build them. The game also has different difficulties you can run dungeons with, as well as even harder difficulties once you get to the late game. The game heavily leans toward co-op playing with either your friends, guildies or strangers. There is actually no proper PvP in this game.Pros:+ Character creation. There are 14 different classes and 9 different races. Not only that but you can multi-class in this game however you like up to 3 different classes, though it's adviced that you know then why you're multi-classing. There are also Iconic classes which gives you a certain race benefit, but ""requires"" you to start with a certain pre-determined class. You however do get XP enough to level right away to level 15, so you still somewhat keep some kind of freedom for your character.+ Difficulty settings in dungeons for both the starters and hardcore players.+ Co-op heavily encouraged. Gather friends and you will have fun.+ Large explorable areas and lots of different dungeons for you to try out playing.Neutrals:* Earning DDO in-game store money by just playing. You get a repeatable 25 TP from time to time when you do quests. You also get one-time bonuses if you do quests for the first time in that server. Highly recommended to do on all servers to get you couple of things unlocked for you from the DDO Store. However this can be grindy, and will  bore you easily. Moreover you definitely need either someone to open the quests for you for repeated TPs, or you need to make a secondary account to just do that.* Lootgen. The game after Update 29 loot generation was scrapped and replaced with way worse loot, which didn't fit with my equipemnt or characters at all. However for the new players this shouldn't be a problem. This is moreover a warning that you might see two different kinds of loot in the auction house for instance. Also the lootgen weapons are way inferior to any named weapons* Complexity. The game can be complex to new players, especially those who haven't even touched the original DnD board game. You have a lot to learn, so DDOWiki will be your best friend at guiding you through the mechanics, like spell saves and multiclassing.* Combat. The combat isn't nowadays like it was. You will see a lot of people and sooner or later yoruself just running through the dungeon, stopping only to kill things which are easy to dispose of, for both melee and spell casters. The combat might become boring in certain quests, but there are also fights which also makes you tense up really well, especially with a group not with people who know the quest alreadyCons:- The game is dying. During the EU primetime the servers might as well be dead, but even during US primetime you won't see that many groups anymore. Currently I believe every server except Wayfinder has only 400 on the US primetime, and less than 200 in EU primetime. Wayfinder has only 100 during US primetime and 50 on EU primetime.- Character appearance. There isn't much you can do to change the appearance of a character other than pre-set hair, facial details, nose, mouth and their color.- Paywall. A lot of the dungeons are needed to buy first. Also half of the races and classes are behind a paywall also. The prices range from 2 to 15 euros for adventure packs and 25 for expansion packs (which can be on Steam sales for very low price). However you will be fine without buying anything if you don't mind do a little bit of running the same dungeon multiple times. Also remember you can earn these still for free by just playing.- No PvP. There are these arenas you can go to but no one is actively searching for PvP since it is heavily biased towards caster classes and those who are at max level.- Graphics are out-dated. This game is from 2004, and they haven't really still updated the look of the game in old contents.- No endgame. Basically once you get to the highest level (currently 30) there is nothing to do but to make your character get better armor unless you want to start from level 1 again with a thing called True Reincarnation, which makes you keep all the items from earlier, and other small benefits. Otherwise the endgame pretty much is running quests over and over again, and every third day running couple of raids hoping to get a named item from there. In short, the endgame isn't worth it at all. Hence you will see a lot of people just True Reincarnate over and over again to keep playing the levels which were interesting-ish.The game used to be fun to play with. But with the recent changes and the paywall being way too big, I just can't recommend this anymore. The game is just too old and due to the developers only focusing on new P2P content and not even promoting it in any way, the game is dying slowly. You're better off saving your money to something newer like Neverwinter or Guild Wars 2.			"

												My favorite MMORPG out of all I've played.A large portion of this is the extent to which it encourages cooperation with other players. In other MMOs I have played, I've just ended up wandering through the starting area doing quests, never feeling the need to party with other players. In Dungeons & Dragons Online (DDO), if you want to complete the dungeons on the highest difficulty setting, having other players around is a great boon. Traps alone can give many adventurers a lot of trouble, and having(or being) a player that can disable them makes them a valuable member of a party. And, while many experienced players have ways of keeping themselves alive regardless of class, everyone appreciates a good healer.I also love the high level of customization available in DDO. You have the option to set your own ability scores (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, and CHA), allocate your own skills (Search and Disable Device are paramount for trappers, while Jump is more generally useful), and choose your own feats, including fighting styles such as Two-Handed, Two Weapon(including ""unarmed"" combat), Single Weapon, and Shield Mastery. Casters have the option of taking metamagic feats such as Maximize and Empower to increase the destructive(or healing) power of their spells, or Heighten and the various Spell Focuses to make them harder to resist (especially useful for instant kill spells and Crowd Control).A less desirable feature to many players may be that the game is heavily instanced. There aren't many vast areas to explore; many quest entrances are accessed directly from town, and each party will be in a separate instance of each quest or wilderness zone. While I feel that this was necessary to encourage cooperation to the extent that they have, I can understand players who may think this makes the world feel smaller.Also, a large portion of the game is behind P2P bars, despite the game itself being Free to Play. You CAN earn Turbine Points in-game and unlock the content of the game without spending a cent, but I have heard that it is better to consider the game a subscription-based game with a limited free trial than a truly free to play game, and I can appreciate that standpoint. If you start playing the game without unlocking any content, you can feel the P2P walls start closing in on you, starting especially around level 6-8 (level cap is 30, so this is higher than it sounds compared to other games).That said, I feel that the pros outweigh the cons for this game; feel free to jump in for free, and see how well you like it before commiting to paying for anything, and I definitely recommend waiting for sales before purchasing Adventure Packs to make the most out of your Turbine Points.

												It's an MMo that isn't going to hold your hand, it's fully willing to you have fail a quest you are an hour into without any mercy. A trap can go off and wipe your group, or some elite enemies will mess your day up. However if you prepare your group, and find those traps you can get through with no issues.  I can recommend this game, because I keep coming back to it, despite it's flaws. Pros:Characters are complex, you can build it in almost anyway you can imagine.Tons of equipment with unique things that you might not see in any other MMOVery skill basedThe Dungeon Masters are a great additionCan be a bit unforgiving (which is good and bad)If you are familliar with D&D you will understand it quickly, but at the same time it's not terribly hard for new players.It rewards exploration and puzzle solving.Magic is both rewarding, and challenging.Cons: Not many people playing from what I can tell.Can be a bit unforgiving (which is good and bad)Combat can be a bit boring depending on your classes.Leveling can take quite a long time.The cash shop. Locking certain quests until you sub, or buy mission packs.Damn I'm bad at writing reviews.			"

												I love the game. I started playing it when you had to buy it in stores and level 10 was the max level. The free to play option is great but very limited at first. The best thing to do if you do the free to play route, is use the free ddo store points you unlock to buy more adventure packs. They go on sale regularly. You can unlock all of the game without spending a dime but it takes a long time to do that. The character buiilding is amazing, you can make any type of character you want almost. A wizard that throws fireballs, a fighter with a great sword, a monk the punches people, a sorccerer that melees things down, a cleric arcane archer, a staff wielding barbarian, a rogue/wizard/paladin, ex....

												Sadly, STEAM has blocked the ability to purchase in-game.  The issue seems to be that STEAM wants a cut of the pruchases and Turbine doesn't work that way.  Don't install via STEAM.  Go to the DDO.com website, download the client, and let STEAM ♥♥♥♥ someone else.			"

												I started to play this game in 2009 at that time it was Dungeons and Dragons Eberron Unlimited. I played it quiet a long time approximately 1000+ hours. We started with bunch of friends for fun but then all of a sudden it became serious we were addicted this game was amazing, we cleared lots of dungeons had the best items, paid for some expansions. After a long time i started to play it again and with a fresh ideas. My review is short and simple as always.   PROs:-Gameplay is amazing.-Dungeons are really detailed and great.-Leveling system and classes are different than usual but its better in most ways. -Quests are good and not boring.-You can create really good Builds with a fantastic skill tree system-It's a game to play with a group friends. (for me the solo is a little boring) not just for fun because in lots of dungeons you need different classes and roles to have the most of it.   CONs-The graphic are getting old and decent for our time.-There is a lot of, i mean A LOT OF, ""paid"" content like expansions, character slots, classes, races... goes on. -It's not a free world there is only cities , towns to roam, shop etc. and dungeons (instances) for some action.-Not too much players: Population is really low.-The game is dying and perhaps nearly dead.It's a wholla lotta different gamplay experience. I recommend this game. I love this game. it has a different place for me. I suggest you to play it (if possible play it with some friends), experience it, than its all your decision to like it or not. Have Fun!			"

												Ever since they switched to the new datacenter they are on, the lag has been highly annoying... which, in turn, caused a very large portion of the players that were still around (admittedly not a gigantic number) to bail out. There is also the fact that the players that ARE still around have been around for years and don't want to spend the time to enjoy the dungeons, rather than just blazing through them at full steam.

It's basically unplayable without vip status (15/month)-dead game, dead community+amazing skill trees, allows for all sorts of flavour builds, probably more than any other mmo+what remains of the community is p chill+game is mostly instanced, so the adventures/quests are much more interesting than your average mmos+mountains of voice acting if you have vipThe best way to play this game would be two people getting membership and dicking around with builds and doing coop. Don't go into this game solo or if spending 15-30 dollars a month is too much.Across steam and my normal play i've only got around 1,000 hours in the game but I really enjoyed it.			"

												I have played this game on and off for years, and spent well over 200 dollars on it over the course of that time including monthly subscriptions and purchases of ingame currency, with 200 being a pretty conservative estimate. My account was suspended without notification and I no longer have access to it without any justification why. Support has almost completely shut down due to what I assume is a lack of funding and as a result there is no longer a way for you to call. I have opened a total of 5 support tickets, had 3 closed on me and 2 unanswered. When I contacted Turbine they said the support team still has an active ticket for me. Don't express confidence in keeping the account you've spent your money on. The game itself was fun when the population was high because character customization is very diverse but they never adapted to their dwindling population by adding between-server instanced dungeons. It would GREATLY improve the ""LFM"" system.			"

												My favorite of all the available MMOs after playing these games for about five years now.  Much closer to pencil and paper D&D than Neverwinter Online and a much better game as well.PROs* Extensive content after eight years of updates and expansions (since 2006) with two major D&D campaigns: Eberron and the Forgotten Realms.* The original quests are focused on group play and are similar in layout and tone to pencil and paper D&D modules.* More detailed character customization than any MMO that I know of.  You can play a halfing ninja assassin (dark monk), a drow elf wizard / fighter, or a warforged artificer / ranger, among many other combinations.* True Reincarnation system which allows a single character to start again at level one with a new class and/or race and become more powerful each time.  Indepth replay ability for this reason.* A mature, dedicated player community that wants to expand the community.CONs* Ongoing bugs / exploits that are being slowly addressed by Turbine - but this doesn't make the game unplayable.* The graphics and some other features are aging when compared to very new MMOs.

												Dungeons And Dragons Online is a severe dissapointment from turbine after their amazing take on tolkiens universe in Lord Of The Rings OnlineThe game had a nice idea. An MMORPG with components of the popular tabletop roleplaying game D&D thrown into the soup ocassionally.But what ended up happening was more like this""HOORAY CRAM ALL THE D&D MECHANICS INTO THIS GAME SO WE CAN MAKE MOOOONEEEYY""The game ended up as an abhorrent broken mess that just felt wrong to play. They obviously spent no time on the animations, graphics and artwork because it looks absolutely terrible even if you shift everything up to full graphics quality the faces and joints look all triangular and you know a game hasn't been worked on enough when your joints have colision glitches with your other joints and your weapon constantly.The game is filled to the brink with ""pay to play"" merchandise which i suppose is excusable for most free to play games but this game literally takes it to the next level when you have it bombarding you with merchandise as soon as you reach level 2The classes are just not fun to play and are completely unbalanced. Solo runs become pretty much impossible as soon as you reach a decent level. Anything other than your standard melee class is horrible to play as. I really did try to get nostalgic with the races but the appearence of the races was absolutley screwed up (especially the warforged, I mean oh my god its a construct of metal and wood not fricken rainbows). The customization is really broad... In a bad way. You know somethings up when you can have a halfling with pitch black skin and red glowing eyesit's like LOTRO turned wrong... really really wrong			"

												First things first: I really like DDO. The time displayed doesn't nearly reflect the time I've spent on this game, just add a good ~3,000 hours and it might be right.I like it in spite of the following:- There are still bugs in the game, that have been known for years. (After seven years, there was a kind of unofficial celebration of the infamous ""ladder bug"" on the forums. I think I'd be sad if they fixed it someday.)- The new shard exchange (read: we want your real money) dealt the death blow to the ingame currency.- The player base has been eroding for years now and new players a rare sight.- If you can't find a group / guild to join, you'll have a hard time (read: die a lot) as a new player.- If you have never before played D&D, you will ♥♥♥♥ up on character creation the first time around. And the second time and the third time,... can you notice a pattern?- If you have played D&D before, you will ♥♥♥♥ up on character creation, the first time around. And then the second and third time... but you will notice your mistakes earlier.- There are tons of low to mid-level quests but hardly any F2P-quests in endgame.- No, sadly it's not really like pen and paper D&D. Then again, I can't imagine how to make that fly as an MMORPG.(- How to put this gently: Some people will instantly hate DDO upon reading this paragraph. Why? There is no PvP to speak of. PvP only exist if you want to participate, but it's useless. DDO's character classes are based on the pen and paper version of D&D 3.5. Meaning, the classes are supposed to support each other in combat against enemies, not against each other. No matter how often you throw your virtuoso-skilled Bard against my Wizard, you're toast. If you want PvP and can't have fun in a game without bushwhacking other players' characters, go somewhere else.)I like DDO because of the following:- In fact I like this game so much, I've even started to like it's bugs and there are plenty of those. Some are frustrating while others are hilarious and none of them game breaking. Yep, that's a  pro  for me.- Nice crafting system - or more precisely - systems, as there are roughly ten diffferent crafting systems around. If you've got enough time or money or capable and nice friends / guild members, you'll have decent gear pretty soon.- Once you know how to look for a group it's easy to find one. If you ask nicely, the other members of your new group will probably slow down and explain why they are doing what they are doing and may even act as tour guides during quests.- The game is heavily instanced which I happen to like.- While it is easy to ♥♥♥♥ up on character creation, there is plenty of information on the forums how not to. Make no mistake, your first character will be utterly incompetent. If trying, testing and scrapping different builds of characters translates to ""fun"" for you, this is your game. You'll hardly find a game that gives you more freedom to create  your  character.- Yes, you can spend money on the game. I certainly did over the years but you don't have to. If you've got the time or patience you can farm enough of the shop currency ""Turbine Points"" to buy everything you need. And you'll simply earn those points by just playing.- The graphics are older but still decent enough.- No involuntary PvP. If you like really well done PvE though, give DDO a try.- If you need advice or help ingame, just go into the next tavern (because players idle there to regenerate and have some spare time on their hands) and ask. Send someone you see with ""wings"" left and right of their character's name a polite /tell and chances are good you'll get your answer or a hint where to look.- Huge amount of freedom when it comes to character builds, I cannot emphasise this enough.- Active combat! You might even have to use your brain sometimes. Just standing around while spamming attacks and holding everything on cooldown is not how combat works in DDO.- Always new and fun ways to die. Did you know that the teleport spell comes with the possibility of depositing you a few hundred metres above the marketplace? Hope you remember where your Ring of Feather Fall is while panicking.I have to admit, that the game is past it's prime but it has aged well. You certainly should give it a try if you are into D&D. After all, it's F2P.			"

												I have been playing this game since release. In terms of gameplay its one of the best. There is always something to do and they are regularly adding content to the game. One of the good things about the game is that you wont succeed unless you do well in a party since there are few solo dungeons. There is a crazy assortment of loot as well as the ability to craft. One of the weakness of the game is the FTP model. The store in DDO makes it possible for you not to do any work in the game. You can just buy all +5 tomes. Also, even though they have added the Forgotten Realms to the game it doesn't have that D&D feel. Its a cool world in its own right but weak in terms of emersion			"

												I love playing this game, there is no other game out there that does what DDO does. The dungeons, classes and races in the D&D Ebberon mix seems just perfect. Now that they've added Forgotten Realms I am just even more excited when I play this game.Be warned, this game is largely made to be played with friends or in a group. I have seen some people solo, but truthfully the most fun I've had is when me and some friends head off into an adventure together.			"

												Introduction;I have spent many hours on this game over the years, and even though it may feel a little antiquated now, it is still one of the best RPG's that I have played in a very long time.It feels like a true RPG, and a true adaptation of the AD&D Rule Set that true AD&D gamers are familiar with.  There is none of that level scaling crap in this game which has become a trend recently.  It is all leveled content.This is one of the few games which I install every time I have to do a re-install of Steam for what ever reason.The Game;The world is huge, to be frank.  AD&D has access to areas of the Forgotten Realms region that, I assume most of us are familiar with, as well as the main city hub of Stormreach, and several huge explorer regions.  For instance, when you get into the Forgotten Realms Campeign setting, you gain access to Evening Star, and eventually gain the keys to the city. If you don't want to be there, then you can go to Stormreach, the Kings Forest, or even the Underdark.The game has all of the usual enemies which you would associate with the AD&D world, including Dryads, Dire Bears, Kobolds, Druids, and Drow.  The enemies are plentiful, the loot is plentiful, and the traps which can be powerful enough to kill you in one shot, are also plentiful.  It is a true AD&D game in every way.The amount of loot that can be acquired from various quests is so expansive that I cannot list them all here, but there is everything from +5 Daggers, to +6 Docents, to +1 Kite Shields, to specific, named loot.  It turly is immense, and the amount of ways to get that loot is even more expansive especially considering the depth of the crafting system, and the wilderness areas which contain specific bosses who can be farmed for fat lewt.  On top of that, farmable item sets of great power can be farmed in Evening Star, simply by farming event tokens in the Kings Forest.  That only takes a few nights to get, and you are essentially fully geared.The quests are plentiful for both groups, raids and solo players.  The main issue with that however, is that the servers can feel a little empty at the minute, but to help tackle this issue, the game does still receive constant new updates.  Later this year for instance (2017), the development team will be releasing the Ravenloft expansion pack.  Besides which, you can cut the need to do low level content out by purchasing the Shadowfell Conspiracy Expansion Pack and start from level 15 with a heroic class.  Furthermore, a lot of the content does not require a group, so there is nothing stopping you from playing solo, scene as every class has access to certain spell casting and healing items.  With all that said, the game is ageing well, for a 10 year old game.The highlight of this entire game however, is the level of character customisation.  Every character can be specifically customised in a variety of ways, whether it is through the character generation screen when you first start, or through the epic destiny system, or the tallents trees.  For instance I play a mage, that might sound boring at first, until you realize that I play a 20th level Eldritch Knight / Pale Master with 7 Epic Levels in Draconic Lineage.  That makes him one bad ♥♥♥ character in both melee and for spell casting.  The range of spells available are not only equal to anything in the original 2nd edition AD&D rule set, but also exceede it, because of these epic level spells and the abilities granted through the tallent trees.Updates;As I mentioned earlier, the game is constantly updated, and always in the right direction.  New raids, new quests, new player races are added, and a whole plethora of other things are usually added.  THERE IS NO NERFING which is important to mention, because the trend these days seems to be that if something is deemed too powerful, nerf it and that is usually your update in other games.  That doesn't happen in AD&D DDO.  Instead, we get new raids, new quests, new loot, new hero classes and races, in otherwords, content that we actually ask for.  It is all done right.  I would highly recommend buying both of the available expansions packs however.  In particular, The Shadowfell Conspiracy DLC is well worth purchasing on F2P accounts.  If you plan to do some F2P gaming on DDO, especially as a solo player, without having to pay a subscription fee, buy that DLC pack before you do anything else.  I will tell you why below.These are probably my two main gripes against the game.  I don't like the fact that you may feel like you are forced to buy content packs to get the most out of the game if you don't want to subscribe to DDO, or want to treat DDO as entirely F2P, but you can work around this by buying the expansion packs instead.  The only times that locked content may be a pain though, is if you are farming for specific loot, and that loot is only available in a certain part of the game world that you do not have access too, or when you may want to do a quest with your friends, and you don't have access to those quests because you haven't unlocked them.My other gripe is that I really don't like how Spell Points are regenerated via Rest Shrines.  Rest Shrines can be used every 5 minutes, 15 minutes, or once only, depending on the difficulty setting.  This isn't a problem really for classes who don't use spells, but since many of us do, SP management becomes critical, and that is also the chief reason why I chose to play an Eldritch Knight.  Even when my toon runs out of SP, he can still go melee.  The SP elixers should also drop much, much more frequently in game, and I don't think that they should be listed on the store in all honesty.  Selling Spell Point recovery pots may be seen P2W, and may put potential new players off DDO.Subbing Vs F2P.don't bother subbing over a long period of time, it is not worth it.  The only real benefit to subbing is the ""free"" DDO store points that you get each month.  There is a better, cheaper way to unlock most of the games content on F2P accounts, wihtout ever having to pay a subscription fee;1:  Buy the Shadowfell Conspiracy Pack.  This will unlock a ♥♥♥♥ load of content and allow you to start from level 15, as a heroic class character.  This will also make a lot of the lower level, locked content worthless.2:  Buy the Menace of the Underdark Pack.  This will unlock the Forgotten Realms setting as well as the Drow Race and Druid Class, and give you a permanent xp boost for your account.3:  Use any store points given to buy the ""Hall of Heroes pass"" so that you can transfer between Eberon and Eveningstar without having to fight Lolth on a new toon each time.Subbing for a year would cost well over $100.  Buying both of the expansion packs and the Hall of Heroes Pass costs around $50 and you will unlock a lot of the base games content.  you then have access to that content forever, without ever having to pay a subscription fee and can start a new toon at level 15, with access to those campeign settings instantly, forever.  Conclusion.I can whole heartedly recommend this game at the minute.  I am slightly nervous because news broke recently that the Development Team were teaming up with Daybreak Studios, which is a bad sign in my book, but still, I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, for now simply because I enjoy this game so much.  IF DAYBREAK do anything to harm the success and longevity of this game, I will never have anything good to say about that business again, and I will probably hate them until the end of my days.For now, I will continue to actively support this game, and I do plan to buy the Ravenloft Expansion pack later this year, if for no other reason than the goodies it should contain.  Hopefully, aside from the new content, it will include new heroic races, Experince Tomes, and DDO points.  We shall have to wait and see though, how well this unholy alliance with Daybreak plays out.			"

												Review 2.0This is my second review of DDO.  The first was a negative review that started out ***AVOID AT ALL COSTS!*** and  I think that rubbed people the wrong way.  I stand behind the review, and the recommendation to avoid at all costs, but a couple years down the road I find I would write a different review, so I am.DDO started out life as an MMORPG, and that's just not at all what DDO has become.  There's nothing massive about the multiplayer, the population has reached a crippling all time low.  You'll be hard pressed to fill a party for questing, raiding is all but out of the question.  That's not so bad though as the game is more about solo grinding the same content over and over again accumulating past lives.  There is so much grinding that even playing quite a few hours every single day it would take you years to catch up to the players that have been grinding for nearly a decade.The thing is, DDO isn't a role playing game (RPG) anymore either.  There is no teamwork.  Classes aren't meant to excel at one particular aspect of completing a dungeon.  Characters are meant to be entirely self sufficient at all times, tank, DPS, and healer all rolled into one.  This task is aided by grinding out pastlives, many, many, countless pastlives.  Additionally, characters can take levels in up to 3 different classes.  What you need to know about this however is that you will never accidently stumble on a powerful combination, luckily for you players have logged tens of thousands of hours finding the most overpowered combinations possible.  DO NOT try to make your own, follow the cookie cutter builds, many of which are going to require a lot of grinding pastlives before you'll be able to duplicate their results.The game's highest difficulty settings have been designed around these super over powered characters, you will stand little chance of surviving wihtout one.  If you want to play on the highest levels at the highest difficulty you are going to have to invest a substantial amount of time grinding content over and over to prepare your character.  Not weeks or months, but years.  If you play 8 hours a day, 7 days a week, then perhaps you might be able to grind it out in under a year.If you want a game that makes you powerful beyond belief by endlessly grinding simple content over and over and over again, DDO is the game for you.  If you want a game that rewards even the smallest amount of skill, look elsewhere.			"

												Don't let the 2 hours on steam fool you, i've played thousands of hours (close to 10k) of DDO prior to update 19. DDO, was one of the funnest games, due to the amount of customization you can do to a character, multiclassing and enhancement building, make a fighter work as a ranger, that was better with bows than a ranger, was actually pretty sick (kensei/arcane archer). But prior to 19 things started to just get easier, xp was easier to come by, epic tokens were easier to come by (with the minigame system they had). Then 19, just made it a more complex wow clone. They went from D&D, build the way you want! to..... here, follow these! I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting time on this, unless you want to play a now, uglier, and slow paced version of WoW.With each major overhaul update, the game is slowly getting closer the likes of a wow clone. RIP DDO			"

												Finally decided to write a review for this game after almost 300 hours on steam, and many more outside of steam.Pros:1. Free, you cant beat that2. Rewards teamwork, unlike other MMO games3. Tons of free content4. Ingame mechanic to unlock more content as you play5. Unique puzzles, and platforming6. Small, yet friendly community7. Regular updates with new content, even for F2p8. Ability to share loot with party members, just like table topCons:1. Player base is starting to fade sadly2. Hard to understand crafting system (which has been updated so fingers crossed)3. A lot of content is locked away behind pay walls, but you can unlock it as stated above4. In later levels the grind becomes tedious, repeating quests is common place5. RNG drop system is a pain (you can select to get drops based on class/race, but mages often get greataxes)6. At end game content if your character started F2p you will be gimped compared to your P2P allies7. PvP scene is laughable8. Limited character slots (can unlock more)			"

												I have been playing Dungeons and Dragons Online (DDO) since it went to free to play in 2009.   I have bought a quarter of  the quest packs for my 3 premium accounts.  DDO is a ""Free to Play"" MMORPG but if you want to go far into DDO, you Will have to pay real money.  DDO is more Free to Try and Pay to Win. You can grind for favor to earn a small amount of store points on your account, but you would have to work really hard to earn enough just to buy 1 quest pack.  The best way now to play DDO is paid subscription (which is $9.99 a month for a year sub). All the quest packs (except Expansions), most classes, account perks and races are open to subscribers, and you receive 500 store coins each month of VIP.  I suggest you try it out from Steam as Free to Play, then if you really want to pay, go to Turbine DDO website to pay.  You could play as Premium non-subscriber but you will have to buy most of the quest packs just to reach level 20 without grinding and be limited in your choices of avatars.  Expansions will have to be bought separately for level 20 and above content or non-Stormreach content.  DDO is set  in the Dungeons and Dragon universe of Eberron and Forgotten Realms on expansion, and fairly follows the pen and paper game closely.  I liked this game better than the Dungeon and Dragons Neverwinter MMO.  The graphics and controls are good still.  In-game Loot is plentyfull. The game like all other game has it's faults but it is better than the other games out there currently still, imho.  Give it a try.   for more info:

												Can not reccomen to anyone who does not have atleast 2 friends to playw with. I have to say I really do like this game. I hav played D&D alot and it carries over so much that it feels almost nostalgic to play along with being a pretty good MMORPG experience. My only problem with the game is that it becomes very quickly impossible to play alone. I don't mean ""I can't play it alone so its bad"", I would be completely fine with playing with other players, the problem is that the player base is so small that if you are tying to even get 1 other person for a quest it takes over 10 minutes (this would be fine i guess if it was end game stuff, but I am only level 3 and can't find ayone). So you must have friends to play with you just so you can do the basic quests. Other tuff that does not translate well from the board D&D to the MMO D&D is stealth mechanics. If you do not start as a rogue (althouh i believe bards and rangers also get stealth stuff) then sneaking is almost impossible until the upper levels of the game. You obviously have the ""Hide"" and ""Move Silently"" skills from normal D&D and the game gives you a toggle ability called ""Sneak"" on every character, but it accomplishes nothing. There are missions you get alot early on that require you too sneak through a dungeon without killing more then 5 or 6 enemies (which is very little considering after you get out of th tutorial there are more then 5 or 6 enemie per room even in solo dungeons, although that isn't too bad), but the problem is that your are detected instantly upon entering a room while using ""Sneak"" if you only hae average ""Hide"" and ""Move Silently"", even by sleeping enemies. You can;t run past them and ignore them because all enemies are faster then the player, even with no armor on, so they will eventually surround you and you will be unable to move or jump over them and they will interrupt you when you try to use levers or open doors. On top of all that, the game is very unforgiving of Free2Play players. Many events, stories, quests, items, skill trees, classes and races are all locked if you do not buy the VIP subscription membership or outright buy them individually, which locks you out of leveling easier or getting many better items. Even the forums run by the developr do not even allow you post a reply, let alone post a question on their forum unless you are atleast a VIP member, so if you have a problem, but aren;t subscribed then your problem doesn't exist.

												Honestly, this is not the same game that was released at launch. I tried to get back into it a couple of weeks ago. It doesn't bother me that I have to pay to get extra stuff. What bothered me was the misleading character creation. Created my character HP was 7. Got into the game and like my HP was in the 40s and I'm doing damage that is beyond what is normal for D&D. Also there doesn't seem to be an spell slots. At launch that's what made this game so special and unique for it's time. I had a group of friends that went from WOW to DDO when it was released. We loved it. I remember the stress the cleric had when he only had one cure light wounds left so everyone had to play it safe. It doesn't feel like D&D anymore.			"

												Dungeons and Dragons Online, a mostly forgotten game by anyone I know. Truth be told I found it a lot more enjoyable than when I first played it when it became free. So much so that I decided to actually buy some features. The trick is... learning the tricks in the first place! The game is free to play, and despite what others may think, you most certainly do not need to pay a thing to hit level 20 and reincarnate. While it is true you can buy things to increase your power, it does not approach ""pay to win"" levels of brokenness. Should you decide the game is worth spending money on, I recommend a discounted Menace of the Underdark (which is available right now if you know how to do it, or wait for the rare Steam sale).There are a LOT of the cash shop items that try to bleed you dry. Some seem reasonable to me, whilst others hell no. Seriously, $12-$15 for experience items on a single character? For reference, farming in-game currency is roughly 25 cents an hour at best... which is kind of a poor way to spend one's time.Despite being a MMO, all quests are instanced. This means that the only time you will ever run into people is in towns. In a way it's nice, but it also feels empty for soloers in that regard.It's quite possible to solo your way to 20, which is what my first character did. If you're a soloer, don't be afraid to hire some hirelings, especially healing ones. They are dirt cheap and they don't rob you of any experience at all. They do cause more monsters to spawn like what would happen in a group setting, but it's usually worth the increased survivability. For a rough time estimate, it took me a solid month of semi-dedicated playing and no knowledge of any quests to reach 20. With actual game knowledge, I could probably cut that time in half. With a good group, you can probably cut that in half yet again. And now there's a built in +20% daily completion bonus that should help speed things up.The Action point/Enhancement system recently got a revamp and went from horrendous to kind of cool. Out of all the free MMORPG's these days, this is the only one I spent money on.			"

												I hope that 74 hours alongside some very good and enamored friends was enough to give this game a fair shake, but ultimately I just can't really recommend it. The game is an attempt to be a semi-faithful recreation of the 3.5 D&D experience, although unlike, say, the old Neverwinter Nights, the game adds some concessions to MMO playability between things like talent trees and the fact that you get Spell Points instead of myriad slots. The concept is set in Eberron, which is a kind of high-magic crystal-punk sort of setting, and the game is played almost entirely through instanced dungeon work.There are reasons that D&D is not played in realtime, and this game demonstrates exactly why. An instant save-or-die death spell on the tabletop can have a dramatic buildup leading the clattering of that 20-sided die; in a realtime game, you just die suddenly for no readily apparent reason, which engenders neither tension nor ""what could I have done better"" counterplay thoughts so much as it simply engenders stunned contempt. The same can go for high end blast spells and traps, many of which can kill characters instantly.They'll often do so with little more than a 'klick,' too, because the sound assets in this game are the poorest I've heard outside bad indie games. Your mighty two-handed sword will do little more than sort of lightly 'dink' while it slices a devastating critical hit through a gnoll; your entire team can be killed by a sonic trap that strongly reminds one of a rather shy doorbell, while, conversely, the discovery of secret doors leads to a deafening CLUNK that overshadows the din of any battle. The upshot is that there's no feel of impact to pitched melee battles. The music has been added to in the many expansions, but never replaced, meaning the early-game music is poor and repetitive.Between that and lacklustre animations, the combat - which is what you will be spending the overarching majority of your time in Stormreach doing, this being a fantasy MMO - feels weak and ephemeral. By aiming for a more quasirealistic if colorful fantasy look, the character art assets might have been good in 2006, but have not aged wonderfully. While I hate to contrast to WoW, WoW's cartoonier style certainly helped preserve its original, dated models for a longer functional time; these assets currently sleep at the bottom of the uncanny valley. The dungeons are pains to navigate, the quest UI is poor to nonfunctional, power (even if not strictly necessary power) is sold via the game's microtransaction system in the form of stat-boosting Tomes and field self-revives.Is there anything positive to say? A little. The game does, unlike many MMOs, have more comprehensible mechanics to those experienced with the D&D 3.5 system, and so it's easier to see what's going on under the hood. The game also manages to successfully break the Holy Trinity (tank/healer/DPS) so prevalent in many other MMOs with a very fluid and diverse class system. Character customizability always was a strength of D&D 3.0/3.5, and that’s unquestionably present.  The Dungeon Master, a voice who narrates things your character is ostensibly experiencing, is a welcome nod to the tabletop.Outside of that, though, it’s hard to recommend it, even to fans of the D&D 3.5 system. Fantasy adventures are not in short supply at the moment, and it’s probably best to seek them elsewhere.			"

												A fantastic take on DDO based in Eberron lore, They recently tied it in with the Forgotten Realms with the Underdark Adventure Pack. Very in depth character creation stats wise. Not very many options to customize your toons look though. All bodies are the same pretty much. Definitely some of the best dungeon crawls and seasonal events. not much in the way of pvp though.

												Even though it has been an on-again, off-again relationship with DDO, it's the only MMO I consistently come back to every now and then. It's a decent game, and although they've far abandoned any sense of core d&d rules, it's one of the most in-depth character customization systems available in the MMO market. I would like to do an in depth review of my roller coaster ride with DDO (some good, some definitely bad), I still recommend the game and think it's one of the better MMOs available... even today.

												First off, the Mac client has some serious technical problems. It wouldn't even install on my system (OS X 10.9.5), apparently due to some problems with the third-party downloader...which I don't see a reason for even including, given that Steam downloads all 8 GB worth of game content anway. So I haven't been able to run it at all in Steam, but the Windows version runs fine in Wineskin.GOOD:- The game captures a surprising amount of the feel of actually playing D&D. There's DM narration during quests, a lot of the mechanics from the tabletop game are included, and you have to do more than just kill monsters. There are spot checks to find hidden doors, traps to avoid, NPCs to bluff and even some puzzles to solve.- Soloing is supported more than in most MMOs.- Most of the game content is instanced: the only public areas are the towns, and most of the quests take place in instanced areas with a linear narrative. As a result, there are way fewer ""kill 20 zebras"" or ""collect 10 rocks"" quests than you might expect in an MMO. - It's free, so if you hate it, you're not out anything more than the couple hours it takes to download.- There are a TON of options for building a character (three trees per class and multiclassing), although several classes are behind pay walls.BAD:- The graphics and interface are really dated, and the voice acting is pretty bad. - The player base is small.- The downside of the character customization freedom and the jillions of different numbers brought over from the tabletop game is that the mechanics are really complicated. I imagine (I haven't gotten anywhere near endgame) that optimizing a character for raiding would be REALLY hard.- There's a lot of pay-wall stuff that pops up right out of the gate. Want to have more than two characters? Pay up. Want to play a monk? Pay up. Want to res after you die? Pay up.			"

												I like this MMO because of it's leveling and quest system. Hee you don't have just to kill mobs and gain xp, you gain xp only by completing quests. The quest's are like separate adventures: you can't meet any players in a dungeon (quest) if they are not in your party. And there's almost no Pvp in the game (unless you want to battle in gauntlets), so no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s preying on newbies. And offcourse - I like the D&D world (monsters, classes, skills, whole system etc.). The Dungeon Master's narratives in the bacground are truly exciting to hear, feels a little RPG'ish. BTW, the players are really friendly here. You will always get help if and when needed. Reccomend.			"

												My college GPA would have been higher had it not been for this game. It is my favorite MMORPG and I have spent many hours playing it for more than 6 years. It is still great with a good group of friends and I always find myself coming back to it when wondering what to play. You can also play it for free! Yes, buying some turbine points and spending them on adventure packs might get you where you want to be faster, but if you want to do it free, there is definitely a way as you earn points for playing as well. The prices on steam seem to be a bit high though, but the DDO store is forever having sales so that you can get what you want cheaper.			"

												This game use to be fun I played back when this game was new player friendly. you could solo quest on any diffculty if you had dessent gear. but now to even play this game you need to have VIP and pay 300 dollars for turbine points and shards. to even use the auction house. you need shards alone because they now have two forms of money in the game and eveveryone put it now in the shards part. the regualr auction house is empty. you need to be tr like 9 plus times to even play this game now. I would strongly sugguest you play something else or anything else. and not waste your money on a WoW clone. pay to win and to even play half of the game content. This game is pay to win and pay to play really and no not 60 dollars like most games it comes to just to play the game now over 300 dollars.			"

												I played this game at release, quit, played again when they went F2P, quit right before Epic levels were released, and now have started to play again. The game has changed substantially since release, and in its present form is no longer for me. Turbine has made the stats excessively complicated, to the point where the game barely resembles D&D. You thought all you had to worry about was ability points, skills, feats, and equipment. Those, along with buffs, would determine your AC, to-hit and damage, HP, spell DC, etc. Now you need to think about PRR, MRR, % Dodge, Universal Spell Power, Elemental Spell Power, Doublestrike %, whether your bonuses come from enhancement, alchemical, morale, song, profane, psionic, luck, sacred...They have also, on multiple occasions, made build-breaking changes to feats and mechanics in the name of 'balance' in a game where PvP is at best an ancillary feature. The enhancement system has been completely redone at least 3 times, and individual prestige classes continue to be tweaked (or ignored).The game has been on a freefall slide into a grindfest ever since crafting was introduced. Run raid for mats, run to next raid for loot, run to next raid for more loot, repeat on multiple characters, wait for timers to reset and while you are waiting, grind mats from zones and tokens from epic. This is the essence of DDO today. And what is the reward? Aside from playing through all of the content (much of which is quite good if you take the time to enjoy it), nothing. You can reincarnate your character for a small, stacking bonus and play through all of the content again. But good luck finding groups to run with, as most vets by now are well on their way to completionist status, having reincarnated as every playable class. Not to mention that they are (and this is no exaggeration) months ahead of you on gear. With timers it is temporally impossible for you to craft high level weapons and gear in any reasonable amount of time. You can't even claim that its a social experience. PUGs are virtually non-existent and most people are in guilds only for the buffs.To be fair, most of the dungeons in this game are very polished, and new content is generally good. Though there is no open, sandbox world, there is a ton of instanced content and occasionally in-game events that the devs put a lot of work into. If you have a group of friends to run with, or can find a good and active guild, this is STILL a great game. Despite what you may hear in-game, you don't NEED crafted gear to complete most of the content in the game, but you can expect challenges along the way. To me that's more fun than mindless destroying content, but most high level players disagree. And who can blame them? They've been playing the same content for years.			"

You'll need a theif to go off ahead to disable the traps. You'll need a healer and a tank.The community is fantastic!

												If you are someone who enjoyned pen and paper D&D v3.5 then this is the game for you.A couple of suggestions:1. Play with friends or make them in game. Soloing is not easy.2. Become a VIP member (it unlocks almost all of the content).3. The game is exceptionally complex in mechanics, so do a bit of research and be prepared to run quests several times looking for the optimum loot drops.Overall, this game can be a lot of fun and very nostalgic for D&D players. Many dungeons are superbly crafted in story/humor/presentation and are easily one of the strong selling points.			"

My Opinions On DDO:
This game is great for a free game. It is an awesome MMO RPG game that you can play with your friends in a party. If you like Diablo then you will most likely like this game. You are able to find loot from dungeons and you can receive items by completing the quests. Each piece of Armor, Weapon, and Jewelery has special attributes than the others and you can get new and better items as the game progresses to become more powerful. Most quests have a narrator that basically narrates some of the events that are taking place. Most of the dialoge is short and sweat so you don't have to sit for half an hour and listen to what characters are saying. There's a window on the right of the screen that tells you in order of what you have to do for that misssion, so you know what you are doing and where you are going (just like other RPG games). Yes, there are some in app purchases but there's no reason to complain, because in app purchases don't affect the gameplay much at all.

Overall I highley recommend this game to anyone that wants a great free MMO RPG game to play with their friends. "

												In short: I strongly recommend this game WITH 2-4 friends in tow. Otherwise, given the current state of the community, I strongly recommend against it!Note:Some folks are having problems with becoming a subscriber or purchasing in the market. This is a problem with the Steam launcher. To circumvent, you need to go to your Steam folder ...\steamapps\common\Dungeons and Dragons Online\ and run TurbineLauncher.exe.The long version:I had thousands of hours of gameplay prior to acquiring on Steam. I have recently returned to check it out.DDO, iirc, was the first Western mmo to go f2p-microtransactional. With Daybreak Games acquiring publishing rights recently, it's unclear how bad microtransactions will become. The claim is that DBG won't have undue influence, but this could easily be pushed into the P2W zone.That said, DDO remains the ""unique"" mmorpg out there. Nuts-and-bolts it was built with grouping, suspense, problem solving, humor, quirkiness and discovery in mind, rather than grind or plain action. In its prime, it had 4 core group roles, with a nod to a fith: tank, healer, dps, trapper and a lil' bit control. The trapper was essential for finding and disarming invisible traps and unlocking key doors.For newcomers who find a balanced and patient/dungeon-crawl group, the experience is unparalleled. DM narration, complex dungeon/mission mechanics (vs simple boss scripting), puzzles, and slower pacing really do rival your most acute PNP nostalgia.Like all mmorpg's, however, the dev team has allowed this to degrade into solo'able content, or dps biased grouping. But unlike other mmo's, the original experience is still viable and worthwhile!The graphics aren't 'modern,' but they have always had an ineffible charm.			"

												Awesome game. See that large number on the time played above? Yeah that has only been since it got on Steam. Yes the graphics are dated and some of the base D&D mechanics are creaking under the weight of all the add-ons done over the years. Most of the problems with mechanics tend to show up at the upper level ranges (20+) Many of the recent adjustments to classes has taken some of the difficulty edge off of the lower levels as power creep has reared its head. -----------For the absolute best DDO experience:get 3-4-5 friends that have zero experience playing. Have everyone go through the tutorial (it is solo only). Set up a schedule of play time and request that no one plays at all outside of the group time, no spoilers!Dont go read about how best to play the game or the best builds , etc. The exploration and learning on your own when it is all fresh to the whole crew is priceless. Some dungeons have you thinking with your fighter ,barbarian or sorcerer you are the baddest MoFo ever. Next dungeon you are cheering on the rogue who is sneaking around a room full of big, bad Ogres, that would squash him in no time flat if they see him/her, picking up the soul stones(dead PCs) of the entire party to take them back to the shrine to be raised from the dead. ===========================Lots to do as free to play so no need to pull out the CC right away. If you follow the above plan for best experience by time you get to where you feel the 'need' to pay, you will gladly be screaming ""take my money, now!"" -----------------------One word of caution about making characters;Many of the older dungeons have the unfortunate MMO min/maxer design problem. You will run in to somethings that require X Strength score to open or Y skill points to trick an NPC will seem really high. The desiginers couldn't make the stat requirements too low where a balanced character could complete with out making things trivial for the min/maxers.Just keep that in mind when building that maxing or nearly maxing your primary ability scores is suggested and likewise it is better to have a few skills that are maxed rather than a bunch of skills with low investment. ~~~~~~~~			"

												Beauty. Perfection. One of the best games out there.I have been playing off and on since 2008, and got serious around 2011. KMGL and I still play for months, then take a break, then come back for months. Dungeons and Dragons Online is a beautiful game with a dwindling community. I hope that WB comes around with an advertising campaign to help out, or I fear we won’t get enough new players.Started playing again November 2016. Still a beautiful game, community is still more than enough to play. One of the best games out there.If you are looking for a game that will intrigue you, excite you, make you cry, make you laugh, and make you life long friends, DDO is the game for you.I will say that DDO is not completely F2P unless you feel like spending 4k+ hours farming favor.You will probably want to spend $40 during a sale, save it, and spend all of it on the expansion packs/dungeon packs.

Roll your mouse wheel to smoothly transition from first to third person while running, fighting, swimming or casting a spell!Travel accross the D&D multiverse though both beautiful and terrible lanscapes.I have 10 different characters  from low to very high level. They are all fun to play. Having a low level character in this game does not suck.Best magic system, best skills system, best advancement system, great guilds, awesome airships.Guild boosts and airship amenities are relavent and incredibly useful, tons of killer equipment available, tons of skins and cosmetics, quests and adventures are varied and fun.Vastly varied enemines requiring many different strategies, weapons and magic types to defeat, and complete character customization.You can play for free for years with all the free content.VIP access is really worth it. You get a lot if you want to pay, but it's not pay to play or pay to win.The variety of quests is truly impressive, many different types.I have had this game since 2011 and don't launch it through steam often, so the hours played on my account is not even remotely accurate.

												DDO is a mmo co-op dungeon crawler. It uses a hub system with various ""dungeons"" attached. These usually have a set of objectives that needs to be completed, which is hardly ever ""kill 20 monsters"". In this way, the game becomes quite different from most other MMO's. A pro and con, is that the game has almost unlimited character customization possibilities and in my opinion no clear, or dominating, ""meta"" besides potential flavour of the month. I have never been restricted from joining a group for playing an unorthodox build. The character customization can make it complex when starting out, but also fun (or self-torturing) as there are many things to try. Generally DDO has a very friendly community. If you are playing a few hours everyday, then doing your time playing/leveling you will certainly meet the same people more than once.  I am in a love/hate relationship with the controls. At times they feel clunky. But depending on class and playstyle you can easily avoid the otherwise standard ""Tab-Target stand-still spell-cast-time"" combat style of other MMO's. I suggest you don't get too adventurous with your first character, or those controls might give you a ""Morrowind-like"" combat. DDO is largely numbers-based. (But but! It can be fun to make your own custom character, don't be afraid! ;))If you want something premade, then I suggest googling ""DDO build repository"". That post might be gone or old by the time you read this, then you should ask for build advice in the new player section of the forums. As I said, the game has a friendly community. Whatever you do, avoid the pre-set class builds when creating your character. They are old and nobody uses them for good reason.Two questions I usually see on forums: - Are people still playing this game? Yes. The player-base on the servers are quite similar, except Wayfinder. Avoid Wayfinder.- Is the game Pay to Win? Or let me rephrase: Can Free to play get along? Short answer: Yes. Semi-long: New player builds (see repository) can be made to handle themselves, spend earned in-game currency on adventure packs, and consider spending any minimum amount of real life money on the game to make your account status to premium.

												40 hours on Steam + at least 3,000 in its own launcher.The goods:This game has loads of great aspects to it, ranging from group questing to a 'True Reincarnation' mechanic allowing for endless play.The party questing allows for some easier playthroughs of the harder quests in the game at low levels and even when you hit the heroic level cap. Each player gets their own loot from chests which can be switched around and given to others via the chest's item drop-down menu allowing for some Bound to Account/Character items to be traded before they're claimed.The leveling system in this game is real easy to learn but very complex and detailed when you truely understand it allowing for pretty much any combination of classes that don't clash to work. There are thousands of custom player-made builds to try on the forums which give you an edge over a standard build. Being able to combine up to 3 classes will also give you an edge too. Want to play as a caster but still be able to disable traps? No problem! Combine Wizard and Rogue for the easiest of them all.The True Reincarnation mechanic of this game allows for endless play, as once you hit the heroic level cap of 20 you unlock the ability to remake your character with benefits. You gain +4 points for your build from Adventurer to Hero, +2 from Hero to Legend and it caps at 36. Champion characters will only gain a +2 stat boost going into Hero as they already start at 32 points. Each time you True Reincarnate (TR), you gain extra abilities based on your previous life. For example, if you were a Barbarian in your last life, you gain 10 HP. All passive past life feats stack up to 3 times. Also, you can take an 'Active' past life feat which allows for extra boosts ingame such as Barbarian's 'Berserker's fury' past life feat allowing you to use a Rage like ability in which a Barbarian has as a different class.Heroic and Epic levels are a fairly new feature of DDO which has only really come around in the past few years and is still massively developing. Now the level cap has been raised to 28 allowing for more Feats and Stats to be gained, giving an even greater advantage over your enemies in quests. With this came a new item system that has 4 different tiers of loot for Heroic and Epic quests. These items are paired with the difficulty they were looted in, giving boosts greater if the difficulty was too.This is an EXCELLENT F2P game as you NEVER have to buy anything in the game if you decide you don't want to, as you get 'Favor' for completing quests which in turn grants you 'Turbine Points' to spend in the store.The bads:DDO has a lot of flaws in its own right, but none more than your average MMORPG. It's always going to have bugs which the community are always trying to stamp out through the use of the public beta test client, Lamannia.DDO IS a pay2win game. You'll never get to level 28 at the current state of the game unless you get some of the epic-level addon content.Summary:Although there may seem more good points than bad, you'll find a lot more yourself from just playing in both aspects. Each person has their own preference of games and whats in them and I love DDO because it's a group-based game. You'll find it much easier to complete quests and objectives if you team up with 5 other people. DDO is an ever-expanding game which is currently on its 25th major update excluding patches for bugs. I could write an essay that makes A Song of Ice and Fire look small and easy to read on whats great and what sucks about the game, but nobody would want to read it. I'd be surprised if people actually read this far into my review. Anyway, going off on a tangent, the game is amazing if you like to team up with friends to go on an epic adventure through the levels, facing different enemies on the way from slimy, annoying ooze monsters that love to break your weapons to Acid-breathing dragons and much more.I'd give this game a rating of 7.5 out of 10, as it still has a long way to go to be able to catch up with the major MMOs such as Guild Wars 2 and World of Warcraft. On the other hand, it holds its own playstyle I've yet to see in any other MMO of group-based questing from the start.If you do decide to play the game, Cannith is a great server! Thousands of players always willing to help you, all you need to do is ask. Just remember, asking around for help in the starter area won't get you far, you have to venture out into the world.Hope to see you in-game soon! ^_^			"

												This game used to be fun back in Mod 8, Now it is at Mod 9 Update 30.Also, know that I play as a VIP and have all expansions packsYou will need to understand D&D machanics to understand my review (not DDO mechanics)When they added the Mod 9, it was a nice change because of True Reincarnation and you could reach level 20.Of course, the bad part was the free to play. The problem comes with the fact that you do not have access to every content. So with the already small population, it makes teaming harder. (The tool to find a group though is the best).I just started back at Mod 9 Update 29 and played few weeks and got really disapointed. The core mechanics of Dungeon and Dragon are no longer present. There is no longer the rule of 1d20 + attack bonus >= Armor Class. That was a simple rule and easy to understand.Also now, monsters have ridiculours hp. More than 500 hp for normal mobs is not normal at level 14. For a boss once in a while ok, but really, its gotten out of hand. I prefered before when they had a good AC with a lot less hp.There is also the guild airship. They can give you buffs, but now there is just too many that you dont care anymore (30+).Also, even though enhancements (kind of feats) is fun (I used to love it because it adds some customization to the character) it became more powerful than taking a feat. It was really something when you actually take a feat (in most cases you have 7 to choose (for a level 20 char)). You have access to 80 enhancement points and for 1 point, you get 2 AC, etc.2 AC is what you would get with an epic level feat (21+), not a level 1 character.The more they update the game, the more they stray from the real dungeon and dragon.While it still can be a fun game (I did not bother listing the positive and obvious negative such as the outdated graphics), it is shadowed by bad decisions by making it a greedy generic MMO that you would find anywhere.

												Bottom line (at the top): It's ok, I'd recommend it because I enjoy it, but you need to be able to see through the WoW-ification of a decent D&D game.I've got mixed feelings about this game, perhaps that's why I keep coming back to it. Essentially what happens is every 2 or 3 months Turbine releases an update that either completely alters the gameplay experience or breaks 3 or 4 old quests (or both), and they slowly hotfix about 50-75% of it (I've seen a Level 2 quest that's been around since before I started playing being unavailable for an ENTIRE update period!), and then they release a new update. As for gameplay, it's ok as far as D&D-based TPHSMMORPGS's go. Lack of proper support and lousy management decisions aside, the community is good, the fanbase is awesome and there's something to do for every non-epic level (1-20) without having to pay for anything.If you like D&D-based games that have gone off-track a little (think in the direction of WoW), this may be the time sink you need. Otherwise, there's tons of other (more populated) MMO's that might suit your fancy.			"

												I enjoyed this game for 4 years. I loved its combat system, instanced dungeons and social focus.However, the game has taken a turn for the worst. tl;dr Money is basically irrelevant unless you have a lot of it. Difficulty is meaningless. Either you can solo elite or your build isn't viable. Difficulty takes the form of giving the mobs more stats instead of actual meaningful difficulty. Pros:- Fun for groups.- Innovative true reincarnation system.- Multiclassing and build planning is fun.- Still updating.Neutral:- Grindy but not bad. If you know how to do the dungeon, it takes 3-10 minutes to complete it and you normally do it 3/5 times minimum, 10 times maximum.- True reincarnation adds to the grind.Cons:- Might as well be a subscription game. You hit a brick wall at level 14 unless you're spending money. Or grinding for favor.- Very strict definition of what is viable, especially in the newer dungeons and at high level.- It's a dying game. Hard to find groups if you're not at the high levels.- Not recommended unless you have a premade group that plays regularly.- Regularly bugged. Not too intrusive, but not recommended if you don't have patience.- Updates aren't fixing the problem.			"

												I have to say this is my favorite MMO of all time. I have played off and on since 2006. The game is just different from other MMOs. The dungeons and combat have a way of making you feel like you are in the world. Trapped down in a dungeon. At times you will find yourself just barely getting through a dungeon. The best way to enjoy this game in my opinion is to get a small group of friends (2-6). Even if it's just two of you. Only play the game together if possible, and only run dungeons on elite. The joy of experiencing a fresh dungeon with a few friends, and not knowing what is around the corner is much of what this game has to offer. That feeling of getting one shot by a trap is beyond anything I have seen in a MMO. The game suffers from a few balance issues, but it's acceptable given the amount of customization it has to offer. The microtransactions are fair. I would say just get a sub and everything else is pretty unnecessary. It’s always fun to come back  to DDO and run some dungeons with friends.			"

												Incredibly fun, possibly the best RPG to ever exist.  The game is both warm to new players and challenging for those late end gamers.  When you think you've seen and done it all, there's still so much more to do.  Dungeons & Dragons, even a pen and paper variant, will always be the king of RPG's due to it's history and enormous fan base.  I can confidently say this is far better than World of Warcraft but maybe not Elder Scrolls: Online.  Then again, Dungeons & Dragons has more history than both of them put together.  In conclusion, I highly recommend this game to any RPG fan,			"

												Yes this is an old game, but i can tell you it was one of the first with free to play and not this level 10 or 20 then it stops. you can truly play this game for free and unlock it and never pay a dime. Now what makes it worth it. Its not your usual mmo either. no open worlds like Wow, etc. instance based. its character customization is awesome. pure class or multiclass. either one will work. the combos and the crazy ideas you can have. not many other games can offer you that same thing.its graphics have gotten way better as you get into the newer packs and the music is amazing in the newer areas. One thing that sets it apart from any other game. TR system. the ability to start your toon over with its gear, money etc and become something else or same toon with a little more power. no other mmo offers this that i know of. no mounts. so don't look for it here. its more of a pve game. pvp sucks. want that go to another game built for it. what can i say. been a member since October 09. it will be my main game until they close their doors.i forgot the abilities of toons make this game great. the combat is nice as well. you feel great when your toon walks through some of the hardest challenges. when you get to that point. tr and think of new ones and try to do it again.

												I've played allot of MMOs, and this is my favorite by far [I even like it more than my first MMO, which I played for 4+ years and still love]. Not because it's D&D; I don't care about that. DDO has the most complex, demanding, and rewarding game mechanics I've seen - by far. The dungeons are carefully crafted to [on the hardest settings, which you can control completely when subscribed] require intense strategizing: if you screw around for a second, if you don't think your way through every moment, you will fail. But, when you learn the system, and set the difficulty correctly, it's also completely fair.The dungeons provide an extremely wide variety of carefully crafted strategic situations, and regularly surprises you as everything suddenly spirals out of control due to intentionally placed surprises - this, however, becomes a nonexistent factor once you've played through them once [changing trap locations aside]. The intitial dungeons [levels 1-3] aren't a great example of my claims, especially on F2P, since you won't be able to increase the difficulty to the hardest settings without first playing through the easier [normal, hard, elite] settings. But, give it time. The game is also stellar for team-play: every class has dramatic strengths over other classes, which when combined, make your team that much more powerful.Though I personally consider this game to be, mechanically, decades ahead of all other titles, it has many flaws. Though the mechanics are extremely complex and fair [both the character building system, and combat], the game nevertheless has a wide variety of minor yet annoying bugs. Game-breaking? No; if we exclude the atrocious hireling AI. I don't recall ever being deep in a brutal dungeon and losing because of a bug. Nevertheless, you'll just have to get used to issues which have always existed on this old engine. Nothing to be done about it. And while the mechanics function correctly, and are precisely fair, there are a wide variety of issues when it comes to understanding them: there is very little explanation of how many of the mechanics work [even ddowiki, which is your best source of information, has blindspots], so you'll be spending allot of time researching from multiple sources. For example: If you want to multiclass, which opens an extremely wide variety of game-play styles, there's very little information ingame about it - even simply sticking to one class can be a very complicated process. And, ontop of all that, many tooltips for spells and skills are incomplete or blatantly inaccurate.  Another issue to keep in mind is that the game can be a serious money-pit, even when carrying a subscription: there are numerous convenience upgrades which can only be bought with real money. Though many of those upgrades can be earned ingame through simply playing, are available as long as subscribed, and a subscription includes currency which can be spent toward those upgrades.All that aside, when deciding whether or not to commit, keep in mind that I have understated the complexity of the system, and that you will have to learn a great deal if you want to play on the level of difficulty which I love. Also that, to be completely blunt, you will need to play with at least 2 total people - ideally 3 or more, if you want to get the most out of the game. Though you can simply turn down the dungeon difficulty, and use ""hirelings"" for most situations while soloing, there are nevertheless many which demand specific classes and multiple people. There are plenty of player groups [guilds] to join. In total: If you're the hardest-core strategist, if you love extremely tight team-play, this is the absolute best option for you - though remember that you need to carefully calibrate the difficulty settings, and your second playthrough of a dungeon will remove the surprises. Still, it's a flawed masterpeice; you will have to take the bad with the good.To whomever was in charge of building this game's mechanics: I consider myself in your debt, for the joys you've granted me. I appreciate and understand the intense mastery you possess and hope you are given your due.			"

												Of all of the MMOs I've played, Dungeons & Dragons Online is not only the most fun, but the most addicting out of all of them. The difficulty of learning how the game works (menus, hotkeys, rules, etc...) is not too overbearing on first-time players and can be picked up very quickly. Games such as STO (Star Trek Online), while also being a great MMO, have a much steeper learning curve when it comes to the interface, knowing where to go or how to do something is much more difficult and takes a longer time, like many other MMOs. There are some picky things about DDO, and some would agree or disagree, everyone is entitled to how they think MMOs should play. However, DDO doesn't have ""grinding"" or any monotonous quests. Every single one is unique and exciting. A very BALANCED (being that it IS Dungeon & Dragons) party is definitely recommended for later quests in the game. As frustrating as that sounds, I'll counter that with the fact that it is incredibly fun having a defined role in a party (Healer, DPS, Trapper, Tank, etc....) and that not many MMOs (if any at all) have that sort of specific role-placement. If there ARE any, I can guarentee that it's nowhere as refined as DDO. The leveling system IS slow, because you rank up 4 times before actually gaining a level. That being said, it gives you a huge sense of accomplishment when you DO level up, every race and class are so unique that when you level up you feel like you're creating your own unique character that no one has ever done. A huge helper is that the game is FTP, although if you get addicted enough, you WILL end up spending money. I recommend this game, and since it's FTP, there is nothing to lose. I hope this recommendation helps your decision, whoever you may be.			"

												This game has been ailing for years - badly. Underfinanced, understaffed, cycling through dev teams with the speed of light, leaving the game with a current management that neither loves nor understands it.

												In my honest opinion, this is by far the best MMO I have ever had the fortune to experience. Unparalleled dungeoning experience with traps, obstacles, relatively varied landscapes, excellent voice acting and narration, and engaging combat that feels like more than merely target and hit 1, 2, 3. All around the game has a very immersive feel to it. All classes have a use, most of which have a unique/different style of playing. Most dungeons require a team effort, and a varied one at that. Can absolutely play solo, if thats your thing, with the introduction of NPC Helper's (basically you buy a mercenary contract to assist you in dungeons). Rogues can dps, but they mostly act as trap/obstacle disablers and hidden location scouts, and are thus about equally sought after for party composition as a healer would be.			"

												I absolutely love this game, but it a lot more fun with at least one other person of similar time investment.+you can play through 90% of content solo or with one other player.  You can increase the difficulty (and rewards) with additional people.+instances mean no kill stealing or reward hogging,  so much better than open-world click-fests.+omg, the character building.  there's so much fun to be had putting together a character of 10+ races and 12 classes, and you can mix up to 3 classes on each character.  Self-healing combat wizard with trapping ability?  Sure. +traps and secret doors abound.  you'll miss a bit of this if you zerg through (see below), but it's a lot of fun to work through for the first few times per instance.+while content has been recycled rather than created, the character options are coninuing to grow, especially for melees.+you get an incredible amount of game for $9.99 a month.-it's so old and desperate for players that easy mode is a lot of places: guild buffs, hirelings, and some pay-to-win options.-power creep was inevitable, but it can be pretty absurd at times comparing similarly-leveled characters of newer plyers and vets; as a result, most content is sped through at its highest difficulty in pugs, and it can be difficult for newer players to contribute or even keep up.

												Overall, I give this game a thumbs up.  The game has been around a while and has an established community.  There is plenty of content.  As a dungeons and dragons game, it has several races and classes to choose from and at each level you can choose class and skills, similar to the 3rd edition(s) of dungeons and dragons.  I found the gameplay smooth and controls easy to use.  Quests were entertaining and I liked exlporing the city.  The quests are all instanced so you don't have to compete, though you can take a party of adventurers. When my friends weren't available, I found content that I could manage by myself or with one of the game's hirelings (AI helper).  There is some content that you don't get with the free to play - extra races, some dungeon areas, and a few classes - but there is still plenty of content to keep you interested all the way to highest levels.  I do note that PVP was very limited - only in special arenas in the taverns (bar fights).  Graphics are excellent.  As expected in D&D, there are tons of spells, equipment, monster types, etc.  Stealth and lockpicking are included and work well.			"

												It is difficult to decide how to rate DDO. On one hand is it' s downsides; including (but not limited to) expencive VIP sub, limited F2P options (starts really limiting you at level 8) and very slow turbine point gain for F2P players, limiting their ability to  purchace adventures. However, for those willing to pay for all the things that would need paying for, it is a jolly old time indeed. It is, by far, the best MMORPG created this side of Ultima online and Wurm. Seriously, the combat is the best I have ever experienced in any MMO ever. The dungeons are instanced: no more fetch 100 slimes or kill 50 goblins! Quests are all interesting and never a bore. Quests could range from having you go through an onslaught of foes to defeat the final boss to having you destroy crates while being unable to kill a certain type of monster. The game follows the lore of DDO very well. There is a HUGE amount of freedom in character creation. However, the business practices of WB and turbine are... questionable. The DLC packs are expencive, and you will find yourself paying for adventures because the subscription is so expencive. Even then, subscribers don't have all the content. You must still pay for stuff. All in all, I recommend this game ONLY IF  YOU ARE WILLING TO PAY SOMETHING. Buying something with real money unlocks character slots and favor growth (which is used to gain rep with factions and get free stuff like races and classes).			"

												background: I was a Founder for this game 1 week prior to release, name on game landmark. Over the years I have loved and played this game from its inception, however things changed for the worst. Likes: The main draw for me was quests, how it played, and the friendly nature of making new charecters and playing them to a moderate fruition. Then try a different build. Social tavern settings (now faded away) was nice after adventuring. The game was smaller more managable and really spoke to the entire DnD model of creating and playing any kind of charecter you wanted in a game enviroment for all ages and what build next excitment. Over the years the way quests were delivered or updated in old areas of town worked well and made breaks from the game a pleasent suprise without it being a daunting task of catch up.Dislikes/destroyed the game:More updates/modules were great but there comes a point when any game reaches too much content and too excessive for its own good. Sadly, DDO reached that some time ago. There now is too much content making it impossible to get steady groups anymore or enjoy the content that worked and made it what it was. Now its a zerg fest to get past all the old content and spend hours soloing and/or farming  for what exactly? midgame and endgame changed.... all that endgame farming, which is why this games great gouping is now a shallow hole of failure. Ingame market? uh,  lets not go there...... That whole ""free to play"" model saved this game a time ago,I am saddened at the state the game is now but watching the games progression over the years is nice. It all comes down to money, free to play saved DDO but the desire to ""sell it"" and pump it full of bloated content severly impacted the game(example auction house and currency). Endgame content is good and there were good additions but you loose some things, steady grps ALL the time for everything and the comfortable DnD atmosphere where groups or people congregated in-game, changing these things alienate and deminish its original art upon release. Now its barren grouping, over content thinning out what the game was. Excessive content and change after change is killing modern gaming, imo. You wouldnt ask ""Picaso"" to rework his masterpieces over and over, why do video game artforms have to be changed and molded until there is nothing but a shell of former glory. Theres something to be said about going out on your best leg.			"

												Verdict: RECOMMENDEDBefore we get into this review, I have at least over 3000+ hours on this game, I have been playing it for 7 years I don't use the Steam version often. Oh and hey to anyone who knows Gonnakillu, Scottyj and my 17 other toons from Argonneson (add me if you do <3)The actual combat system is definitely one of the best I have used in MMO's I have played my fair share of MMO's and in my opinion the combat system/engine in this game tops all of them, for a game that was released in 2006 (I think) it has a really advanced combat system and I would call it advanced for games today.To actually have fun with this game you do not even have to have friends playing with you as there is a great group engine which allows everyone around the world to be connected together and play with eachother, you can mark yourself as LFG (Looking For Group). The game is also fun while soloing through quests but you can also have support from hirelings, which is an friendly AI which you purchase to hire for an hour (time doesn't go on whilst not in quests/wildernesses). Speaking of the AI's, although they are sterotyped to be stupid as a pinecone they are actually very useful to have at times and they're very well developed.For classes/races there are so many options to pick, I think there are a total of 14 classes, but that can change at anytime because Turbine are always updating the game with new classes/races, I also think there is a total of 14 races now that they've added in Gnomes, unforunately I haven't been on to see this yet. The race you pick can also effect your class stability and changes your stats such as Charisma, Wisdom, Strength, for example a Halfling will have decreased Strength and a Drow will have decreased Intelligence, this is also a very good system that stops very over powered builds coming in game.The servers itself are very good, I do not ever experience lag, whenever I do it is on my end, there are not many maintenances that occur.The game is F2P but after a certain level lets say, 12 it is very hard to progress without some adventure packs and you will find yourself grinding the same quest a lot, VIP is quite cheap for a monthly subscription, but you can also just buy the adventure packs individually and in your own time. If you are P2P'ing you will have a better time with the game as you will not have to ransack every F2P quest out there as a lot of adventure packs are added frequently that you will have access to once released (as a VIP) You can also either the races/classes or get them for free with VIP, but you can also earn the in-game without implementing a single penny into the game via favor which you earn with every quest you complete, the amount of favor points you get is increased if you do the quest on a higher difficulty (please note there is a lot of F2P classes/races but there is a lot of P2P classes/races as well).This game can also be used to make a lot of friends which could lead you into a high level guild which makes the whole experience a lot better and more fun. Your guild you have joined or created can also get an airship, you may unlock the first airship at level 20 (guild level) I believe and you will start to unlock better airships gradually when you increase your guild level, these airships can be brought by in game currency (platinum, gold, silver, cooper etc) or Turbine Points. These airships aren't just there for design though, they are able to have buffs on then which increase your stats which are very useful especially when going on high level raids.The PvP feature is outstanding, I guilty enough, have spent most of my hours in the PvP areas which are normally located in taverns, the most populated one being the Wayward Lobster in Harbor. Although in my server it isn't as populated as it used to be once be (the good ol' days :'( ) it is still a fun feature which you can mess around with friends with, there are also game modes such as capture the flag and all of that shenanigans but I am not sure if it is working shape as I haven't heard of it for a while.The character creation is an extraodinary engine, it has many options to pick with which can be used ot make a already built build (highly recommended for new players) or a custom build which you can decide where your points go and what spells you decide on. You can even choose your own aliginment (not sure if spelt right) In the past couple of years they've implemented a lot of good features such as new skill trees, epic feats, epic destinies etc and this has changed the game a lot as there is so much more to do. This game, in my opinion, has the best charactor creation engine out there.If you decide to buy VIP right off the hook make sure you DO NOT start an iconic character straight away as this will take you to level 15 and as a newbie you will be absolutely crushed in quests (that is if you know how to get to quests by that point) make sure you try one of the beginner classes and start off slow and get the drift of the game first, get a character to level 1-15 instead of skipping the levels.An outstanding feature is True Reincarnation which can be used at level 20 to set you back to level 1 but it will be like you are creating a whole new character as you can pick a whole new race and class but it will be a lot more stronger, powerful and it will give you a lot more options, if you true reincarnate again you will be stronger and more powerful than your 2nd life, after your 3rd life you will have one more boost your points you can add onto your stats etc until it will stay the same and if you do one life on every class you will get a feat that will stick onto you forever called ""Completionist"" this drasticlly improves your stats etc,  although this will take a lot years to do, I know a few people myself who has done it, I myself have a family member who has done it.The community in the game is great, but they're also some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on there, but hey this is the Internet it is a normal occurance, most of the community are completely chilled and good people and are willing to be your friend have group with you to complete quests together and the community 9/10 helps you out, hey, I had someone give me 100k plat to my brother who was starting out at the time.I will probably add more to this tomorrowOh and Turbine, update your steam homepage and use it more and fix the purchases on steam, anyone who thinks they are going to purchase in game do not download on steam as it is broken, download here https://signup.ddo.com/ddo.php?ftui=DDOBlackDragon&abrs=100_1457230160 "

												This game has 1 major flaw; it's really gosh darn hard to get into, I really cannot remember how I managed to trawl through the uninteresting mess that are the low levels and starter zone, but I certainly do not regret it; this game is so amazingly unique and I love it <3Now this game is technically an MMORPG, and MMORPGs have a great level of stigmatism, mostly caused by great numbers of Korean WoW-clone grind fest chatboxes. DDO isn't like that, DDO is focused on the 'game' part; character building (my personal favourite part, just like real DnD) and play-style are very important, so if you want an MMO with unique and interesting gameplay, give DDO a try.However, this gameplay focus came at a remarkable cost; the social aspect, every quest is an instance, which while making them unique, means you can't just party up with people half-way and make friends easy; you have to make groups beforehand and go into the dungeon together. Of course the Devs don't expect us to do that all by ourselves, so there is a ""Grouping"" menu, where people can put out server-wide messages to find people to quest with; and it works well enough. But- the DDO community has gained a very... ""elitist"" edge to it over time, and try as I might, I am not exempt to this rule; many in-game factors make it hard not to become rather ""elitist"", per se, over time. Many people are interested only in speed running dungeons for optimal xp, and have little-to-no-interest in making friends. This can make things very hard for newer players, who want to take it slow, learn the rather complex mechanics, and make some friends.All in all, I love DDO and would love to see it thrive, but until the Devs overhaul the starter area, early levels and social aspect, (I say this, I have no idea what they could do to spice them up though :/), I can only really recommed DDO to groups - at least 2 people (max party size is 6) - who are looking for a group based, challenging PvE RPG that rewards effort and planning.

												Alright, my history with this game is rather dubious. For the last few years now, since around 2010, this game has been on my Steam account collecting dust, and is the standard nostalgic game that you have on the shelf that you haven't played in years. So you walk into your bedroom, bored out of your mind, and you ask yourself what you're going to do to pass the time; that's when you see this game sitting on the shelf. You're wide-eyed, surprised to see it, and instantly grab the dusty game case and look at it with nostalgic visions of how much fun you had with it. However, about six hours of gameplay and perhaps a few days off and on with the game, you begin to realize why it was collecting dust on your shelf, and you kind of want to put it back where it was.Dungeons & Dragons Online is an amazing FTPMMO, don't get me wrong, but it's flawed; oh boy is it flawed. As a massive Dungeons & Dragons fan/player, I jumped onboard when I found out about this game and signed up and started playing, only to find true horrors to await for me. Combat is all over the place with various degrees of difficulty for more hauls of loot and experience for your character, the quests themselves are simple fetch-quests or the standard ""kick in the door"" style of game in which you saunter over to an Orc's cozy cottage, kick in its door and then brutally slaughter it and its family. There isn't really a whole level of role-playing IN the game, it's a hack and slash MMO and the players are forced to role-play with their friends to gain a better experience.Now the two grated problems with this game, wait, THREE problems are as followed: Character Creation, Character Development, and Character Interaction. Right out of the gate as a player, you're instantly penalized in the character creator with having incredibly low stats and penalizing you if you're not a paying member for Turbine. With that, you're tossed out onto the sandy beaches of Korthos Island with a poor chance of holding your own against the enemies that await you in the Hard and Elite difficulties, unless you min/max your character mainly into a Cleric, Fighter, Paladin, or Monk (which is a member class). Character development is also lacking greatly in this game, due to its constraints as a video game, let alone an MMO. In the actual pen and paper version of the game, your character has an immense amount of space to develop into whatever version of the class you choose to be. Want to be a wizard that specializes in certain spells and feats to optimize said spells? Can't do that in DDO. Want to become a minion summoning spellcaster that can command a multitude of summoned creatures to defend you and do as you will? Can't do that in DDO. You're given three to four skill trees, depending on your character's class, and race, which you put Action Points (AP) into to gain a variety of bonus abilities and traits to aid you within the game. However, while this on paper or in my review may sound like an amazing concept, in practice, the abilities are very subpar and don't really mesh well with the game. On several occasions, the special attacks or perks just seemed lackluster and a waste of my Action Points, and at times, I even questioned if they were better than basic attacks.Character interaction may be the biggest glaring obstacle in this game for me. Guilds, adventuring parties, and raid groups are the main defacto groups for players to interact with each other, and are the vanilla concept for any MMORPG. I get it, MMO's nowadays need to catch up to World of Warcraft's template and show that they're hip and cool, but when it comes to Dungeons & Dragons, the grandaddy of the entire role-playing game genre, you should show some more respect. Every player is required to join a party to do several questlines, even if they have started the first three quests and are on the final homestretch of the adventure, as well as being incredibly handicapped when it comes to not being in a guild with people they do not know. The way the game ropes players in to joining said guilds are with benefits such as cheaper healing prices, and low-level gear is now cheaper, however, the only way to obtain such perks is to spam other players invitations to those guilds. You see, the way guilds progress in the game, is by member count; the higher the count, the more perks unlocked. This means that a player exiting the boat from the tutorial region, is almost assailed by fledgling guilds and end-game guilds who want that finally person in their roster to get the perk they've been dying to obtain and that is just wrong. For the last 180 hours clocked in over four years, the only time I actually discussed anything in the chat with other people, were the few friends I had who enjoyed or were anxious to join me on Dungeons & Dragons Online and those times were few and far between. All in all, and with a heavy and decisive ""no"", I've got to give this game a 4.5/5 out of 10.			"

												Would be nice to see this with a graphics overhaul and more available classes instead of paying for content. I'm honestly more likely to pay for a game and play it free, than pay for content on what should be free to play; when in truth it is not. Free to play games that offer vanity items such as costumes, special mounts, pets, or even items that just make things easier with leveling as well as special gear items that require purchase, but aren't necessary; I'd be more likely to spend money on.

												By far the best blending of D&D 3.5 rules with an MMO feel.  While it may take some getting used to, once you grasp the basics, it'll click quite nicely.This is set in the Eberron world for the most part, not the Forgotten Realms of major fame but don't let that stop you.  The Eberron setting is unique and a lot of fun.There are several classes available for you to select right from the start, and your four ""basic"" D&D races, Humans, Dwarves, Elves and Halflings.  And while each race does have a certain feel and flavor about them, as with proper D&D, you are free to combine whatever class you can with whatever race you can.That said, there are some classes and races that can only be unlocked via Cash Shop.  Or you can get a subscription.  Due note, not all classes are unlocked with a subscription, and they are unlocked only for the subscription.  Best to just buy them outright.Yes, there's a lot of slow going for this game, you don't just rush to the end.  But when you do get there, you can ""reset"" your character, causing them to be revived at low level, but with an extra stat points on your build, which lets you make an even more powerful character.If you're looking for a D&D game that'll get you hip-deep in the mechancis of it, this is the game for you.  If you're looking for something more MMO and modern, look into Neverwinter, which is based on the 4th edition rules.			"

												Many a long night has been spent in a dark basement, rolling the forbidden polyhedral die and casting spells that no one in the mortal world could even dream of. Harsh landscapes have been traversed and deep dungeons have been explored by those dreamed of living in another world and embarking on untold of adventure. Those were the days when such basement meetings were widely frowned upon, and those who partook in the art of Dungeons and Dragons were widely shunned or treated as pariahs. Does anyone remember the great Tom Hanks scare? What about the ridiculous ‘Dark Dungeons’ Chick tract that led many to believe D&D was nothing more than a tool of the devil?Those days have long passed and the mystery of Dungeons and Dragons has passed into legend. These days tabletop gamers meet in the open, exploring dungeons with friends and strangers alike. Lately, however(as of the last fifteen years), the RPG genre has moved online, and as a result, the game has changed entirely. You can only imagine the happiness and joy expressed by old school gamers when Dungeons and Dragons Online was released in February of 2006, even with a subscription fee. Now that the game has gone free to play, players around the world have been given the opportunity to experience Eberron in all its tinkered glory.			"

												I won't sugar-coat this.This game is dated as all hell, and it shows mostly in the graphics department. Beyond this little bit, the game is VERY fun, can be incredibly challenging (scaling difficulty), and is in my top 5 favorite games of all time.It's based around 3.5 rules in terms of character creation, but apart from only being able to multiclass into 3 total classes, the character levelling process is staggeringly varied, and the best part is that most builds will work to some degree, whether it be a niche setup, a full out min-maxed badass, or some fun little generalist you enjoy tinkering around with. You might not be clearing Epic Elite Reaper 5 difficulty quests on everything, but there's many settigns you can try, as well as solo/group support on every quest and dungeon.If you've got some spare time and are looking for something MMO-based, but still want the ability to explore on your own, give this game a shot. It's free to start, and you can unlock most game content withuot spending a penny. Some things are gated by Micro-Transactions, but they aren't required to enjoy the game, and merely add more options and more flavor to an already packed game.			"

												7/10 - putting the 'Dungeon' back into D&DIf there is a single old school MMO left that has no auto-heal, unlimited spell use and macroing combat....then its Dungeons & Dragons online.The difficulty level has been significantly lowered since the original release but it's still a challenge to solo and grouping is something taken serious. The learning curve is a bit steep and leveling is a crawl compared to the current centuries MMOs but that's what makes it so D&D.The best feature are how traps are implemented in the dungeons, DDO is the only MMO out there where playing a thief actually has the same feeling as in the classic P&P game. If you don't try out a thief you'll definitely miss something.The graphics are are a bit meh, the UI is *antique* and Stormreach looks more like carnival than high fantasy but at least the dungeons and the player equipment are candy-colour free. That female character models get along without high heels and cleavage also makes the game stand apart from the pack of MMO grinders out there.			"

												Obviously the game is not for everyone, but I mainly want to say the mixed reviews represent half the people hating it and the other half loving it to the death.  DDO isn't the newest or most visually flashy game out there (not that it's bad visually, it's great, but just not the latest, greatest graphics) - and yet, there are still people who avidly play this game ten years plus and still going.Personally, I'm an orginal D&D player from back when the game was printed on freakin' pamphlets and handed out to college students - before even the red box og's refer to.  I've also tried every damn D&D online game in existence.  I find most of them either feel like I'm playing some kind of anime manga thing . . . or they're very cartoonish and feature click bar buttons that launch complex attack combos that can be chained together . . .  or they feel like Diablo.  Those are all great in their own way - but they're not Dungeons and Dragons as I know it.  Hell, Neverwinter Online, which also bears the D&D trademark is not Dungeons and Dragons as I know it.DDO is the closest thing I've found to playing a video game version of Dungeons and Dragons.  In fact, the list of things that are different from pen and paper D&D would be far shorter than the huge list of things that are exactly spot on.It just feels right.  If you want to jump and attack with your sworrd, you push a button to jump, and another to attack.  If you want to turn while doing that, then you're gonna need to push a button to turn, as well.  The combat is what they'd call in a space game ""twitchy.""  The only clickies on your toolbar are gonna be spells and special abilities - and there are plenty of those and that's fun.  I've read that DDO features ""the most immersive combat online,"" and that's really how it feels.  You feel like YOU are there, fighting some ♥♥♥♥ing kobolds or whatever.  I remember back when I first started playing and I fell down in the kobold prison in the Waterworks with my 2nd level wizard.  I literally had a freakin' panic attack because it truly felt like the end of the world - a very terrible situation.  Somehow I fought my way out of there, and it's like I actually survived something.  I actually got sick from anxiety - which was great. My wife and I spent 11 hours in the Proof in the Poison quest one night.  Another, both our characters were in their skivvies buidling a freakin' human chain in the pitch dark to try and cross a pit of spears - in Rainbow in the Dark . . .Which is to say, some of these quests we actually recall as if they were REAL trials overcome.  They're in our real book of memories, so to speak.  I can't think of another game that's had the impact on me.In terms of expansiveness, not only is the world of DDO huge, it's so big now you don't even have to explore it all to advance all the way to the upper ranks.  And not only that, but movement in the world never feels ""fake.""  If you get to the end of the Halls of Shan-to-Kor or you reach the Burning City in the Sands of Menechtarun, you feel like you have done some hiking, by god - and you're likely terrified some Drow rangers may still be following you.I don't know . . .  It's not perfect.  There's some newer ♥♥♥♥ I find cheesy, but even as I criticize DDO I still think it's the best.  The complaints I see about it . . . well, those aren't things I'd complain much about.  Being censored for hate speech?  Sheez, yeah.  Good riddance, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.    P2W?  Yeah, I guess I can see that - but the F2P stuff is extensive and by the time I ever decided to pay a penny I was well and truly immersed in the game and I felt the enjoyment I had was well worth every penny.  Turbine are incompetent?  Yeah, okay, but then again I've had to deal with Turbine maybe three times in, like, seven years.  The game runs pretty damn well.Overall, it's hard to describe what is different about this game.  If you've tried all kinds of D&D or fantasy MMO's, and you've come to the end of the line with them all, then don't give up on the genre without trying DDO.  The game is full of a lot of players who have come back to it again and again, as I have.  Its following is loyal, and they're the same folks who are purists regarding Dungeons and Dragons proper.  Fans of 3.5 I should say.Hell, I'm just praying for DDO2 - and hoping the make it exactly the same as this one, except with cloaks and horses.  No ♥♥♥♥.			"

												DDO (Dungeons and Dragons Online), is a wonderful game in my opinion. Pros:Lots of abilities and choices, even within the normally confining spectrum of only 11 classesHack and slash setting makes it very active and funVery party and friend compatibleFree to play!!!!-  WHO DOESN'T LOVE FREE?!Cons:Very complex- you have to really understand how the pen and paper game works to do very well in this game (at least until you get the hang of it)11 Classes- I had to say it, but mostly because I'm a huge fan of the psionic classes and many of the prestige classes available in pen and paperMany items are costly, such as some of the better classes, although, you can work up to them with a lot of dedication "

												Is great fun and will give you lots of playtime, unfortunately not 100% solo friendly once you get a bit further, especially for spell casters, but can still be managed in quite a few areas. I definitely recommend getting some friends that also haven't played to just join you and you all go in blind and just learn the game through experience. It's much funner that way. At first with character creation if you're not feeling confident or don't know some D&D mechanics you can just click a melee one and pick the presets. (Where it offers 3 different choices or 'customize' at the bottom) If you're feeling confident or you're a couple characters in you can really start to get into the character creation, selecting feats and skills.Once you're a fair way in you may be inclined to pay, buying a couple dungeons to keep forever is the best way to go not buying VIP or anything like that.Overall, very, very fun with a little bit of patience and some friends who are also at least relatively new.

												If you're a D&D fan you will appreciate this game. My only real complaints are: there are no achivievents to unlock for steam, I had to buy my favorite class(I'm weird), and some quests require a party; otherwise it's worth a play. Especially if you enjoy fantasy, parties, and character building.What do you have to lose? It's free to play with the option to buy perks, more quest options, and extra classes/races.			"

												DDO is an amazing game with a unique playing style, tired of sitting in the back of your seat and clicking enemies all day long with your mouse? then this is one of the games thats made for you. DDO requires the player's full attention, to traps, enemies, and objectives/time limits. The Patron/Favor system balances the F2P and P2P and with TP u can buy adventure packs, which will open up very nice quests/areas to you. DDO also has a unique class system, want to be a tanky spellcaster? build a Fighter/Wizard class for example. everytime you got enough xp to level up, you can choose to level up in your class, but you are able to place those levels in other classes, be aware that this can have negative results on your enhancementsOf course every game has its Pros and Cons, and for DDO its really visible what its Cons are. its graphics are outdated, alot. compared to the modern graphics in games DDO is pretty much on the Atari level, it makes up for it with its content tho.

												(Only recently installed through Steam, I have at least a few thousand hours logging in directly through the client and several characters at level cap).The core game is very good, but the actual experience is plagued with bugs, performance issues and questionable management. Play for free for a while, then decide if you want to commit.- Gameplay: Positional, third person action RPG based on D&D rules. All the main classes and races are here, and they play as you would expect from the pen and paper (but obviously with different skills and powers due to the different natures of the games). Gameplay is fast, rewards correct positioning and physically dodging attacks and spells is not only viable, but often required. It's more than just amassing big number, even though that's obviously the main goal and the measure of progression.- Customization: The main strenght of the game. You can mix and match up to three classes on each character, and (almost) each class has 3 skill trees to pick from. No other restricions apply. You can melee with a mage, throw shurikens with a paladin or wield greathammers with a gnome warlock. Tons of loot, (frankly too many) crafting systems and special, named items from various quests. Many cosmetic choices for armor and helmets, not so much for the rest of the equipment.- Longevity: Over 400 quests (see Business Model below) and a couple dozen raids, which means you can play hundreds of hours to fully explore all content. Quality of course will vary: some revamped classic modules are really good (Haunted Halls of Eveningstar), while many older quests are a bit bland, grey and uninteresting. The main trick however is reincarnation: get to level cap and start again from scratch, with small incremental benefits and the ability to completely reshape the character (including race, class, skills, appearance). The game is based around the concept of performing several reincarnation, growing progressively in power as those boni stacks and you ammass a larger stash of equipment.- Business model: The premium currency can be earned ingame, so in theory you could experience the entirety of the game for free. That's one of the fairest business models I've encountered, as far as content goes. Turbine, however, is pretty obviously warping a few mechanics around the shop, sadly: a few crafting systems (including some raid rewards) can be bypassed with cash, and the difference is noticeable. I'm ok with convenience and cosmetics (bank space, character slots, cosmetic items, xp boosts), not so much with buying raw power, raw xp and in general progressing without running the content.- The bad: The game is 10 years old and it shows. It's not graphically impressive, animations are generally bad and you can count polygons on most environments. It's also obviously built on spaghetti code, and every update something completely unrelated breaks and is even fixed way too late, fixed partially or left there. I've experienced crippling lag. I've died for no reason while walking. I've had the game eat my ingredients without rewarding me. I've heard of people losing items while banking them. You need to learn all the quirks of the game and play around them (as in ""kill this now or we'll lag out and fail"", or ""don't use the bank in this area"").My suggestion is to roll a couple of characters, experience the free content as long as one can, buy a couple of adventure packs with the ingame currency earned and by that time you will realize if you want to keep playing. It's a shame a good game is plagued by technical issues and questionable design choices, but what is unacceptable for someone who's been playing for 6 years may be unnoticable to a new player. There is no risk in trying it out.			"

												OK what u need to know, Tips , THEN (END IS PERSONAL)1) There are many classes to choose from you WILL find somethin you like .2) You DO NOT have to pay this gameis not Pay to win , u can grind (hard work in the game) to get anythng you want .3) This is one of the most RPG type of game you will ever see, not your adventurers look BUT the classes, it is endless.4) Its not a game where u start off with the things you need to be REALY good at the game, you have to get the GEAR (*stuff*) u want by your self, it will take time to acomplish what you want BUT it will be worth it TRUST me 5) The character aperance creation is not very big,6) There are quite a few races MOST free but as i said if u want somethin GRIND for it 7)  It can be really basic and easy or hard and complicated depending on how YOU MADE your adventurer . 8) DDO is unique aside to other games, im almost 100% sure u have not played a MMO/MMORPG like this .Tips:1) Do not Choose a PATH at the customisation Go a forum/wiki ETC and decide what you want to play as and what role you want to be and stuff like that,what wepeons u will focus on and all that, so decide then google then make it hapen2) Dont let selfish people pi*s you off , they will be nice people and Aholes , Trust me i know (dont rage quit)3) When you enter a group (in DDO called partys) say im new , for they know your not a noob just a newbie4) If u need help while in the game type /a {then type wha u want to ask the gamers} 5) DONT TAKE EVERYONES ADVICE take parts of it from diferent people , some are TROLERS , i know this because i was asking by typing /a many times and if u take one persons advice they might be wrong ONLY u can piece toogether what u want , make every answer a piece to your puzzle6) If u see little wings next to a persons name it means they are a TR = true reincarnated, they know what there doing because they have been around a quite a bit... (MOST OF THEM) 7) PLAY YOUR PART be a group if your in a party , why did u join a GROUP if you arent guna play as a GROUP?8) Press O to bring up the group panel BUT (***BYOH*** MEANS BRING YOUR OWN HEALS) basickly dont die , bring potions if you are a character that canot heal always have potions for yourself9) Dont be stuck in PVP, to be good there u have to get your gear and make your character a PVP PWNER 10) ENJOY IT!!!!DDO was the first online game i ever played, I started as soon as it became F2P , i remember the days we were scared to do miserys peak on HARD (*thats the end quest of inro*) now we solo ELITE without blinking, i must have spent £200  on the game in the past 4-5 years about? The only game i ever spent money on BECAUSE it was the only game WORTH spending money on in my eyes.. But when these changes of the skill trees and all that i left, but not because of that but because of the popularity was crushed , i didint play for like 8 mounths, came back and here i am again playing the best MMO(RPG) to ever be shown to gamers but as i explained above for many reasons. I always believed that the First impresion of what u play on no matter what it is will stick with you forever,For me that was DDO , So if u know a newbie gamer who wants to become a GAME DESTROYER then make it a good ... Some of the BEST times of my life are in this game.. And i want to thank Turbine for that.. 100/10 rating for me			"

												This is a fairly fun game and I'd suggest giving it a decent try. It does attempt to cover various groups. Can solo most quests. But if can run with one or more friends, that would be more fun. Or make friends within a guild. Even running with random people (PUG) is usually good if choose carefully.Public areas permit a large number of people (note, not PVP). However the number of people that can enter a specific quest or adventure area is 6 and with raids 12 (special events may have more). That number does include hirelings (and also the not-great owlbear from Shadowfell collectors edition) but excludes summons, companions, pets.There are currently about 100 free quests and about 250 quests that are paid (by quest pack or by expansion). There are quite a bit more free quests below level 10 than above level 10. There are also almost 20 raids and around 30 adventure areas and maybe 10 challenges. And some PVP areas that are ignored by almost everyone.Do need to get packs and expansions? I would say that if enjoy the game then consider doing so. Yes can earn turbine points to buy the packs, but for many that isn't a great use of their time. Note purchase of a pack is for all characters for all servers forever. Or go VIP and have access to all packs. However VIP memberships do NOT include expansions.One note on VIP is that it can open up hard and elite difficulty. I find hard difficulty is a great choice for many newer players (and still a very good choice for more experienced non-expert players at higher levels). Note other account types can also open a quest on other difficulties either by completing on a lower difficulty or by a cheap store item (or in the same party with someone that can access the higher difficulties).Everyone have their own favorite packs. Gianthold pack is argueably the most recommended pack as it has lots of quests at both heroic (13-14) and elite (23-25) levels. Can search for recommend packs. But keep in mind of your play style, the usefulness of the pack and how much you might enjoy the pack. For example, I like bright cheerful explorer areas so picked up the Three barrel cove pack - a pack that is often not recommended.The catacombs starter pack isn't too bad. The quests are somewhat interesting (opinions vary of course). As this is a purchase, will automatically bring account to premium status. Note the permenant gold seal hireling is only one per account per server so if don't have shared bank (included with VIP and a recommended option for other account types), so make sure you login to the correct character after you enable that pack. That hireling is useful for those soloing to give you an extra hand to deal with some quests mechanics, and especially with a character that uses spell points as the hireling can restore some spell points back to you. Note must be level 3 minimum to summon that hireling. For a VIP, less benefit. Note can always buy non-permenant gold seal hirelings from the ddo store.Expansions? Menace of underdark is recommended once reach level 16+. If it includes the Attack on Stormreach pack then would be useful earlier (level 13 pack). By level 20, it is highly suggested. (note max level is currently 28, will reach 30 by end of 2014 and unlikely to ever increase beyond that).Shadowfell expansion - I got it, not thrilled. But as the number of quests at epic levels 26 to 28 is quite low (but growing) so for now could be useful.Combat is very dynamic, or can be. Can always just stand in front of some monster and whack away. If can kill very quickly or have enough healing or high defense and especially at lower difficulties (casual/normal) and on stupider creatures that can work. But combat often is not like that as can move around, use terrain, dodge attacks and use various tactics. Notice what an opponent is doing / about to do and react to that. e.g. hard to shoot someone with arrows or with a ray spell if the target keeps moving or runs behind a pillar.Grouping - this game permits characters to reincarnate back to level 1 multiple times. These characters are called TRs. Other people may like to run many different types of charcters (alts). So this means that in a random group you might have one or more that is familiar with the quests and what lies within (note if repeat a quest will notice that does do not vary too much, although difficulty selected will have a significant impact). And they are often equiped somewhat better to way better than a newer character. Although noticeable at low levels, it is very noticable around level 12 for greensteel equiped TRs. These people often just want to complete the quest efficently/quickly (usually on elite) and as they already know the quest, they don't need to investigate or explore. This can give a false impression that a quest is easy and dramatically decrease how long it takes to do the quest (e.g. a few minutes instead of 30+ minutes for a group that isn't familar with the quest). Groups are usually labelled as Elite BB, Zerg or BYOH or similar. Suggest if don't want that type of group to post one yourself saying no zerg or not a speed run or similar.Graphics, primarly on the older quests can be dated. But it does work fairly well with low end graphic cards. There is also higher quality graphics mostly in forgotten realms that can take full advantage of a high end graphics card. Some people say they prefer the graphics style in DDO over many other mmos, so whatever. Some of the images on the DDO steam page looks like images from a few years ago and is currently is significantly better.Other notes: When starting the game, you are immediately in a quest. The whole island has several quests. However keep in mind these are fairly simple quests to show some of the facets of the game. And no, a rogue/artificer is not necessary to do any of the quests (there are a few optional chests and some traps that can be timed). Hiring the level 1 cleric hireling is recommened (costs a few coins). And if your character can cast spells, strongly suggest to take the Archivist's Necklace for the Misery's peak reward. Enjoy the journey, don't race to get to the end, many of the most popular quests are at many different levels. And especially true as the end game is being revamped with the level cap increase to 28 a few months ago and then finally to 30 at the end of this year.Races. The base races are good.For premium races, Warforge is very popular for wizard and sorcerer (and artificer) due to strong self heal capabilities.Purchase of drow is not suggested as it is easy to earn access to the drow in game (only 400 favor to unlock drow for the server).Half orc and half elf, are not too popular as the free human race is usually a better choice. Note half-elf is the ugliest race. Gnomes are not yet available.Iconics start a character at level 15. Although not too bad for TRs and alts, for most new players I would not suggest starting with an iconic. Some iconics may be included in some versions of the shadowfell expansion.Classes: The base classes are also good. (although paladin and especially bard are often viewed as weaker choices)For premium classes, Artificer is a considered as a fairly strong choice. It can be gained with favor (not easily...). However for me the repeating crossbow sound was so annoying that switched to different combat style...Monk is considered as a strong choice for, especially if like active combat style with lots of buttons and manoeuvring around. Also popular for multiclassing with 2 (or more) levels of monk such as with fighter, cleric, artificer, wizard, etc.Favored Soul use to be quite popular, now not so much... maybe when 3rd prestige is available it will be popular again.Druid is okayish. Some can get it to work quite well, for me... meh. Might be included if get some versions of the Menance of the underdark expansion.Done.			"

												DD is literally the best game i have played. From the action combat to the traps in dungeons its awesome. Another plus is that almost any pc can run it decently. Theres quite a few classes (16 if i remember right) that you can chose from which fall into 4 main categories. you have stealth range warrior and mage essentially. It is however very instanced but the load time isnt to bad even for low spec pcs. Each weapon is strong agenst specific enemys such as blades being ineffective agenst skeletons but maces are and vice versa for undead. If your looking for a game thats fun to quest grind and etc in this is the game for you. It gets even more fun when you get a whole guild in an area. It makes you feel very powerfull. There are plenty of toutorials to help you through the game so i would highly suggest at least trying it. If its not for you then whatever you just had a bit of fun and passed some time!			"

Yes there are puzzles, traps, skills, abilities and other stuff which require ur inteligence to work a bit.  If you are familiar with classic tabletop adventures of Forgotten Realms or you've play classsic CPRG like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, Temple of Elemental Evil and so on, you will be OK with this title... even more you'll swim at your own waters!

												Okay, so I'll be the first to admit that this is not the MMO for everyone. It is rather dated, has a few issues once in a while, and lacks some of the quality of life features of some newer MMO's. However, it is a character builder's dream, with the ability to endlessly tinker with various builds and classes and the freedom to build your character however you want, with stats, skills, and feats freely allocated allowing for clever and unique builds for those who want to try something new and impressive optimization for power gamers. The community is by and large decent, and while there are probably a few bad apples, I haven't had any terrible experiences. The game is both solo and party friendly, and the more recalcitrant solo players can bring along hirelings, AI companions, to help out if the going gets tough. Dungeons can be run on four difficulties, a pansy mode for cowardly weaklings, a normal mode for weaklings, a hard mode for regular players, and expert for power builds! (Okay, I generalized there.) There is a lot of content for free, and subscribing unlocks access to most of the content for a monthly fee. Otherwise, you can buy or earn turbine points to get content packs to expand your experience. The cash shop is prevalent and offers advantages, but free to play is sufficient to get a good start in the game and there's not really a crippling disadvantage to free players that would force them to pay.

												This is a very good D&D game but you are limited to level 20 total.  It is not great for multiclassing but it does give you the ability to make as many action bars as you need for all of your skills and abilities.  Great playability and if you have enough time you can even earn your way into paying for content without spending money. The great thing about the game is that it has in game voice chat that works perfectly.  When you join a party and have the capability you are automatically entered into voice chat.  Kind of awesome.  I have never found another game that can do that correctly.			"

												Great game over all, tons of character options. If you like the neverwinter nights games or baulder's gate, this is like the psuedo mmo version of them.It can be a little confusing for begginers to figure out mid game, but the community is helpful.It gets harder to solo later in game, which is unfourtnate and all too common in mmo types of games. (Probably a big reason so many games failed to be the WoW killer, WoW understood the value of solo support). You can have your AI hirling pick up your soul stone when you die so you won't go out of range of it when you walk around as a spirit, then you can make your way back to a rez shrine, but if your hirling dies too, then you have to respawn and re-enter the dungeon. You get a exp penalty for that. It's a good system, abiet counter intuitive, and if you want to play solo avoid doign dungeons on anythign more than normal if you are new.The pay to play for access to certain areas, I find kind of dumb. The game should never split up parties because one doesn't have the certain dlc they need. I wish they would find a better way to monetize, do what warframe does or something. Anyway, it's definitely worth trying out. 8/10			"

												I like the fact that you can do dungeons with a couple of players.  However, the AI scripting and pathfinding for the npc hirelings is terrible.  Many of the healers dont heal, but instead try to fight.  Its tragic that a healer dies with over 9/10 of its mana still unused, and you and the npc are killed without one heal being cast.  This is espeacially true after level 17.Not the best MMO, but the community isnt the worse attitude on the net either.The armors and weapons are dull looking.  Engine looks dated as compared to other MMOs.  The game designer team is slow to change bugs.It plays similiar to pen and paper D and D, which is the reason I have put so much time into it.I give it a 7 out of 10.			"

												What can i say about this little gem? Well for starters its free. So that should have you downloading as we speak. Well plenty of classes, Build, Skills, Feats, Enhancments, and Quests,and P2P content that will keep you playing for hours. The way you can custimize your charcter is amazing. You can be a self healing monk caster or a fighter cleric its just amazing! I really dont understand why people dont play this. If you havent already or even if you have give it a other try, Its worth :) P.S I played this way more than what it says (Played it without steam) But i will say this with caution. If you dont want to make multiple toons and grind and grind for points or you dont want to buy them. Then this game is not for you. Its a amazing game. But way to much p2p content. I recommend playing it to lvl 10-15 as f2p then buying the content if you like the game. I love it.			"

												Subscription:I played it many years ago(2007-2008) and it was great as a subscription game. Alot of content to keep you intrested in and Reincarnation system makes for alot of replay value. There seems to be alot of improvements that i have not yet fully explored yet (due to the fact I am no longer a subscriber). If you are willing to pay the subscription fee, it is worth it to pick this one up for a bit till you get bored of it. All ten of my characters from back when I stopped are still all there(cant access most of them due to the limit of 4 characters for a premium account)F2P: NOT RECOMMEND ;I reciently picked it back up to see the changes in the game, but as f2p this game is a horrible money grab. You pretty much can not do anything worth while as a f2p. From what I have seen there is no possible way to get to max lvl as f2p. I can not recomend this to anyone who isn't willing to sub to it if you plan to play it for a while. Good way to see if you care for it or not to sub though.			"

												Still an asbolute gem of a game, the graphics may be out of date but they possess a dream-like quality all of their own. I love this game, it is a very faithful and well-loved representation of the dungeons and dragons universe. If you want to play dungeons and dragons in a non-dumbed down environment, you can't do better than this. The people in this MMO are the friendliest and most polite I have ever known in any game ever. This has always been my favorite place to go to and chill out in a little world of my own whenever I need a break, the free download is huge but what have you got to lose? Become a new person, enter a new World, and start your adventure now, you won't regret it.			"

												I recently got into this game because my wife and her brother used to play the crap out of it when it first released. Now we have a full party of family members all playing together. If you enjoy D&D 3.5, you'll be glad to know that every rule in the game came straight from the tabletop books, to including multi-classing. It sticks true to its roots of the original format, but also makes a pretty good MMO. The community is also very friendly from what I've seen (Khyber server) which I assume is because it's age (and possibly it's limitations on free players, more on that later) has driven off the bulk of players, leaving only the ones who really enjoy it.As a note, this game released 11 years ago, and while I personally appreciate that it doesn't need a dream machine to run smoothly, people who are accustomed to 4k HD might find it off-putting. Also, if you have a friend (or a few) who you're going to play with, I highly recommend using a third-party chat system such as Discord, as I don't think that the in-game mic chat has been updated since 2006.The only fundamental problem with the game is that as a free-to-play, free players have a bit more limitation than what I've seen in other games. This could actually be the reason why the community is so nice, but I digress. There are a few races and a few classes and even several missions that are only available to those who purchase VIP, but if you don't mind spending a little money I highly recommend giving it a whirl.

												I don't understand how (since the unfortunate and untimely demise of SWG), anyone can play any other MMORPG.  I mean, in all fairness, other titles might have the advantage of being a venerable title (WOW), or have a massive fan following (either FF XI/XIV), but when it all comes down to style, playability, and taking full advantage of the MMO perks, by incorporating them into the games construction, DDO, has done exactly what it set out to do...Emulate the adventures of the pen & paper game that has reached critical acclaim from loyal fans the world over.All the versatility of the tabletop format is right here at your fingertips.  You want to customize your stats and feats to build the most critical to form shield & sword knight, emphasizing value of honor and virtue, or become a shadow walker with deft fingers and mythic ability?  You can.  In fact, you can be both at the same time!Multiclass?  Yes, please!  I found myself easily bored by other MMO's and their linearal ability trees; maxing out my characters to get a taste of their potential, only to wish that there was more I was capable of doing.WOW?  Pffft... not if the game paid me!  DDO is the closest experience to the tabletop format as you can possibly get, without actually drawing up a world yourself.And trust me, if you enjoy this game for even a minute, do yourself a favour, go pick up some dice.  When you experience all that D&D can be, you'll never turn your back.  It's the ultimate high.			"

												The best MMORPG game I've played (and I've played a lot of different ones).It's got it's fair share of bugs, and it can be laggy in some situations. It's not very well opimised so people with slow hard drives, and not very powerful computers might have issues.But despite this, it's still kept my interest for many years.It's got great character customisation (although sadly not as much cosmetic customisation as I would like), and lots of interesting quests.The only down side is that while it is technecally a free to play game, and you can infact play it for free. Getting past level 14 or so becomes very hard due to there being few free to play quests after that point. You can unlock more quests by earning pay for money in game, but it's very time consuming to do so, and becomes easier the more content you have unlocked (so it's harder to do to start with).It lets you really try the game out though, and I would recomend anyone who likes the game to spend at least a bit of money in order to change their account from free to play to a premium account (unlocks permanently after you spend any amount of money on the game). Doing so lifts a lot of restrictions on your account.Other than that, the only thing that I can think to say is that the comunity created wiki for the game is your friend in this game.			"

												I've played this game for years now (way, way before it was on steam which I honestly just moved to) and it has been a great game. It's a really great game honestly and I love it. The creators are still supporting in and releasing updates and it's pretty awesome. However it's player base has started to dwindle and that is hurting it a lot. It was never what you could call high profile but it did have a crap ton of players on it. But now it can be hard to find others. It's possible to get around this if you know what to look for though. First of all, play during the day, esp. on weekends and there will be a good number of people around. Second of all, be careful what server you pick as characters can't move between them. To get around this I suggest using Argonnessen (you might have to scroll to find it). It has a really active player community still and there are a lot of guilds looking for players. Third, JOIN A GUILD PLEASE, just do it, if you are having a hard time finding people that's probably because you aren't in one. It helps, a lot, it really does. As far as finding one goes, hang around the harbor or korthos island (after you kill the dragon, you can't join one before that) and someone will probably try and recruit you to their guild. I know a guild (not mine, I founded my own a while ago and try and keep it kind of small) called Tycoons of Tommorow has been really active lately as well as really into recruiting, so they would be a good choice. Fourth, if a guild isn't helping or your fellow members aren't logged in, use the social pannel. It's there for a reason. It's made to show you all parties looking for members to do a quest. If you want to do a quest that isn't on that list, create your own looking for members party (the tool to do so is also in the social pannel). On the issue of FTP, that lasts for about 7 to 8 levels (that's a lot more than you think, you have to rank up 5 times per level and ranking up is a lot like what leveling is in another game) so you can still get some play time in before you run in to that really badly. HOWEVER, remember this is a bussiness, the company has to make money otherwise they can't have a game so eventually they need you to buy something. Don't get upset about this if you don't want to pay, go play flash games or something online it doesn't really matter. If you are willing to get over that, be willing to pay a little, you can get a subscription or buy individual content. I suggest buying the individual content which you do through the in game store, it's not too expensive and it never expires so it's a lot like buying DLC content for another game. Next DON'T expect this to be the pen and pencil game. It's different, HOWEVER, it really did inherit the heart and soul of D&D. Character building is almost strait out of D&D 3.5 edition and is very (almost deceptively) complex. It's easy to mess up so read a couple tutorials or pick a default build. Whatever you do, don't play the wizard, pick sorcerer, they do everything better and both are free. Wizards just really suck on non-reencarated builds. For beginners I suggest picking the Barbarian or Paladin classes. Both are really good and easy to play (Paladins just got an update and are stupidly powerful right now, I would go with a Human or Dwarf Paladin). Player abilities take a little ispiration from 4.0 (good things not all the terribleness) so that you don't have to make a lot of basic attacks and it's really intuitive. Quests are also really nice as long as you aren't too concerned with your exp. per minute (which honestly just takes the fun out of the game). Take your time and read and listen to the stories, they are pretty great. And lastly just have fun with it. It's free at first so it doesn't hurt at all to try. So come on and play, If you are on Agronnessen and you see a character with the surname Requiem, say hi, I'll see if I can't help you get started.			"

												Really glaring flaws that are really putting me off.Melee combat is very hit or miss, I enjoyed it on a monk but a dual rapier rogue ended up being a nightmare at some points,(maybe it was the attack speed?) if the enemy chooses to move at all you will have just about no chance of hitting them and this will happen frequently against casters. Maybe this was just from the last dungeon I was in but I was not able to hit the orcs at all once they moved, and they moved VERY frequently when hit, and it took a moment after they stopped before I would be able to continue dealing damage.  I was doing very well in a dungeon three levels higher than I was supposed to be in but these things seriously hampered my progress to a point where I had to completely stop and leave, I will never step foot in that area again because it was a very nasueating experience having orc casters with blur and negative level abilities constantly shift to avoid damage made them literally unhittable, it was an actual brick wall.NPC spellcasters that are not your hirelings have an infinite amount of spellpoints, so anything you fight will never run out of an infinite font of fuel to burn your ♥♥♥ to the floor. If you try to wait any negative levels (feels like three minutes+ per negative level..) you incur they will continue to spread buffs, and the moment you get in range you get slapped with even more.The dungeons are really neat when its not go left or right into rooms that have nothing but filler mobs with a few crates that *might* contain something worth selling and for the conquest and ransack xp boosts. Although I feel like for this reason there are some quests that arent really even viable to do because they are just way too long and you could have done much more in that time. I don't even think this review is done but these were just some thoughts so far.			"

												The game has only gotten better with age. A little confusing at first, but ig you've played Dungeons and Dragons (Pen and Paper) Then you'll absolutely love DDO. The community is great (Especially on Twitch) and all of the players usually tend to help one another. I think this is honestly the best review I can write for any game in my Library, as it has been a couple of days since I redownloaded it from when I was little, and didn't understand it, but now I do understand how to play, and it's amazing!!!

												For an MMO this was pretty good. I had a lot of fun playing this and had I invested money into the game, I probably would have played longer too. I liked the idea of the Guilds and the ship too. But I have a short attention span and get bored doing mindless hash and slash after a while and am essentially done playing MMOs for good.If you like mid-evil MMO's than this is definitely a fun one to check out. It has a decent story and unlike most other MMO's allows some customization with your leveling up.But if you aren't a fan of MMO's such as myself, then don't expect anything spectacular here that will change your mind on those types of games.

												Caution: Old school Pen and Paper Geek, review will be slantedI played DDO on and off for over 2 years and even had a premium content pack or two, but I just gave up. The initial Character mechanic LOOKS like the DnD 3.X, but the deeper layers of the game are built in a fashion to any other MMO. Just because I know what my character can handle on paper doesn't mean my Online character stands a chance. Looking into the forums and fan pages, I leaned that just like WoW/Everquest/et al, the game was built using an engine that encourages decimal point maxing that's even more Munchkin than pen and paper games. If you want to play solo, don't bother. The ""perfect builds"" have been long since logged and the macro routines are freely traded, thus turning the game into less of a skill/luck game and into a ""press this key to execute this routine"". The player population is slim and too many tropes from other games have crept into DDO over the years like meta currency, Alliance based items and abilities and a subtle but painful need to chain play content packs for gear in order to stand a chance at higher levels (as a soloist, I suck at group play).It just isn't DnD anymore. It has the window dressing at the front end, but it's just a grinder. I disbanded my Alliance, deleted my toons and gave up.			"

												It was good at first. Then it all went downhill once the second expansion came out.It hurts me to play it, because I realize how alive and good it once was.Doesn't help that the content-purchase system here is much more greedy than in LotRO. At least the content was reasonably priced there and you could get Turbine Points rather easily...I've played since 2011, quitting for a while after each time I true reincarnated. The content is enjoyable at first, but can get repetitive quickly, especially if you're on later lives and need more exp. Balance is... out of whack, and has been...There's more of a focus on soloing now, as many players have quit in the last few years, and most servers are lacking in population, at least from what I've seen. At least the character creation is very extensive. I've always liked that.			"

The Best [Free to Play/Pay to Play] Game in existance currently!Alright so to start off this review lets talk about what the game of [DDO] actually is.[DDO] Is a F2P hack n' slash style MMORPG with a dungeon crawling theme to it. The game has quite a bit of Pay to progress content that players can either choose to pay in order to get it, or use the ""favor system"" in order to get content for free just by playing. The game also offers many elements that help the replayability immensley, which I will talk about laterPROS & CONSPROS    1. You can attain all of the content for FREE.    2. You can solo and or group in the game if you want to.    3. The game has immense customization, meaning that you have the ability to build your character completely different than other players every time If you want to    4. The game has a system in which you can True Reincarnate once you reach level cap. This means that you will go from level cap back to level 1, with benefits from your previous (life).CONS    1. STUDY STUDY STUDY - - Unless you really enjoy studying to better understand a game in order to become the best, then this part is a CON for you. Studying can be VERY beneficial in this game, however it can be the down fall of this game for many players as well.    2. PvP - - There is PvP within this game, however it isn't really good. If you are looking for a PvP based game, then I advise you to go to another MMO.    3. Groups - - This game certainly isn't for everyone, it takes a bit of work to get into, so finding groups to play with can be challenging. You have to put yourself way more out there, in order to find other players to talk to/group with.     4. GRAPHICS - - Now I personally dont mind games with bad graphics, however some players might. This games graphics can be hard on the eyes when players are used to games such as... (Skyrim, Blade & Soul, Black Desert, etc)    5. GRIND - - This game is a major grind, since the entire goal behind this game is to utilize the (True Reincarnation system). If you dont wish to utilize that system, then you are better off playing something else.Looking at the Pros/Cons you might be wondering, ""Why...? Why would this guy recommend this game to me?"" Well I will tell you. This game may be finicky, it might require a bit more time invested into it in order to enjoy it, however this game has 2 essential elements that many other games lack.    1. Character Difference    2. Reason to continue playing that characterA lot of the MMOs out there these days lack in both of those areas... With [DDO], You will be able to differentiate your character by selecting things such as, (Race, Class, Alignment, Feats, Skills, Enhancements, Weapons, Armor, Stats, Selecting up to 3 different classes, etc.)You will also be able to continue to improve upon that character by following through with the (True Reincarnation system). This will make it so a level capped character can go back to the beginning with benefits acquired from your past life.These 2 elements is what makes [DDO] superior to games like [World of warcraft] For example. What is it that players from [World of warcraft] do once they reach the end game area? They get the best in slot gear, then what do you do? They might do some PvP. Then what do you do? They get gold capped. Then what do you do? The game is pretty much dead for you after that right? At least... unless a new update/expac comes to pass perhaps. Yes, [DDO] does get more updates to the gear, and if you dont like to grind, then this game definitely is NOT for you.Now, im not the best at writing reviews however, I certainly recommend to anyone that is seeking a new MMO, to try out [DDO]. The game is definitely worth a look, and it wont cost anything to just download it and hop in for a bit guaranteed :).			"

												DDO is probably the most underratred MMO out there. I wish more games in the genre would use modular content like this one does. It allows you to solo and make groups on the fly while still enjoying the content, and you never feel like you have to twiddle your thumbs waiting for a ""healer"" or ""tank"" to show up. It's an altogether better system than the traditional MMO in many ways. The free account is limited in that you can only create two characters and they will be removed if you don't log on for a while - which makes me sad, because I really play this as kind of a pick-up-and-go game and I don't like to pay subscription fees for MMOs. That said, the game itself is definitely worth your time if you're looking for a free to play MMORPG that actually has some depth to it. It can be difficult to find other players to group with because the player base is small. It's still a very enjoyable game, and if you're even vaguely familiar with D&D 3.5 rules you'll get into it pretty easily. I only know the very basic gameplay and I was able to jump into this without too many issues. The leveling system is more complex and robust than a typical mmo, but the game has features that allow you to select a goal. The game then builds toward that goal for you. It's a fun game to play causally. I would play more often if I had a regular group to play with.			"

												As a long time D@D player going back to the late 80's, this is probably the best online roleplaying game right now. Building your character the way you want to play is the best feature. Joining a guild is very important, for guild ship buffs and having people available to help you with quests. PUG groups are ok...but can fall apart a lot. If you played pnp d@d you will really enjoy this one.For low end systems..i would suggest downloading the actual client from the sight..i had to do that after my main pc crapped out. I actually have probably over 800 hours..give or take in this game.			"

												DDO is a great game filled with meticulous character planning, questing, leveling and even more character planning. Despite how it sounds, it's actually very pleasing. Overall gameplay experiences are positive and it's not bad on the eye either. DDO brings outstanding events (mabar, crystal cove, etc.), and I found these to be extremely rewarding. However, I'm kind of sad to see DDO becoming less and less D&D in an attempt to please a more mainstream crowd. I greatly enjoyed playing it over the past years, but I find myself playing less for exactly that reason. Every update comes with it's own set of new bugs and support is sloppy. Every update seems to make the game more profit oriented, the gaming experience coming in second place. And I'll admit, I have spent my fair share of money, with no regrets. PROs:- Hours of fun. Find yourself a capable, well balanced party and you'll be having a good time.- A variety of different locations, each with their own inhabitants, all equally eager to knock you down a peg.- A very supportive communityCONs- After hours of gameplay, going from TR to TR becomes quite a grind.- ""Incompetent"" (By lack of a better word) parties will prolong a quest greatly. This is not always a problem, but can be quite aggrevating when it takes 3 hours to complete a seemingly simple raid.- Bugs and poor fixes.- Quest mechanics have been changed, making it next to impossible to do a quest solo.TL;DRDDO is still good, it just used to be better.

												Well, the most lovely and complex MMO for me since 2006 (based on AD&D + special rules). I really not want to admit how much hours i played since 2006 with this game...(since 2006 it's 5-6hr average daily base mostly on evenings, and i'm not a 24/7-er and never will be; nowadays have some months retirement from DDO... there are some guys who plays a lot lot lot more. Lowlifers? Millionaires? Workslackers? Gnomes in the basement as daddy's/mommy's favourite thing? Guess i will never know that...)I can recommend this if you like to build unique characters and try so much things what can offer this game, and if you like AD&D. It's still the best choice what can offer the market around for hardcore rpg mmo...+ instanced quest system+ deep character, class and reincarnation possiblities+ good story content with lot of hidden and less hidden clues+ secret places, TRAPS!+ ""free to play"" made a great blast for the community, but you really need to 'work' hard if you not want to pay for this game, if you want to unlock the whole content (to be ""raid or fast reincarnation compatible"" mostly)+ team game, but if you have a good idea/build/amount of time/skill/persistence, almost every time can figurable how can be possible to solo any quest (even raids)+ guilds and shipping (housing)- graphics a bit outdated, but the main thing is the athmosphere, so can live with that- random characterization is a bit outdated- encourage to break the whole furniturement in the dungeons (you get extra xp for that), it's still SILLY!- unsolved bugs since 2006 (the most famous one: the ladder 'bug', which is extremely annoying), and every new expansion seems to be a problem to not cause unwanted bugs in the implemented older contents, so usually worth to wait a bit after they release a new one (well it can be true nowadays for so many overhype-marketed games also)- ocassional LAG and sudden disconnections, sometimes non-planned maintenence- favor of the month builds, which suggest serious content balance failures, but the developers always follow how to fix that... and of course encourage people to roll a new 'trendy' build for the success...- ingame purchase: if your wallet is big, you can progress much faster -> reincarnation hearts, +50% experience pots, tomes etc.			"

												1. Do not think of this game as free to play. You ""Could"" get every piece of content in the game for free, but it is highly time inefficient and soul-suckingly boring for the average person. requiring roughly 20 hours to get 1000 Turbine points (the Shop currency) also known as 10$. 2. Since I have asked you to suspend your current beliefs I will supply you with some new ones. This game should be thought of as a 25$ game when on one of their deep discount sales on steam for christmas (mabye), black friday, or any other sale where you can pick up the two expansions, or a 15$ a month Subscription with free premium currency as mini rewards as you play. Remember that you can buy most adventure packs for $3 to $10 with a few exceptions. You also do not have to buy all of the packs. some can be ignored because they are not your cup of tea.3. Sales. Learn them. This game becomes a much better sell once you realize they have weekly sales every week on thursday and friday with discounts on things you actually care about like adventure packs or occasionaly one of the premium classes.

												After 400 + hours of this dealing with bugs and everything, i can safely say that this is like a love hate relationship. You wan't this game to be so good but the bugs constantly slap your immersion right in the face.Would i wan't the hours i played back, no. Do i wan't the game to improve yes.If you have ever played pen & paper like i did, this is a easy to digest version somewhat of the old d & d games. But it plays like an mmo of course. Theres starting to be a large variety of classes now to melt into eachother with reckless abandon. Some builds are extremely good and some are very gimped.It takes the action based approach to a really cool place, which i really like. But that said some of its features are lacking in the sense that it's crafting system never fully matured. The large raids require a large amount of guidance, and can fail badly and quickly because of large amounts of dammage  huge demands to mana. They removed monks ability to ressurect people which was a huge boon and needed in my opinion.Small pets that do nothing, no mounts and no housing. Those are things id like to see in the future. And the really cool story based dungeons could lift the game somewhat, with not to much downtime mind you, it sucks to wait for minutes just looking at narration.Well if you are new to the game and are looking for a guild, im on sarlona with my own guild Nobles of Evenstar.

												I came across this when I couldn't find a decent gaming group near me to play Pen & Paper DnD.I haven't played it on Steam for a long while (Because technical reasons), but I'm pretty sure my hours played are at least double, if not triple the amount above.It's not a carbon copy of PnP considering it's made for MMO purposes (I mean, come on, you don't REALLY want to wait six seconds for every single action, do you?) but it's a pretty good representation of it.A dedicated player can play this game and eventually* access all its content without needing to pay a single penny.One thing that makes this game stand out from many others out there is its replayability.Your character isn't capped at its full potential when you reach max level, no.You can ""Reincarnate"" characters to make them stronger on recreation, giving them extra perks and bonuses, allowing you to build a better character from level 1 without deleting and re-creating it.With time, you can go through all the Classes with a single character, no need to create different characters for different classes, though you can still do that, if you so choose.It's also a rather friendly community overall, so don't hesitate to always ask for help in-game!*After excessive grinding across multiple servers for currency you can use in the in-game Store.

												So here it is, another hidden Gem in the list of free to play games.  this game has been out for awhile, I was around 18 years old when I heard about it, I gave it try back then, now 5 years later (2014). Ive came back, I felt like i didnt give it much of a chance and holly crap what an amazing experience Ive been having, I plugged my Afterglow 360 controller in, touched up to controlls to how I prefer and jumped into a  flawless well polished game, that new what it wanted toe be, a serious RPG for D&D fanseverything including the gameplay, naratives, character customization which keeps things challenging to the way that you crawl over the land scape and grab onto ledges  this is what keep D&D titles alive. simple concepts like puzzles and having to search areas, this is the ultimate MMO, I recently played Elderscrolls Online, and honestly I love the ideas and how much loot you can pick up, and how you can see your hands when in first person, how every AI talks to you with sound, but honestly it takes you outta the reality of being immersive, DDO has the kinda Graphics that grow on you, it looks kinda clunky at first but when you toss DX11 on you start to really love how it all blends together, this is a game that is looked past by many, for those who really feen for a solid well polished RPG look no further this is the ultimate pakage, join the legacy  11/10  "

												A solid D&D game, although it starts getting stale around levels 5-10 where you will need to repeat quests on harder difficulties if you want to keep playing for free. It'll take you a while to get there though (levels are split into 5 ""ranks"" as well, which might sound bad, but is actually good), so you'll get plenty of good D&D gaming without paying a cent. Also, the sahaughin make a good running joke if you listen to some of the voice dialog.			"

Joining a guild is very important, for guild ship buffs and having people available to help you with quests. PUG groups are ok...but can fall apart a lot.

												DDO is a great game filled with meticulous character planning, questing, leveling and even more character planning. Despite how it sounds, it's actually very pleasing. Overall gameplay experiences are positive and it's not bad on the eye either. DDO brings outstanding events (mabar, crystal cove, etc.), and I found these to be extremely rewarding. However, I'm kind of sad to see DDO becoming less and less D&D in an attempt to please a more mainstream crowd. I greatly enjoyed playing it over the past years, but I find myself playing less for exactly that reason. Every update comes with it's own set of new bugs and support is sloppy. Every update seems to make the game more profit oriented, the gaming experience coming in second place. And I'll admit, I have spent my fair share of money, with no regrets. PROs:- Hours of fun. Find yourself a capable, well balanced party and you'll be having a good time.- A variety of different locations, each with their own inhabitants, all equally eager to knock you down a peg.- A very supportive communityCONs- After hours of gameplay, going from TR to TR becomes quite a grind.- ""Incompetent"" (By lack of a better word) parties will prolong a quest greatly. This is not always a problem, but can be quite aggrevating when it takes 3 hours to complete a seemingly simple raid.- Bugs and poor fixes.- Quest mechanics have been changed, making it next to impossible to do a quest solo.TL;DRDDO is still good, it just used to be better.

You also earn Turbine Points for playing, allowing you to quicky move to a premium account.

												Pretty good MMO. The go-to MMO if you like 3.5e D&D, forget Neverwinter. That's different.Now, I know at a certain level pretty much all quests require a Quest Pack Purchase (involving real money) but still... not a bad game. Plus, there are some ways to earn free Turbine Points, so it's not all bad.Overall, I'd give DDO a 3.5/5. Overall  above-average, though not exactly 'stellar'.

												I am write this review while waiting for Turbine to fix my account, which isn't connecting due to a ""Lack of subscription"" when the game is F2P.Supprisingly It isn't negative one. DDO was my first involved experiance with FTP+Micro transactions, and I have to say when I'd last played they where doing it right. There was no functional item in the Real Payment stores that didn't have an equivilant you could work for, and overall it is one of the best executions of the entire format. In a game with +4 weapons, and the store caped at +3. Utility items that open locks 50x , so you don't lose out of treasure just because your playing a Paladin who doesn't pick locks. You can clear out an area, and over time loot and sell items to get that NPC contract so you have a dedicated healer. Or you can fork over five bucks and get one from the store. Classes feel different, and the feat system works similar to the classic Pen and Paper game. And they have implemented skills in a way that very few skills don't at least have some appeal. Swim might seem useless, until you are trying to solve a puzzel on a water level, and you just ran out of water breathing potions. The hidden cap of 40 could of been adressed, perhaps giving some minor bonus elsewhere depending on the skill.The only complaint I ever really had was how slow leveling up felt, each level subdivided into 5 mini-levels. However the very thing that is drawing me back is that recent updates have given me hope that they may now feel more substantial with a talent tree like interface. Lastly, I will say that if you do decide to play. Steam does not have anything to do with the account and login. That is Turbine. And they have the Worst Website of ANY MMO i've seen. Even those random Korean games that where popular some time back are better. It honestly feels like they hired somone to take care of it, then fired them a week before launch, and never hired anyone to fix it. Supposidly if you become a ""Premium Member"" (You've payed ~$10 or more) you get actual customer support to help deal with your issues, but as i've said, i'm waiting on a ticket.Overall I'd give it a try. That at the very least cost nothing. And the game really can be played without ever paying a cent, although expect to do a lot of grinding to get everything.			"

												DDO is a great game with detailed character creation and awesome combat mechanics. You can do a lot for free, which is spelled out well in the ddowiki article[ddowiki.com].If you are new to the game, be sure try all the servers until you find one with a lot of activity during your play time. At least one server has a player character acting as a greeter in the starter area. If you like to hammer things out for yourself, you can do that. If you like socialization, grouping, and getting help in game, you can do that, too. There a lot of helpful players, and when you find and join an active guild, you will have constant comrades. :)*Don't mind my Steam playing time. I have been playing DDO long before I joined Steam. ;)Edit:This is a great game, and it has been one for years. If you are used to playing other MMO's, you would do well to forget them when you play DDO. Approach the game with a fresh perspective, and bring along some friends. You will not be sorry. :)			"

												I used to think this game was the epitome of great in spite of both dated graphics and logistics....because 3.5 is the only DnD version worth playing (Baldur's Gate, NWN, Icewind, etc.), but the game is dying.  Sad, but true.  The game needs a reboot with a new engine, and I truly believe such a reboot would attract a large player base, but it's doubtful that such a thing will ever happen.  There has been a serious dumbing down in the difficulty of content such that most PUGs are with individuals who feel entitled to a win without working for it.  Strategy?  Unknown.  Entitlement?  Yes, now.  While that description by no means encompasses every player it fairly describes such a prevelant sentiment that the enjoyment of the game is in a steady decline and has been so for a quite some time.  Also, the last year or so has seen Pay-To-Win options introduced on their store, further degrading the player base and removing motivators for continued play while lining the pockets of Turbine.  Gear is handed out like candy, through duping or otherwise.  With no real motivators to be better, skill declines.  Unless you're the kind of player who likes easy walks in the park and readily accessible gear for all, then this is not the game for you.What once was good now needs a burial plot at the nearest cemetary.R.I.P.

In that you can buy perminant content that would otherwise require you to keep paying a sub to have access to. The game itself is fun for a while. Tho after level 8 or 9 the game is a bit repeatative and grindy. Tho you will surely have fun until then. Best recommendation is to play with people you know. Makes it tons funner that way.			"

												This game is amazing. It's graphics and combat give it a classic feel, and even though it looks old, it is updated regularly and has a large amount of players. The quests and dungeons are interesting and immersive. There are large ""Wilderness"" areas filled with monsters and places to explore, and they even have a few rare named monsters! The dungeons are exceedingly fun, with many different monsters and 4 different difficulty settings that effect XP earned. Choose Casual and go through it lone wolf, or go Elite and bring a few friends along to conquer all those who oppose you! Grouping in this game is fun, as you learn to depend on one-another when in danger. The crafting system is a little boring, but it is absolutely rewarding. Armor and Weapon designs are cool and flashy, with multiple different armor sets for diversity. Combat is fun, with weapons having hitboxes and a certain reach based on their weapon type. There are somewhere around 15 classes, all of which are interesting and fun to play. The game features a multiclass system, so you can make your character exactly what you want it to be. Whether you're a mage with a huge greataxe, a stealthy tank, or a magical rogue, whatever you want to be is entirely up to you.9/10, You must try this game.			"

												As one of the original founders (my guild's name, Gtb, is still on the monument), I returned after some years to the game in the hopes of enjoying it once more. A poor decision on my part, I'm afraid.The game says ""free to play,"" but, in fact, the game is a microtransaction farm. It's sparsely populated, and the only way for your wallet to survive is to join a guild - in this game, if you're playing solo, understand that death has a dollar sign attached to it. And, you're going to die a lot. The game's mechanics have encouraged a scarcity environment, to ensure microtransactions, and the repetitive gameplay means a lot of grinding.If I knew a few weeks ago what I knew now, I wouldn't have wasted my time. Avoid this game - the whole experience has degraded.			"

												I wanted so much to love this game.It is wonderful if you loved 3.5 D&D (I did) but the whole thing creaks under its age. The player base is small, cliquey and more overpowered then any noob could ever aspire to. The game is buggy and the free version extremely frustrating (so much content is locked). The paid version is ALSO frustrating since, even when you pay the subscription cost, you have to buy upgrades etc. seperately.I think I'm going to try again, at some point, and see if I can find the fun but I'm not hopeful. The cost of just a few months playing it as pay2win would pay for an entire premium game (Witcher 3). Maybe it will just become my drunken FTP ex and I'll booty-call the servers when I feel bad about myself.			"

												After playing this game for about 10-15 minutes (It may not show up that played but I did) I had finished the tutorial and was out into the first town, little did I know there was a lot of grinding to be done just to get to lvl 3. and it took an hour, to get to lvl 3!!! COME ON!! I don't want to play a game where you have to grind and grind to get into the lowest of the low lvls! I want a game that I can jump in and play, no grinding. Also, it is sooooo restricted by whether you spend money on it, to the point where I wanted to play as a drow wizard, but no, I had to pay money for that. I didn't like it either, as it took for ever to get to the 2nd town, ( I perservered ) hoping against hope that there would be no more grinding to do, but guess what, there was! This game is free, and still I haven't gotten my money's worth, playing Magicka Wizard Wars instead, strangely addicting...ps, it says I played 22 hours of this game, that was with one character and I got to lvl 6,(Iperservered some more, then gave up) Magicka Wizard Wars and Diablo 3 are both way better, play those instead			"

												Just a note before I begin..... I have been playing this game for 4 years prior to accessing through Steam.This game is what a good Action RPG should be.  It has almost infinite replayability!Characters aka ""Toons"" - with 8 regular races, 4 Iconic races and 13 classes......the combinations are endless.  Each class has multiple ways to build them and with multi-classing, the tweaking never stops.  This is the biggest strength of the game in my opinion.  Add in the Epic Destinies in the later levels and customization continues to increase.  Each Resurrection adds a ""Past Life"" bonus which keeps you grinding for more.Content - There are tons of quests! A large amount of them are set in the Realm of Eberron.  A couple of years ago they expanded to include the Forgotten Realms (Eveningstar, Underdark, etc.).  The content includes Wilderness areas, Quests and Raids.  There are a large diversity in quests with puzzles sprinkled through out.  The difficulty is adjustable in each case.Free-to-play - When reading reviews of MMOs, this seems to be one of the biggest factors for people liking or disliking the game.  Is this game Free-to-play?  Yes, it is.  You can unlock everything in the game for free......with a good amount of grinding.   It is possible to play totally free by earning Turbine Points (TP) for completing quests.  TP is the DDO Store currency for purchasing Quest packs, cosmetics, specialty potions, etc.  Is there the opportunity to pay real money for advantages?  Yes, there are.   You can purchase TP with real money.  There are also upgrades to purchase for you character like ability and skill tomes.  So technically you can advance yourself by spending some real money, however the only way to get the great gear in the game is by grinding for it.  I played 2 years for free before finally going VIP cause I love the game so much and thought, why not....this is where I spend most of my time.Community - The community is largely made up of older people, reliving the days of PnP online in video game format.  Guilds are a good way to meet people and also gain some help.  There are opportunities for roleplaying if you find the right people.  The majority of players are good people if you are willing to learn the right way to play.... that means listening to those who know what they are doing, sticking to the plan and playing within your limits.  There are lots of resources for help onlineI have enjoyed this game for a long while and will continue to do so as long as the updates keep rolling in			"

												Great game, until you try yo actually pay for a subscription very hard to navigate . The process says to log into the game, and select DDO points, then select subscription. From there you are taken back to STEAM to purchase with STEAM POINTS you purchase with a CC. Every time i do this i get an error , even though i have enough points (money). For example the one month sub is $14.99 , i have $15 in my steam account....you think it will let me purchase a 1 month? NOPE!...and good luck trying to get customer service to be time . Great game CS and business ethics sub par though.			"

It's hard to do the contract because you can't scroll down it easily and you can't just click I agree because they want you to either read the whole thing or difficultly try to scroll down it. When I do get to finally click I agree it starts downloading,for like 3 seconds, then it stops and says internal error has occured, it does that everytime I start the game!

												Background: D&D 3.5 DM and player of Pathfinder & 5ECombat Mechanics: Outdated, but True to Form for Dungeons and Dragons. Throw Dice at it...more dice and eventually you may find a different result.   This game like the Tabletop version is very Team oriented and much like the Tabletop experience. At Low Levels Non-Casters thrive, but at High Levels It is those with a Casting Ability that really start to take the Lead.  Some will find this system of standing in a room and holding down Left Mouse Click to kill something...Tedious...Boring...Overdramatized when it should be contact with enemy produces some kind of visible reaction from the enemy whether I miss or not...I have friends who have told me the exact thing. This Game and its mechanics are not for everyone. The Pay to Play Thing: Yes some classes are Paywalled but everything can be obtained through lots of hard work. Turbine points are given for in game progress but can also be purchased. Quest Packs are purchased and unlocked in the same way. So is the Druid Class. If you have a subscription you get all the Quest Packs and 500 Turbine Points a Month.The Pay to Win Thing: Now there is an opposite side to these Turbine Points. Not only do they unlock classes and quest packs, but they also allow you to buy ingame Convenience Items that make most of the game; Stupid Easy. Like Resurrection Cakes that let you Free Rez inside of a Module, or Items to allow you to Craft Epic Pieces, Unlimited Lockpicks, you name it.  While This is not cheating it does fulfill a model to create revenue because at the heart of any MMO is a Business and Businesses need money. I do not fault their decision to offer items like this, but it irks me sometimes at their offerings.Social Mechanics: Given the age of the game and that fact the Devs are still pushing out content (Turbine and WB are somehow still producing stuff) and the mostly active community. The Social side of DDO still has enough active guilds and Power Runners who've literally memorized the maps and quest sequences that you are bound to find a group if you look hard enough.Final Thoughts: So this game was made a while ago. By today's standards it is like World of Warcraft in that it should be scrapped and a completely new, graphically intense game of the same name needs to replace it, like yesterday. That being said I am a diehard D&D player and DM so part of me knows the frustration of trying to Disable a Trap and then roll a 1 and get completely obliterated. The other part of me knows...this type of gameplay is not a positive example for a RealTime Game like DDO.100% Watch Low and High Level Gameplay before you Get a Membership. Remember this game can be 100% Free 2 Play and you will evenentually have everything a VIP has Except for a few character Slots.			"

												Background: D&D 3.5 DM and player of Pathfinder & 5ECombat Mechanics: Outdated, but True to Form for Dungeons and Dragons. Throw Dice at it...more dice and eventually you may find a different result.   This game like the Tabletop version is very Team oriented and much like the Tabletop experience. At Low Levels Non-Casters thrive, but at High Levels It is those with a Casting Ability that really start to take the Lead.  Some will find this system of standing in a room and holding down Left Mouse Click to kill something...Tedious...Boring...Overdramatized when it should be contact with enemy produces some kind of visible reaction from the enemy whether I miss or not...I have friends who have told me the exact thing. This Game and its mechanics are not for everyone. The Pay to Play Thing: Yes some classes are Paywalled but everything can be obtained through lots of hard work. Turbine points are given for in game progress but can also be purchased. Quest Packs are purchased and unlocked in the same way. So is the Druid Class. If you have a subscription you get all the Quest Packs and 500 Turbine Points a Month.The Pay to Win Thing: Now there is an opposite side to these Turbine Points. Not only do they unlock classes and quest packs, but they also allow you to buy ingame Convenience Items that make most of the game; Stupid Easy. Like Resurrection Cakes that let you Free Rez inside of a Module, or Items to allow you to Craft Epic Pieces, Unlimited Lockpicks, you name it.  While This is not cheating it does fulfill a model to create revenue because at the heart of any MMO is a Business and Businesses need money. I do not fault their decision to offer items like this, but it irks me sometimes at their offerings.Social Mechanics: Given the age of the game and that fact the Devs are still pushing out content (Turbine and WB are somehow still producing stuff) and the mostly active community. The Social side of DDO still has enough active guilds and Power Runners who've literally memorized the maps and quest sequences that you are bound to find a group if you look hard enough.Final Thoughts: So this game was made a while ago. By today's standards it is like World of Warcraft in that it should be scrapped and a completely new, graphically intense game of the same name needs to replace it, like yesterday. That being said I am a diehard D&D player and DM so part of me knows the frustration of trying to Disable a Trap and then roll a 1 and get completely obliterated. The other part of me knows...this type of gameplay is not a positive example for a RealTime Game like DDO.100% Watch Low and High Level Gameplay before you Get a Membership. Remember this game can be 100% Free 2 Play and you will evenentually have everything a VIP has Except for a few character Slots.			"

												Is an alright game, if you can afford the payments(which isn't alot compared to other online games). Only issue is every now & then you are unable to log onto the game. It could be related to the switching of Companies, etc. All in all a fun game, if you understand the game mechanics!			"

												Not that far into the game but it can be quite brutal. Getting 1 hit by traps because you aren't careful is refreshing. There are so many builds I want to do since you can mix so many classes. Would recommend, but with a premium subscription of course so you are not limited by f2p content.			"

												I have played WoW (as of today i have 10 maxed toons there) and Rift (4 maxed toons) for years, but this game have the best class/skill/abilities/spell system i ever met. Highly recommened to play it if you enjoy building your own character the way YOU want it, not the way developers made it. Oh, did i mention that you can multi-class in this game? not to mention epic destinies and bunch of other staff great staff?? :)In short, i love this game. the only downside is there is no unlimited open world like in WoW or Rift. Hopefully it will be changed in future.			"

												Let me start this off by saying I've played this game for far longer than my playtime says. In fact, it was one of the first PC games I ever played, and to this day it's still one of my favorites. The world is interesting, the diversity of spells and abilities you can get is astounding, and it boasts the unique (so far as I know) feature of calculating stats and damage like an actual game of tabletop D&D. You even get a couple Dungeon Masters narrating the things you do, which I always thought was a nice touch. The sixteen-odd classes, with the ability to multiclass up to three times, and various races are each fairly intriguing, though there isn't really much you can do in the way of customization. Still, you can play as a magic robot. That's pretty cool.  The graphics are definitely showing their age, and I've run into my fair share of bugs, but it's never stopped me from having a good time. Still, the game is far from perfect, and there's a few pieces of advice I'd like to give to those interested in picking it up:1. Get some friends to play with you. This game is fine on its own, but, as with tabletop D&D, a couple friends makes it far better. The playerbase for this game is fairly small, and public groups arent' as common as they once were. If you want to co-op, chances are you'll have to seek outside help.2. Be prepared to spend money. Not on items, or gear, or things like that, but on adventure packs. This game isn't pay-to-win (how could it be, it's mostly co-op), but you do have to pay for a great deal of content. This can either be in the form of a subscription (I don't know how much that is exactly), or for adventure packs, for which you use TP, the game's freemium currency, to unlock specific quest chains. For some people, that might be an instant turn-off, but if you're like me and have trouble sticking to one game for too long, You'll probably appreciate the ability to pay as you go, rather than keep shelling out money for a game you may not be interested in at the moment. You can, as with most games, go through and unlock all of the areas for free eventually, but not unless you're willing to endure a rather long grind. I'm talking like multiple characters on multiple servers long. If you're not quite sure if you're willing to spend money on a free-to-play game, there's still enough free stuff to get a feel for if you like the game, and you can still have plenty of fun without spending a cent.Also, not sure if this is on my end or something with the game, but I've found the controls to be a tad slow and unresponsive as of late. Again, not sure if this is the game, or my computer, I've had similar problems in a few other games. To conclude, not a bad game, if you like D&D you'll probably like this. Really I'm just writing this in the hopes of keeping it alive.			"

												One of the best MMOs I have ever played, tons of free content and very cheap access to the rest of the game. Best played with close friends or you may end up just running through dungeons without understanding or getting a chance to admire the puzzles and traps.My favorite feature is the traps, they add lots of new mechanics, such as ""do you wanna rush up those suspicious stairs, or wait for the rest of the party?""Its not perfect, it has some underused awesome systems and some overused less awesome systems, but overall i think it is awesome. If you love D&D or other tabletop games try this game immediately, im sure you will love it.EDIT: Would just like to say that if any of you have been discouraged by the ""akamai netsession plague,"" dont be. Akamai is secure and helpful. additionally, Akamai can be easily disabled, even though it doesent even turn itself on until you use it.[/b] The people who say its a bad thing only say so because they never even bothered to learn what it does, just heard ""P2P"" and started screaming about how they couldent find the very obvious off button. To sum up, the game is awesome, and akamai net session poses no risk to you, all it does is speed up game updating. "

												Good game; changed a lot through time and right now is very far away from D&D, but still is a good game:Pro- keeps evolving all the time, with new features- best customer support game- is totally free, and all you can buy with cash you can also buy with TP earned in game (just need more patience) but there is not something only those who pay can achieveCons- mechanics for the stats, right now are way to more complicated than original D&D and for someone new to the game it can be disheartening- dungeons become a little too much easier to complete so you may lack the excitment of ending a quest that others could not end alone - sadly this is due to crybabies that payed but being a total failure as gamers were not able to complete quests and so the devs decreased the difficultyConsidering this, and many other aspects, is still a very good game that I strongly recomendPS. I palyed this game from the very beginning, even before it was on steam, so my 400 hours on record are not even close to the time I dedicated to this game - the real hours spent should be over 1500			"

												Great MMO. Huge amount of class builds you can play. Huge amount of content to explore. If you want to grind the whole game can actually be played for free (although with just a few bucks the grind can be reduced substantially). I have played most MMOs out there but this is the one I always come back to. It has different difficulty levels on each of the dungeons which is a huge deal as it allows the game to cater to both soloers and groups and also gives the game a lot of replay value as you can always play the same content over on elite difficulty when you are higher level for often a much bigger challenge. I honestly don't know why more MMOs don't have a system like this. The only drawback I see to this game is there isn't really an open world except in the towns but honestly this is not something I miss at all.Be aware that this game was released in 2006 with graphics you'd expect from that era but the gameplay is great.

													Today was great.  I've recently come back to DDO and reactivated my VIP subscription.  After a few days I was wondering why I ever left.  I even convinced some friends to come back and enjoy the game with me.  Then I tried to purchase some turbine points and my day really great.  Opening up the store I navigated through to purchase some coins and made sure there was enough in my steam wallet to afford it.  I don't get paid till Friday, but $20 isn't bad and it's fun.  So, once I get all that set up I click to purchase the points and...error.  No problem these things happen and there's downtime soon anyway.  I'll just try again afterwards.	Downtime is over, DDO is back up and now I log in to complete my purchase and get to playing.  Error.  Ok, so maybe I just can't use the steam wallet option.  No worries, I still have $25 in that account I'll just use my card.  So I type in my card info, choose the points I want and confirm.  Error.  Can't purchase the points.  Well, now I'm annoyed, but I'm not gonna let that get in my way.  I know I can go to the site, use the store there to but a code for the coins and input that at my account page.  It's not as handy, but it'll work.	Alright, got everything set up, found the points in the store on the site, it get 50 fewer points for the same price going this route.  But at this point I just want to get things taken care of so I can get back to playing.  So I purchase the points, get the code and head over to my account page.  Seems simple, click a button input the code and here come my points.  or....Error...really?  The code isn't valid?  I bought it 5 minutes ago, I have the page still up, I've got a confirmation email.  I'll go see if perhaps it hasn't charged my card yet.	Log into the bank and....wait...overdrafted.  Hmm...oh look I was charged for both the code I bought on the site that is invalid as well as the purchase I tried to make with my card through the store that gave me an error and told me it couldn't be completed.  Ok, so now I've moved money to my steam wallet, been charged twice from my bank account, and now we can add an overdraft charge...and I still don't have my turbine points.  What a fin day of gaming, so glad this is how I spent my day off.	Do yourself a favor, stay away from trying to support this game though purchases.  If you want to play for free, it's fine.  The game play holds up well.  But until they manage to fix the terrible system they use for purchases, just stay away.			"

												I sank a lot more in to this game pre-Steam. DDO remains the best online MMO experience using the D&D 3rd edition ruleset, and is really a great experience, despite the fact that it show it's age. However....after it went F2P it developed increasingly elaborate monetary systems, weird crafting rules and lots of freemiu options that often felt necessary but weere very costly unless a sale was on.  If you prefer soloing or can't find players....a real problem at times....then you need to spend money on henchmen, too; the game is more balanced now than ever for solo play compared to when it started, but forget trying to go it alone without a healer, for example. DDO is not perfect, and it's aged badly, and I dislike the cash shop's excessive prices (I never bought something if it wasn't on sale as a rule) but it's still an innovative MMORPG and the best such type of game D&D has ever been translated in to.

												A classicIt is bugged, and lacking in many areas, but honestly, its an MMO that keeps finding a way into my PC every now and then.Most non-RPers will not get my point here; somethings might cripple your experience, and the character creation, even though having a ""standard build"" option, might be very confusing unless you played DnD 3.5But if you did.... you'll get my point; the character creation is pretty much the same as the Tabletop version, and fighting against DnD allstars, like Trogs and Oozes, really keeps you insideOn the other hand, its not a 100% adaptation, because of obvious limitations; all of them, however, just makes the whole character build even more interestingBottomline, Id advise that you play this game at least once in your life, with a friend if possible; finish the intro storyline, and then play a bit more before dropping (if you end up dropping it, anyways)			"

Highly recommened to play it if you enjoy building your own character the way YOU want it, not the way developers made it. Oh, did i mention that you can multi-class in this game? not to mention epic destinies and bunch of other staff great staff?? :)In short, i love this game. the only downside is there is no unlimited open world like in WoW or Rift.

												It is actually more a Cooperative Online RPG than a proper MMORPG (You will only be playing with +5 in normal quests and +11 in raids, except for the city hub).The system has evolved quite a bit from pure 3.5 D&D, but still is based in it which is nice.Lots of freedom to build your character allowing to mix classes (you can copy online builds if you are weak and can't figure out yourself :p, honestly you will screw up your first characters but the proccess of creating your own build is very satisfaying in my opnion and one of the main reasons i played the game).It is kinda free, you have free quests to do (quests here are like self contained adventures, and not ""kill 20 rats and come back"")but of course, the best ones and with the nicest gear are paid only.Also some races and classes require some payment to unlock.Overall i loved my time playing this game, it was great fun once you find like minded people to play with.

												Dungeons & Dragons Online (DDO) plays sort of like a hack-and-slash game as opposed to a more turn-based ability-heavy MMO like WoW. You control your character with WASD as per the norm, with things like blocking and rolling available. Attacking is done by holding down the left mouse button, and items, abilities, and spells are used with whatever you decide to use them with, the default being the 1-0 number keys. Everything's in real time, though some spells, abilities, and other things can take a little while to cast.Easily the strongest part of DDO (and D&D) is the character customization. Want to make a melee mage? Go for it! Want to put some different caster in your caster, so you can cast while you cast? It'll be horribly gimpy, but go for it! Aside from alignment restrictions (Barbarians and Bards can't be Lawful, Monks must be Lawful, Paladins must be Lawful Good, Druids have to be Neutral) and the fact that you can't be an evil alignment, you can do whatever you want. Generally, any character you build (unless you want a 19 Barbarian/1 Wizard to cast spells offensively or something else silly like that) can get through quests fine if you play, gear, etc. well, though some will obviously struggle, and it'll likely be very difficult to play through higher difficulties and raids with a gimpy character. You also might get weird looks in parties, and perhaps even some rejections, but making your own party for like-minded people is easy.It should be noted, though, that DDO works significantly differently than D&D, and many of the things in D&D (horseback riding, climbing, spell slots, multiple attacks per round, etc.) had to be changed. You don't have a set number of spells per day; there is instead a mana system, though the mana doesn't recharge on its own and you need to use a rest shrine (in place of resting anywhere with the possibility of being ambushed in D&D) or extremely rare potions to restore it. Casters can cast a lot more spells than in D&D, and since this was one of the main drawbacks of casters in D&D, casters tend to be more powerful than melees in DDO for large portions of the game. A lot of skills in D&D (horseback, crafting, tumbling, probably most of them, actually) had to be changed significantly or removed to fit into DDO. Numbers in generally are significantly inflated in DDO (to help fit the real-time combat so you don't just die instantly when beset by two kobolds at level 1), so don't be surprised to see people getting 1k or more HP by level 28.The game world is completely instanced; instead of running about vast landscapes (though there are some of those, I'll go over them in the next paragraph) like other MMOs, you talk to NPCs to take quests, then go to the entrance of the quests and are whisked away to wherever the quest is in an instance that is completely separate from everything else in the world and only you and your party can enter. There are currently close to 400 quests, each with their own different dungeons (though some use the same dungeon in a slightly different way), and each quest has its own objectives that you must complete in order to finish it. Most of the quests are generally fairly static (as in not random), though almost all of them have optional objectives, secret areas, and things like that. Some of them have multiple ways to reach the end and some have multiple ways to finish the quest, though for the most part there's a clearly defined objective and one or a few different ways to get there. Quests are generally available in 4 difficulties (Casual, Normal, Hard, Elite), though some aren't. Raids, for instance, don't have a Casual difficulty.Speaking of raids, there are currently 17 of them, ranging from level 6 to level 24. They're all fairly unique, though I don't have enough MMO experience to be able to compare them to other games. Some of them are rarely ran, though if you're patient or have friends/guildmates you can do any of them.There also exists things called Challenges. These are timed pseudo-quests, where you have a certain objective you must complete in order to complete the challenge, and then 5 optional objectives that give you a higher score and more rewards.There are also Explorer Areas, which are more traditional MMO areas that are open and have various things to do and explore inside them. They have XP rewards for finding certain areas, killing monsters, and killing rare monsters, and often house the entrances to quests.In terms of endgame, at this moment, there isn't much. You can True Reincarnate your character, which recreates it at a lower level with some benefits (mostly passive things, though there are active ones). If you go from level 20 back to level 1 (there's also an option to go from 28 to 20) with this, you can create a completely brand new character of any class and race, though some things (like your name) remain the same. Other than that, there are currently no raids at the level cap (though there are many below it), so I would avoid blowing through everything to get to the level cap, and instead go slowly, play all kinds of characters, and try out all the content. This will hopefully change in the near future, as the plans are to increase the level cap to 30 and stay there to develop an end-game.The community is relatively small, but still quite active. Finding groups can be a challenge, but if you create your own you'll most often at least get a few other people to come along. Even if you can't find people, soloing is very much doable for almost all of the game's content (though some will be extremely difficult or require you to use and abuse certain things to finish), even including some of the game's raids. There are also hirelings, which are NPCs you can buy and bring with you into dungeons. These are mostly useful for healing, either for yourself or to keep critical NPCs alive in quests, though the other hirelings can be useful. The game scales its difficulty based on your group size and composition, sometimes to a fault; it can sometimes be harder to do something in a group than by yourself.As far as content restrictions for free players, they're not too terrible. There are more details on this topic here: http://ddowiki.com/page/Account_comparisons. There are about 120 free quests (see here: http://ddowiki.com/page/Guide_to_Free_to_Play) and challenges can be played once per day per character for free. 4 of the game's 8 races are free to play, though one of them (Drow) is easily unlocked through play. 9 of the game's 13 classes are free as well, with 2 unlockable through play (though both of them require you to unlock/buy plenty of quests to do so). In addition, completing quests and challenges will earn you Turbine Points (TP) over time which can be used to unlock quests, classes, races, extra benefits like starting characters at level 4, or various consumable and cosmetic items. It's certainly more stingy than more recent F2P games like Path of Exile where most things or even everything is given to players for free and only cosmetics can be bought, but it's not an unreasonable system.On the whole, I'd recommend anybody at least give DDO a try (after all, it is free to play). It's certainly not for everyone, and there are issues abound, probably more than most big MMOs, but it can be a lot of fun. Don't be put off by the early questing, too; a lot of the early quests are sort of samey, featuring the same enemy and environment types. It's not until level 3-5 quests (depending on what you have available) that they start to get really interesting and unique.			"

												Dungeons and Dragons.  Every geek and nerd (myself included) who grew up playing this on tabletob, with a bunch of frends, Mountain Dew, and Cheeto and Dorito dust encrusted hands, knew exactly how fun it was.  Now it's online.  And, better yet, IT'S FREE!The game can be played as a loner (without a group), but the higher levels you gain, the easier and more fun it is as a group.  Plus, if you enjoy the RP side (what made D&D spectacular), there are plenty of players who love to keep in character.The quests range from easy to OMFG GET ME OUT OF HERE NOW!  All are fun, and all definitely have that D&D feel.The tutorial at the beginning when you first start is helpful and recommended.The controls are also pretty user friendly.Give it a try.  If you love D&D and love online games, DDO is for you.			"

												I have a very mixed opinion i must say of one of my favorite games of all time. It's been a great time sink for roughly 5 years and a beautiful landscape to hack my way through. Software and all has never been a problem aside from one very notable change to the launcher. but i must say THE PLAYER BASE IS DYING :( and the Dev's/company and all seem to be neglecting it. I have a petition link ill post below if you'd love to give your opinion and sign for a better and hopeful DDO community(Dev's and ourselves included) after all isn't DDO meant to be family ? http://www.thepetitionsite.com/868/808/989/help-fix-a-broken-and-corrupt-ddo-/#updated(If, posting a petition link isn't advised and against the rules i apologize and will remove said link also if you are hesitant to click on it due to obvious safety and all of your PC i understand.

												It is actually more a Cooperative Online RPG than a proper MMORPG (You will only be playing with +5 in normal quests and +11 in raids, except for the city hub).The system has evolved quite a bit from pure 3.5 D&D, but still is based in it which is nice.Lots of freedom to build your character allowing to mix classes (you can copy online builds if you are weak and can't figure out yourself :p, honestly you will screw up your first characters but the proccess of creating your own build is very satisfaying in my opnion and one of the main reasons i played the game).It is kinda free, you have free quests to do (quests here are like self contained adventures, and not ""kill 20 rats and come back"")but of course, the best ones and with the nicest gear are paid only.Also some races and classes require some payment to unlock.Overall i loved my time playing this game, it was great fun once you find like minded people to play with.

												good game but with A LOT of corporative greed, gets VERY repetitive since the only way to ""play"" is by closed dungeonsyou can only play their premade content and if you are bored you have to buy their dungeons.""but hey, you can play free without spending any dime on the store, since you earn turbine points for favor""^^^^this is the biggest lie ever^^^^ask anyone who is higher than lvl 20 if he is premium... why? becuse in order to get the best stuff you have to buy the dungeon packs  in which they are.oh and btw, remember the favor-grind stuff? it is limited to 1000 points (and THAT if you grind across the 8 servers)they focus more on launching premium content than they do on free oneMY ADVICE: Play ""Rift"" if you want something similar and not a PAYWALL'd experience becuse you are forced to either grind favor for half of the game content or pay cash for it.

												The mother of them all... the orginal, start and birthplace of fantasy games...Dungeons & Dragons. I remember playing this in my uncles basement, rolling die and imagining the beholders and kabolds. Now, I just click click to make a halfling rogue in 2 minutes, then makeing the same character sheet in 30. Times have changed. With free to play abilities D&D is a great game to play. Start from choosing class and race and a rather very in depth face creation hub and your off.  Start with a races human, halfling, elf, dwarf, half -elf, half -orc, warforged with the classes rogue, ranger, artificer, warlock, sorceror, paliden, fighter, barbarian, mage. With a straight foward ''quests lead to a dungeon'' and beat the dungeons with plenty of trainers and merchants around the game. It isn't very difficult to get the hang of. Like its tabletop version, you are pretty much an adventurer off to clear dungeons looking for epic loot. The quests and coupled dungeons do sometimes have a rather good sence of humor to it witch makes for a good read and laugh. The aspect of booby traps and puzzles within the game, in witch you need to use ''example'' my rogues search or disable trap abilities, was rather fun and challanging. The free to play aspect though does get limited as in higher levels you need to unlock along with dungeon/quests of that level. That makes for a lot of stuck between levels grinding for free to play players. Then just getting stuck. Is it a good run until then? YES  but, then the DLC is kinda needed. The graphics are decent with an oldschool feel to it where you can even  change the color of your dice and hubs for custimization. The music is spot on also to what you would expect of the fantasy world and areas. For the nostalgic and those that dont mind throwing some money at to progress.			"

												As I am new to online pc gaming (aside from Secondlife) (although not new to gaming on console) I find that I really enjoy playing DDO as I can play by myself if I choose or along with others. There are many quests and challenges to choose from or I can just wander around aimlessly and meet new friends without time limits. The game play is pretty easy to figure out, even for someone who knew absolutely nothing of how to use any of the inventory items or how to do any moves.  Within a couple hours I was running around with a few quests under my belt, some money and didnt look so noobish which was a wonderful thing. I recommend this game and I look forward to my online gaming experiences in this and other games.			"

												All around not a bad MMORPG yes there are better ones out there but this one gives you a feel of the classic games from back in the day yes there are issues with it with no games perfect and yes it is free to play which means you get the basic low standard treatment compared to players who are premium players but once you get off the tutorial island the game kicks off, it does take some grinding to start getting the good gear if you dont feel like paying for it but that just adds to the general aura of the classc games, the more you play the better gear you get. If your new at this i reccomend trying to group up with other players, there are constant invites at the beginning from other new and old players to join their guild and its a good idea, it makes the dungeons more fun and gives a sense of teamwork that most players look for when playing online games			"

												I do recommend this game.  I'm a age-old D&D fan, and the flexibility of this game to make the character you want, change classes, vary weapons, etc... it's just awesome.  The dungeons and combats are much more unique than most other MMO's I've played (still not as great as solo games where you are the center of the universe)... but hey, you can play it with friends which is cool.  I was worried about the reviews, expecially the costs... but some of the posts are dated and no longer accurate.  For instance, it doesn't cost any $ to level up.  I'm now about level 8, and finally blew $35 on the game and don't really plan on spending more... that might mean I top out and don't get to the highest levels, but I don't plan on playing more than a year.  If you do go the Free to play option, I highly do NOT recommend spending any $ until you get to be level 6 or higher.			"

												I mean, I'm not very far in, but the gameplay and class building aspect are great.HOWEVER, the character creation is abhorrent. Each race is limited to pretty much one face, and you have an option of 3 noses, a few lips, and about 20 ugly hair styles. All of the eyes for the elf race are slanted up at a ridiculous angle. You cannot alter the character's age.If character creation is a dealbreaker, don't get this.If you don't mind, once you get past it the game is pretty great.(I personally like Neverwinter better, plz dont hurt me)			"

												The game is still fun, and it still has good people who also have fun with it. And the prenium account is cheap at 15 bucks a month, and cheaper than that if you do bundles. Sure it lags a little, and they added astral shards as a cunrency you have to buy with real money, but all MMO games have that now. And all MMO games lag once in a while. That's right, all of them. And most MMOs are free to play, even elderscrolls online is going free to play this summer making Eve the only pay to play mmo still out there that I know of and that is a perma death space game. "

												To anybody who's played an mmorpg with an annoying game launcher that made you download even more stuff after installing the game? Yeah... you get the idea.This is a pretty well made rpg game. It's got all the aspects that an rpg should have(including F2p and a premium subcriber service). Yeah kinda peeved at that because like 75% of the content ingame is P2P and the F2P stuff get's kinda boring after you grind in them for 100000000000000+ hours. Also the launcher is a little annoying on the update system as it downloads a lot of stuff if your not on for a month or something like that.Not trying to hate on the game, it has some great things like clever item systems with multiple slot enchantments and items(doesnt sound like any other rpg game...). Fun quests(for the first time you play them). and a lot of zones(Which will take you years to reach because your too underleveled).Ok let's get specific. At the start of your game you get to create a character. First off some of the races and classes are locked because you need a premium account to use them. and the only decent looking character i could make was human(granted I always play human, but other games really built a solid image of what else should look like and DDO kinda breaks it). Second It takes forever to level up. They have a rank system where like every 5 ranks you level up, so in reality level 2 is more like level 10 and getting levels only come from a massive amount of grinding. So be warned rushers who expect to get final level in the like the first week of the game. Commit to the game and you might actually get the level 3 in a month. In the starter areas you get a lot of the story, but after, it just gets harder and harder to find all the details. As you continue there is less and less voice acting and dialogue in the quests. And the quests, Quests are dungeon based so you cant's just enter and leave them freely, so it is kinda annoying and takes a lot of your time to complete. If you do leave you get an XP penalty or something like that. And since there are so few F2p quests/dungeons you have to keep regrinding them to get XP.The combat is pretty fun, different enemy types have different resistances and slimes even break weapons faster. Item decay is something you have to worry about. you can fix them or just ignore them until your UBER GREATSWORD +7123 breaks because you were too lazy to unequip to fight a blob of jello. Combat animations were pretty cool, but got pretty silly after a while. There are always specific weapons that restricted like foreign weapons that your character needs to have a certain loadout to use and skillpoints gained on every rank to advance your character skill tree, except it get's really confusing especially if you multi-class with like 6 different skill trees and only like 2 points to spend. The abilites are easy to use if you know how to use hot-keys.Now onto the life of a subscriber. If your willing to put in the money, it can be a really fun experience, you get more Xp special areas and quests that are completely restricted to the ""F2p Peaseants""(A.K.A 97% of the earth's population). you get easier access to pets, guilds, items, and cosmetic stuff. Only after you dump your life savings into the game on a monthly basis though, So go be the 3% and get the right to say that you did spend hundreds of $$$ on a fake game.So to sum it up, either be a commited and persistent person and spend the rest of your life trying to reach level 10 or go be a premium member and do a life's work in 10 minutes with the power of cash and P2W Psychology.4/10 would grind for days again			"

												Such a shame, over the years from nov 9th 2009 to sometime in may of 2015 I played this game almost religiously. Tried to get back into it today (6/17/2016) and it is just so..pathetic now. They changed random loot to be completely screwed, adding gnomes, and just all around making the game worth less than..worthless. Don't waste your time, certainly don't waste your money. If anything else we should boycott the game and give it a proper burial. Great in it's time..but now it is dated...So poorly dated. What was once a five star rated game by me...I can't even justify giving it one star.A toxic communityPoor credit card securityLaggy, bugs, and riddled with exploits.Dungeons are just bland races to the finish.Poor sound qualityAwful visual quality even in high def max graphic settingsGnomesI seriously can't think of a single good thing about what was once my favorite game...FU devs you've ♥♥♥♥ing ruined it.

												This is a very fun game, unfortunately, it is not much for multi-player. This is a downside for me as I thought it was an actual MMO, but turns out you can solo everything. But even with that problem, it is still a very fun and engaging game, worth the download if hacking and slashing is what you enjoy. If your a die-hard roleplayer, avoid this game. You won't find ANY roleplay at all going on.			"

												It has its fun moments. Servers are practically dead, same bugs are around that have been around since launch (stuck on ladder, rubberbanding, failed potion usage due to lag or rubberbanding makes it go onto cooldown) their servers use dial-up which causes massive bouts of lag and more rubberbanding. Wheloon prison is a joke, great story, but to make things ""difficult"" they just throw hordes of enemies at you that deal massive damage and can take massive damage. Throw that in with their ""too many enemies notice you so you are slowed down"", attack penalties, movement penalties, etc, until you kill half of them off.While also in Wheloon prison, Shadar-kai Assassins can just spam their AoE weapon that slows, reduces attack speed, attack damage, etc, etc and stacks up to 8 times causing nothing challenging, just a pain in the ♥♥♥ of a grind fest. They made this particular expansion just to milk more money from players to use special ""microstransaction"" healing items and ressurrection items due to the length of the quests, no one wants to start all over in that ♥♥♥♥.In short, game can be fun, but avoid their ""expansion packs"" as they're just trash horde spawning messes.Stick with the core game if you plan to play. I'll continue to play, but I don't recommend this to anyone that hasn't already invested time or money.Did I mention they removed Mithril and Adamantine armors from random loot because the developers are too lazy to fix a really old issue with them?It is currently possible to get an item from random loot that has a +0 modifier to it.

												I wanted to like this game , I really wanted to love this because I adore the DND tabletop games I was looking forward to explore the DND world and have fun.However as I slowly found out that most of my time with the game is waiting of it to start ( much of the time recorded is just me waiting for it to start up or load the game world or move to a new area) Sometimes the game crashes when entering a new area and I have to start up the game again and all progress lost!Not only that but I soon found myself spending most of my time playing the same quests over and over again to get the exp for the good dungeons but most of the interesting ones are behind a pay wall or need more then one person to be workable without dying a million times.The grinding wore out all the enjoyment I have when I started playing this game together with the crashes and the long wait times I just could not go on.I will stick to the table top games ,at least your team mates can't pretend that you don't exist or worse troll you.

Very poor execution - the way it should work, lik e99% of other Steam Games, is you download it, install it, launch it, set up account through the launcher an play. For some reason they have it set up where you don't get a key or a sub automatically, you have to request one through their support site.

I would personally reccomend just making a character sheet and playing through either Steam chat, Tabletop Simulator, Skype, IRL, etc. That way you can play D&D and have more freedom with making your character.

												Your enjoyment of the game will be entirely dependent on having a good group to work with. Unless you're able to get into the game with people who are also starting fresh (or willing to make new characters and allow you to play a role you find interesting) you will not enjoy this game at all. There is virtually nothing you can do solo in this game; you NEED to be in a party of several people to accomplish almost anything beyond level 3.Overall the game feels incredibly slow paced and is clearly outdated. Even setting aside the graphics, there are numerous bugs that feel like they just shouldn't exist in a game that has been around this long. Expect to have to restart the client at least once every couple of hours due to one issue or another. Nothing about this game flows together nicely.The amount of free content is minimal, at best; you will end up having to grind quests just to continue leveling up, and the interface is littered with frequent reminders of the things you could pay for. Unless you have a VIP subscription ($10/month) you will have only about five quests you can do per level, which will not offer you enough experience to advance, forcing you to redo them for even less XP than you earned the first time. The only workaround is being carried  through the game by someone 2-3 levels above you who can unlock quests on a higher difficulty, but then you'll be doing little more than watching them solo the dungeon. It's not fun, and you'll never catch up to a point where you can actually start having fun with them.			"

												I've played DDO for about five years, and I still enjoy it as much as I did when I first started. I took a break for about a year and tried Neverwinter because a few friends liked it, but never really got into it. DDO has a lot more depth for a F2P MMORPG, with many classes and races, a variety of combinations to customize and multiclass characters, numerous quests both free and premium, a decently sized and fun community, and finally, what really keeps me compared to other MMORPGs... The ability to play almost entirely F2P through the whole game (the exceptions would be Menace of the Underdark and Shadowfell Conspiracy, which are both worth paying for, in my opinion, giving you new classes and access to new quests in the continent of Faerûn). Thanks to the Favor Point system, you can get Turbine Points to buy new quest packs just by playing free quests! It can get a bit grindy, yes, but that's the incentive to get you to contribute to the game with purchases. The only thing the game lacks is up to date graphics, but this game is a decade old and that has to be expected. Overall, fun game but it can be difficult to get a hang of! (Also, try the server Sarlona, and AVOID Wayfinder, if you want to play with other people)			"

												I would highly recommend this game to anybody looking for an addictive RPG experience with friends. HOWEVER:1. Although it doesn't have  price tag it truly costs a lot if you're actually going to enjoy the experience. There are only like 15 dungeons that are F2P and if you grind them too much they give you an experience penalty.2. Character Customization: A small nitpicks, but truly disturbing, as the elves are twice as ugly as they should be, don't even get me started on the halflings, humans are fine I guess.3. Movements/Action: My character looks really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when I dual wield, and that's highly disturbing to me, as I am a bard. I mean, anybody who plays this game can tell you that the animations for the game's combat phase? Not very top notch.			"

												Im sorry but i really gave this game a chance... first thing i have to say is this game is like a sterotipical mmo except guess what you have to click and hold the mouse or assign a auto attack button to even fight someone not to mention after that entire fight the only way you get any type of loot is if a treasure bag is dropped... aka you get some stupid quest based loot. So basically you fight and get nothing until you come upon a magical chest convieniently placed at the end of a dungeon. On top of that there is no open world just ""combat zones"". You work through a combat zone to discover dungeons but guess what dungeons and combat zones work the same. Im sorry but compared to DND at its absoulte prime aspect this games blows ♥♥♥♥. Action rpg sure but honestly its more like click on things and hope to god you swing your sword at them. Really you mean to tell me a DND game is completely based on treasure chests and crates and vases? So i kill lets say 15 humanoids and not a single one can you take their armous or weapons let alone misc gear such as food or potions. Bessssssttttt part of all is looting for example if you try to loot a single item off the ground you are required to click on it. Try clicking on a item that is sitting under two bodieds and a broken crate its ♥♥♥♥ing impossible.Oh i feel like i forgot something.... oh yeah the DDO store. Ive played many mmos in my time but i have to say none of them is as much pay to play as DDO. You want good gear well good luck. You will run a dungeon 3000 times before you get the gear anywhere near the gear you have to pay actualy money to get. A video game that has any feature where actual currency in real life can be exchanged for anything in game is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. Why spend hours playing is joe shmo can pay 200 bucks and be hundreds times better than you? gaaaayyyyy. i cant believe i spent the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time downloading this game			"

												I bought this game when it came out and level cap was about 5 or something. I have gone back to it several times over the years, as apart from DM'd NWN stuff it is for me one of the best dungeoneering adventure game experiences on a computer.Caters to people who want to min max or casually enjoy some fun adventures without the need to devote hours to each session unless you want to. From the first little adventures to the epic stuff it is a class act with friends or solo. There have been many changes and power levels are pretty extreme as you'd expect in a game of this age, there are a lot of systems, craftings, grindy bits etc which can be intimidating but to be honest they aren't required unless after joining in on the ultimate challenge levels (I haven't), and you can find challenge in many other ways in the game - but more importantly you can find a boatload of fun adventures.It is worth your time and your money - the adventure system used with its narration was a genius touch at the time and is more satisfying than the story modes a lot of later MMOs used - adventures are group instances so may not be your thing, but if you like small co-operative adventuring it was made at a time people were mad for MMOs and it shows, and it has developed a huge amount of content of differing types. The combat and adventure skills are great too. Not flashy, but just right and allowing for a huge diversity of character builds - both effective and erm, flavour. It doesn't handhold but there are websites which can answer just about any question you could ask so not an issue and people are helpful.A great game.			"

Won't Reccommend. why? because this is a steam review.Also, because of this, having a Steam based forum is pointless, especially seeing as how there's a recorded level of less than 200 players averaging most servers originating on steam.(This title should be removed from Steam completely)I'd probably say go with anything else outside of the DnD franchise.not many players. pretty dead. mostly solo focused. get repetitive and boring fast.also, extremely pay to win and overpriced for everything.the game is old.very. old.and glitchy, b/c its never been properly updated.in short, just a warning, you'll be wasting over 10 gigs of precious hard drive space for something you'll probably never play.This is the only time I'll say, for what it'll take to get the same gaming experience, Just go for World of Warcraft. its cheaper.seriously. its way cheaper than this Freemium scam of a game. you can't even do most of the quests without buying your way into it.the controls are very clumsy. and the graphics, even on highest settings feel wasted by the choppy gameplay and clumsy controls. again, If i were to use World of Warcraft as an example, and trust me... I hate WoW and quit it after level 80 in wotlk, i'd have to give more credit to WoW as an MMO.there's other MMO's on steam with a larger player base.another annoyance: you have to log into a server first before you can see what characters you have saved onto it. if you forget.... you'll have a fun time of starting/closing your game.actually, another game I'll actually reccomend over this is Warframe. sure, its not medevial or magical, but you'll have a better overall gaming experience with it.Edit:This game has some of the worst... and I mean WORST customer service I've ever seen in the history of all the games I've ever played and had to troubleshoot something out of.Have you ever had to deal with that one customer service rep who actually asks stupid things like ""is your computer turned on? is it plugged in?"" to that level of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ INEPT... wow. just wow. 3 weeks later, still e-mailing back and forth with them, including one supervisor, and two other department heads. averaging about one response a week, following up reporting two csr's not even reading their tickets.Run by WarnerBrotherGames, they also have no interest in ever linking thier purchases to Steam Wallet. they cheat steam by intentionally disabling the page for buying with steam from their in game store.have a glitch? good luck. forums are moderated by trolls who will do thier best with lines likeoh, you have to phone steam to fix your problem!(steam support has no phone number)uninstall. and please, steam, REMOVE THIS ♥♥♥♥ FROM YOUR GAMES.

I don't really see much difference in the early levels.I read the wiki, and it looks like they gimped f2p even more--no more 32-point builds?  No thanks.   The game is fun, but having to grind each dungeon like 3, 4x to unlock something that shouldn't be locked in the first place.  Also, I see the game is still buggy, and some D&D rules are, like... what?  You're honestly better off with some sort of G+ hangouts/chatroom and diceroll generator and playing tabletop with people online.			"
