AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Grotesque Tactics: Evil Heroes Original Release: 2010 Genre Tags: RPG; Strategy; Turn-Based; Parody  My Overall Grade: B Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 10-20 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Casual gamersREVIEWThere aren't many grid-style movement, tactical, turn-based RPGs like this.  There is a good handful, but by no means are there many compared to other similar genres.  This is a pretty great game if you are a huge fan of the genre in search of new games to try.  If you aren't that big of a fan of the genre, then this may not be a good game for you.  The thing is: this game is technically a parody RPG, and lacks depth in many areas.  However, ironically, it still winds up being a pretty good game in the genre it is trying to parody, even though it is simple and minimalistic.You need to go into the game understanding it's supposed to be simple and whimsical, and then you can enjoy it for what it is.Grotesque Tactics: Evil Heroes doesn't have very much depth in the departments of tactics or RPG elements, which many other games in the genre do have.  Each character is a set ""class"" and only learns 2 ""spells.""  And there is only really one set of weapons/armor for each character that you acquire through the game.  The story is linear and there are no choices. And since all the characters have a set class with set abilities, it takes a lot of the tactical aspects of party formation out of the game; but you still have to plan your actions on the battle-grid accordingly. So there are still some tactical decisions to be made, just far less than is typical in the genre. But even with this lack of depth, the game is still charming in its own right.  The characters and narrative progression are purposefully cliché and it works out in a charming way.  And the graphics and soundscape are fitting with the game; nothing jaw dropping but nothing jarring. The result is an overall presentation that is sarcastically atmospheric and endearingly casual.So even though this game is just a ""parody,"" and therefor is simplistic compared to others in the genre— it is a welcome addition to a small list of games to a true fan of an amazing genre. The game is just fun, simply, especially to a fan of the genre itching for a novel experience.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Grotesque Tactics, developed by an indie German studio by the name of Silent Dreams in a joint venture with Headup Games, is a turn-based strategy game in the same vein as Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre, or any of the other hundreds of games with ""Tactics"" tacked on to the title. But let me clear the air here: unlike the aforementioned games, Grotesque Tactics is bad. Not ""bad"" as in Big Rigs: Over The Road Racing bad, but more like ""all I wanted for Christmas was a Nintendo 3DS but all I got was a Nokia N-Gage"" type of bad. You know, the type of disappointment you get when you are hyped up on all the good things, but are let down on every level. The plot is nothing to write home about. There are no plot twists, no overly-emotional scenes, nothing. Just you and your party against an evil empire. You play Drake, a drop-out from the Glory Military Academy. By a stroke of luck, the very fact that you were the only dropout in the history of the academy has saved you from death in battle at the hands of the Dark Church (the aforementioned evil empire). Being mopey and emo (and yes, the game makes use of ""emo"" way too much), Drake finds the courage to fight back against the Dark Church with the help of the Semidivine Holy Avatar, the stereotypical ""I'm better than you, and women love me"" beefcake of the game. Together, you and Holy scour the world rescuing maidens, recruiting party members, and completing side-quests. Like I said before, it's nothing to write home about. On that note, I should mention the writing. I'm guessing Silent Dreams hired a 16-year old high-school dropout to translate the game for them, because even though the game has had an extensive grammar overhaul for the English version, the writing would make even a first-year college student cringe in terror. Grammar and spelling mistakes abound, and any hint of humor the game wanted to convey has been lost due to the horrid translation. For example, Candy, one of the three maidens you rescue and recruit, constantly says ""Hihihihihi"" instead of ""Hehehehehe"" or *giggles*. The only thing that would make that worse is if Navi from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was put in the game and constantly said ""HEY! LISTEN!"" every ten seconds. But even then I would have fond flashbacks to my time playing an infinitely-better game. Grotesque Tactics just makes me want to punch babies. And then there's the humor. I'd like it to be known that humor is NOT universal; it is purely subjective. Unfortunately, the game is billed as a parody of other great games. If anything, Grotesque Tactics is a parody of computer game designing. There is a difference between parodying a game and simply referencing a game, and Grotesque Tactics references the hell out of other games. The humor is extremely in-your-face, much like playing an interactive version of the Meet The Spartans movie. While it's not as ham-fisted as UnEpic, at least UnEpic is a good game. The entire cast is a tragedy upon game design. The main character is an emo who isn't really emo all that much except in certain combat situations, the supporting character is the stereotypical knight-in-shining-armor with sunglasses, the rogue is a goblin who joins you because you killed his buddies, and various other travesties. Oh, and if any reader of this review is black and you want to see how German game developers portray black people, play this game. The only way the token black dude could get more stereotypical is if he had fried chicken in one hand and purple drank in the other. Yes, this is what Silent Dreams considers a parody. Sad, is it not? From the moment you boot up the game, you can already tell you're in for a world of hurt. The pre-game loading screen features Holy Avatar and the three maidens, but the whole thing looks like it was made in Poser. Then the game starts and the Poser-like art is replaced by anime character portraits. Holy is pretty much the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of the group, while the three maidens and other female characters are in various states of undress. Let's not forget that while you are rescuing said maidens to recruit them, they are screaming about getting their clothes torn off. The character interaction, combined with the almost-ecchi artwork makes me believe that this game is the lead designer's attempt at a VERY bad self-insert fanfiction rather than a clever satire of RPGs. And finally we come to the meat and potatos of the game: the gameplay. As I've said before, it's a clone of the various Tactics games you see or have seen on the market. Turned-based strategy on a battlefield with positioning. Nothing new, so let's move into what makes Grotesque Tactics stand out from the crowd (other than the sad attempt at German humor). The really big thing about the game is the Obsession system. The game flat-out tells you in the tutorial that this is a limit break (I'm guessing Silent Dreams' thought process was ""LOLOLOLOL! I MADE A FINAL FANTASY 7 REFERENCE! LAUGH, PEONS! LOLOLOLOL!""). Each character has their own way of increasing their Obsession, from hitting stuff (Drake) to getting hit (EVERY SINGLE PARTY MEMBER). Each Obsession does their own unique thing, but more often than not it involves the obsessed party member attacking another party member. West goes berserk, attacking anything in range (friendly or not), the maidens and the angel simply attack a party member, the goblin rogue blinds everyone in a radius (again, no thoughts to friendly fire) and warps to Holy, and Drake buffs nearby party members' attack rating but at the cost of halving his attack rating a few turns afterwards. Drake is obviously the most benefitial of the party, but that's not saying much considering everyone else is geared toward screwing you over. Inside combat, you control all characters in order based on their agility. Outside of combat, however, you can only control Drake while the others automatically follow him. This works out fine, except for one major game-breaking bug that was the straw that broke the camel's back for me: Afflictions aren't removed once combat is over. In the battle leading up to getting the mage party member, West went berserk due to his Obsession. I ended combat right next to a treasure chest in a narrow 1x1 area in the forest with West blocking the only exit in or out. Since he was technically still berserk, he refused to move, and I cant move through party members. Needless to say, I was stuck and had to reload the entire damn mission. Have I told you yet how much I hate this game? And lastly, I come to the deal breaker: the camera. Or, rather, the automatic camera panning. Any time there is dialogue or a character is moving, the camera will pan to that character. This isn't such a big deal if the damn thing would actually CENTER on said character. Instead, it trails behind a moving character. Trying to manually compensate for this means your camera goes out of whack and ends up 50 feet in some random direction. Again, this wouldn't be such a big deal if we could turn automatic camera panning off, or if movement outside of combat wasn't in real time. Alas, no on both accounts. This will, more often than not, lead to clicking the wrong square or giving you a fit of nauseua.			"

												Pros:+Cliché moments and references to movies and games.+A lot of humor and adult references (if you know what I mean, wink wink).+Tactical RPG (similarity to those of Final Fantasy Tactics, XCOM, Silent Storm, etc.).+Bright and colorful – rather detailed on some locations with the general environment.+The storyline fits the game and does so perfectly with the supported humor and complaining from your fellow party members (humorous complaining – if that makes any sense).+Custom Keybinds.+Music fits nicely with the game.+Graphics in my opinion are okay. I believe they could have polished it up more, but it wasn’t bad where I would quit a game on graphics alone. Cons:-UI could use some polish.-Controls at times may feel wonky when moving the character at the same time when moving the camera (The game tries to pull you towards the hero when you’re trying to scout ahead of your movements).-A linear storyline-Not a lot of RPG elements (not a lot of spells, certain amount of armor/weapons, no manual stat gains – done automatically).The game is supposed to be a fun, goofy experience about a hero that is to save the kingdom from an evil sect. Sounds like your typical storyline for a RPG, right? Well… it is! I believe you could call it a parody to other TRPGs out there and they’re doing it in their own fun way (which I approve). The bantering between certain party members and towards you is comical (I’ve had my outbursts of laughs, not going to lie). The game isn’t to be taken seriously. If you are jumping into to this game and hoping for a serious TRPG, well, you might be disappointed and rant with a negative review on why this isn’t your cup of Joe. If you come in here knowing that this is a parody to other TRPGs, have a sense of humor, wanting to find humor in a title, then this game should fill your shoes. The battles aren’t rememberable, but they do the job. At times you may even question the actions of your party members and throw a rant at your monitor, but that is perfectly normal.  I’ve had my fair share with the ditzes and a directional figure. I’ve also had the occasional crash, but it didn’t happen till after a 5 hour or longer gameplay session; I’m assuming a very slow memory leak…? If you save often then this issue won’t be an issue – besides, who doesn’t save often on a RPG anyways?Overall, this was a nice game to stumble onto and I find the humor and cliché moments very well done. I don’t see a lot of TRPGs and if you’re trying to find one yourself, I would recommend buying this one when you can!			"

Product received for free
IntroductionGrotesque Tactics: Evil Heroes is developed by Headup Games and Silent Dreams and while being published by Headup Games. The game really manages to tackle quite a few gaming tropes with sincere humor.  GameplayThe first game in the Grotesque Tactics series hasn’t really started on the right foot. It’s an RPG/TBS hybrid alright. The gameplay mechanics were doing their job as intended but the first thing that strikes you is that for a relatively dialogue rich video game, it has zero voice acting and far too many silent cutscenes. Colors are a bit on the saturated side so you better tweak that from the in-game setting ASAP. Frame rate drops, check. Random crashes, check. So why on Earth would I still give this game a 6 out of 10? Because its one hell of a fun ride. Stereotypical RPG characters which are clear parodies of themselves constantly break the 4th wall (interacting with the player) and make pop culture references. To give you a brief picture, your party may contain an emo kid and a narcissistic knight surrounded by bikini-clad “damsels in distress”. Not your typical role playing game and the turn based combat is well balanced as well. So I can’t disregard the game’s unique twist and break from norm.Graphics are decent for 2010’s standards. It has aged well enough but my main gripe with this game is the inherent instability of its engine. I had to wait 3 minutes for the settings launcher to initiate (and you can’t skip this procedure when booting up the game) while I honestly thought it wouldn’t start at all, were it not for the fact that as a background process the aforementioned launcher was chewing 20% of my CPU output. From Task Manager I ended the process tree several times until curiosity urged me to wait and see what happens next. Indeed after 3 minutes of total boredom just staring at performance graphs, the thing finally launched and I was able to play the game. I reckon that it must be a Windows 10 issue, since there were others who complained about the slow booting of this title in the Steam Community Hub. So you need to know what you can expect. The UI is tiny indeed, if you run the game at 4K resolution so just stick with 2K or better yet, 1080p. Same scenario as with GRID, pressing the designated Steam screenshot button and taking screenshots, would occasionally cause CTDs or stop working at all. And no, not even rebinding the key, would fix the lingering issue with these two older titles. A Steam Overlay bug perhaps but still very annoying. A game that doesn’t allow me to nurture my affinity towards screenshots, is not gonna remain installed for very long on my system. Pros+ Features plenty of comic relief+ Decent combat mechanics+ Steam Achievements Cons- Several technical issues- No Steam Trading Cards- Slightly overpricedResult / Final thoughtsIf you find Grotesque Tactics: Evil Heroes in a well priced bundle, go for it. Perhaps you’ll be able to run it better if you’re on Windows 7 or lower. Frankly, if this game didn’t amuse me, I wouldn’t have recommended it at all. But its over-the-top characters squeezed a laugh or two out of me. Not an easy task.Rating 6/10 This review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA titles. "

												I wanted to like this game. I really did. The over the top parody involving a self-loathing hero, a self-adoring tag-along who thinks he is a stereotypical babe magnet and is in fact a stereotypical babe magnet, and a plethora of stereotypical babes sounds like a real winner. Trouble is, this parody tries to push every aspect of the game and genre only to feel as if it is a parody of itself when jokes fall flat or are taken far enough to no longer be funny. Meanwhile the gameplay is hindered by poor camera positioning and a system where battles drag on well beyond the point of enjoyment.The general ideas and foundation of the game are solid enough, but the execution leaves me underwhelmed. If you are not a strategy RPG fan, this game really has nothing to offer. Otherwise, it comes down to a matter of personal taste.			"

												Definitelly not as bad/buggy/dump as i expect. I regret 1$ fo McPixel more than 5$ for this. For sure not for everyone, but if you have sense of german/sexist/""politically not correct"" humour you can find it funny.+funny+special abilities of your heroes (with good chaining they are able kill each other even in battle ""for sure you are going to win"")-buggy (according to the forums im really fortunate that game crashed only once and 2-3 times i got stuck in combat mode)-unbalanced (final battles are insanely tough comparing to regular ones)-cant keep pace whole the time-default camera is evil (or is it game design?)-more loot, better RPG elemnts would be nice-start of each battle/pathfinding - all members of your group have avatar on the map, turn-based battle begins when someone of your group stands on field in area of sight of enemy, BUT during first round only heroes who have been seen can make their turns. so, thankfully to ""good pathfindig/game mechanics"" you can start battle with your healer and rogue agains 4-5 enemies, which means instant death for both of them.average small game, satirical turn-based RPG.Dont expect too much and you will enjoy it.

												This game has plenty about it to love.  I can tell that Silent Dreams really put a lot of care into developing this game.  It is a humorous game for sure.  The characters personalities are both realistic and mildly absurd at the same time.  The art style may be somewhat cutesy in places but the backgrounds really set the apropriate moods for each stage.  I thought that the artwork was truly beautiful.  It may not be the most challenging game in the world but some parts were hard enough to take multiple trys, revising my strategy each time.  The story was like a fractured fairy tale with dark humor that made the game a reason I will always be a fan of the people at Silent Dreams.			"

												If you want a fun story and don't care much about strategy or buggy graphics and awkard controls, this game is for you.However, if you like strategy games (as I do) stay away. The combat is heavily (and I mean heavily) based on luck, and can be frustrating to anyone who expects a strategy game to be based on strategy and tactics.			"

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Grotesque Tactics Evil Heroes 

			Views: 965		

			Grotesque Tactics Evil Heroes is a tactical turn based game the fist in a series available on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/46450/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your...		

	Grotesque Tactics is a turn-based strategy parody, that pokes fun of other standard RPG games.  The music is done very well, and keeps thepace and atmosphere of the game.  Each character represents some formof a classic hero; be it the warrior, archer, or mage, but does anexcellent job of augmenting the comedic aspects of each one.  	The controls and interface are sleek and well done, and I foundthe gear progresses with the player in a very balanced way.  Tactically, the game is good for a novice turn based strategist, but the story appeals to everyone.	One unique twist is the obsession meter, which when filled, thehero reacts in an unexpected way that may cause damage to anyone.  The combat is simple, but the dialogue is entertaining and intriguing.  	The characters and story parody other RPG's in an entertaining manner, and I enjoyed playing this game.  I never felt my time was wasted,and I can easily recommend this game.  This is a summary of what I talk about in the video,  I am a YT'er not a BloggerThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												What can i say about this game? It tries to be a comedy, and it's actually very funny.The history is very simple, the graphics aren't good, the battle system can be a little confusing, it has some bugs and crash from time to time.So, why am i recommending this game?Even with it's problems, this game is very fun to play.The characters are unique, different personalities, some based on stereotypes.There are jokes and references all around this game, Legend of Zelda, Super Mario, Lord of the Rings and others.If you don't care about the graphics and the gameplay looked interesting for you, you can give it a shot.Try looking for a discount or a bundle if you liked.

												I've played this game through twice.   I liked the humor, it's definitely a casual game.   People that are looking for a more complex game are going to find it lacking all sorts of depth.    The camera shifts that follow the party are annoying, but not detrimental.    I thought that the gameplay system that some people complain about was also a parody in and of itself.  Concerning the emo phases,  you just have to plan ahead, knowing at some point, looking at their meters, that they are going to enter into their various emo phases.   I found it added another dimension to the tactics, having to plan for that.  I picked this game with the second on sale,  I thought it was well worth the sale price.			"

												Yes, it is a roleplaying game. Yes, it has written over it that it's more an game irony... Thus you meet cosplayers ingame, and other weird people like a priestess, that didn't even know what her job is (healing people) and others. You start as a failed hero, that was beaten up by some mushrooms and you are on the brink of suicide because you are a total sucky warrior, that would happen to harm yourself more than your adversaries. Ok, you fumbled and fell, but did that really matter? The story is more bend on satiric fantasy on a very low level. However it can be fun to play. The question is, would I recomend this game? Yes, especially if you love funny games sidestepping the regular trashing and grinding endless monster hordes and giving some background about the deeper abysses of the genre. Including fanboys and *snort* (selfcensored for radical and very unsettling verbose denigration of ...). You'll become a true hero in the run of the game, someone who doesn't even care about how this adventure got started anyhow, and to whom groupies are a vital part of dungeon hero lifestyle. (Turns on ManOWar ""Pleasure Slave"")... But even though I like to laugh, I don't fancy that the developer tried to tickle me to death.			"

												I appreciate the effort, especially when there were almost no games of this type when this one came out, but Grotesque Tactics only manages to be entertaining for a couple of levels before the monotonous combat starts weighing it down.  There's really no depth to it and nothing else about the game was interesting enough to prevent me from getting bored and just dropping it.There are other gams that do tactical combat much better.

												This game is greatly underrated for a reason or another, while I do admit that the graphics are rather bad compared to some other games out there but really you do have to understand that this game is sold cheaply on Steam so you shouldn’t expect the graphics and functionality to be on the same level as Witcher or Final Fantasy. Also you have to keep in mind that this game is meant to be parody of RPG and JRPG genre which it does quite well and even if there is few bugs it was playable and funny. There were few dull moments sure, but what game doesn't have? After playing it a while I did find myself to be hooked and had to complete the story, so can bad game really hook you? I think not, because I have played some much worse than this and I did not get hooked.			"

												7/10This is a turn-based squad tactics game with easy-to-understand mechanics, and everything you'd expect from the genre in terms of classes, techniques, and so on.Where it stands out is in the quirky characters (For once you're not some fabled hero-with-the-right-birthmark or small-town boy sent on a quest by a weird uncle). The rag-tag bunch of misfits have to somehow muddle through, and do so with lavish doses of humour and sarcasm. Prepare to watch tropes shredded or inflated until they pop.			"

												Many other reviews have talked about the humor and technical issues you will experience with this game.  Based on those reviews you've either decided this game interests you or it doesn't.  For anyone still considering Grotesque Tactics: Evil Heroes, let my tell you why I would recommend it. What I appreciate about this game is it's casual nature.  Sure, I like games that provide a challenge, but every now and then I want something a bit more simple and less challenging, for example, something to play during lunch break.  The turn based aspect of this game, by its nature, means I can take my time to plan out my moves without penalty.  In normal difficulty the combat is just difficult enough to require that I think about what I am doing, but not so difficult that my party is constantly wiped.  Additionally, the game's generous resurrection mechanic means I don't have to be concerned if any of my party (except for one or two key members) are ""killed"" in battle.  While not super challenging, this does keep the story progressing and I find that important when my time is limited and I don't want to be fighting the same battle over and over again just to get to the next stage of the game.Equipment is also simplified.  There is only one type of weapon or armor for each class and whenever you buy/find a new piece, it is obvious if it is better, equivalent or worse than what you already own.  This may sound boring to min/max'ers, but is a welcome feature for those of us who want a nice, casual experience without a lot of complicated formulas.  Overall, Grotesque Tactics: Evil Heroes is a fun, entertaining game if you are looking for something that doesn't require a lot of deep, concentrated thought and doesn't expect to be taken too seriously.

												It doesn't have the greatest story in the world but that's kind of the point. Its meant to be a parody on the Fantasy RPG setting using a retro Tactics style gameplay.It lacks the depth of anything like Final Fantasy tactics. All the armor and weapons you come across will be direct upgrades. And the various items you get were mostly unnessessary. Every character on your team is a double edged sword. Each is a timebomb. Once a specific requirement is filled for each of them they go off and hurt anyone nearby. The key is to be aware of this waiting until their fuse has almost ended and position them so that they'll help you and hurt your enemies. It's very similar to Vandal Hearts of the PSX in that every character has a unique function and you always have your entire group with you at all times, All the equipment will always be direct upgrades, and there are no skill points or classes to allocate. It also lacks Vandal Hearts triangle combat system no weapon type has any advantage over any other. If you enjoy tactical RPG's and Vandal Hearts especially you may enjoy this aswell. It won't be the best Tactical RPG you've ever played but it's still a decent game in it's own right.			"

												So after beating the game, and feeling a bit let down on my experience, I find this little gem on the Store page:""In chess, a Grotesque is a problem or endgame study which features a particularly unlikely initial position, especially one in which White fights with a very small force against a much larger black army. Grotesques are generally intended to be humorous.""You know?  This is excatly what I needed to know before jumping into this game.  It's dated, it has major flaws, the art is meh most of the time and the few characters I do like don't get developed as much as I would hope for...  But it was indeed a fun game.  Fustrating at times, but fun when a battle that seemed unwinnable turned around at the final moment due to a crit or a close miss.  As the game suggest, your party is made up of anti-heros: as in, these guys don't know how to work together.  But even so, somehow it all works out in the end. (Pro tip: save the elixer of souls for the REAL final battle.)			"

												It lacks complexity and depth, and it lacks content. There's really no character development and areas are used several times for different scenarios. That being the case, it's still quite entertaining and very much worth the small price I paid for it. I'm definitely looking forward to more from these develpoers. I recommend it to anyone who can just enjoy a fun little game without expecting too much.			"

												This game... is a strange one. I am a major fan of JRPG's. This game makes fun of them in a good way. The combat is ok however, and that is it's one weakness imo. However, I understand that is my fault as a gamer. I am a completionist and wish to be as strong as possible, so I grind forever each battle since the story is linear and you can't go back to train/grind. I find the story funny and the characters add to this greatly, so I enjoy them both, and I can make it through the battles, but I just get somewhat bored with the combat for the aforementioned reason. I do recommend this game because it is fun and worth the money imo, but it just depends what kind of gamer you are. The grinding isn't fun, but I can tell this game wasn't made for that (even if it's mocking JRPG's).			"

												So far this game has proved to be a fun experience even with the simplistic style. The game is pretty funny at times and even smartly gives refences to other RPG style games. One I noticed was Shining Force. However sometimes the game is a little too predictable when it comes to the jokes, it's very cliche' and sometimes tries a little too hard. Now onto the gameplay, I have to say I quite like the style of gameplay however I sometimes find myself getting mad at the flow of the movement, there are quite a lot of invisible walls that could easily be walked on yet the game ignores. I noticed this greatly on a beautifully designed level which had a bridge connect to an island with a house on, I was hoping they'd hidden a chest on there but when you get to the bridge you can't walk across it. This of course is only a minor fault and more one of my irks with the game. I've also encoutered several bugs on the level I described with the bridge. One of them was a bug with the Angel character who was stuck in the same place throughout all the fights and exploration of the map. Of course this was a huge pain since she's the only healer so I instead had to use up most of my potions. On the same level as I got to the prison tower one of the female chocobirds glitched and repeatedly attacked all of my characters even after my main hero died. This happened twice but luckily the game didn't make me restart the level and instead fixed itself. Now onto the story. I have to say the story is quite enjoyable so far however some of the characters can be a bit unlikable, for example the maidens who constantly try to get the attention of Holy. I know they're going for the whole typical female stereotype within games but it can get a bit tiresome and it can be incredibly annoying in combat (If you decide to play the game you'll see what I mean).  However where there are a few downs there are ups, the rest of the characters I've encountered so far are very enjoyable in particular Drake and Holy who you start the game with. They are very much opposites. Drake is represented as a depressed emo type who doesn't have a lot of confidence whereas Holy is represented as a strong blonde hero who's sometimes vain. I could write more on the story but I've wrote enough already.Overall in my opinion this is a brilliant game for those people who love RPG style games with a hint of comedy. If you're not a fan of games putting obsticals in places where you could roam then this game will probably annoy you. You may find the combat later on in the game irksome as well as you find more characters as they have certain 'limit breaks' that can hurt people in your team and sometimes kill them. Don't expect anything too great since this is made by an indie team but it will be enjoyable none-the-less. Also the price is good for what's in the game so even if you're a little unsure it won't be too much to waste or you could just wait till the sale. Hope my review was useful.			"

												This amusing, satirical game is not without its flaws. Some of the jokes get old pretty fast, and the gameplay can be rather clunky at times.

And your 'army' for want of a better word is primarily composed of women (they being the only ones to survive the initial assault). It's fun. It's witty.

												As many have mentioned before the game is quite buggy but this aside it was still fun to play and story was an interesting one to follow. Maybe a tidbit short, but hey.PROS:- Humorous dialogues and story- Good graphicsCONS:- Bugs bugs bugs (crashes - major, but also some annoying small ones like unability to select an action during combat by a character, loading a save game during combat will not restore fire traps - more below)Game is playable despite the bugs and if you plan to try it, just ensure you save often. Some of the bugs, like when game stays in turn mode after combat has ended, can be simply worked around by loading a save. My approach was to use the save slots for major stages (eg. new location, tough fights) and quick saves - often during combat. One thing to remember, loading a save made during combat will  not load any walls of fire or wine so if you plan to use those at some choking points to watch enemies wander into the fire and burn alive, ensure you save BEFORE placing your traps ;-) "

												This game, while somewhat unpolished, is a good treat for turn-based strategy fans like me.The story and characters are silly and get pretty engrossing once you've warmed up to the game. The combat is fun and rewards planning. This game was a fun challenge all the way through. The game doesn't hold your hand beyond the mere basics, but that made things a lot more satisfying once I figured out how everything works and started devouring quest after quest.The only few negative points I can bring up are the art and how this game could have crossed the threshold from ""Pretty Fun"" to ""Strongly Recommended"" if not ""Must Have"" with just a bit of polishing. The 2d character art looks like something out of a teenager-otaku's animu sketchbook more than a professional videogame. In fact, it was quite a turn-off at first, but I'm glad I let it slide because I hardly noticed it once I got about three-to-four quests deep and started appreciating the game more for its gameplay.The humor, for what the game is mostly promoted with, is rather hit-and-miss. Probably because of the translation. One particular joke, even if it was intentionally bad, was just too bad that I wanted my 32 seconds of life back.As for the writing - it wasn't too bad. The story is bland as oatmeal mixed with tap water and a dash of salt in the middle of Ohio, but it was the character interactions that was just good enough to keep me invested in the game (Other than the gameplay itself). However, I've spotted at least one typo, and it was of the ""Semi-divine's Humble Self""'s name. How can you possibly mispell one of the main character's name/third-person referential name?Speaking of which, the game is a bit buggy. There is a game-mechanic that allows you to freely roam over the map until you get close to an enemy, then you're characters are stuck into the grid when battles begin. Once the enemies have been defeated, you go back to free roam mode. Or so you should. At least twice I was stuck in battle-mode after I cleared the entire map of enemies. Luckily, this problem didn't prevent me from leaving the map and continuing the game. However, this change from free-roam to rigid-battle layout system bugged out once that made the game unplayable and I had to restart again from an earlier save. I was crossing a ford when forced into a battle, but because my characters where so bunched up, one character couldn't reach an open square to end his turn on, thus stuck in an eternal turn.Also, this game crashed twice on me. Maybe because it's an older game on much newer software.However, my biggest irk with this game, rather than the writing and bugs, was the sound design. Particularly the sound design on a few particular stages. There are things on the map that make noises, and no matter where you go on the map, you hear them. For example, there is a fool who constantly jumps in and out of the gallows, and it makes an irritating noise each time he does it. And it doesn't matter if you are on the other side of the map -- It. Never. Stops. It's even worse on the graveyard level where you come across a skeleton swinging about in a cage on rusty chains. You here the chains squeak and groan and clatter mercilessly over the other audio -- And it. Never. Stops. I just gave up and nearly muted the sound in the latter case.In all, this game has a heart that shines through its unpolished and amatuerish exterior. It was fun to play, and I ""somewhat"" recommend it to other fans of turn-based RPG fun.			"

												The game is a turn-based strategy where you have command of heroes who are attempting to foil the evil followers of ""the mother of god"". It starts out with the main character being a emo who was the only one ever to fail at the commander achademy and attempt to sacrifice himself until a Paladin names the ""Holy Avatar"" comes to your aid and inspires you to fight against the forces of darkness.Like Deathspank, this game has tongue-in-cheek humour at fantasy styled RPGs and MMOs with some silly enemies that'll bring a smile to your face such as savage mushrooms and sabre-toothed bunnies. There are even green mushrooms that when killed you hear the maro 1hp trune play and even see a 1hp appear.All character have unique abilities and you have to think tactically in order to fight back and cut down the enemy.

I'll look forward to going back and playing it again someday.			"

												I understand that this is intended to be a satire of traditional RPG memes, but satire is funny when it's subtle and witty, not when it's crammed down your throat at every opportunity.  The game just tries too hard.  Combine that with an ultra-linear plot and bland gameplay and you get a game that is just not worth playing.  There are so many good games on Steam - don't waste your time on this trash.			"

												Grotesque Tactics is a parody light hearted RPG with a turnbased combat system.There are lot of jokes in the game about rpgs and clichees.The combat isn't so complicated but has enough depths with several skills.Grotesque remind me of Final Fantasy Tactics but it's more simple and faster. It's better for casual gamers and rpg fans like me , not for hardcore tactic fans.You can have up to 8 party members later I think , so you have some huge battles later.The game has a few quests, cute graphics and adventure elements. Overall I like it and I will also play Grotesque Tactics 2 and Holy Avatar maybe (however he is very sexistic ;)).			"

												The best way I could describe this is a very simplistic version of Final Fantasy Tactics. Its combat uses the similar grid system, however nothing is even remotely complicated. The Terrain offers slight defense bonuses, there is no class changing and theres really no decision to be made on equipment.The game does however offer an odd humor that I came to enjoy. Grotesque Tactics manages to poke fun at the overall genre of adventure games and seems to just have fun with itself without ever trying to become too ""serious"". TLDR~ Simple Final Fantasy Tactics game, has some decent humor in it, but makes fun of itself quite a bit to the point where I wouldn't recommend this to people who NEED a strong story to love a game. Graphics aren't bad either.			"

												Grotesque Tactics is a turn-based RPG with lots of humour. It has nice graphics and an entertaining story. The UI is terrible, but once you get used to it, it doesn't bother much.

												You can’t feel totally ripped off at only $15, but you have to wonder if the quality doesn’t match that price. On the one hand, both games can be pretty funny at times, what with attempting to parody a wide variety of games and pop culture references. On the other, it often comes off as clumsy and the gameplay reflects roughly the same.  There are many times where luck is valued more than skill, so regular saves are a must.I still have fun with these titles, but only in small bursts. If you enjoy parody games and you’re willing to put up with some seriously clumsy, flimsy design, these games may be right for you. Just keep in mind that, much like Pyst and Driven (parodies of Myst and Riven), you may be getting more parody and less game at times.			"

												Grotesque tactics is a turn based rpg with some dark humor, it doesn't excel at any of those two but it can be entertaining somehow.You're Drake a failed student at the hero academy about to go kill yourself to a man-eating mushroom (btw you will kill diff versions of mushrooms through the whole game) but that's when you encounter the holy avatar a cool looking paladin with... sunglasses? who aids you out of your depression, together you must raise an army, and gather 3 virgin maidens for the holy avatar in order to stop the dark church, and yes they reuse the virgin maidens thing a lot.As you progress you will encounter allies like an angel, 2 more half naked archer virgin maidens, a thief goblin, a berserker and more.The controls are a bit messy in the tactics battles, and you only got 2 skills per character aside the normal attack button, but they did implement a nice feature called obssesions which would be like the limit breaks of final fantasy games, but with the drawback than they're not as useful sometimes.When a hero maxes their obsession bar it will go into a burst and do something depending on the background of that hero, drake will give leadership bonus to all who's near but get depressed afterwards, the holy avatar will be telling more made up stories about himself nobody cares about causing any enemy nearby (and ally) to be affected by sleep, maidens will attack whatever is nearby in a burst of rage and etc.If you're a fan of rpgs and don't care playing a bad game then go ahead and buy this game, but not at full price			"

												Overall, I give this game an F. Though the ""obsessions"" system is mildly interesting, the game is poorly executed. The obsessions system refers to characters occasionally taking extra actions which may either be harmful or beneficial, based on some character-dependent trigger. For example, there's a healer who will beat up your team for a bit if she is hit too many times, while the main character will sometimes take an extra attack and buff nearby allies after he attacks enough. As the obsession meters don't empty between battles, many of the negative ones feel annoyingly inevitable, though some can at least be played around. Overall I didn't actually like how it played out, but it was at least an interesting idea.However, I wasn't really a fan of the writing, and there were enough bugs that I noticed and poor interface decisions to dedicate most of the rest of the review to them, though I'm probably missing some because I played this about 10 months ago or something.Bugs:-Sometimes your action bar doesn't light up, making the only way to end your turn to basic attack an enemy (which must be done by right-clicking the enemy, because you can't choose the attack command).-You can't click on an enemy if there's an object (like a building) between the camera and the enemy.-You can softlock the game just by moving around in a narrow area due to the behavior of allies moving out of your way. This can happen both in and out of combat.-The top right save slot doesn't work. It can't be clicked on at all.Poor interface decisions:-Tiles you can move to don't light up. If characters moved a consistent number of squares this might not be a big deal, but different terrain types have different movement costs, so the main way to tell if you can move somewhere is to try it. Many turns started with pacing around the outside edge of my movement range to see where it was.-Nothing in the game tells you the range or mana cost of any skill. Or that ranges seem to be in absolute distances rather than tiles (you can shoot an arrow 2 spaces normally, but if aimed at an angle you can actually hit someone three spaces away, like a Knight's move in chess).-Selecting a skill will sometimes automatically move your character and execute the skill if there's only one thing in range, which may not actually be what you wanted.-There's no sort of highlighting of enemies behind objects like buildings.-The buttons on the status screen for changing among characters can blend in with the decoration a bit. They're hard to spot until you know they're there. I've seen a question on the Steam forums about it, so it's not just me.-The transition from non-combat to combat gives no opportunity to set up a formation or anything.In short, the game barely works and doesn't do enough good stuff to redeem itself. I only finished it due to a 2016 New Year's Resolution to finish games already in my library (and it wasn't hard to get 100% achievements, with a guide for where the 1-Up Mushrooms were, and I was tracking my average achievement percentages pretty closely at the time).

												The premise seems simple, poking fun at tired RPG/fantasy tropes, but in practice this game feels like a checklist of how NOT to make a game.Steam says I played this for ~5 hours, my only playthrough clocks at ~1.5 h. The extras are repeating parts of the game because of random crashes, horrible slowdowns (my computer meets the requirements comfortably and yet the game slows down to 3-5 FPS (!) in explore mode, even with lowest video settings.The camera is sometimes non-responsive and often annoying in its movement and positioning. The character movement is terrible as well, on multiple occasions I've had problem pathing from like 5 squares to an NPC I had to talk to (during 1.5 h of playtime!).The interface is designed in a weird and non-intuitive way. LMB for attack? Nah it's for selection, RMB for execution. Esc to exit an inventory/option menu? Naaah, let's limit that to the [X] closing button, Esc just slaps the main menu over it. Oh, and if you try to start a new game then, the old menu persists on the screen. I couldn't check if it happens when you load a game with a menu open, because the only time I could load a game was after a fresh start, otherwise it crashed.I wanted to like the game for being something different, but the end result will probably go into my ""garbage"" category, never to see the light of day again.Oh, and if you want a good fantasy/RPG parody, try Unepic, that one's actually well-made.

												Very cool looking graphics and weird character and environment sets but the controls are super buggy. For instance when you finish with a certain area and try moving on you will find areas where the character will outright refuse to go where you point him and instead will turn around and run back to where he came from no matter how far away it was. When you finally get the character to return via the same path, the game will trigger enemy alerts for enemies that have already been killed and cause other buggy problems. Seriously, this game should not have been released yet and you will soon find out how true this is if you buy it.  Good luck.			"

												Got abuot 15 minutes into the game, was close to rescuing the first... whatever her name was. The game had already bugged once, and then wouldn't trigger the enemy after I 'rescued' the girl. 15 minutes in and a showstopper. Uninstalled. Don't waste your time.			"

												Grotesque Tactics is a satire RPG with tactical combat.  As you progress, you build a party of characters to take on the Dark Church, the generic evil organization in the world of Grotesque.  The game is fairly well written with decent humor and its own set of purposefully cliched characters, but it unfortunately has a lot of problems.Though the game isn't even 10 hours long, I had quite a few instances where a quest script broke or the AI got stuck in an infinite loop during combat, forcing me to reload my previous game.  One time a quest NPC accidentally got put to sleep during combat and since effects don't wear off while out of combat, I couldn't wake him up to continue.Combat can be rather unbalanced at times, with some enemies possessing instant kill attacks and others able to hit for nearly half a character's life and hit 3 targets with one shot.  Each character also has a special charge-up behavior that automatically triggers when their bar is full.  One of the characters will turn and randomly attack another party member when this happens and will kill most of them with this attack.The interface needs a lot of work as well.  Clicking through conversations often results in your character moving after the conversation has finished because the game registered the last click as a movement order.  The camera position keeps your character very low on the screen, so it's difficult to move down without resorting to manual camera control.  The camera also uses very slow panning to follow action, which I probably don't have to tell you is quite annoying.On top of those problems, the game engine is simply atrocious.  The graphics are pretty simple, yet the game stutters like I'm trying to run a game from 5 years in the future on my computer.  Turning on the ""quality renderer"" option makes the game look worse with reduced lighting and really nasty flickering shadows under plants.  There are also numerous graphical glitches with water, and flashing triangles across the screen if I zoom the camera out.I'm having a hard time recommending this game.  While the game itself is compelling, there's too many bugs and design flaws that get in the way of enjoying it.			"

												I'm sure you've already read all the bad reviews but I'm adding my own.The game is very clumsily made.  The interface is one of the worse I've experianced in recent years.  In fact I was going to write a massive list of problems with this game but I won't.  It's so terrible I'm not even going to finish this review.			"

												I own about 95% of the Meridian 4 catalog, and picked up GT: Evil Heroes during that package. I later purchased GT2: Dungeons and Donuts during a sale.The BackgroundGT1 and GT2 share the premise of the player taking control of a moody sap (Drake) who overcomes personal challenges to become The Hero That Saves The World. The game is largely a parody of main-stream RPGs, with characters often throwing out asides and references to other games. The jokes are campy and are mostly of low-brow humor; some would say the designers are mocking how sexualized female characters are in other games, some would say the designers are part of the problem.CharactersThroughout the games, you get the opportunity to recruit new party members with different skillsets, for example:Angelina: Healer""The Semi-Divine Holy Avatar Himself"": 2 handed swordsman.Candy: ArcherEach character has a relatively well fleshed out back story, as there is a LOT of dialogue to read. In GT2 they have actual voice actors to play each character.SkillsIn GT1, skills are tied to your player level. Your character has an additional skill titled ""Obsession"", which is kind of an automatic passive attack with unique abilities.Ex: Holy Avatar's obsession is the ability to talk everyone everyone to sleep in a 3x3 radius. Including your party members.In GT2, skills are tied to your ""Talent Tree"" (which is not very well explained).When you max a bottom tier Talent, it unlocks your 3rd skill. A second tier talent unlocks your 4th skill, and a 5th tier talent unlocks your ""ultimate"".Additionally, GT2 skills have a timer, so you can't use them every turn. Your Obsession meter (more like an ultimate meter), builds up to allow you to cast the Ultimate skill.The ultimate skills in GT2 are actually pretty useful, with one of them doing massive AOE damage which is needed later in the game when there are seriously 20 monsters in a room.The ProblemsThe camera is terrible. It frequently locks onto random locations, and you have to reset the Follow toggle to return to your character. You might even feel sick from it. The Bloom doesn't help either, and may be part of the problem in inducing motion sickness in players. There is extreme camera smoothing in both games.Characters frequently get stuck. If I have a party member that stands in a doorway, and I try to talk to a NPC outside of that door way, I cannot pass through. My character will choose to run into the party member, and constantly try to move past. The controls are locked and I cannot disable the ""queuing"" of the talk command. To fix this I had to use the cheat console to teleport Drake to the NPC. This happened at least 30 or 40 times.In GT1 there is a major gamebreaking glitch where the Holy Avatar would be completely disabled during a battle. The battle round timer would still be enabled, and you would be stuck in an infinite loop. This required a reload of an earlier save file to fix.In GT2 the quest journal offers only Italicized and Normal text views. It is unclear if a quest is Completed, In Progress, or Not Completable. That last detail is interesting, there are at least 5 quests in GT2 that if completed, disable your ability to complete other quests. Some of my quests that were ""completed"" still remained in the journal, while some that were incomplete just disappeared.GT2 lacks progression logic. Finding your next mission requires you to talk to just about every NPC to figure out what you're doing next. The need to do so is not tracked in the quest log. There is also no notification that informs you to talk to a NPC. If you surf the Steam or Gamefaqs forums, many players ask ""WTH do I do next?"" And the answer is usually ""Talk to everyone"". This was not as big of a problem in GT1 as the maps were not as large.Final CommentsI eventually used the cheats ""goto//god//healall"" to complete both games. ""Healall"" resets the movement tracker so you can move from one end of a map to the opposite end in one turn. This made progressing through the (really boring and tedious) fights much quicker. Even then, it still took about 10 hours to finish GT2 because of all the walking and talking you're required to do. I would estimate that GT2 would take over 30 hours without cheating. And let me tell you the 10 second ending is not worth the effort[1] .Humblebrag: This post here is more comprehensive than anything you'll find online. Nobody wants to write a walkthrough or a guide for these games because GT sucks. If you're stuck on a mission/quest, leave a post and I'll see if I remember how I did it.			"

												this game is stupid. I think the saving grace is supposed to be the dialogue, but it's only funny 1/20 lines. I laughed at a few parts, but the showing lack of intellgence made my insides shrivel. maybe the translation is at fault.... maybe, but poorly veiled fantasy references, reddit tier ""video game logic"" jokes, half-naked women, and/or unserving racial stereotypes aren't funny.every character is one-dimensional. not surprsing for a comedy. but to call it story focus is a sham. with the semidivine exception of the holy avatar, not a single one of these characters is memorable or clever. nothing in the story will stay with you or impress. it seeks humor only and surface humor at that. it's a very shallow game that's absolutely painful to play if it cannot make you laugh.with no driving force, it's comforting to know that the game itself is fundamentally broken. bugs and crashes are common force - the end of level event did not trigger properly and I was forced to reload an older save, when my main character was killed at one point the death filter that occurs when he dies was permanently stuck on, and when attacking on a bridge the game totally and entirely crashed. but the broken nature of the game doesn't stop with its programmingthe pathing when using right-click-to-attack prioritizes stepping in the highest defensive terrain than maximizing a character's range or staying away from enemies. of course, moving and attack can be done seperately, but it's not as obvious as click to attack. click to attack will inevitably get a character killed. logically, it should move to the closest space and attack, not walk out and around to a bush. logic isn't this game's strong point.the obsession meter might be the worst mechanic to ever be featured in a game period. as characters are attacked - or for a few preform attacks - a red meter fills up. when it fills, characters do something, ah, unique. this might be putting friend and foe to sleep, but it's probably hitting one of your allies. actually for over half of your small army, it's hitting your own allies. having your beserker or healer hit - not even killed - might force you to lose the whole map because dice roll decided that they'd kill your main character. obsession is not fun. it's supposed to be funny and keeping tabs on it is apparently another layer of strategy, but there's nothing good about it. it doesn't enhance the experience, it screws it all up. nearly all of the times I lost, I lost because my own ally killed me, and there was little control I had. to avoid obsession, you're forced to bench characters, effectively limiting strategy instead of enhancing itthat's implying this game gives you any moments of strategy. using items have no repurcussions. you could win a whole map with one character and potions. I very near did that from time to time. equipment is extremely limited and so are character abilities. the effects range from overpowered to completely useless, with nothing balanced in between. status effects always work and devalue any challenge the game could present. considering the writing is bland, the artstyle is amateurish, and the music is generic, it delivers on absolutely no fronts. and the gall of it all is that every asset in the game repeats multiple times. you fight the same enemies constantly and return to a too small set of maps. characters end up all with the same obsession and the grand penultimate insult is a new character that is an exact clone of the main character moves and all. I think that's supposed to be a joke, but after redoing so much of the same crap then given the same crappy character again, I took it personal. small stat increases greatly overpower characters and there is no linear balance from one map to the nextif grotesque tactics is funny it's for all the wrong reasons			"

												An inexcusably, pound-the-keyboardingly graphically buggy turn-based PS1-style strategy RPG that, while offering decent level to level challenge, provides little to no incentive to progress. No character skill trees, no point allocation decisions, no character-to-character synergy, no meaningful environmental or elemental modifiers, and no choices to make as your equipment improves. Most significantly, the abundant dialogue in the game overrelies on a self-aware, snarky sense of humor that isn't zany, smart, or original enough to even garner a chuckle. Returning to my initial disgust momentarily: if this game weren't so intent on providing textures, lighting affects, and animations that the coding simply cannot support, it would almost be playably lukewarm. But as it stands, if you've been minding Greenlight and the mid-major indies, there's an overwhelming welath of turn-of-the-millenium JRPG TBS options out there. I'll make it easier on anyone so inclined to fish the deeper waters: avoid this one.			"

												if u like tactical rpgs this is a great game. cant really find the right words to express how great this game is other then u need to play it to understand. there is only so many weapons and armour in the game but it is enough to satisfy as u arent playing for hordes of items. and yes there is a few bugs but they dont break the game and only 1 is a crashbug towards end of the game by an optinal golem which if beat quick enough and move away from the spot it wont crash u and u will know the point when u reach it. but overall u got ur parodys ur semidivine hero and the maidens alongside drake ur gothic style commander and well ur perverted goblin? u got the lovely yet easy to♥♥♥♥♥♥off fallen angel and a beserker ish warrior. oh and might i add there is vampires? its a great game and sidenote try to beat it without using ur potions as weapons and armour early on is alot better use of coins and potions are only really needed if ur not that great at tactical rpgs. overall a very enjoyable tactical parody rpg which i would play again <3 10 of 10if this review is not helpful, please leave a comment as to why u feel that way so i may make changes if needed ^w^			"

												For being a turn based RPG, so many design mistakes and details are left out. First off, yes there are some translation mistakes. Also, it seems like the game tries too hard to be funny and conversations are way longer than they need to be with a lot of pointless conversation. How the game plays out is you are transported to a single map and you need to finish the objective and move on. You fight pretty similar guys and find uninteresting upgrades of gear that just give slightly better stats. Then there are all the design mistakes. You can see all of your party's health, but its at once and jumbled all over the screen in no order. There is no way to see the health or stat bar of enemies. You can sit there and try and hold the cursor over the enemy and a number will pop up for health, but it's finnicky and a bar would be better. Also, you have no idea how much damage your characters do. I would have an item that says it does 3-4 damage, but my attack would do 7 damage. This is stupid because in turn-based games you need to know if your attack will finish someone or not to plan your turn, and it isn't there in this. You dont upgrade characters at all, you just get 2 abilities total and it auto upgrades stats. As for abilities, they aren't described well and you usually never know what happens with them. They will say they do increased damage and have an effect, but you don't know how much more, and the effect is not described so you don't know the specifics of it. So once again this ruins the planning part. As for battle, if your characters die it does not seem you are able to revive them, at least this isn't explained, meaning you have to go the entire map without them, which seems dumb. As for ranged characters, they are done poorly. It does not tell you how far away you can attack enemies, and in once instance I targeted someone to attack and it made my character run up right next to them to attack. Even when it does have you attack, it only has you 1 square back, which makes no sense, especially because you can't move after attacking. The board does not clearly show you how far you can move, as many times against dark grass and at night my guy would keep moving but it would be side to side and then I would finally realize they couldn't go further. Every time you get to where you can't go further, you must manually end your turn. It is annoying, but there is the bonus factor you don't end the turn by moving one way, you can walk back and go a different way if you want, decreasing moving mistakes. Another huge mistake is you can't cancel an attack. If I click to attack someone 6 spaces away and instantly change my mind and click my guy to instead move or stop him, it should change his direction or stop the attack, because I'm obviously doing it for a reason. But in this game he cannot change course for some reason no matter what you do......durrrr???There is also the problem of the camera. If will move super far if you just tap it, but when your character is moving you cant pan it at all, which makes no sense. The same is said with rotation. You also can't pan the camera out enough to see the map fully, so you have to pan all around it and back to your party, only seeing sections of a time, but decreasing how much you can see. Interactibility is a huge problem. You cannot see when you can loot someone or interact with something, and there is no button to show all interactable objects like there should be. When you try looting or opening a chest, it is annoying and finnicky, and you have to click multiple times on the exact perfect spot to do it. Also, there is basically no help or direction on the map, and there is no mini-map with objective markers. I got stuck on a map and quit because I had to slowly pan around it but it looked like I had found everything but I could not press a button to see anything interactable or any enemies, and there was no objective marker. Also, a button to see all enemy's bars in the area like you see your own would be helpful. The obsessions is a stupid worthless feature. You never know when it's coming, and you don't know exactly what triggers it. When it happens they almost always hinder you, so its basically a stupid handicap put on so the developer's could include it as a feature on the game description tab. The L/R mouse buttons make no sense either. L and R move you, but only L attacks, but only R picks up items from chests, but only L opens the chest, and only L (or R, cant rememer) switches item to what you are currently wearing, but you have to manually drag items you have to sell them, and only L (or R, once again forget) buys an item........you get the picture, no consistency, meaning you always hit the wrong button because you forget which does what. So basically none of the UI or design of the game makes it cohesive to play, leading to frustration more than fun. 4.5/10.			"

												For a game that tries to sell itself as a Fire Emblem clone, it does a very poor job of emulating the things that made games like FE enjoyable. The way player actions are set up, there isn't much planning in terms of things like unit placement.  Navigating the grid is cumbersome and the controls often felt ""sluggish.""  The graphics aren't terrible, but the art direction is; the character portraits are all rather ugly. The dialog and attempts at humor seem forced and ultimately tripe; it attempts to mock common tropes but in doing so manages to be just as bad (if not worse) than the conventions it pokes fun at.Overall a very disappointing purchase, I bought this game for $4 on sale and still regret it.

												I really really wanted to like this game. But after playing it for a bit I was very disappointed in the story, camera, and sometimes the controls. The story tries to be funny but it seems to have been written by someone that believes that he is funnier than he is... and unfortunately he drones on and on. I'm still hoping for a part two... that's written by someone else.			"

												This game is neither good nor all that funny.  The humor fell flat and the gameplay fell far short of any strategy RPG I could ever recommend.  There are not too many games of this type on Steam, but even if you are starved for games of the genre, I recommend avoiding it at any price.			"

												the game starts out ok. Lots of dialogue. It's a turn based strategy game with RPG elements. Think Final Fantasy tactics, but with all sorts of cliques and witty dialogue. I can't recommend this game though because of the game breaking bugs. I can't revive any of my party members. I can't leave town without having them revived. The only way i could beat this game is if no one dies at all. At one point my character tweeked out and ran into the river where enemies were. Just randomly.Wish i could finish the game...it was interesting. Hopefully the sequel isn't as buggy.			"

												Grotesque Tactics: Evil Heroes is a turn based 'strategy' game featuring specific characters, a linear storyline, and no random encounters.  I love turn based strategy games (Cute ones like Disgaea, serious ones like X-Com, easy ones like Final Fantasy Tactics, and unforgiving ones like Jagged Alliance).  I thought this one would be right up my alley.  Here is why it wasn't.The gameplay lacks real strategy.  There isn't any units you control outside of what they issue you in the story.  Each unit is unique in character, has semi-unique abilities (all three archers have little variation), and is limited to how they level up (limited, set number of possible encounters).  Keeping low levels up to speed becomes exceedingly difficult as the stronger characters tend to have to bail out the weaker.  The characters have unique abilities (similar to the Final Fantasy Limit Break system), but they tend to be counter-intuitive to how they are used.  When the characters see enough action, their special ability happens automatically, which can affect both your enemy and friendlies the same way.  If that wasn't frustrating enough, there are also neutral monsters that will sometimes attack your enemies for you.  That sounds fun and exciting at first, but then you realize they only take away xp from your own units.  Due to the lack of balance between weak and strong units, and the limited amount of xp to be gained, battlegrounds can turn in to a game of luck more than strategy.The lack of camera controls, playable area (boundaries), and fixed (unchangable) game controls also make for frustration as well.  They don't break the game entirely, but still will probably be noticed enough to slow down the flow of gameplay.I would like to play a polished version of this game, with some random encounters added to train up my low characters, but that simply will never happen.

												currently i am still playing this game and you might wonder why i would give it a thumbs down. well that is because it has some pretty bad bugs and still 2 years later never fixed. so one of the major issues is the camera. holy crap that thing flies all over the place its pretty annoying. never understood why it couldn't focus on the units that were moving instead of going crazy like it was on meth.so i encountered this bug during my playtime which made drake walk south no matter where i clicked. he would walk through the buildings loop around then finally go to his marker. so i figured hey maybe it will fix when i leave station wish. nope instead it gets worse. drake now can't move. this bug has been reported a few times and today it was never fixed. reloading my save did not work. the only thing that worked was quiting and loading the game again. so after all that it finally worked and i could play a little longer.so now i was just returning after finishing a battle and game crash. my first one. so yes i had 0 issues starting it and my computer is a pile of junk.ok so now that bugs and annoyances are out of they way. is this game worth it at current price. at this moment i say no. this is something only worth it if on deep discount or bundle. the bugs are way too common to validate a full price. now as for the gameplay and story. i actually laughed at the story and the little jokes.  west is funny when you first meet him saying oh hell no i'm not going to the front because i'm a black man.the jokes you need to be open to because they really are silly and sometimes stupid jokes. if you can't laugh at them then maybe you are too serious. for example west goes on a vietnam freak out, there is a scooby doo reference, etc.the story doesn't bother me. in fact i laugh at some of the jokes. remember humor is subjective so what i find funny you might not. my main reason why my review is negative is more on the bugs then the story.edit 1 I want to add there are 2 more bugs and one function that should exist in all games with a barter system. Ok so first but is when selling sometimes it refuses to even take it. sometimes it even will ignore you completely. so this is where there should of been an option to sell more then one thing. you have no idea how annoying it is to sell those vials. you can't just right/left click it to sell it. you have to drag each one and that is if the store even takes it. so yes very annoying.so after my crash yesterday i played and finished the cemetary and when you finish a battle you should be able to move normally but i was stuck in the title moving scene until i finished the level. now this isn't a gamebreaking bug but sure is annoying.

												Game will not launch and the developers seem unwilling to address the issue, which is a shame because it seemed like an interesting game.I should add, I use Windows OS 7 64x, graphics card, massive RAM. This is a custom built gaming rig. Some people have gotten the game to work with their systems but it does not work with mine. I've tried to fix but couldn't. I want to play this game but you should consider this a valid negative review because I can't play it despite meeting the system requirements. It is because of Steam's no refund policy. Here it is: ""As with most software products, unless required by local law, we do not offer refunds or exchanges on games, DLC or in-game items purchased on our website or through the Steam Client.  Please review Section 3 of the Steam Subscriber Agreement for more information.""BTW, if you check section 3 you'll see ""legalase"" for this paraphrasing, ""If you live in the EU you have the right to cancel payment as long as you do not start the game."" That legal gist is that even if the game does not launch properly, as long as it launched it is considered purchased. Currently 0% of people found this review useful. Perhaps that is because they perceived that any technical issues on the customer's side is the customer's fault and shouldn't be mentioned in a review. However this is part of the review process. If you can't use a product and there is no clear reason for why the product is faulty and no ability to return said faulty product it looks poorly on the company providing the content as well as the company distributing it. Should I simply say, ""Caveat emptor."" ""Buyer Beware.""? This warning may at least help you consider your purchase with more information available, specifically that the product may not work.			"

												Tired stereotypes and misogyny piled on top of unremarkable gameplay.  Other reviewers have already gone into more depth about those, so let's talk bugs.Crashes frequently.  Camera glitches abound.  The game gets borderline unplayable as you pick up more party members, as there seems to be a rogue AI loop during ""explore mode"" that eats your CPU and craps it out in pieces until everyone stops moving (the majority of my play time is waiting for this to finish).  Missions will occasionally start with one or more characters completely unresponsive to controls.			"

												Grotesque Tactics: Evil Heroes is possibly one of the worse rpg I have ever played. It tries its very hardest to use satire to ridicule the RPG genre, but the end result was a giant mess of unfunny, immature, and amateurish jokes slapped on to one of the most un-playble and boring indie rpg game in creation. I tried very hard to like this game, but the static/boring loot and absolutely tasteless characters made it very impossible to even pass this game off as average. The story is a joke so I can’t even list that as a positive for this game. The gameplay in combat is ridiculously slow and mundane, this game is turn based so controlling a massive team of characters is a big chore especially when they all do pretty much the same thing in terms of mechanics. Avoid this title; you can surely spend 10 dollars on a much more deserving game.			"

None are game breaking, although some require saving and reloading you save. No lost progress.I didn't find it challenging. Beat it in 9 hours playing in normal mode, only wiping 3 times due to carelessness. Carelessness will happen because the game is so damn easy you sometimes forget to watch the HPs of the two ""you die, game over."" characters. (All the others can be resurrected at a cost in town.)Content isn't all that great either, area reuse gets old quick (you visit one of the places at least 3 times...)I understand this is a 20 bucks game, but I think it's not worth paying it full price.
