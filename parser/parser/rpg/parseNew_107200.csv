“I prefer face-to-face conversations. In case the situation turns bad, I know exactly who needs to be blown up.”Space Pirates and Zombies (SPAZ) is a hybrid 2-D space simulation crossed with a real-time strategy game developed by the company Minmax Games with emphasis on combat mechanics and tactics.  Atmosphere & presentation:+ Large amount of ships with creative designs guarantee a lot of variety and enable a corresponding learning curve.+ The salvage and mining mechanics keep up the motivation to explore new star systems.  + Size and mass of ships influence movement and inertia of each vehicle.+ Late game introduces an ever shifting equilibrium of power.o The faction system adds an interesting dimension to the game, but it has little impact on the behaviour or decision making of the player.  - Amount of side missions and randomly generated events throughout the galaxy are limited and repetitive. - The musical background lacks variety. Combat & gameplay:+ Fluent combat mechanics create a dynamic battlefield with focus on tactical positioning.  + Each ship offers different customization options for weapon and auxiliary systems, which benefits the tactical spectrum of the game.   + Easy-to-learn-but-hard-to-master skill tree challenges the player to gain more experience.  + Late game requires a more strategic approach of the evolving situation. o Everything on the map can be attacked and destroyed.Characters & story:+ Story telling has a surprising and refreshing twist.+ Well done integration and development of the zombie threat.o Stereotypical portrayal of characters. - Very little voice acting during the entire game.Summary:Minmax Games succeeded in creating a well-rounded game with only a few rough edges. SPAZ delivers much more action and tactics than one might expect of this indie title. The urge to unlock the next ship class, spending points on the elaborate skill tree or collecting credits for the next weapon upgrade will keep you up late into the night. And the entertaining zombie plot will come around the corner when you least expect it.

												When I first got SPAZ, I remember playing about 5 minutes and just not being interested; I never gave it a chance and now I really regret my initial judgements.Space Pirates and Zombies is a top-down, twin stick style shooter set in a randomly generated solar system. You operate out of a main “mothership” and tackle quests and missions piloting smaller craft alongside AI Wingmen. The combat is difficult, but rewardingly so, and requires thought and sound tactics especially at the later stages of the game. I definitely judged this book by it’s cover when it was first released, but it is certainly no run of the mill twin stick shooter.The RPG elements are shockingly deep; you gain levels, rescue crew specialists upgrade weapons, collect ship designs, outfit your wingmen, and participate in a simple but very effective economy trading rez (currency), goons (crew) and data (xp).Visually the art is great, lots of vibrant colors, really unique ship designs, combat effects are satisfyingly meaty, characters are well drawn and the dialogue, while crude, is interesting and humorous.The only issue I have come across is playing SPAZ via in home streaming. Considering the visual fidelity of the game, it seems like my gaming rig has an abnormally hard time encoding the video of it. I’ve found that using “DirectX Compatibility” and “Capture Mouse” helps make it playable, but there are still numerous visual artifacts and glitching seen on the remote computer.Overall a brilliant game, and I’m truly looking forward to the sequel!

												SPAZ is an awesome game, you gather resources and manage your own fleet of starships, everything can be customized, from engines to missiles. Took me about 22 hours to finish the campaign, the map is huge, the more you explore the more ships and technologies you unlock, and to complete the package the game support mods, you can simply download a Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica mod that will customize all your ships!

												SPAZ does almost everything right as a 2D arcade space shooter. The game is fun, features a considerably deep ship designer; as challenging as you wish it to be and it looks good. The low points are the dialogue, which is thankfully sparse; early balance (good luck getting anywhere if you choose to research beam weapons instead of cannons!); lack of information regarding the effectiveness of your ship design and, for some, though not for me, the control scheme. These issues, however, do not detract from the experience in a significant way. 8/10, looking forward to the sequel.			"

												I finished this game in 64 hours. That wasn't a wasted time, not at all. Because I like tactical strategies and I like RPGs. This game is mainly strategy with active pause. RPG elements is mostly for technical purposes like skills and leveling. So don't expect tons of talking. But be prepared for tons of space explosions, destroyed and captured star bases, lasers, missiles, dozens of skills, upgrades, ships and all that stuff which should be in game like that. Yes, this game has it all. And all of that in open, procedurally generated world.VERDICT:If you like space adventures, you will like this one.If you don't, better change your mind.If you really don't, why the hell did you start to read this at all?Like this review?

												SPAZ is a gmae which I can heartily recommend based on a few short facts.1. The game's graphics are beautiful with a unique and disticive art style and lots of interesting and diverse weather conditions.2. The ship designs are distinctive with their own mix of strengths and weaknesses and each has fully customisable loadouts to better suit whatever your style of play.3. The game is long. Very long in fact but still manages to make each system feel unique and mysterious.4. I controls are natural and destinctive with hotkeys that allow all sorts of game changing things to occur including ejecting cargo, jettisoning spare crew and releasing the ship's armour all of which improve the handling of the ship.5. It's cheap and worth every last dime you drop on it.If you like exploration, space combat and custom ships then you can't go wrong with SPAZ.			"

You know that game where you check on steam and it says you've played 200+ hours and you are just like.... holy.... That's this game. Btw If you are a soldier and you are deploying to the land of crappy internet. This is a must buy. It will really help pass some of that extra time you've got.			"

												Wow. I've spend about 5 days straight playing this one, and I still hungered for more.SPAZ, or Space Pirates and Zombies (And Bounty Hunters) feels unique. You've got a small fleet of spaceships, and your objective is to reach the center of the galaxy, in search of a fabled load of Rez, an exceptional element discovered in the future capable of being transformed into any metal you need - starting ALL THE WAY BACK from the edge of the Perseus arm, where Earth is currently situated. You can assume direct control of any of your ships at any time in the field - being able to switch back and forth at a moment's notice, while the AI takes care of your other ships for you. You also have a Tactics panel, from which you can evaluate the situation of the entire battlefield and give orders to your fleet, set action stances, order reinforcements, etc. You can also DESIGN each and every one of your ships - you can unlock different hulls, weapons, modules, you name it.You'll find yourself dragged into a MARATHON once you get a hold of it. There's only one problem, though: the game is a bit grindy. The Milky Way is ENORMOUS, so there can be quite an expanse between your location and your objective in it. You'll find yourself battling through a load of star systems just to reach your next mission or unlock the newest upgrade, and that takes time and resources - most of which you'll be grinding out of mining stations/enemy fleets if you're careless. If it weren't for the grinding, this game would be perfect on my book. But still, it's VERY enjoyable.Has a great story - but I don't want to spoil it. Play your cards right and the game will go easy on you. Screw up, and expect to spend a few hours grinding for Rez.DEFINITELY recommend. You'll need some patience, though.			"

												Delivers that old-school skill based freeflying space shooter gameplay (say that three times fast) just like the developers wanted and manages to combine it with fast paced naval style tactics in a 2 dimensonal battlefield to keep things interesting. On top of that they shift gears at the end game and throw in a light turn based strategy system on top of it. Resource mangement can be a grind and a drag at times as your progress comes to an almost literal deadstop because your enemies are simply way too strong for you to even make a dent in their armor. Time has to be spent collecting resources to build ships while buttering up the factions for each system you visit for the tech upgrades they have unless you want to blow their stations to pieces so you can just take it instead, either way you're going to have to stop and smell the roses a few times, more than a few if you lose a lot of ships.The plot is a throwback to the classic days as well, no ""deep"" triple A slop here, just a decent story to keep the action going with a predictable unfolding if you pay any attention at all and a great ending to lead into the second game which I am now highly anticipating. Overall an excellent title for anyone who likes classic action, tactics and maybe a small sense of conquest and conquering at the same time.			"

												Definitely the strongest point for me was the atmospheric nature of this game which pushed me to complete it twise. The combat gets more exciting after you level up, get larger ships and stronger weapons. It has some strategy elements and the combat will require you to have proper ship set, timing, aiming and moving if you want to complete it on harder difficulties. I personally had some troble getting used to the moving system, but it became natural after little bit.Unfortunately the story isn't great and the whole moving from system to system gets repetitive after a while because of small amount of intriguing encounters, yet that serves as a push to try new things, like different ship and weapon sets or different relations between forses. In the end it gets you even more interested in it.			"

												+RPG levelling+Wide-variety of ship types+Physics-based movement for both ships and projectiles/missles+Easy-to-learn resource management+Dark humored-Grind intensive (if under utilizing the civvy station types)-Sub-Par AI teammates-Low variety of equipment types-Low variety of levelling skills (that is, no branching)Listen, this game is fun as hell. Despite my minuses up there, there is still some variety and strategy to be had. It starts off fast and still really picks up. Even though there's a low variety of equipment, it still feels like there's always another ship to unlock or skill to level up.The best way to increase the life of this game is the mods. Fight for Universe is easily the star, but Big Fight for Beef is also very good.Even though SPAZ 2 is out, this is still definitely a buy.			"

												This is a rare gem. Next time I look at a space shooter game, this will be a comparison.Your ships are fully customizeable, reactors, shields, engine, armor, weapons, you choose whether it'll be powerful but sluggish or nimble but less powerful.It has upgrades, though higher leveled doesn't mean better - it depend on your playing strategy about how using it.And of course it has lots of things to blast including starbases if you don't want to pay those upgrades.

												Despite the odd title, this is a fun game if you like 2D space action, like collecting new ships and weapons, and don't mind having to grind a bit if you do poorly for awhile. SPaZ is a top down space combat game where you mine resources and fight other ships. You gain power by gaining favor with two factions and buying weapon blueprints. You get ship blueprints from beating those ships. For me, getting those blueprints and seeing what each new ship or weapon could do was the most fun part of the game. There are many different types of equipment and you have limited upgrade points, so you'll have to pick a few trees to go down until late game when you can really pack on the level up. This gives the game some replayability if you like.Combat is fun and you have a lot of options. You can put out a big, expensive ship and just mow down enemies, or you can put out a small fast ship that can't take much damage. While the small ships do die quickly, they are much less expensive, making it an important issue to consider. If you get low on resources, you can't build your big ships and have to either do easy missions or go mine. There are places to do so relatively safely, but that's the slight grind I mentioned.I only had two issues with the game. The first relates to the factions. There are two and in each system they will have different feelings toward you. If you make them happy or mad in one system, it won't affect them in another. This is actually good. The problem is that one faction is always the one blocking the warp gates leading to other sectors. They must be cleared before you can move on. So you must either bribe the guards, which is extremely expensive, or attack them and♥♥♥♥♥♥them off. The second problem is that the end game got very boring and ""samey"" as I cleared system after system. However, that was me being completionist. You can finish the game without doing so but more systems cleared will give more aid in the last battle. Overall, I had a lot of fun. I'm not ready to jump into a second playthrough yet, but I'm happy with the time spent with this game and I will be keeping an eye on the second.			"

												The style and idea behind this game are appealing, but the game is made unpleasant by several glaring design flaws.You only ever seem to have around 3 ships to control at once. That doesn't really give you much in the way of tactical options. You're frequently put into situations where you go up against way more ships than that, so it feels strange to have only one large ship and two small ships and be expected to feel like you're being strategic/tactical.The issue with the tactical options is compounded by the need to grind a lot to have weapons strong enough to take on foes of a given tech level. The damage system is interesting, you have shields, then armor, then hull. Beams are strong against shields, cannons are strong against armor, and launchers are strong against hull. However, according to the DEVS THEMSELVES, a good strategy is to only focus on upgrading one of beams/cannons. What was the point of the damage model if you're just going to suggest people not worry about trying to match up the correct weapon based on the situation of the enemy ships? Because I didn't know about this, I was getting to the point where most of my time was spent grinding to at least 1.5x the tech level of the enemies I would go against. It seems like the designer didn't really think about how the damage and tech level system really affected the fun of the gameplay.There's a lot of time spent just doing repetitive mission types over and over again to get data so you can level up your tech. It gets old after awhile, even though there's a decent variety of mission types, once you play a certain type once, it isn't really fun to play it again. The only thing to keep you going is a desire to progress through the story or feel like you're ""being productive"", but really you're just doing the same stuff over and over again. It doesn't make for very fun gameplay.The whole idea of the Bounty Hunters is also an issue. Bounty Hunters in space is really thematically appropriate, but the way it's implemented in this world just adds unpleasant busy work. Every time you do missions you accrue ""bounty"". Whenever you jump, if your bounty is high enough and your near a bounty hunter lair, you'll be attacked by powerful ships and probably will have to reload a save. The only way to get rid of bounty is to go to a lair and pay them, or complete ""arena challenges"" which net you some Rez and relieve some bounty. The arena challenges are very fun, but I frequently found myself in a situation where I had maxed out my Rez so I just had to pay a bunch of money and never really felt a reason to play the challenges. It's just a resource sink without much fun behind. If it was possible to beat bounty hunters when they attacked you I would consider this fixed. There's plenty of other ways it could be improved, of course.Other than that, there's just lots of little annoyances throughout the game that indicate a lack of polish. One petty example is that, on escort missions, the ship you are escorting might have cloaking, but will be invisible to you, which makes it difficult to tell where you need to be. Escort missions have other problems, like the behavior of the escorted ship (it will sometimes go in the opposite direction, won't follow you, etc...). This is just one example of a minor design issue. There's others; like the heavy reliance on saving and loading (breaking immersion and breaking up the flow of the gameplay).Overall, it's insulting to Mound and Blade to call this game ""Mount and Blade in Space"". Mount and Blade lacks a lot of the issues that make SPAZ unpleasant (after a few hours of playing). Unlike games like Mount and Blade, I just never feel like I'm becoming more powerful. I don't feel like I'm interacting with the galaxy because all the solar systems are very closed off from each other. If you're looking for a game that actually gives you a sense of strategy, tactics, and power, you should look into Starsector (formerly Starfarer), which is currently playable though in-development. I think it does a better job of providing the sort of experience this game was trying to provide.			"

												Space Pirates and Zombies (SPAZ) is a top down space shooter game with a level up system for technology and a rudimentary economy system.  The majority of the game is space combat similar to the old multiplayer game “Subspace” but with no power ups (and you kind of design your own ships).SPAZ technically has a story but you probably won’t pay attention to it for most of the game since you’ll be exploring the galaxy for long stretches between “story missions.” You play part of the crew of the Clockwork, a ragtag mother ship headed for the galactic core to mine precious minerals.  Unfortunately the galaxy is mostly controlled by the UTA, a powerful organization kind of like the Empire in Star Wars, except not really evil. The UTA has its own problems though, the colonies are rebelling, and everywhere you go in the galaxy there will be fighting between UTA and colonial warships. The game’s galaxy is randomly generated when you start a new campaign and is made up of about 100 different star systems randomly connected like a spider’s web (if you’ve played FTL, it kind of looks like that, only much bigger). Each star system has a number next to it, representing the “tech level” of the star system. In practical terms, you can think of this as the “difficulty” of the star system. In order to progress to different stars, you need to somehow unlock them. For example if you go to one star, it might be connected to 2-3 other stars and each of those 2-3 stars has a separate warp gate that needs to be unlocked. You can unlock a gate by either killing all the UTA ships around it, or by bribing the UTA to let you through. This bribery brings up an important aspect of the game. Every time you enter a star system you are given a relationship status with the colonists and UTA. If you’re hostile to one of the 2 factions, they’ll attack you on sight and you won’t be able to trade with them. To bribe the UTA, you need to be on friendly terms with them. You change your relationship status by taking missions for that faction. For example to raise status with UTA, take missions destroying colony ships (which will lower your colony relationship). The relationships aren’t galaxy wide. You can be friends with UTA in one system and their enemy in the system right next door. You do not get chased from planet to planet no matter how bad your relationship is.Combat in SPAZ is pretty straightforward. You control one of three ships in your little fleet and can switch freely between them. The mothership stays in a safe place rebuilding your ships if they get destroyed. When enemy (or allied) ships are destroyed, they drop a “blueprint” which you can pick up to unlock that type of ship. Later ships require more copies of the same blueprint. For example to unlock a particular fighter, just destroy it and pick up the blueprint it drops. “Data clusters” dropped by destroyed ships are the “experience” of the game, and you gather those to level up. On level up, you can put skill points into various technologies, such as shields, beams, missiles, etc. This allows you to use more powerful tech (that you have to buy separately). Money in the game is a mineral called rez that you can mine from asteroids or pick up from destroyed ships. The money is used to buy tech from space stations (as long as you’re friendly with that faction). New tech items are actually pretty scarce; you need to make do with your combat skills most of the time.Pros:+The game is surprisingly complex. This would be a great game if I had no backlog to keep me going. Years ago when I had not many games to choose from, I would have spent a lot of time on SPAZ.+There is no difficulty option, but if you’re having a hard time, just go to a lower level star system. There is nothing keeping you from backtracking or skipping entire star systems. Also, very often a star system will have open battles between UTA and colony ships when you are neutral to both factions. You can just sit there in the battle and wait for a ship to be blown up so you can snag the data/blueprints. Obviously this works better on high level star systems where you’re too weak to fight either side by yourself.+Interesting weapon / defense dynamic. Beams do extra damage to shields, cannons do extra damage to armor, and missiles do extra damage to hull. Your ships can only load 1 or 2 weapon types each so you need to have a nice variety in weapons to be able to take on all enemies. Plus, combat is very fast paced and some weapons are easier to hit enemies with than others (missiles are homing). Cons:-As I mentioned above, new tech is few and far between. A star system will probably only be selling 1 item, and it probably won’t be what you’re looking for. And in order to actually buy the item, you need to be friendly with the faction that’s selling it. That means doing missions for them (and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the other faction).-The game is a tremendous grind. The faction relationship thing mentioned above is one example. Another is unlocking additional ships. You have to hunt down and destroy specific ship types to unlock them. Not so hard in the beginning, but in the end these are massive battle cruisers that can easily kick your♥♥♥♥♥ And you need like 10 blueprints to unlock them.-The technology level up system is weird. You need to save up skill points to unlock higher levels of tech, for example unlocking level 3 missiles requires 3 skill points, level 4 requires 4 skill points. Yet the game will keep nagging you if you try to save the points. If you try to diversify, you’ll end up at a disadvantage. (If you’re playing an RPG, you don’t put a point into every skill).Overall, I’d give Space Pirates and Zombies a tentative thumbs up. You can sink a lot of time into the game if this is your cup of tea, but for me there’s too much grinding. The pluses outweigh the negatives, but only just barely. "

												The game started out sounding very nice.It sounded, and looked, from the trailers, to be very enjoyable.Then I bought it and played for a little while.The concepts are all there, they're all done as well as can be expected, and, if it were paced a little better, the game would be pretty good.The problem is right there, though - pacing. Half of the time I was playing, I was just mining rocks to try and get more money to upgrade my ships. When I finally managed to get into combat, my enemies would take a small amount of damage and just run from me. Over half of my combat time was chasing down enemies in the vast nothingness that exists everywhere in search of that one last ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ needed to complete the mission.			"

												Though initially i was drawn into SPAZ, after a few hours i realized that the bulk of the game boils down to grinding the handful of recycled randomly generated missions you will come across in every sector. Its not really avoidable, to avoid being steamrolled by each group of enemy ships you will have to grind data to ensure your tech level is consistently 5+ levels higher than them not to mention you'll need to grind for blackbox data to build better ships. Assuming youve stuck it out that long you'll find yourself with extremely limited hangar space, which means that in the vast majority of battles you are greatly outnumbered by superior ships. I tried addressing the game's shortcoming with mods but the modding component of the game appears to be broken as none of them function and i cant be arsed to fix something that should be working when the game is just not compelling enough to warrant it.

												First impressions - I'm so far, thoroughly enjoying this game more that I though. I've had this for a while thanks to a bundle and I've seen it pop up on Steam, TotalBiscuits WTFis and probably some other sites saying this game was good. I was thinking I wasn't into the Newtonian movement kind of games, like Asteriods, which is a good classic of course, but it's kind of annoying to control your ship. I started playing and it reminded me of the Dreamcast game, Armada, which I bought for cheap long after the systems death and got really into. There's that ""one more level"" factor as you gain levels to improve your ships, gather rez as currency, kill enemies for data (XP) and Goons that can help you at your base, be sold to traders, or automatically ejected from your ship if they aren't willing to work (in which they comically flail around and scream before either dying in space or being shot or ran over - it's quite amusing). I'm playing on normal with reduced bounty hunters and increased tech, so i'm kinda playing on easy and I'm not sure how much I'll like it (I feared I wouldn't because it might be too hard for me). If you're into space exploration, it's great. If you have a copy of this, but haven't touched it, give it a go for 15 minutes or so and see if it's your taste.			"

												Extreamly complex space fleet management.  SPAZ is basically FTL meets Mount and Blade.  The action feels like an addicting top-down space-shooter.  This game is not for casual gamers.  It can be a bit overwhelming but if you stick with it SPAZ can be quite a rewarding experaince.			"

												You go from solar system to solar system, and from planet to planet, and all you do is fight and mine. Well, not really, you'll also upgrade ships and play with all kinds of setups. You're always in action or close to it, and because it's a pretty fun and addictive game it can really hook you up. I'm a bit of a sucker for bright colors and this game provided those in spades in an aesthetically pleasing way. You can customize your universe, but if you choose from a medium one and up, you'll have a lot of grinding to do until the end of the game.Pros: pretty colors, overall fun and keeps you engaged.Cons: it can get grindy.Rating: PEW!

												Great game, I pirated about 3 years ago and liked it for the few hours trying it. Then I found it agian on Steam a month ago and bought it on the summer sale for only 2,5 euro, more than worth it if you like tactical 2d space shooters!The game starts out simple, but becomes more and more advanced as you research new ship parts and discover more in the game. I can't believe how much a game made by only TWO PEOPLE can be so well developed and have great tactics! After 11 hours of playing i'm now level 21, and I can say for sure that you need to know a lot about the game and it's tactics to progress further. If you don't learn them, you're gonna get crushed by the UTA and civilians until you have to retreat to mine for resources with the ""short bus"".The game has some pretty graphics and a variety of good looking space backgrounds, effects and sound effects. The ambient soundtracks are nice, sometimes chilling and gives a great feeling to the game. Theres barely anything to complain about SPAZ.Things i'd like to see in the next game that is coming: Multiplayer battles and/or co-op, and voice acted characters in game and/or cutscenes :)			"

												You are a group of mercenaries, traveling through randomly generated galaxy, gathering resources - actually there is only one main resource - ""rez"". You're trying to reach the galaxy core to discover the origin of ""rez"". That's how the story looks like, pretty simplistic, but by no means boring. SPAZ is almost completely non-linear - You can visit a lot of galaxy sectors without touching the main storyline. Gameplay reminds me of another great game ""Escape Velocity Nova"". You build ships, gather resources, research new technologies, fight against 4 game factions - Civilians, UTA, Zombies and sometimes Bounty Hunters. Built-in tutorial is all You need to learn basics of SPAZ.SPAZ features top-down 2D graphics, and I find it a big advantage - everything is nice and simple. Sounds are also good, music nicely blends into the gameplay.To sum this up - If you're a fan of space games, at least try SPAZ - it's a true gem among the genre.PROS:Nice 2D graphicsNon-linear gameplay, high replayabilityEasy to learn, difficult to masterRPG elementsLots of ships to discoverCONS:Combat can be frustrating at higher difficultiesBecomes repetitive at times			"

												While I'm a bit late into the game of reviewing SPAZ, writing it anyway couldn't hurt. Space Pirates and Zombies is a action-strategy space shooter with elements of random generation. While you have some control over how random it is, it only serves to increase or decrease the difficulty in the long run.Gameplay: The gameplay is pretty solid. You pilot your ship around with WASD keys, and shooting your weaponry with the mouse. What makes it special if that you don't point and shoot, but the direction of your ship controls where your shots are. If you place a weapon on the front of your ship, expect it to shoot forward until the higher class ships which have rotating turret mounts that do just that. Even then, anything other than lasers will still need to lead the target, as nothing is hitscan. This makes shooting more skill based.At the same time, you have to pilot your ship to avoid incoming shots from enemy ships. This ends up leading to dog fight type scenarios where you and your opponent are dodging around each other trying to get a shot in. This is where a lot of the enjoyment of the game is, since a lot of battles will be decided on whether or not you can out-maneuver the AI, especially on higher difficulties when the enemies become too strong to kill in a head-on fight.As you kill enemies, you can pick up orbs of Data to level up and gain research points. The tech tree is nothing complex, since it is mostly just a direct % increase in damage and other stats for each weapon or ship subsystem. This is however needed, since more powerful versions of equipment are unusable until you level up that system. But before you can even  equip something, you must acquire the blueprints of each item. Naturally, higher level equipment requires more blueprints, which can be obtained by the faction bases. Either buy from them, or blow it up and loot the charred remains of the base, if you can.The Bounty Hunter system adds in some extra challenge to the mix, if you choose to allow them to spawn. Killing enemies within their territory increases the bounty on your head. Eventually, if left unchecked, the hunters will come after you in an attempt to collect that bounty. The higher your bounty, the higher the chance. You also have the chance to be extorted on the way out of one of their systems. Failure to pay and you'll need to fight them off. You'd think this would increase your bounty further, but instead gives you respect, which lowers the bounty. If the bounty falls into the negative, you start to gain respect points. This acts as a buffer before you will start accumulating a bounty, and ensures you won't be attacked until you drain all of your respect. Another way to gain respect, as well as money and Data, is to fight in arena matches set up by the hunters. As you progress, harder challenges are unlocked, each with 3 difficulties. If you want to avoid ambushes every are or two, you may want to take advantages of these arena matches. They can even be repeated for a lesser reward if you are out of fresh fights. And if you really have no other option, you can pay your bounty off yourself. As a whole, this system adds more challenge to the game, which is welcome when not playing on the highest difficulty.There's much more to gameplay, but I don't wish to drag on. So I'll end with one major flaw I found, and that mostly comes with the late game. If you fail to kill one of the smallest ships but weakened it to critical health, it will flee. For several thousand feet. If you don't switch to a small ship of your own that is just as fast, it will get away, and you'll spend minutes at a time waiting for it to come back. This becomes a huge pace breaker, and sometimes even causes you to be put in more difficult situations in the late game, when enemies can spawn just by you staying in an area for long. Maybe if they would retreat from battle, leaving the area entirely, this wouldn't be an issue.Story: The setting is that of a far future, and space travel has advanced to that of colonizing other star systems. This is mostly thanks to the currency of the game, Rez. This subtance is mined from deposits floating in space to craft vessels. In order to become rich, many set off to mining colonies to gather as much Rez as they can. Legend also has it, there is a grand deposit in the center of the universe. This deposit is what our protagonists are looking for. The only problem is getting there. Warp gates between star systems are guarded by the UTA, the police space force, essentially. Not only this, but the grand warp gates to the planets near the center are locked down tight. A nice twist comes in the zombie part of the title, which you discover upon finally reaching these center systems. I'd elaborate, but I don't wish to spoil it.Graphics: I care very little for graphics as long as they are serviceable. Meanwhile, SPAZ has great graphics. Each ship looks nice, if simple at times, and the lighting is bright and colorful.Sound: The music of the game mostly boils down to ambient noise, but there are a few tracks here or there that are enjoyable. Cutscenes are also narrated by TotalBiscuit, who does a fine enough job. Though even he says he did terribly, and it is clear enough that he could have done better if he tried. The sound effects are all well and good, meanwhile. Each weapon has its own shot sound effects, and the sounds of another ship being hit are clear to hear. But after awhile, hearing the pew pew pews of the game gets old.Overall, the game is a terrific time. It serves as a challenge when it needs to, and is just pure fun to shoot stuff in space. I'd recommend this to anyone who thinks they might enjoy this when shown any gameplay.			"

												A great top-down space game with good combat, OK story and a decent amount of replayability.The ship customisation is key to the game, and while it isn't as free and expansive as some other space games, the amount of variety is significant and creating that ultimate ship (or fleet of ships) that mows down everything in its/their path is very satisfying.Unlocking every blueprint and reaching the highest tech levels can take a long time, so focus is generally what will be needed.The standard missions in the game, to earn reputation with the factions, currency and experience are fairly varied but eventually you'll have seen them all; however each time will have different ships which can alter the difficulty and reward you with new parts.Sometimes the random generation of the map is extremely unfair - there was a point where I had access to systems up to level 50, and the connection to systems above that (including the story objective at the time) were linked by just one system, which was level 68. It took a awhile of grinding on the lower level systems before I managed to force my way through the gate. This is a game where going up against ships 5 levels higher can be brutal, but can also be fine, depending on what the ships are given in the area by the random generation.The addition of bounty hunters gives another edge to the game, with their special challenges (which involve a specifically designed ship and not yours) based on skill, not your current progress.The game mixes it up when you reach act 3 by introducing the zombie faction, which plays against the other two factions (Civs and UTA, or 'police'). While the first two can be befriended, the zombies are always aggressive. When a zombie ship is killed, it explodes into spores and zombies, which can corrupt your ships into zombie ships. This can be devastating if they get your best ship.In the final act, act 4, the game again changes it up my adding a system control element because (story spoilers:) the zombies are now a much larger threat so the UTA and Civs now work together with you as allies. This bit feels a bit weird, but these systems now gather resources for you (rez (main currency), goons (crewmen, secondary currency) and data (experience)), which can help in the endgame area, where your ships cost significantly more, your levels take a lot of data, and you chew through goons and rez upgrading systems.In summary, good fun game, great combat, eh story, can get grindy at times and the ship customisation is great.

												I really enjoyed this game, I put a lot of hours into it, and was rewarded with an interesting story, lots to explore and heaps of combat.What I like about it is that there's unlimited fights to have and things to explore, you can just wonder around the galaxy and fight endlessly. You can see the challenge rating of each star system, so you know what you’re in for before you go there, and if you want some relaxing fun you can just pop back to an easy system and kill everything with impunity. There are lots of spaceships to discover, and lots of weapons, that will suit your playing style and dexterity.Combat is the central part of the game, you have a number of ships to field, and the AI is decent. Combat takes place on a 2D playing field, and you have a God’s eye view of the whole map, so finding things to shoot is easy. Sometimes it gets tedious racing around the combat map to reach waypoints, or protect space ships with no self-preservation instinct.However, by the time I was ¾ of the way through the game it was getting tedious. I was only driven to complete the story, I could barely tolerate entering more combat because it was becoming repetitive. I did finish the game, and I did enjoy completing the story, but I can’t see myself playing a second time**Overall, I recommended this game as a good distraction. Exploding enemy ships and capturing or shooting their crew after they eject is satisfying for a gamer like me.** Edit: It's almost 2 years since I wrote the original review, and I am playing through the campaign again. The desire to blow up spaceships is still strong!			"

												Space Pirates and Zombies is a good old fasioned 2D space battle and exploration game with strrong ARPG elemements. While the story is somewhat shallow, the game universe is procedurally-generated and randomised, there's plenty of area to explore and conquer, although at times, it gets to be a bit of a grind, although if you're careful, you can reduce the amount of grinding necessary by trading with civilian stations. The tutorial is actually quite good and the game will stop and show you new mechanics as they come into play. Totally worth buying, I've sunk over 235 hours into this game, and I've enjoyed every minute of it.			"

												SPAZ is one of those oddball games that is just surprising. It has surprising amount of depth due to the variety of random bits and pieces it offers you. The premise is simple: you have a mothership, and it builds these tiny remote ships (of 4 different size classes) that you can take out to do things with. You start with the tiny-size and mine asteroids. Soon you'll mount attack lasers and armor and other components as you take on tougher and tougher missions while you encounter the threat to humanity... Space Zombies! Different systems have different factions (government, rebels, and bounty hunters) who have different feelings toward you! Attack, defend, ally, betray, it's all up to you. Depending on relations, some will trade, others will not. The actual game is just pretty much ""asteroids"" as you control one craft but due to different components on the ship (you outfit yourself) it can feel very differently. AI ships will fight against you or be on your side. Give fleet orders while you do your own things... it's all up to you. Don't let the 2D graphics turn you off. This game has some serious depth into it.			"

So almost lost hope, but when I got into it the game turned out to be remarkebly in depth. lots of goals and a HUGE game system you can play with as you dominate a huge universe. Learning how to move the ships can be pretty horrid , especialy if you have sinus/equilibrium problems as the fluid movement can make you dizzy if you take things too fast..lol Highly recommend this game for it's zanny fun and in depth aspects, conquering this galaxy would give you years of play, and replay and replay again. Will most certianly be looking to get the new one when it comes  out if it stays true to this formula.And as always a plus....they took the time to make a trading card set for us Badge/card collectors. Always an extra selling point!			"

												Overall a great game.Personally, I like to play games while I drink (hey, it keeps the replayability factor up when I forget :-P), watch Netflix and BS with buddies. This game is great for that in the sense that I can step away from it while it's running and not come back to a dead toon or missed out on something extremely important. Also (bonus points) if I get a little too far gone, chances are good that I again didn't miss something that I can't look back on the log to figure out what happend. I think this game may have been made specifically for me.I love leveling up. I love keeping an eye on resources. I love the discovery aspect. I love upgrading and discovering new weapon/ship models. Oh and there's a fun storyline with multiple characters. The best part is that each one of them are friggin♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I hate dainty little do-gooders when it's a universe they just wouldn't survive in. Every character I've come across in this game thus far has been such a friggin @sshole and I love it!I can't wait until SPAZ 2 comes out if it's anything like the original!Play it, or don't.

												I've played through this game several times. I originally bought it on sale through Amazon.com, long before they added the Bounty Hunters to it. I purchased my Steam version when it went on sale recently, just for the added joy of getting the achievements. I mention this to note that my hours in game are far more than my Steam account suggests.This game is actually fairly simple to play and even master. Though the graphics look awesome, they are just 2D, which makes the game run fast and smooth. The controls are easy, and the galaxy is totally customizable in terms of size and difficulty. Obviously, the game has some replayability value, since I've played all the way through at least 3 times, collecting all the tech I could find each time. For me, this is one of those games where I don't come back for a while after playing through it, but when I just want to blow something up, I can come back and be pretty close to my old skill level.Be warned: the story and writing are kind of weak. I haven't looked too hard for mods that might help improve this aspect of the game. I just wanted anyone expecting a grand space opera to be aware. The game's charm lies in the concept and ease of the controls.If the game goes on sale, I'd highly recommend it to people who like top-down, sci-fi shooters, as well as those who like RPG style build-up-my-force-as-I-go games.

 Review: Space Pirates And Zombies  SCORE: 9.0 / 10 - An Indie Masterpiece=== Pros & Cons  + Pros + + Immense variety of weapons and modules (100+) to suit any play style+ Astonishing variety of spacecrafts, from tiny fighters to massive capital ships+ Customizable galaxy: decide number of systems, tech availability, difficulty and more+ Many types of side-quests with always random enemies and objectives+ Beautiful 2D art style and effects+ Arena challenges: you get to pilot a random ship against random enemies for fame and fortune+ Unrestricted gameplay: want that upgrade but don't have the money? Blow up the trader and take it. Or die trying.+ Faction system with allies, enemies and an ever-growing bounty on your head+ Tactical map to give orders to your fleet, with customizable AI behavior and commands+ Modding supported and easy to use with a modular mod selection function+ Good story, albeit a little stereotyped+ A long journey: at least 30-35 hours on high tier difficulty levels. More if you aim for 100% everything. Lot more. - Cons - - In late game it takes a lot of rez (money) to do anything and often you will have to grind for it the long and boring way. Or let your AI ships do it while you tab the game and do something else.- Booster Modules are REALLY overpowered used in certain ship designs / weapon combinations- A particular quest in the Main Questline is borderline broken and WILL make you REALLY mad- Respec debt is way too big: whenever you respec a skill tree you get your points back, but also a debt of XP equal to all the XP it took you to make the points you refund. Basically, you have to do that XP again after refunding and redistributing those points, and it takes AGES specially start and mid game. So think REALLY WELL what you want to put your points into.===This game is brilliant. A true space exploration action with RPG elements done the RIGHT way. Fun, addictive, simple enough but not simple enough to be boring or too easy.Extraordinary gameplay mechanics, almost perfect balance, great variety of stuff to do.This is a game you have to get, leave SPAZ 2 in the shelf and get the original, the true SPAZ.

												As a game inspired by Star Control, it desperately, desperately needs controller support. Instead it uses awkward mouse-aim + WASD in a top-down game, and ten hours in I haven't seen any ship or weapon that really takes advantage of that. Speaking of ships and weapons, there isn't a wild diversity in either - you pick a size of ship, decide whether you want the slightly faster one or the one with slightly more weapons, and kit it out with variations on lasers, projectiles, and homing projectiles. Bombs are basically big missiles with long cooldowns, and fighters are just missiles that fire more often. Combine this with a tech system that results in weapons/systems you don't use much being typically weaker, and the game at hour ten feels very much like the game at hour one. Point your ship at the other ship and hold down both mouse buttons.The great big open starmap looks good until you realize the only real variant from system to system is the level of enemy ships and the presence or absence of bounty hunters, which seem to exist primarily as arena locations and also as another way to slow down the player by putting bounties on their heads. The missions in a level 1 sector are the same as the ones in a level 35 sector.The in-game chatter is terribly repetitive after only a few hours, though it can be turned off.So yeah, kind of a dull game.

Pros: While the graphics of the game is only 2d, it is generally very pleasing on the eyes, especially the procedurally generated backdrop of the various solar systems. You can outfit your own ships. There are multiple technology trees to choose from, each having its own advantages and disadvantages. The music and the sound of the game is good, although not outstanding. The possibility of using a different technology path, outfitting the ships in different ways and the procedurally generated galaxy gives the game significant replay value.Cons: The AI of the ships in combat are very aggressive and stupid. This is most problematic with your wingmen as they have a tendency do die a lot, so you either have to micromanage them in the tactical interface, or accept that you can easily lose 1-2 craft per mission.

												At first I couldn't stand this game because the controls/ui were a little cryptic and ""home made"". But once you get past that stuff there are some really good mechanics at the core. The way the game occurs on different ""scales"" helps this space game not feel so empty (as many space games so often do).At a large-scale, you are making choices about which system to go to and juggling faction reputation to gain all-important research.At a mid-scale you are trying to build a diverse set of ships that can deal shield and hull damange.And at a small-scale you are working with positioning and ship crews to gain an edge in fights.All-around, an interesting take on the ARPG, and something you should at least consider buying.

												This game is great and many other reviews say so.What I want to talk about here is MODS.As you know, a game can be several times funnier (and longer lasting) with mods, and SPAZ is great modding material. On the official game forums you can find several, from small ship adjustments up to game overhauls.My personal suggestion is to get a mod to increase the size of your fleet. Not only the game gets prettier (moar lazers), but also it helps to make the endgame more interesting.			"

 Originally posted on October 28, 2013 SPAZ reminds me why Escape Velocity excited me when I was a kid. It's an all out blast of a top down space shooter, and has a cool sense of humor as well. There are a solid variety of balanced ship types and weapons, and the faction relationships being different for each star system makes it hard to really mess up. The one complaint I had is it felt like a real grind having to build yourself back up after losing a big fight. There should be a faster way to regain resources at high level. Other than that, the game is a great. I would definitely check it out if you're into that sort of thing.			"

												This game is brilliant. There's no other way to describe it. The sense of combat this game gives you is absolutely among the best I've ever experienced. If you're ripping the enemy a new one, you can tell. If you're getting ripped a new one, you can definitely tell.This game can be punishing too, forcing you to grind your way through certain areas, which is a bit of a downside. However, you shouldn't really face that issue unless you're playing on INSANE! and are fighting 10 tech levels above you.There's a lot more I could talk about but all in all, this game a great buy for a cheap price. As of now I've already sunk 16 hours into this game and I plan on sinking many, many more into it. 9.5/10!			"

												An obvious labor of love, and a love letter to Star Control 2... and a leading candidate for exemplifying the necessity of polish in games. It is so mind-bogglingly dull thanks to really poor pacing and a nasty set of balance issues that I really can't recommend it at all. Supposedly it's still being worked on, and I can see modders fixing almost all the problems with the game, but right now it's just garbage. There are ideas and systems in place that could almost certainly be fun, and they simply aren't, thanks to some bad math, for the most part.As an addendum, I feel the need to point out that combat is mindless and broken. Examples: AI is brainless and employs its weapons for minimal effect, often failing to use their full complement of weaponry. Enemy AI uses a simple tactic of running away when their health is low, which can lead to endless chases if you happen to pick a slow set of ships. Your own AI is almost impossible to control precisely and loves to wander into range of enemy weapons, and shoot your allies. In a late-game mission, you are tasked with defending four generators simultaneously: attempting to do so will get them all blown up. But, if you concentrate all your ships at one generator, the enemy completely ignores the other three. The list goes on. DON'T BUY THIS GAME IN THIS STATE.			"

												If you have fond memories of playing Subspace back in the day, but always wished the game had a single-player mode, SPAZ is the game for you.A top-down shooter, your ships handle like the one from Asteroids, with thrust and momentum affecting your crafts as they goes flying across the battlefield. You have an entire squadron at your disposal, but can only directly control a single ship at a time. The others are handled by the AI, but you can and you swap between ships with the press of the button. Each ship can be upgraded or swapped out for different ones better suited to the challenges at hand.Instead of flags and bases, the game pits your squadron against varieties of enemy ships. Your squadron jumps from system to system in the galaxy, mining for resources to upgrade your ships while completing different missions. There isn't too much variety in the gameplay, with most of the missions boiling down to ""blow up everything that isn't yours."" There is a story, too, but it is pretty thin.I got a kick out of the game, mostly for the nostalgia of playing something similar to Subspace. The lack of variety and paper-thin story hurt the game, and give little reason to grind your way to finish. But for the price, it's fun while it lasts, and I'm hoping for a sequel or add-on that fleshes out the core gameplay further.			"

												This is an extremely open ended game, and while the core systems are established early and relatively easy to pick up, there is alot of depth and agency in exactly how you chosoe to navigate through the game. That being said, it is most definitely an RPG, and while the game will never stop you from trying, there are plenty of times when you just aren't tuff enuf for what you are going after just yet.I find this game incredibly soothing, just drifting from one system to the next doing randomized event, blueprints for new tech, weapons and ships trickle in at a constant rate, and you have huge freedom when generating your game when it comes to difficulty, the size of the galaxy, and even the pace of the progression by way of blueprint rarity and the spawn rate of bounty hunters, long and short, its a randomized, extremely streamlined meditative romp through space that operates on the very specific terms you decide.As with the rest of the game, the combat is simple but hugely satisfying, there is just the perfect level of depth to combat systems when it comes to things like the difference between shields, armor and hull, as well as what sort of weapons work best against them, and the presence of multiple hangers and AI controlled ships (whatever ship you aren't using the game takes over for you) means you can create very specialized fleets to address problems the way you want to.As for minor gripes, the game can get a little repetitive, as with the exception of some quests that inject interesting litle subplots (some of the side quests are also insanely funny, the whole game has an air of dark humor to it), you will mostly spend countless hours just knocking over one system to the next, farming research levels and either grinding relations or flat out nuking NPC bases to get their blueprints, and beyond that formula the game doesn't change itself up much from start to finish.Last point, and this is super subjective, but I personally felt that the default hanger slots, as well as the max ship size allowed for each hanger is far too conservative, even with the higher teir mothership in the later game they just don't give you enough ships and size to really flesh out the satisfaction of leading a squad of ships of your own making. Thankfully there are multiple developer sanctioned mods that increase hanger slots and size relative to the rank of the mothership that can be used to solve this if you feel the same way I did,  http://www.minmax-games.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=3108 being the one I choose to use. Be adviced that in the case of this paticular mod, it only modifies the hangars and nothing else, which means that other than potentially losing some AI ships faster (Cus you have more of them) and thus burning rez to rebuild them, it does not rebalance the difficulty of the game at all, so keep that in mind when deciding on the difficulty settings.All in all, fantastic game if you are looking for a progression based experience to mellow out and sink countless hours into.

Becomes increasingly challenging as you visit the more dangerous systems (especially with the addition of Bounty Hunters), but you can always retreat to an easier system to stock up and resupply if things go badly. Not the kind of game I usually play, but much more fun than I expected.			"

Product received for free
This review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to both Steamified & MinMax Games for providing the key for review purposes.First of all, first impressions plays an important part for me personally to decide whether the game is worth investing the time in and even though I enjoyed my short experience with SPAZ, I have to say that it fail to get me hooked. Now, onward to the actual review.Space Pirates and Zombies, or SPAZ for short, is a real time roleplaying strategy game developed by the two-man team MinMax Games and was released back in August 2011. SPAZ is generally well-received and the success of the game spawned a sequel with the same name released only recently as an Early Access title.The game takes place in a distant future where the center piece of the conflict revolves around the discovery of Element 126, or Rez as it's more commonly known. With rumors of the abundance of Rez reserves at the galactic core, you and your crew of space veterans sets out on a voyage to seek the fabled promise of fortune. Of course, things weren't always that easy as the galaxy is in turmoil with the clashes of the oppressing UTA forces and the desperate civilians factions. Not to mention the rising report of zombies incident and the notoriety of the bounty hunters that stalks each system.The gameplay is done in a top down fashion where you control a single ship while the AI controls, depending on how advanced your mothership The Clockwork is, several others and they will assist you to what nature that you've set them via the Tactic panel. This panel acts as your drawing board for devising strategy on how to approach the situation. The game is paused while the panel is open and you can select units and commands them either to attack, reposition or follow you similar to the conventional real time strategy games. Another unique feature is that while you're in this panel, you can access the hangar menu and customize your deployed ships, whether to change them to a different better-suited hull or switching out ship parts to better adapt to the situation. All of this are done in real time as you close the panel so make good use of the Tactic panel to turn the battlefield to your side.This game relies heavily on exploration and the game is GIGANTIC! It amazes me of what two people can achieved with the right motivation. Moving back to the exploration part, you'll have to jump from system to system via the warp gate, searching for rare blueprints to outfit your ships better, recruiting vital crew members which provides significant bonuses to your whole fleet, reverse engineering various hulls so that you'll have more options in combat and various others. Based on what you've chose early on, the galaxy can contain to hundreds of system at once and this will lead to potential hundreds of hours of entertainment.Generally, the game revolves around 4 factions, the United Terran Alliance (UTA), the Civilians, Bounty Hunters and... Space Zombies. Yeah, I'll get to that in a bit. In a system, every action that you take will result in these factions react differently. Anger the UTA too much and you'll have their ships raining beams and missiles on yours and vice versa. To make it worse, in some system where the Bounty Hunters resides, your actions might increase the bounty on your head and collect it too much and you'll have some skilled hunters on your tail. There's also an arena mode held in the Bounty Hunters space station where you can undertake specific challenges in terms of scenarios. Succeed and you'll be awarded with Rez and reputation. I haven't got too far into the game yet but the zombies seems to be the byproduct of a failed experiment and for some reason, it affects ships, or zombies piloting the zombie ships? I don't know but it's pretty whack to be honest but I guess zombies sells.Now, let's move on to the pros and cons, shall we? I hope this will explain why I said the game didn't get me hooked.PROSThe game is HUGE, even with the least preselected systems generated! Fans of exploration games will love this as there's always the itch to go to the next system, one jump after another. Although I haven't had the chance to tingle with the mods yet (available in the site's forum, if I'm not mistaken), I can sense that the replay value is extremely high, given the interests.The combat system feels tight as every aspect of your fleet are customizable and proper planning and strategy will lead you to victory. For a relatively old title, SPAZ still holds well in the graphics department. It's nothing groundbreaking but each new system and planets are an eye candy to look at.On the technical side of thing, the game runs flawlessly with consistent 60 FPS throughout the game and I've never experience any crashes of the sort. There are also various settings provided from the launcher before starting the game. Steam basic features are all present and functional.NEUTRALThe initial loading time is considerably long but I guess that would be better than constant loading time in the game.CONSThe biggest thing that annoys me is how floaty the ship's movement felt in the game. I'm not sure if it's stats related or anything but controlling the ship is a pain and I honestly could not get the hang of it.The factions system feels pretty shallow. Each new system has their own relationship meter for you and it doesn't feel like any of your actions are particularly impactful other than towards the bounty hunters.Even though the world is huge and lots of places to explore, I just can't help but feel that almost every system is more or less the same. Maybe I'm just too early in the game but that's how I simply felt.The tutorials, while good, are pretty lengthy and I admit that I almost quit before realizing the the first hour I've played is only part of the tutorial.The sounds in the game in general is very underwhelming. The explosions from blowing up ships are no where near as good to how it visualized. The soundtrack is also forgettable at best. This is a shame since I generally enjoy listening to in-game soundtracks.The UI and text feels too small at times and this is a major problem for players with big monitors. Despite all the flaws I've listed, SPAZ is a great game, tailored to the niche of the genre and I have to say that they've done it beautifully. Sadly, however, the game doesn't appeal well to newcomers alike and I can only give it a decent 3 / 5.Like I've said, the game fail to keep me interested from exploring any further, even the previously reviewed Drox Operative appeals more to me. However, if games like this are your cup of tea then by all means, go for it. I'm sure in time you'll receive your money's worth because the contents are just enormous.For similar reviews and fantastic giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/. "

You can equip your ship as you like it: (engines, armor, energy shield, any weapon slot, add-ons, crew)every ship in this game is different and almost all obtainable so you won't fly with the same thing until you find the best oneeasy controls, use WSAD and mouse (Yes you control ship by yourself) ;]not enough resources, or crew? No problem destroy UTA, Civilian station.

												A MUST BUY. EXTREMELY GOOD GAME.An awesome 2D top-down space shooting and exploring game, well balanced, with a strong if a bit predictable and cliched main plot. Delivers an extremely satisfying experience in combat, has a light design-your-own-spaceship element - you choose a weapon layout for pre-determined hulls with some ability to modify the bahaviour and handling of your ships - which is excellently done and delivers a ton of fun.All the elements of the game are extremely well done, polished and provide a ton of fun and relaxing space shooting experience. Highly recommended. Probably the best 2d top-down exploration-style shooter ever created.			"

												SPAZ is a hidden gem in my book, I have played this game more than evey other game in my libary (which includes some 60 dolar games). THe replay-ability is extremely high becuase the uniqueness of every ship makes you want to unlock them all especially the later tiers of ships. The randomness of each system ensure that every place to warp to is a surprise. The zombie mechnic(although implemented much later into the game) provided a rush of fresh air (lol) so far into the game that grinding through systems to the center became tiring. The highe level ships are very impressive, providing yet another reason to finish the game. One of the most fun times i have had with this game was when i traveled back to the first couple systems, with fully upgraded war shi[s and absoluting dominating all of the ships/stations that gave me grief at the begining of the game.There are many features that I still have not mentioned, but I will spare you them for the sake of both our mornings/afternoons/nights. I cannot stress how amazing this game is, if a could rate it it would definitly be 10/10. Keep it up MinMax games!			"

I recently started a game and found quite a bit of new content had been added.  Definitely a cool surprise and even better that I didn't have to buy some DLC to get it.  The community for this game seems to be pretty active and a variety of mods can be found.			"

												This is a great game. Deffinately worth the normal $10.00, or the current $2.50 sale price. This game was developed by two guys over the course of a few years. That said, it's difficult to tell it had such a small team because this game is pretty well polished. The only giveaway is the voice-overs. They sound as though they were recorded by friends, family members, and the developers themselves. This doesn't detract from the game, it just brings the player closer to the developers and gives him/her a sence that they are contributing to the lives of these men while they enrich ours through this game.The gameplay is pretty solid with an easy to use upgrade system, navigation system and customization system. If you've got the $10.00 to burn, go get this game and play it through. It's worth it.			"

												SPAZ (Space Pirates and Zombies) is my lastest game addiction. With well over 100 hours played I am still kind of sad to have finished. It is a nifty space shooter/strategy game with witty banter, shiny lasers and purple zombieplague foes. While it can be a little repetitive (if you mess up a mission and lose resources it can be a grind to get them back), certain dynamics alter throughout the story, changing things up enough that it never gets dull.I would like (in an ideal world) to have more variety of species or zones in the galaxy - there seem to be no other life forms around, apart from us. The warring human factions and the added Bounty Hunters are interesting (the Bounty Hunters always turning up when I am already in a struggle), but it feels a bit lonely being the only sentient species out there.Despite these niggles I had a great amount of fun with SPAZ. It is uncomplicated, with an easy learning curve and is quite nice to look at... generally just good pew-pew-laser-shooty fun.			"

												Highly recommended.This is easily one of the best games I have played in years.Althought it does not have the fancy 3D near human modern graphics that most ""players"" want in today's games, I find it far more preferable to those.The game plays exactly as advertised, like the old Star Control games.You are a small band trying to find the magic pot of gold at the center of the universe and travel along the universe, up to 300 systems, fighting and exploring and building up your fleet.The beauty of this game is there is no right or wrong way to play it.  You jump into a system and if you feel like fighting you can or you can dock at a station and bribe the guards.  You can fight one side in a map then jump into the next one and be that sides friends.  Or you can fight both sides if you feel like it.There is enough variety in the ship classes and equipment to keep it interesting for many games yet to come.  Also, the maps are randomly generated each time so no 2 games will ever play the same.What makes this game truly awesome is it was made by 2 people who loved the product and were not out to make a quick buck at the players expense.I can not wait for SPAZ2 to come out later.  I hope I will be the first one to buy that one.!!!!			"

												A MUST BUY. EXTREMELY GOOD GAME.An awesome 2D top-down space shooting and exploring game, well balanced, with a strong if a bit predictable and cliched main plot. Delivers an extremely satisfying experience in combat, has a light design-your-own-spaceship element - you choose a weapon layout for pre-determined hulls with some ability to modify the bahaviour and handling of your ships - which is excellently done and delivers a ton of fun.All the elements of the game are extremely well done, polished and provide a ton of fun and relaxing space shooting experience. Highly recommended. Probably the best 2d top-down exploration-style shooter ever created.			"

												I think the name SPAZ actually make the game seem less than it actually is. The zombie aspect of the game is more like Homeworld Cataclysm than another dumb zombie shooter game. The game itself is very solid and to a point very satisfying with all the ship customization and upgrades available to the player. The little downside is, in my opinion, that it drags on a bit towards the end of the game and tends to be quite repetetive. Nevertheless, I recommend it to anyone who likes solid sci-fi games and doesn't necessarily want all the drama and weight of a AAA title.			"

Its a bit like the Torchlight of space games, you collect and fight and go just on for the next level - again and again.It gets a bit repetitive after you have explored a good part of the galaxy and you have seen most of the missions, but still its fun for me, after more than 20 hours. Well worth the price from a play time / price perspective. And I havent even seen any zombies yet... so theres more of the story still for me =)There is a Storyline to follow and side missions, some funny ones too. You have alot of technologies and shiptypes to discover, different tactics you can try out, and the graphics are pretty and colourfull.I also played the beta before it was on steam, it allready has improved alot since that version and the Developers want to deliver even more content. You can register this game on steam wherever you have bought it, thats also great.If you dont have it allready - get it!			"

It's got just enough depth to keep it interesting, but not over-complicate it with a lot of ""4X sim"" type stuff.   The game's only real definite flaws are it's slightly grindy aspects (the transition from flying around the outer systems to going into the inner ones requires a lot of leveling up) and the uneven difficulty, but luckily any frustration is largely relieved by the flexible modding system that does not punish you for using it.

												Space Pirates and Zombies is addicting, funny, and exciting. The game was made by a small team of independant developers which did a wonderful job with SPAZ and this game definately has a lot of content for your money.  When I was first playing the game, I often found myself saying, ""WHAT IS THAT?!"" because some new giant ship had decided to turn its weapons against me. Thinking back, this game produces a nostalga now and again which brings me to play it even after beating it multiple times. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys platformers, sci fi, rockets, lasers, and strategy. I only have one problem with this game, that being its lack of multiplayer capabilities, but if you get passed that it is definately worth a buy.			"

												Now this, ladies and gentlemen, is a piece of work.It's got an interesting storyline that surprises you with not exactly plot twists- but... surprises. I was using some awfully small ships when I encountered a group of extremely large enemies coincidentally sitting right where an object I need to grab is. I was told to take them out. With difficulty I finished the job.Now, that may seems insane, but when you learn how the CPU ships are going to try to attack you, you'll set your ships to different modes to make use of their evasive moves and such.This game is great, there is a ton to do, from persuading people you're on their side to blowing up bases. Before you know it, you'll have played so much (if you like it as much as me and my friends do) you'll go from taking out a weak Dart ship to blowing up Lvl 3 Bounty Hunter Bases. There's always somewhere to go to upgrade your gear or to open warp gates and such.Fun game. 9/10			"

												SPaZ is kind of a throwback.  Flying 2D spaceships and accepting missions is a lot of fun, and I have fond memories of other games of this type.  This one, though, feels a little lacking in some areas.  You get a decent variety of ships and weapons, plus a tech tree to spend your upgrade points on as you level up.  There's a big galaxy map, except that all the systems feel kind of the same.  There's only 4 factions (military, civs, and bounty hunters, plus the titular zombies that come in later on).  Oh, and your reputation with 2 of these factions, instead of being global, is system-by-system, and randomly determined.  So, you could hop into a new area wanting to do business with one of them, only to find out they hate your guts, and you'd have to take missions for them (or bribe them) in order to turn that around.  There are plenty of randomly generated missions to undertake, but aside from a few plot-related side missions these are all repeatable and repetitious.  The main obstacles standing in your way are the warp gate blockades, preset enemies you have to fight to proceed to the next system, so a lot of what you're doing is just knocking these guys down to get from A to B.  Sometimes you have to train up and get more resources to take on a tough outpost, but other than that..  The big draw here is the combat, and customizing your ships, outfits, and tech the way you want them.If you like 2-D spaceship-flying games, this'll be right up your alley.  If not, there isn't a whole lot here that'll change your mind.			"

												If there is one word to describe SPAZ, it would be ""ambitious"". If there are two words, they would be ""over ambitious"". It has all the parts needed to make a grand space adventure but ultimatly the various systems are not deep enough to support this. The game is divided into two parts.The strategy part has you designing ships, plotting a course around the galaxy and managing relationships between three factions. But those relationships carry only over between systems for one of the factions so there's no long term planning in relationship building. And those relationships can be turned very easily so ticking someone off only takes 1 or 2 missions to fix. The one faction that does perist relationships is only ever hostile towards you so your interactions are limited. The ship design system is deep enough but it requires way too much farming. Advanced ship designs require several blueprints which can only be obtained by destoring enemy (or friendly) versions the ship. Advanced weapons also require several blueprints which can be bought or stolen from the faction bases. On top of all that, the weapons can only be used if you reach a certain tech level which again means more farming.The second part of the game is the tactical action combat. This part has you commanding your ships and piloting one of those ships in space battles. This is where you use the ships you grinded for. Ships handle differently and learing to lead your shots and manage your momentum is key to success in this section of the game. However, because of the slow build of new ships and weapons many battles are the same.But despite all the negatives, it is possible to loss yourself in the universe and just enjoy the ride. It's a fairly cheap game and is often on sale.			"

												An amazing 2D space combat game, SPAZ pits the player and his fleet against increasingly dangerous enemies in their quest to reach the galactic core. With space combat as it's core mechanic, strategy elements, RPG elements and an overworld, it's easily the best game in this genre I've seen in a long time. I'm hard pressed to say anything negative on the subject at all, so I'll skip straight to the conclusion:Verdict: At 9,99 euros, SPAZ sits up near Terraria or Binding of Isaac in terms of price vs quality. It's hard to find a better deal.			"

												I spent a few hours on the demo version of this game before purchasing the full version. I am completely in love. It's simple, yet complex in it's own ways. I love the variety of ship hulls and weapons to choose from, as well as the side missions and factor relationship system, not to mention the art style. Not only that, this game will never play the same way twice. I am very much looking forward to SPAZ 2, and I would most certainly recommend this game. 10/10, would buy again.			"

												If there is one word to describe SPAZ, it would be ""ambitious"". If there are two words, they would be ""over ambitious"". It has all the parts needed to make a grand space adventure but ultimatly the various systems are not deep enough to support this. The game is divided into two parts.The strategy part has you designing ships, plotting a course around the galaxy and managing relationships between three factions. But those relationships carry only over between systems for one of the factions so there's no long term planning in relationship building. And those relationships can be turned very easily so ticking someone off only takes 1 or 2 missions to fix. The one faction that does perist relationships is only ever hostile towards you so your interactions are limited. The ship design system is deep enough but it requires way too much farming. Advanced ship designs require several blueprints which can only be obtained by destoring enemy (or friendly) versions the ship. Advanced weapons also require several blueprints which can be bought or stolen from the faction bases. On top of all that, the weapons can only be used if you reach a certain tech level which again means more farming.The second part of the game is the tactical action combat.

												This game is one of those ""one last turn"" games. It's very easy to wind up sinking entire weekends into this game. The gameplay and content are good. The pool of voice acting is a little small, so you will often think ""didn't I hear that ten minutes ago?""However, I often found that I needed to grind in order to progress, and the difficulty follows a more stepped scheme, rather than a curve. This means that the beginning of an area will be overly hard and the end will be overly easy. It never really feels like it's at the right difficulty level. Overall though, it's fun and worth the price.			"

												I haven't completed the story mode yet (only 21 hours into it so far and I haven't even started fighting zombies yet), but I can already say the game is definitely worth buying.While the story feels a bit cheap in places though sometimes interesting, dialogues feel childish a lot of the times, Total Biscuit admitting to being a bad narator for this particular game (though I can't say he was terrible at it), and the enemy flying away preventing you from killing them is really annoying making a simple small battle take forever to complete (usually resulting in you changing ships just so you can keep up with it and kill it), and among other little flaws the game has... it's a great game. Where this game really shines is the gameplay itself. You can try out a lot of different ships, which they do actually feel like different ships with completely different hardpoints and options. Some ppl think the balance is a little off, but I disagree for the most part, losing ships once in a while is to be expected which is why you have resources to make more in the first place, plus, if you stay in the ""green"" leveled areas (or yellow if skilled), you never have to worry about being overpowered by stronger enemies. I also like the fact that the more skilled of a player you are, the more chances you can take by going in the more difficult areas of the world (so you can either take your time and not have much difficulty or you can go hardcore on it and fight enemies way stronger than you and complete the game much faster).Even at full price, I highly recommend this to anyone who is into this kind of game.

Tons of missions and side missions in a huuuuuge galaxy that you explore at your own leisure.For a two man indie company to produce such a fine game, it renews my faith that the little guys can compete with the big development giants, but just on a different level.I was almost choked up when in the opening screen the developers leave a very personal message thanking you for buying it.I will be playing this game for a very long time.Bravo MinMax!and to everyone elseBUY THIS GAME!!!!

												Space Pirates and Zombies is a point and click adventure game in the vein of Lucasarts classics such as Monkey Island, as well as Sierra classics such as Leisure Suit Larry and Police Quest. It tells the unlikely and comedic romatic tale of Space Pirates Falling in love with Zombies, and their misadventures as they try to make it work. With the Bounty Hunters addition, it turns into a love triangle and will tear at the strings of your heart. Youll laugh, youll cry, the writing is exceptional throughout the twists and turns of the story. Overall this game is a fantasic release from a studio run by just two gentlemen for a knack for releasing heartwarming adventure games. I look forward to their future releases. 8/10.			"

Unlocking new upgrades for your ships is really rewarding, and there's plenty of challenge to be had using alternative weapon setups and attacking hardened enemy blockades.

												A good game till the end im level 109 and still can't defeat the boss. The curve the games takes after act 2 is huge. Prepair for trying the same mission over and over till you quit and never come back. :(edit Well I did come back and I worked on leveling all the way to level 139 and at that point i was able to take out the boss in 30 secounds. That felt so good! 75 hours is good for 7.99 a bit grindy but it was very fun.			"

												I have played through this game multiple times and every time there is something new that I didn't find, or a challange that I missed somehow. I have shared this game with several friends and they all were very interested and enjoyed this game. I personally would recommend this game to everyone at least try it. The only problems with it are minor spelling and grammatical errors along with some swearing that, while sometimes a little irking don't detracted from the game's enjoyability at all.			"

												I love the elements of this which call to mind old-school shareware sci-fi classics. The exploration, resource-gathering, ship design, and combat are all very rewarding, and I like the cast of renegade characters. Highly recommended, despite a somewhat slow set of starting missions.			"

												So, I""ve got lots of very expensive big budget games in my little library. This little indie game is much better, and played far more often then many of them. It puts you in command of a little squad of ships, one of which you control directly. You hop around from system to system doing jobs for factions and trying to upgrade you ships. The ships are very configurable, and there are quite a few of them to play around with. All of this is very addictive. I've blinked and realised a couple of hours have flown by while I've been hopping accross the galaxy looking for that next level reactor part, or missle launcher, or new hull. The size of the galaxy is configured at the start of the game, and a huge galaxy is really huge. Looking back at that statement, it sounds funny, but it's true :). If you find the whole zombie craze very tired (like myself), don't be put off by the fact that it's in the title of this game. The zombies aren't really a ""more brains"" kind of thing, but more like the reavers in the movie Serenity.I've gotten a lot of value out of this game. I really don't think you can go wrong if you decide to pick it up. Oh, and they're working on spaz 2 right now. Yay :). "

												This game is a treat if you like to nerd out by customizing your in-game toys. I recommend playing on a fairly challenging difficulty and playing a very large game (as in, the largest). I powered through a small, not-too-challenging game and then could not stomach a second go at it and I am sad because of it.The often requested feature of multi-player support would make this a true gem of a game. I would spend endless hours playing this with friends were that made a reality.As it is, tweaking out the ever growing ships and dialing them in exactly to your preferred methods of destruction is a great treat. Playing with ""unorthodox"" load-outs can be a game in itself and the game on a whole is being continually expanded upon and improved by a couple of independent developers.All in all a great game and absolutely worth owning, there just is not much more to say about it!

This game is very indepth, ship customization is great, and the story is incredible. I would recommend this game to anyone how likes...playing games. You have the option to have two AI ships follow you around while you do missions, or take control of one of those ships to diversify the way you play (or when your main ship explodes). There are numerous missions to do, at times it does get repetitive, but the intensity does increase as you plan on with loot to take. There are a lot of solar systems that you can visit, and the way you interact with each faction helps determine, what weapons are readily accessible for you to purchaes or scavenge. Down side: I have to wait tooo long for the sequel.			"

Must have.Also, the modding community pumped out some pretty cool mods that are worthy a shot!			"

It is enjoyable, although ti could be better, For such a spectacularly low price that it is, it's a steal, and it's worth every second.			"

												A little mundane at first; there's a lot of information to be conveyed (not information overload, but it pays to read the tutorial screens). The progression of weapons, armor, shields, ship types, and much more keep you playing till the end. Then, in my case starting over on a harder difficulty. There's a lot to like here; the one thing that's a little hard to get used to is the controls are relative to your ship, and not to the screen. I suspect it would have been too easy if they were relative to the screen, but finding that perfect balance of cargo hold, crew capacity and firepower at any given time is great fun.			"

												I've been hooked on this for a while, it's easy to pick up and play with just enough complexity to keep you going. I find myself in that ""one more turn"" mentality. It's an upgrade-based game, and that does mean a bit of grind, which may seem like a dirty word to use, but it is the sort of 'waves of enemies' and 'perfect your game' kind of deal. It definitely doesn't feel like a chore, and stays fun and addictive.Big applause to the devs for breaking up gameplay style in how the chapters work.

												This game is a treat if you like to nerd out by customizing your in-game toys. I recommend playing on a fairly challenging difficulty and playing a very large game (as in, the largest). I powered through a small, not-too-challenging game and then could not stomach a second go at it and I am sad because of it.The often requested feature of multi-player support would make this a true gem of a game. I would spend endless hours playing this with friends were that made a reality.As it is, tweaking out the ever growing ships and dialing them in exactly to your preferred methods of destruction is a great treat. Playing with ""unorthodox"" load-outs can be a game in itself and the game on a whole is being continually expanded upon and improved by a couple of independent developers.All in all a great game and absolutely worth owning, there just is not much more to say about it!

												I would recommend this game for fans of the genre. It's not for everyone, but definitely a pearl of it's kind. A huge galaxy, a lot of ships with even more modules to customize.The story line is OK. It makes sense in the sense that it carriers th games progression, but it wasn't engaging enough to get me back to playing. What got me back was the urge to finally explore all systems, find all blueprints, max my stats and kick zombie♥♥♥♥♥The game has it's downsides, of course. For example the huge galaxy in the standard setting. While it forces you to engage in fight so you level up, you just visit most systems once while passing through. The weapons aren't balanced, some types are rather weak even when upgraded all the way. Weapons also have a fire rate cap, so more weapons will not always result in moe DPS. I also would have wished for a way to change the control from relative to absolute but after a couple of hours I adapted quite well.Overall a ""good"" game which has it's downsides but still manages to bring a fresh wind to the genre!

												Best space top-down view game I've played in a very long time. I've spent hours and hours playing this game. This game is very indepth, ship customization is great, and the story is incredible. I would recommend this game to anyone how likes...playing games. You have the option to have two AI ships follow you around while you do missions, or take control of one of those ships to diversify the way you play (or when your main ship explodes). There are numerous missions to do, at times it does get repetitive, but the intensity does increase as you plan on with loot to take. There are a lot of solar systems that you can visit, and the way you interact with each faction helps determine, what weapons are readily accessible for you to purchaes or scavenge. Down side: I have to wait tooo long for the sequel.			"

												So, I""ve got lots of very expensive big budget games in my little library. This little indie game is much better, and played far more often then many of them. It puts you in command of a little squad of ships, one of which you control directly. You hop around from system to system doing jobs for factions and trying to upgrade you ships. The ships are very configurable, and there are quite a few of them to play around with. All of this is very addictive. I've blinked and realised a couple of hours have flown by while I've been hopping accross the galaxy looking for that next level reactor part, or missle launcher, or new hull. The size of the galaxy is configured at the start of the game, and a huge galaxy is really huge. Looking back at that statement, it sounds funny, but it's true :). If you find the whole zombie craze very tired (like myself), don't be put off by the fact that it's in the title of this game. The zombies aren't really a ""more brains"" kind of thing, but more like the reavers in the movie Serenity.I've gotten a lot of value out of this game. I really don't think you can go wrong if you decide to pick it up. Oh, and they're working on spaz 2 right now. Yay :). "

												Who doesn't like space, pirates, or zombies? A misleadingly simple-seeming game,  SPAZ is actually one hell of a, I want to say RTS? At first the story seems minor part of the game, something to give you a reason to pirate your way across the Milky Way and you become more concerned with blasting anything in your way. As the plot thickens, however, you're drawn into something much more and you find yourself wielding your fleet for something huge.For being made by a couple of guys on a budget, SPAZ is a must own with its dollars going somewhere they can do some good.

Power up your ships, find blueprints and build new ones, customize them with a variety of weapons and systems, or maybe just mine asteroids until your eyes bleed.

												This is one of my favorite indie games on Steam - a true gem. Even though it's made by a two-man team, this is an awesome 2D space combat game. It's not laden with overly complicated interfaces and rule systems like a lot of strategy games, yet has enough customizability and complexity to keep the player engaged. Ignore the story, and focus on configuring your ships. My 40 hours on a single playthrough is proof of how much fun I had. Some may find the combat repetitive eventually, but I found the steady trickle of new weapons enough to keep me invested. I love this game and am very excited for the sequel!			"

												I ended up putting in way more hours than I ever thought I would in playing this game. All in good fun, though. It's a good top down space shooter with a lot to do, some quirky humor, and several different ways of playing (though maybe only a few work best in Insane difficulty -- canons and stealth are your friend until you build up the tech to face things head on). It can be a bit grindy at times, especially when you get to the Zombies part of the title, as you'll want to acquire powerful tech and ship blueprints to deal with them (and this goes double especially on Insane difficulty). But, if you get into it, you'll barely notice all the time pass until you've suddenly put in over 100 hours. A good, well-put together game at a cheap price. Worth the full price. A no brainer when on sale. :)			"

Its a 2D isometric space ship pew pew game that kind of tends to lead you along with the promise of new and better ships and upgrades, but along the way teaches you the complexity of said upgrades and combat. The only downfall I'd say it has is the repetitive ambient chatter, and the godawful character faces/avatars, but then again it was made by just two people.

												This game tries hard to entertain, but does fall short.  Having played games such as Flash Trek Broken Mirror before, this game did not amuse me as much as I hoped it would.  Many of the tasks actaull got kind of repeitive in m opinion and it was somewhat confusing to start.  However, I may just be overpicky since I am comparing it to the great Flash Trek Broken Mirror.Rating: 5.1/10			"

												There was, once upon a time, back in the earliest days of MMORPG's a game that went by the name of Diaspora.  It was a simple yet highly addictive space battle and trading game,  made by a very small team of coders.  Guilds were formed, alliances made,♥♥♥♥♥♥was flung, and all in a small java based applet of 2D glory.Now we have S.P.A.Z; a single player game of space battles and trading with RPG elements.  Very addictive, very funny, very shiny, and above all else, very Indie; made by a team of 2 people.  So Diaspora for the modern day but without the multiplayer aspect and yet just as fantastic.9/10			"

												If you like space combat, endless customization, and many hours of gameplay -- I can really reccomend this game. It was done extremely well for a two party development group.Good music and great graphics.The only downside to this game for e was the repetitiveness, however I did take the time to clear the entire outer ring.

												Space Pirates and Zombies is a point and click adventure game in the vein of Lucasarts classics such as Monkey Island, as well as Sierra classics such as Leisure Suit Larry and Police Quest. It tells the unlikely and comedic romatic tale of Space Pirates Falling in love with Zombies, and their misadventures as they try to make it work. With the Bounty Hunters addition, it turns into a love triangle and will tear at the strings of your heart. Youll laugh, youll cry, the writing is exceptional throughout the twists and turns of the story. Overall this game is a fantasic release from a studio run by just two gentlemen for a knack for releasing heartwarming adventure games. I look forward to their future releases. 8/10.			"

												It's a no for recommend, even though I've enjoyed the game. The end game is wretched. When I say wretched, I mean it is nothing short of a chore.  ""Hunting"" down the infected aliens is less of a hunt, and more of a mindless chase. They run the opposite direction at speeds near yours, only they'll be at distances like 30,000+ . . . The goal is to ""clean up"" a system, or you're labeled as a ♥♥♥♥♥ for not completing the mission. The problem is the real ♥♥♥♥♥ is the coders that can't think of a decent combat. The combat will be over, long over, like ages  . . . and ages  . . . and ages over, yet another stupid tiny infected alien will spawn on the other side of the system. At this point, the only thing you can do is turn around, and have a mindless wait as you drag your ship slowly across the ""system"" (a needlessly large grid) to get to the point where you easily pop the tiny ship.There are great battles, don't get me wrong, it's the hell that is mis-labled at the game that gets my ""No"" for recommend.On top of the lame ""zit popping"" adventure, there is a new element added to the targeting system, where the turrets refuse to aim toward anything you are choosing to shoot at. Something went horribly wrong with an update, and I seriously doubt it will ever be fixed.			"

Blast through endless (literally, infinitely spawning missions) of dull ships by shooting at them with your [weapon choice], fly through the debris and hoover up exp and money and crew members.I honestly don't see why I even have to be at the computer. The AI could be taking care of this with a ""go to enemy and fire fire fire"" routine... and in fact that's exactly what my AI teammates do.That I would rather have this game running without playing it shows that it's not enjoyable to play, just to level up and find out the next % increase on my laser beam length.

												This is a great game to sink hours upon hours into, still only got to the middle, but I am hooked, as simple as it is, building ships and fitting them with weapons you grinded for and blowing up enemy ships has some retro-ish vibes that scratch an itch that modern games just don't give you anymore.SPAZ is kind of like a forgiving rouge like, it has many elements of a rogue like, but you don't loose much if you die, if you have ever felt like going all in guns blazing in a rouge like, but went the safe route because you didn't want to loose your stuff? SPAZ will scratch that itch.The ""cling cling cling"" sound of missiles detaching from your ship, the radio chatter, getting used to your new customized ship's drag while you whiz around firing and dogging enemy fire is such a satisfying experience.Also its nice that you have multiple ships to command and can switch to with ease, you can build your fleet in such a way that is very specific to your tactics, which would not work if the ships are controlled by AI.It does get tedious to grind for materials, but not to the point its annoying.I actually bought SPAZ 2 before this, but I don't plan to move my way up to it just yet, SPAZ 1 is just too addicting to let go.

Gotta catch 'em all.  Though on a side note, now every time I squish a bug I hear ""what did I EVER do to you?!?""  Play the game.  It'll make sense.

												This is a game with a great core gameplay loop - load up a couple of ships with various items and fly them around frantically through a swarm of other ships blowing stuff up. The action-oriented 2D combat is great fun, with surprisingly great physics and object interaction for such a seemingly simple game. The fact that the plot and the elements in play radically changes halfway through the game is a bonus, and works great even though the zombies are spoiled by the game's actual title.There are a few issues I had with the game though. Grinding for resources and data can be quite a hassle - the less you grind, the harder the combat is, because your equipment simply won't be as good. Updating your tech RPG-style is really compelling, but unfortunately not every tech is created equal. Techs all cost the same, but it seems clear to me that investing 50+ skillpoints in, say, Hull strength or Shields is vastly preferable to investing the same amount of points in something like Bombs (a really specific type of weapon) or Crew (only situationally useful). Maybe this depends on playstyle, but I tried investing in things like Subsystems or Launchers at first and found the benefits just weren't as tangible.Also, for a game that probably takes even experts 30+ hours to complete, the fairly small number of mission types gets old fairly quickly.That said, the core gameplay is really fun and made it worth it for me, and the sense of progress you get teching up and defeating fleets that would have smeared you to a paste several hours earlier is tangible and rewarding. If you've got a lot of time and like a simple 2D action game, give this a shot!			"

												Do not let the price of this rare gem fool you, Because the content this game can offer is well worth more! SPAZ is a fantastic, well-made game developed by only two people who had a dream and made it reality, Creating a stepping stone for others to do the same. After 300+ hours into this game, Here's my experience so far.PROS: 1. What initially brought me to this game was how alive it felt, With something always going on around every corner of the galaxy. There are many events and little side-missions that make it feel like it's a living, breathing environment2. While on the surface the mechanics look simple, there is a surprising amount of depth put into how you can personally tailor and customize your ships to your own liking, Giving you the chance to get creative and make many different layouts and strategies on how you want to play.3. The exploration, With the choice of either a minimum of 150 stars or a maximum of 300 stars, You can set the pace at which you play the game to your own standards. Regardless of what you choose, It takes a considerable time to explore each and every different system, Giving you a reasonable space to scavenge for tech that you may need.4.The combat, the main focus of this game, Is very engrossing and addictive. The controls are tight, The gameplay is fluid and it's all easy to pickup, But hard to master. From blasting your enemies away with cannons to steadily melting them to scrap from far away, There's plenty of options for you to take down your enemies. (Or civilians, if you're not in the most merciful mood!)CONS:1. The game can become very repetitive, With most side-missions being recycled, And many tasks needing to be done in order to progress with reputation.2. It can feel very grindy, especially early on in the game when you need to farm resources and levels if you ever get stuck on a quest.3.  The Zombies in the game can become very tedious to clear out later on in the game,  This game has brought me tons of priceless joy, I hope I had shared some of that experience with you all, Because even with all that I said, I still can't express or put into words how much I love this game, Thank you for reading this far, Have a pleasant day.

												This is a great game to sink hours upon hours into, still only got to the middle, but I am hooked, as simple as it is, building ships and fitting them with weapons you grinded for and blowing up enemy ships has some retro-ish vibes that scratch an itch that modern games just don't give you anymore.SPAZ is kind of like a forgiving rouge like, it has many elements of a rogue like, but you don't loose much if you die, if you have ever felt like going all in guns blazing in a rouge like, but went the safe route because you didn't want to loose your stuff? SPAZ will scratch that itch.The ""cling cling cling"" sound of missiles detaching from your ship, the radio chatter, getting used to your new customized ship's drag while you whiz around firing and dogging enemy fire is such a satisfying experience.Also its nice that you have multiple ships to command and can switch to with ease, you can build your fleet in such a way that is very specific to your tactics, which would not work if the ships are controlled by AI.It does get tedious to grind for materials, but not to the point its annoying.I actually bought SPAZ 2 before this, but I don't plan to move my way up to it just yet, SPAZ 1 is just too addicting to let go.

												I really enjoy this game a whole bunch. It's lik Escape Velocity without the trading. If you find trading tedious, this is a great game. Just finding things and making money without dieing too much. It's just fun to play. A pleasure to move the ship around, I mean. The upgrading and items are all very nice as well.			"

												Definitely recommend, to space game fans as well as everyone else. Top down action, RPG elements of leveling the components your ships are made of, souring the systems and planets for new components, and constantly facing new tactical challenges in every battle. The game does get pretty grindy around midway through the story, and keeps getting even more grindy, but if you're smart enough with effectiveness of weapons against certain ships, you'll have a great time.I saw people complain about ""very low and old graphics"" and ""horrible repetitive gameplay"", but I believe not every game has to be a top-notch ultra-realistic adventure. Many indie games are going towards the good old 8-bit days, with pixelated graphics yet such good gameplay, and this game is no exception.The graphics in terms of overall experience are at times cartoonish, and the dialogue can be either funny or dumb to the right person, yet you shouldn't expect a lot of seriousness inside the individual lines. I myself found it very entertaining, although later on I started skipping more lines.Rating, I'd say 8/10 for me. A little grindy, and could maybe use a little more polish on some very minor elements. But again, there are no games I have played that I have enjoyed 10/10, hehe.			"

												This is a game with a great core gameplay loop - load up a couple of ships with various items and fly them around frantically through a swarm of other ships blowing stuff up. The action-oriented 2D combat is great fun, with surprisingly great physics and object interaction for such a seemingly simple game. The fact that the plot and the elements in play radically changes halfway through the game is a bonus, and works great even though the zombies are spoiled by the game's actual title.There are a few issues I had with the game though. Grinding for resources and data can be quite a hassle - the less you grind, the harder the combat is, because your equipment simply won't be as good. Updating your tech RPG-style is really compelling, but unfortunately not every tech is created equal. Techs all cost the same, but it seems clear to me that investing 50+ skillpoints in, say, Hull strength or Shields is vastly preferable to investing the same amount of points in something like Bombs (a really specific type of weapon) or Crew (only situationally useful). Maybe this depends on playstyle, but I tried investing in things like Subsystems or Launchers at first and found the benefits just weren't as tangible.Also, for a game that probably takes even experts 30+ hours to complete, the fairly small number of mission types gets old fairly quickly.That said, the core gameplay is really fun and made it worth it for me, and the sense of progress you get teching up and defeating fleets that would have smeared you to a paste several hours earlier is tangible and rewarding. If you've got a lot of time and like a simple 2D action game, give this a shot!			"

Maybe Pokemon?  I never played Pokemon but I'm assuming this is pretty close.  Wandering around space, blowing things up, hoping for a blueprint part to make a different awesome ship.  Gotta catch 'em all.  Though on a side note, now every time I squish a bug I hear ""what did I EVER do to you?!?""  Play the game.  It'll make sense.

												SPAZ ( and bounty hunters ) is a very good game . The 2 d style works wonderfully , its a verry colourfull game, the planets in the background make you want to visit them . The story is captivating though to advance you have to get to higher levels so you will be able to do the missions , since if you didn t grind you get overpowered by the enemy fast , and the grinding takes too long . Even so you have a lot to do : upgrading ships , destroying ships to take black boxes for more blueprints to have more ship models. "

												SPAZ is one of my top 3 games, only second to Borderlands 2. Don't let its silly name and kinda weird storyline decieve you. SPAZ's simple 2D top down style and insane amount of customization will keep you entertained for months. Installing a mod is easy, and creating your own is just as easy but even more satisfying, because even the smallest changes can completely change gameplay style giving it an amazing replay factor. Aside from the gameplay, the dialogue is hilarious, and side story missions are very rewarding when it comes to stat bonuses. Speaking of stat bonuses, SPAZ's uniquely simple research system can make all the difference in life and death situations. If I could change any one thing about this game, I would make it more popular. Why? Because the TWO developers (yes, ONLY TWO PEOPLE MADE THIS!) deserve more credit and support than they are currently getting. Fore what it's worth, on a scale of one to ten, I give this a nine.			"

												This is a great game. If you know Star control 2 then this is basically a tribute to that, but then with an ARPG twist. It's a bit like Diablo in space. You can explore a very attractive looking 2d universe and shoot lots of interesting and increasingly powerful spaceships and then you can build them yourself and customize them with weapons and upgrades.The story has some interesting twists to keep it fresh and you will feel a great sense of progression. In a nutshell, this game is awesome. It was developed by a small indie company so it is sometimes a bit rough around the edges but the gameplay is very solid and if you like space shooters with progression then this should keep you busy for many, many hours.

Cannons maxed, shields maxed, lots of point im secondary system, almost no points in unused systems... get wrecked by AI ships. Well, sometimes it's still pretty ok, but then you have two enemy ships with equal tech as yourself, but you don't need to know a lot about the game that this won't work.Searching for answers about how to deal with this brings up countless players having the same issue.Trying other stragtegies is no fun because of the random nature of the game and the fact that losses will end up in grinding money to get on track again. Add to this that every respec costs tons of data/XP and stops your progress for hours.Very disappointed.			"

												This quirky little game is great because you can pick it up any time you have an extra 20 mins to kill and want to have some fun.  The biggest detraction is that I find the gameplay a little grinding. To advance between systems you have to be about equivalent or better than the technology level of your enemy. This means you often find yourself grinding to get your tech level up, respec your ships, and then go blast away the bad guys. If you fail to do this you find yourself quickly decimated by an AI who has superior firepower. While I may not have the finer points of ship selection and counter measures figured out, I think this is a fair assesment of the gameplay.

												If you were playing FTL and thought to yourself, ""This is great, but I need... MORE"" Then Spaz is the game for you.If you were playing Gratuitous Space Battles and thought to yourself, ""This is boring, I need... MORE"" Again, Spaz is the game for you.I want to stop playing it, but I can't. I have to conquer the galaxy, pirate-style. Incredibly addicting, and like FTL, ignore any and all dialogue. It's cute, but that's about it.For $2, it's a must-have. For $10, you'll still get your money's worth. I give it an FTL out of GSB.			"

												I picked this up in the winter sale and I quite enjoy it. I remember playing a game called Star Control when I was a kid and SPAZ seems very keen to evoke those memories.The bulk of the game is spent carrying out missions (i.e. quests) which will reward currency and/or reputation with each system's faction. Speaking of which, each system has two sides: UTA (Empire) and Civilians (Rebels). You don't always have to butter up one or the other, and which side you'll have to♥♥♥♥♥♥off will vary from system to system. It's very much up to you how and where you want to go questing, but the levelling process can feel a bit grindy.The combat is fun but not overly deep, and things can get a bit repetitive. I've put 30 hours into it so far and I've only really just got into the meat of the campaign I think. At a sale price, I'd say it's worth it. I wouldn't be disappointed to buy it at 50% off so anything else is a bonus.p.s. If you're on the fence, TRY THE DEMO. It's a good taster.			"

												Reminds me a lot of Star Control II in terms of gameplay mechanics, but with more overarching strategy and customisation going on. The opening blurb says that they wanted to make games that they don't see a lot of any more compared to days gone by and I think they did a fine job of it. The only problems are it can get a bit grindy sometimes, and the AI for your assistant ships is beyond moronic. Apart from that though, I would recommend this.			"

												This game is a very interesting type I've never really tried in the past. It's based on this group who end up having their main station destroyed and reduced to the lowest tech and losing all tech, but you manage to have some to make ships and continue to claim blueprints through the game.As the titles suggest it's in space and you fight against Pirates and Zombies as wll as military and civilian. You can either do jobs for either sides to gain Rez (currency) to buy schematics for new ships or weapons. You can also gain tech points for research into using better weapons, shields and armour.It's certainly a very long game with a lot of grind, but you don't have to buy stuff from space stations as if you are well enough equipped you can destroy their station and steal all they have for free, but it only depends on the balance between how many times you've died and what you get out of it as the payment for making your ship can be very big if you spent a lot of money to make your Ship massive.

												I normally never both to review games on Steam, but in this case I'll make an exception. Maybe this game is a type of genre people enjoy that just isn't for me and that's fine, but the reason I can't recommend it is about 50% of the game could be flat out cut. I've had this game in my Library for a long time and wanted to finish it as I'm a bit of a completionist. However, upon returning to it recently I cannot bring myself to play it anymore. There seems so much to this game and based on what I saw before buying it I was excited to customize my ships and all that jazz but 6.8 hours into the game what have I actually accomplished? Very little. Sure, I could be accused of not being patient or wanting maximum rewards for minimum effort, but in most other games during that time I'd have done more than float about a few quadrents listening to the same dam messages repeat over and over and over. Warp to a place, kill some guys, rinse and repeat. There might be more to this game later but so far I've had so little fun I can't bare to get further. I guess if you really want to find a way to sink hundereds of hours into floating about doing repetitive tasks in the most unfun way possible this is the game for you.			"

												I did not find the combat enjoyable one tiny bit.  The ship handling is sloppy.  The ships have tons of momentum and terrible acceleration so changing directions is a pain and takes way too long.  You spend most of your time flying past your enemies and missing your shots, then trying to turn around for another pass, only to miss again, and then turn around again, and so on and so forth.  Actually killing anything took way too long and was simply more trouble and aggravation than it was worth.  I was mislead by an idiotic comment by a curator, describing the game as ""arcadey"", it's anything but.  Do not expect to get your space combat thrills here.			"

												As I write this I'm 66 hours into this game, and it continues to impress.  One of the most tasteful uses of zombies in modern gaming.  By tasteful I mean that they don't even introduce them until several hours in, not that the zombies aren't disgusting, festering messes.  They are.			"

												The ship unlocks, powerups, and upgrade progression make this game strangely addictive, despite the repetitive and grindy missions. Combat is fun and the controls are responsive... but once you've visited more than a couple sectors, the rest of the game feels like more of the same.			"

												My alltime favorite schmup game. What is better than Pirates? Space pirates obviously. And what about adding a helping of zombie apocolypse? Command a small fleet of customized ships running missions with epic space battles with resource management & technolgy unlocks. Solve your rather straightforward objectives through a variety of approaches (most of which revolve around decideding who to blow up). No one-way decisions or trade-offs here, full respec and the ability to recover from most blunders. All the while treated to a somewhat funny plot, over-the-top characters and excellent ambiance. "

												Do you like spending a looooong time fighting your way through 999999 systems that all feel pretty much the same?Do you enjoy mindless circle strafing and trivial aiming?Do you like a ship customization system that basically amounts to little more than ""give your ship the overpowered machine gun laser""?If so, you'll like this game. Otherwise, not so much. Say NO to strafing in physics-based space shooters!			"

												I played this all the way through (offline) back in the day. It's strange because the shallow gameplay would normally cause me to give it a thumbs down, but there is something about this game that got me totally hooked and I've recently played it halfway through again. Now that I've come here to write a review I've discovered that SPAZ2 has just gone to early access and the video for it it making my heart thump already. Anyway, back to my review...Cons (none of which matter to me)The game universe is enormous but to be honest all a bit samey. You have to complete endless tasks to gain the technology and resources to upgrade your ships, but these tasks mostly involve battling enemies which is really the be-all and end-all of this game. In theory you're supposed to tailor your ships/weapons to the task at hand, but in practice it doesn't really seem to matter, you just equip the best weapons you can find and use them for everything. It's not the most intellectually challenging game.Con (which does matter)There is a storyline to this game, with an ending. After it had finished, to my dismay, I discovered that it was impossible to go back and play some more with the massive battleships I had worked for hours on end to build up. Bear this in mind before you tackle the final task, or make a data backup!ProsIt's all about building bigger and better ships with more and more firepower and watching the battle mayhem. Especially towards the end of the game when huge battleships are blasting each other to smithereens it's a sight to behold, and the amazing thing is that all this glorious graphics action doesn't seem to lag or stutter at all, it's smooth as silk.Now enough of this, I'm off to buy SPAZ2!

												This is very reminiscent of older space exploration games I used to play (whose names I can't remember which is why I picked this up on a whim). You start off piloting a flying trash can and through the tutorial fix it up enough to control a small fleet. There is some seriously deep customization with your ships. With carriers that can support their own miniature fleets to turret covered behemoths that can shoot 360°, both the pea-shooters you get at the beginning and the imperial destroyers you get near the end all have their uses throughout the whole game. There are some balancing issues with weapons (cannons are a swiss-army knife that destroy everything while missiles are useless late game because of point blank defense systems, etc.) and framerate slowdown once the zombies joins the fray, but patches are being worked on to fix these issues and add more content.If you enjoy 4X games, this $15 variation is worth your money just for the nostalgia rush.

												There is a bit of a learning curve up front, but this game is a gem once you get going. Along the lines of Starscape (which I've previously recommended), you are gradually exploring the galaxy using small ships deployed from a larger mothership. As you go, you will develop relationships with local civilian or military factions, fighting missions for them to gain experience and advance your research. Upgrade all aspects of your mothership and deployable crafts, and iteratively gain the ability to explore more of the galaxy. Oh yes, and there's zombies, too. Good times.			"

												Frustrating, tedious, hard.  Sometimes SPAZ makes me want to eat my keyboard at times.Yet I come back to it.  Why?  Why?  Why?Update: The frustration outweighed the fun, finally.  I stopped coming back to this game.  Too grindy later in the game.Actually, I know why.  The game doesn't have the most balanced mechanics, nor does the difficulty ramp up all that smoothly (more like, brick-walls on you if you aren't careful).  But it's a 2D space combat simulator with a teeny little bit of RPG tossed in for good measure and a heavy exploration element, and by God's Bones, they dun make games like this no more.There's lots of ships to unlock and lots of goodies to toss onto said ships, so at least if you feel bored using one sort of build you can swap it for another.If you put in lots of hours in games like StarControl, Escape Velocity: Nova, StarFlight and Solar Winds, then buy SPAZ and enjoy it.  If you have no idea what any of those games are, then you might want to pass.  Then again, it's on sale at times for just a few bucks, so what do you have to lose?  Aside from a few bucks.Pros:* Nobody makes these kinds of games anymore, OH WAIT, they did!* Lots of ships and weapons/upgrades to discover.* Big universe to explore.* Nice visuals and sound effects.Cons:* Big universe to explore.  Becomes tedious after a while since systems must be unlocked one at a time.* Chunky and slow during big space battles, especially later in the game with lots of ______'s flying about spewing chunks.  (*Spoilers!)* Space battles can end up near-stalemate battles of attrition, which take a long time to resolve.* Less story-telling versus games like EV:Nova, etc.			"

												Fun simple space game. Control 2-4 ships of different sizes which you can customize a little (i.e. choose weapons and features according to specific spots). Each system basically has an oppressive government group and rebellious civilian group. They’re relationship with you depends on the system and your actions. You may enter one system where the government loves you and the civilians hate you, then move into the next system where the gov. hates you and the civies love you, then the next system they both love you. You actions in one system does not affect the others. The missions in each system will affect your relationships in that system so be careful. Unique game, fun to play. Pros-	Each game is randomly generated so your experiences will always be different.-	Simple to learn/playCons-	The story doesn’t necessarily enthrall you but its there.  "

Space Pirates and Zombies is an open-world, 2D space-themed shooter and everyone should buy this game. Not only is it amazing that a team of two created this, but they did a really good job on it. They did a better job than some large game corporations have done on games before. Amazing combat, soo much to do, hilarious dialogues, really cool story, and you have ultimate control of how you get to point B. You can power your way through, or take your time and get everything one step at a time, just depends how you like to play. This game is for all styles of gamer and you should get it!

												This won't be a review that shows all the facts, the pros and cons. It's rather going to be my personal love letter for this game. I picked up Space Pirates and Zombies a few years ago, not long after the release. Since then it really found a straight way into my gamer heart, making me play it again every few months. I can say without doubt, that this game is among my Top 3 favourite games of all time!Who didn't want to fly around in big space ship discovering the universe when they were young? SPAZ made this dream come true for me... at least on the screen. It is the perfect mix of flying around, discovering, building up your small fleet, fancy and colourful explosions, tactics, ship management, looting and a simple but funny told story, which matches the title. There's always this next blueprint you wanna get in order to upgrade you ships. There's always this next planet or galaxy you wanna visit to find out what treasures it withholds from you. There's always this next mission you want to complete, this next ship you want to destroy, this next achievement you want to achieve. And just like this hours passed by and I experienced how evenings turned into nights turned into mornings, until I was finally too tired to continue with the adventure of my small space fleet.In the end I highly recommend this game to everybody felt a little of the joy and excitement while reading this. Even if you won't get as much out of it as I did, I can still pretty much promise you quite some hours of fun. And if this game is on sale, it really is a must buy!			"

You can make the game as hard as you want, and tackle challenges too big for your britches!  The story is neat, though it does kinda give you an♥♥♥♥♥pull at the end.  The interface and controls are smooth and dialed, even if they don't look super polished!There's a lot of strategic choice and at least three distinct playstyles with the weapons and armor you choose, the AI is pretty good, and you can control a BFS (big ♥♥♥♥ing ship).  What's not to like?			"

												Space Pirates and Zombies (SPAZ) is a top-down, 2D space pirate combat game where you explore the galaxy completing quests, finding resources, and upgrading your ships.  There is a story here, but in between heavy grinding sessions, I forgot what was actually going on.  Overall, the game is fun and the combat is exciting, but I did get frustrated many times after getting thoroughly whooped on the battlefield (battle-space?).  Hopefully SPAZ 2 will be released soon with improved features and gameplay.PROS+ Controls are intuitive once you get used to them (WASD oriented towards mouse pointer)+ Combat is mostly fun and exciting+ Large number of ship upgrades and modules to purchase and find+ Customizing ships is fun (weapons, armor, subsystems, specialists)+ Resources (currency, data, and manpower) are plentiful+ Each star system has factions to interact with via quests and events (but...see CON)CONS- Mothership can only be upgraded after certain story missions (required for most other upgrades)- Grinding is necessary to advance- Most missions ultimately feel the same (battle after battle after battle...)- Since faction respect doesn't carry between systems, it feels rather unimportant long-term- Needs autosave function			"

												I'm a fan of 2D space games so this was a game I picked up a while ago. Currently on sale at £1.74. A shooter at heart, but the more you play, the more delights it unlocks. Gets a little repetitive, but worth supporting the indie market and games like this as it will push the scene further. The developers have just released a free add-on pack, so I'll no doubt revisit the final zombie frontier.  Would I reccommend this.   Too right I would, it's a nice little gem thats worth trying.

												6.5/10SPAZ has an amazing demo, the full game however has a few shortcomings:1. The mercenaries are just too damn powerful to fight and extort you at every opportunity (oh and you WILL NOT win that fight!) The game NEEDS an option to disable them!2. The game revolves around grinding cash then bribing both fractions at EACH gateway. I’ll go guns blazing next time?? But I think the diplomacy route is too tedious.3. Personally the fleet you have at the end, IMO just isn’t grand enough…I kinda hope I’ll blast through this game again soon. "

												It's a space RPG where you play as the ships. You start on the outside of a galaxy and fight your way through worlds and space police checkpoints to get to the center og the galaxy where everyone prospers. There's a decent backstory behind it.At times the game really feels like a grind, but thats okay, it's an RPG. You fight, gain exp, and upgrade your stats. The usefulness of stats are: small passive bonuses (aka armor bonus, % health increase, etc) and your skill level allows you to slot the different parts (weapons, armor, etc) onto your ship. There's like 12 -15 different areas to level up in i believe. Like shields, armor, hull (general structure integrity once armor is gone, aka ship health), engines, reactors, beam weapons, etc. It's pretty in depth.If you like games like atom zombie smasher, you'll like this. You are given a top down view of where you fly in space. There's hot keys to do various things, and you can switch between any ship flying with you in the same sector at any time. Say, your ship gets destroyed or sent to repair, you can control another one in live battle. There's factions, whether they like you or not in each sector gains you access to parts, or you can try to take them down yourself. They act as bosses bt provide decent xp.Yeah, just get the game. ESPECIALLY if it goes on sale. Right now it's 80% off so it's $2 ($1.99). There's no reason not to buy this at such a steal. They're currently making Spaz 2. Can't wait. Oh, TB does some voice acting. The character voices kinda suck, but it's cool.Downsides:Can be a grind regardless of skill/ level (its an RPG)Sometimes too much reading (i get lazy)Voice acting sucks (this doesn't affect gameplay)			"

												I HATE HATE      HATE HATEHATE          Trying to learn new complex games that are a really great but it's fun.  What I mean is that I just learned how to play Project Zomboid(coincidence, not on a zombie kick), FTL and a couple others and I wanna know how to play instantly because my brain is about to explode.   I Just got the basics down on this and got through my first gate and did a couple side missions and can tell this is gonna be a great one(game that is) and I'm going to compare it to FTL and hope to not get yelled at and because I just wanna say that it's kinda like FTL but much more better because graphix and seems to be deeper in stuff and mechanics and well everything.   9.5/10 so far.  I guess -.5 for the tutorial skipping on a few much needed pointers/tips. I highly recommend reading and/or watching some tutorials.    There is one on youtube that I watched where a dude plays through the beginning but doesn't do a great job explaining what each thing is so it's probably best to find other info out or play the demo and then watch his vid like I did   Yeah, I did the demo for an hour and kinda kept it in the back of my head that dying was ok because it wasn't the real game yet, so this may be a good strategy for others. Also S.P.A.Z. 2 is coming out soon I think and hoping I get enough play in here to help me there.    Hope this helps and that the ""and's"" were a bit humorous and not annoying(eek...) "

												This game is decent. It's got a really good concept and the story is well fleshed out. But after a while the difficulty curve becomes steep and pushes you into grinding too much. There are a few things that could be done to balance this out but the game needs more things in it. It feels like it needs more polish. Worth a few hours if you liked FTL or similar games. Otherwise I would skip it.			"

												This game could be so good, but you're so underpowered and even the lowest enemies take a solid 10 minutes of laser fire to kill. You have to constantly get these ""resources"" called ""rez"" for some reason to build ships, but each of your ships can only hold about 2 units of ""rez"" before it has to take it back to base. But you can't make it back to base, because your ships are basically made out of paper and you have ♥♥♥♥ing flashlights for laser beams and you keep getting torn apart by every enemy in sight. So you have to keep using resources to build more ships, which keep getting blown up...It just feels like everyone's having a party and I don't belong there. ♥♥♥♥ this game.			"

												This game has provided me 122 hours of entertainment. Which is an absurd amount for many games of its type out right now. Granted, I never want to play it again due to both doing all there was to do (within reason) and being completely obsessive about looking at every ship, every part, and every configuration thereof. It has this weird feel about it that makes me remember the ""games you can't find anymore"" as the authors call it. Without actually being able to call to mind what games it refers to exactly.The art is quite unique and detailed. The character portraits are randomly generated for specialists which can generate some amusing stuff. The plot-relevant portraits are made using the same dada-style copy & paste technique that the specialists do, just not randomly generated. It's pretty charming really.			"

												Call me a casual but . . . it seems like this game needs a little more instruction in the beginning.  I would quickly get to a point where I would fulfill the tutorial objectives, but then after that have no idea what to do.  I tried experimenting with no success, and the game didn't have the draw to encourage me to keep experimenting.  There's no indication if you're doing the right or wrong things.  At least with other games if you suck you die.  Here, you just kinda float around.I tried to like this game, but after hitting a brick wall on a few different playthroughs relatively quickly, I shelved it.			"

												SPAZ is a top-down space shoot-em-up that has pretty graphics and some nice RPG/upgrade elements for a variety of unlockable spacecraft.  It's a great game to play when you need to kill some time, but the repetitive missions keep it from being much more than that.  However, SPAZ is a great companion to FTL: Faster Than Light;  where FTL requires you to adequately manage infrastructures amidst turn-based combat, SPAZ does that♥♥♥♥♥♥for you, and lets you just kill things in real-time until you get bored.

Even on lower difficulty settings against enemies of a lower level than you, this game can easily turn into an exercise in banging your head into a brick wall until one or the other breaks.Ultimately the gameplay just isn't varied enough to keep up with the grind.

												I quite liked this game- the playstyle, the graphics, even the atrocious, cheesy writing. As a quick aside, they apparently even got that TotalBiscuit fellow to do a great deal of exposition, and while he’s not the greatest narrator of all time, it does lend a certain gravitas gravy to the cheese. Kudos all around.However, once the zombies get introduced, I quickly lost interest. I was actually rather looking forward to playing as a space zombie, which doesn’t appear to be a thing, but more than that there seems to be a distinct lack of good ways to deal with them. I’m sure there’s something I’m missing, but I take umbrage at having to do research on a game to defeat zombies- I, like general use of zombies these days, am a little tired…			"

												Game goes fine until a mid-game ""change"" (trying to avoid spoiler). After this, the game becomes nigh unplayable IMO. The simplest of missions will involve you taking down 30+ ships.....with your 4. They do come in waves somewhat, but thats little consolation. Your reward for this slaughter, should you succeed? Not enough enough resources to rebuild a single huge ship (the largest hanger size you can field). The only other game i can think of that i've played where i hit a ""wall"" akin to this was Diablo 3 in torment. Maybe some hardcore people enjoy beating their head painfully against walls like this, but unless you consider yourself one of them. Dont waste the initial 20-30 hours getting to that point. Save yourself the effort and just go bash your head on the nearest doorframe.			"

												Game's annotation says what it is open world sandbox, but truly you will always be clamped by the main story quest. This game also doesn't have enough side quests. Each 10 space systems you can find only 1 side quest, so this game turns to ""collect resource, kill 1000+ weak enemies to get tech lvl up"" and then repeat it hundred times to complete another main quests and unlock new ships and new space systems. So if you really want to play old school open world space action game you should choose  Space Rangers . This two games like earth and sky, like perfect ancient masterwork and new poorly made copy of it. Don't waste your time on SPAZ. It doesn't worth it.			"

Story missions are massive spikes in difficulty requiring a lot of leveling from you.  They didn't make a massive randomly generated galaxy for the fun of it, as you will be wandering around picking fights and strip-mining it to get the xp and tech needed.

												I expected more of a strategy game, but the bulk of the gameplay in Space Pirates and Zombies (SPAZ) is about twitchy 2D space combat.I struggled to master the controls. I would have preferred a basic twin-stick control system, like Robotron. Instead, SPAZ features an awkward combination of using the keyboard for thrusters, and the mouse for direction and aim. The result is a game that looks like hockey pucks on an ice rink flying around, shooting wildly at each other. It's really unpleasant to play.I've played the tutorial mission through twice now, and each time I have come away wondering why I would want to continue. The gameplay is poor, and the various elements of SPAZ don't come together to make a pleasing whole. I'm underwhelmed, and happy to set this aside.			"

Because you can insta spawn new ships! If you have enough resources you can basically just pain out the game untill you win. But its gameplay is very boring.This might just be me, but it seems like the humor/story is like an inside joke going around the devs, and they have a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of story in their head that we never get to know about, then they write in parts of it and you are left going... uuh... what?I outright disliked the game and it is the worst thing I have ever spent my money on.Sorry for the harsh review but that is just how I feel about the game.

												I am trying to get into this game but I am finding the combat and movement controls very awkward. Most times if feels like you are just spinning around on one spot shooting things. Very little manovouring. Movement is similar and sometimes it's difficult to see if you are moving since there is usually a large planet in the background, which barely moves, so it throws you off. As well during combat there is little feed back visually or physically. Meaning your ship hardly reflects any damage or somehow impacts your movement. I know the game is created by a small team and is well done for what it is, but the above really is important, I think, for a game to have. I might give it more time. But I don't feel I can.			"

												The worst game I ever played in my entire life. Everything is boring, nothing gets you entertained.SPAZ is a space ""shooter"" game and when you are used to control fast engines, in this game it's freaking slow and for the best part of the game, you're shooting lasers, because missiles are mainstream.You mostly take 10 minutes to kill a piece of sh*t with those lasers and again, when you think you're almost having fun, the ennemies are flying 20 000 km away but they won't leave the area, no, because you're having fun chasing them for nothing. In the end I got with a ship I couldn't destroy because he was escaping me anytime he's almost dying. And when he's out of my sight, he regenerates.The game has more than 100 areas to explore, all of them look the same and are infinite in length but empty of things.Each area has missions, pretty boring ones and repetitive. It also has a level system, 100 levels it seems, but totally useless because every ability you increase does no effect! It's only useful for new engine parts: lasers, shield, cloak, etc.The level can also tell you how hard an area can be. But you will always die more than 20 times before clearing one.There's plenty of ships to unlock, each ranged by class: small, medium, large, huge. You won't get something good before getting a huge ship, that means, in the end of the game when you have nothing else to do.However, mods can give a great visual but nobody gives a.. and only 2 mods are available: halloween and xmas. wow.I admit I played with a trainer but even with that it's a pain to play this horrible game.2.5/10			"

												This topdown shmup isn't just a arcade top down shmup like astroids. The game has rpg elements where you have to do missions and upgrade your fleet. In Mount&Blade style you have a fleet just control one ship in battles. It's a nice twist on the genre. But the problem is that the shmup gameplay is boring. The controls are bad. You need to play with the mouse+keyboard and the mouse is used for steering. Also because of the rpg elements the combat is slow and the missions aren't interesting. SPAZ has potential, but just isn't very fun.			"

												Before you ask, no, i dont have a steam copy, my copy of this game is actually non-steam (humble bundle, look it up), but this is a really cool ship combat game that i suck at.  Despite the cheesy title, this game is actually a really fun game all in all, mixing all sorts of things into the game.Storyline in a nutshell: New element, Rez, is discovered. This one government, the UTA, uses this element to make warp gates that can let ships travel to different solar systems. However, they're total warp-gate nazis and the civilians dont like it, so they get their own ships and start fighting UTA (peaceful civilians... who said that?) ships all over.Just a little background knowledge.Now, what you do is use these ships to take a side on factions... don't worry, whatever you do will only affect faction relations in the system you're in, which means you can go take down a huge UTA convoy, go to a different system, and poof! Aside from that system, nobody gives a crap! Very fun gameplay, and when it comes to taking sides, its always open for change. However, you will start at different levels of relations with factions per system, and... whatever. Just play the game already.			"

												If you are offended by foul language, steer clear. It isn't just enemy pilots about to die; it isn't just in dialogs with lowlifes; it is in the ambient sound for the game itself (presumably intercom chatter aboard your own vessel). Totally unnecessary, and adds no value to the game.Now, after turning the noise completely off, and ignoring the dialogs (which you can probably get away with, since the in-game indicators tell you what you need to do next), you can get around that objection, so what is left?A lot of grinding. I don't mind grinding, generally, but I appreciate some sort of appreciable reward for grinding. Admittedly, I didn't go far in the game, but the whole time I felt behind.Regrets that I can't give a positive comment. Building and maintaining a small space task force is right up my alley, so I thought it would be great. It isn't.			"

												Space pirates and zombies... Although the ideas for a great game are there, the way they were implemented was a little off the mark, and it isn't very addicting gameplay, the story and voice acting is basically little to none. Although it is fun for a period of time, and if multiplayer was implemented as well as a much wider array of spaceship upgrades I can see potential.I would not recommend SPAZ, i'd rate it about a 5/10.

												""There is potential here, the ship customization is nice.But the game also feels very grindy. Some missions are fun, others just feel like BS-Also the control sceme is somewhat awkward.""The bit above was my original review, i wrote it about 3 or so hours into the game.Now, having finished it after about 45hrs of playtime (that's a single playthrough, so if the game can keep you engaged, there is very good playtime value in it... Most of it was repetive/grind-ish missions however), i am somewhat torn. In the long run it was better,  than my first impression. Certainly not terrible. However, was it good enough, to change my vote? I don't think so. On a more refined scale, i would have voted differently - a 6 out of 10 perhaps. But with only ""Yay"" or ""Nay"" as possible votes, i'll stick to my initial negative vote.After all, after wrtitng that original bit, i stopped playing for a few days. Might havenever returned, but was really-really bored, so took it up again.A few nice extras came up, but my two main complaints - grind and awkward controls - remained in place.The story was ok for a open world-ish combat game, where no one really cares about story anyway. Predictable and very cliche, but enough to keep you moving from chapter to chapter. Actaully, when changing chapters there were a few interesting changes in the mechanics. Late game even had something a kin to a basic strategic layer, with defense chokepoints and ressource management - very-very-very basic, but nevertheless, an interesting change of pace.However, it did not do away with the grindy-ness. Rather the need for ressources increased. To progress the story i had to do the same missions over and over again (same objectives, slightly different maps). In the end i was just cherry-picking the missions, that i could do the fastest (cloak, destroy the target, get out).I had unlocked all the ships, all the modules about half way through the game. Picked my favorites rather quickly too. Most new unlocks i only tried for a short while (one or two fights), found them inferior, to what i already had and never used them again.Now, i am willing to believe, that there is some bit of personal prefference involved - other player might select other ships at some point. However, there is also somewhat poor balance - some ships of the same class, are clearly and stricktly superior to others - more health, more equipment slots.Bounty hunter designs in particular seem very strong - perhaps a sort of power creep in the development process.My main complaint remains the control scheme, even after 45 hours of gameplay i still wasn't fully used to it. I can't even rightly describe it - it's just not intuitive. Basically the strafe controls are pivoted on the ship, rather than on the screen. And since the ship can be spinning all willy-nilly, depending on where you aim your mouse (which is where your target is, so you can't just say ""screw it"" and steer with the mouse), the direction of strafing is kinda flipping around, so sometimes ushing left, will make you move left, while other times you push left, yet go right. That made strafing completely unviable for me.			"

												A conceptually good game that ultimately suffers from being very grindy and surprisingly difficult.  The grindy-ness is kind of just the nature of the game and if you can deal with the controls and feel immersed in the universe and enjoy the combat, you probably won't care.  Most games are repetitve after all.  But I found the universe to not be quite as interesting as advertised and the rpg-like elemnts of the game to be not bad per-se, but not really compelling or interesting either.The difficulty is at least to some degree, a by-product ofthe awkward controls.  This game needs controller support, it begs to have twin-stick controls.  Its just too hard otherwise it would be a fine little game.  A lot of people apparently adapted to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls but I just couldn't as a long time Geometry Wars type player I just can't get the hang of the combat........and thats the entire game so yea.  Its slightly unfair of me to knock the game because I suck at it......but how much foresight and budget would it really have taken for them to include controller support?  Ring Runner Flight of the Sages manages it at a similar price-point and would be the game I would recommend instead.			"

												I do not recommend this game.Gameplay: Way too repetitive.  At the end, you're just holding down the mouse button while your turrets do the work.  And the game likes to start throwing 'attacks' against you after the first few levels, keeping you from warping out unless you hit one of the menu keys quickly enough.Story: Garbage.  It also impacts the gameplay too heavily (prevents you from researching / building / etc. until you get past certain story missions), killing replay value.  Also, way too long on the default settings.Audio: S'alright.			"

												I really wanted to like this game and there's quite a few things that are good about it, but it's just not nearly enough to recommend this...What is SPAZ?This game puts you in a more or less randomly generated 2D galaxy. You can set the amount of star systems, the difficulty, the tech advancements and randomize the tech tree. That's pretty much it. I've played a game with 300 systems and started one with 150. I honestly don't see the difference, which already brings me to the biggest issue I have with it:This game is utterly and truly boring. You are going to do the same thing over and over and over and over again. That is: Fly to a subsystem, complete missions to raise your standing with 1 of the 2 factions, which of course hate each other, in order to gain resources you need to (re)build ships, gather upgrade points and buy new modules like better shields, etc.There is a main mission to follow, but honestly after 10 hours of gameplay I've not been able to progress this very much, since every main mission is multiple sub systems apart. Now, you've got to understand that these subsystems have a level requirement attached to it, which means you need to break a blockade to access a new subystem. That in turn means grinding out levels to get more upgrades and fighting against superior foes either technologically speaking or just sheer numbers. The next problem with this is that you only get new and better ships by destroying these same ships multiple times first to get the blueprints. In my first playthrough I just didn't get any good ships that would even survive against the enemy for a few seconds most of the time. It doesn't help that most damage is unavoidable and your ai ships are dumb as ♥♥♥♥.In the end this means ginding, grinding, grinding...and that's not what I was looking for in a space exploration and combat game. Not to mention that after 10 hours there are still no zombies, so I can't even comment on how the gameplay changes after you reach that stage, but since I was finally able to complete another main mission, only to realize I need to grind another TEN levels to even GET to the next mission area I said ""♥♥♥♥ you"", as this is a bottomless pit. Even with just 150 subystems you're going to be doing this for 100 hours I feel. Not worth it, especially since the gameplay does not change at all throughout the whole game. The only difference is that you get bigger ships that move slower, but the main combat system and weapons stay the same. Pretty disappointed in this one. :/			"

												Oh, look! A game set in space where you to read tons of witty text to learn how to build ships! And it got ""Zombie"" in the title! Not boring or ripetitive at all! SO indie and original! I really do not like this game. Often compared to Star Control, it has neither the charm nor the entertainment of the game. It tries to imitate an old game style that died for a reason; it's not very good. The game starts off promising, shoots itself in the foot. The game is Repetitive, with a capital R, with such abysmal lack of content I don't understand how it got released in like so. You get maybe a handful of ships to play with, and the majority of them you will never use. At no point in time through playing the game did I ever concern myself with resources, as there was never any need. If you play well you're given everything you ever need. The missions feel tedious and the grinding for blueprints is aggravating, not to mention the restrictive modular system it presents. Why make such an amazing modular setup, then take it away, forcing specific pieces on the ship designs? So instead of getting a massive fleet of awesome variety, you get... cookie cutter setups. It makes the whole system feel a waste.Perhaps I am too hard on the game. It gave me 2 hours of entertainment! But afterwards, it felt so old, so repetitive			"

												It's been a few years since I played this, but I really did enjoy it quite a lot. The story was fun and compelling, the challenge was inviting and encuraged you to explore around for resources before progressing, but without it feeling too grindy. The Bounty Hunter update also improved many of the problems the game originally had. I'm really looking forward to SPAZ2 as well, which I know is quite a different type of game.			"

												SPAZ is a very good surprise: 60% action, 30% RPG and 10% strategy. It is a mix of X3, Space Rangers and Elite. The story is not original but it is well told. There is a lot of black humor in dialogs and the characters are charismatic. They are far more different missions than in X3 Terran Conflict and you can build a mini fleet (four ships) with a wide choice of hulls, weapons and technology.In overall: A very good and pretty long game especially for the price!

												This game is very addictive.  At first, I was confused as to how to play it, but the tutorial was sufficient to help me get started.  The main draws to this game are the upgrades.  Purchase blueprints from one of the factions, upgrade weapons, engines, crew, armor, shields, etc.  Play smart in combat so that you  can afford the to keep your ships up to par with your tech.Two downsides to this game: 1) it is repetetive.  You'll repeat quests that are very similar many times until you'll come to recognize them.  2) Ship layouts aren't customizable.  Otherwise, I recommend this, and expect great things from S.P.A.Z. 2.			"

												SPAZ is great fun initially, but repetitiveness tends to wear off the whole space-faring laser-shooting vast-exploring novelty.It can get frustrating trying to figure out if you're losing your battles because you haven't grinded your tech level up enough, or if you just suck at dogfights. I still haven't figured out yet.7/10, but with little replay value.Great job for an indie game though, definitely worth checking out.			"

												Top down space shooter with an addictive progression system. It feels like a 2D Freelancer flying around upgrading ships, blowing up pirates, civilians, zombies, police cruisers all the while upgrading your little band of mercenary ships makes for an absolutely fantastic time. The open ended nature of the game gives the player freedom to go where they like while the narrative gives a general direction on where to go next. Combat is fluid and each ship handles a little differently as a space game should. All this made by two people. Weapon and ship upgrades keep the player going for 'just a bit longer' into the wee hours of next week.Get it, play it, love it. "

												This is really a good game.  And, it's only about 150MB to install.  It's a space exploration, resource gathering, space combat strategy.  I'm not much into RTS games, and this game doesn't play like one.  You have a mother ship, and then control individual ships in your fleet.  You can switch between any ship, and also set up AI for those ships you aren't currently controlling.  The galaxy is proceedurally generated when you start a new game, and you can control the number of star systems up to about 300 total.  Each star system has a level requirement before you can visit it, and you have to deal with the ships guarding the Jump Gates (bribe or destroy) before you can move freely between systems you have access to.Really, try the demo.  The tutorial is for the first system but seems to open up after about the 1st or 2nd mission you take.  This 2 person dev team deserve your money.			"

												You're a space pirate out for profit and martial power while navigating a massive, randomly generated galaxy that you can set the size and level of difficulty for.  Blowing stuff up and buying weapon blueprints allow you to reverse engineer better stuff for your personal squad of ships.  There are multiple resources to manage for a wide variety of uses.  As you collect Data, you can invest research into 15 different technology categories to augment your play style.  If you feel you've made poor choices, you can reallocate research... though it causes a reasonable setback.The simplistic design of the game contrasts greatly with its resulting complexity (similar to Chess, but to a much lesser degree).  The amount of freedom is likewise staggering. The  ships, gear, specializations, even the method used to traverse the galaxy, all of this stuff is up to the player.  The very tight controls, thorough balance, and terrifying zombies of course add to the greatness.			"

												This game is super addictive and fun! Well worth the money.It has an excellent simple to control combat, the difficuly on default normal is just right and I have always felt it's my own fault for not being prepared for a fight or getting in over my head when I've had to retreat. It's also very forgiving of failure, which so far has merely meant licking my wounds and spending a few minutes gathering crew and money. Sometimes by taking my rage out of weaker systems at the same time.The only time I felt I had an unfair loss (I'll skip the mission details, save to say I needed to be stealthy) and the one thing I can point out that actually needs improving is the AI ships on your team that you're not currently controlling will sometimes ignore a ""passive"" command and fire at enemies anyway when you're trying not to engage. I simply recycled those ships and went solo and succeeded later, then rebuilt the ships again which takes mere seconds afterward.The good number of ship selection and weapons, and the ability to place different weapons or boosters in slots give you a advantage, or occasionally disadvantage, and give a feeling of variety and tactics to the combat. If you choose poorly you needn't fear losing a mission usually, you can go into the ""hanger"" screen refit your ship(s) and have them warp out and a handfull of seconds later warp back into the map.It has an ""rpg"" element that you level up and select to upgrade over a dozen types of parts of your ship to work better and be able to equip new things which further gives you a feeling of being in control of your ships.The visuals are very beautiful and colorfull eye candy, but you can see all that in the pictures or youtube vids.

												After following the development of this game for a while I am pleased to say that the wait was worth it. As with games like Terraria and Super Meat Boy, do not be fooled by the simplified graphics as it more than makes up for them in playability and addictive content.The game universe is HUGE, hundreds of star systems each with multiple planets for you to explore. Each planet within a system offers missions or events for you to encounter. As you complete one mission another is generated as the universe evolves with every action you take.On release there are over 30 ships for you to obtain and dozens of technologies to research. In order to advance the available technologies or ship designs you will have to blast your way through the galaxy and salvage the blueprints and data you need.The only criticism I would make is that there is no multiplay feature but the developers are continually adding content to the game and hopefully they integrate multiplayer mode(s) in the future.

												An interesting 2D shooter with RPG and strategy elements. There is not as much variety to weaponry as I would like, however this can be rectified with 3rd party mods. The moment to moment gameplay usually consists of blasting enemy ships to pieces, then swooping over their dropped black boxes to pick up blueprints to build more ships, and resources to level up and purchase new weapons.The Zombies in the game do provide an interesting mix up to the standard space combat, manifesting as infected ships that can shoot zombies at you. The UI could be more intuitive, some interesting options are buried in drop down menus that may not be obvious to most players; the ability for turrets to autofire is extremely useful, but is hidden in a drop down box and thus went unnoticed for a very long time. Graphics wise, the game will win no awards; however the textures and effects are servicable and lean more toward the humorous side of things. The tone of the game is not overly serious, this is quite succintly conveyed by the cheesy dialogue. The story is enitrely forgettable, as is the back story. It all reads like some terrible work of fan fiction; I understand that such a small dev team is unlikely to be able to afford a decent script writer, but attempts could have been made to hone their writing skills through free online courses.The game is fairly customizable upon start up, and runs well even on a back - up Intel GPU on a laptop. Overall, given the price, I would highly recommend this game to anyone interested in space games or 2D shooters. It is obvious that a lot of love went into the production of this game, you are even greeted with a thank - you from the developer every time you start the game up. I look forward to the impending sequel, and wish that there were more games of this type floating about on Steam.			"

												SPAZ is truly one of the best games i have played since years.Sure, it does not offer the brilliant uber graphics from many modern shooters, but hey - that is neither intended nor necessary.The whole rest - including gameplay itself, long-term motivation and simply FUN to play - is totally worth it. It is as if you can feel around every little corner of the game how much heart has been put into it.Considering the fact that this game was created by mainly only two guys, it is a true masterpiece.Very good job, guys!

												I haven't run into a game quite like this one, and even if someone wanted to make one, they might look at this and give up, because SPAZ seems to do everything right. If you're like me, you will relish the experience of improvment in games... levelling up, getting better gear, the kind of stuff that RPGs and dungeon crawlers are known for. But SPAZ takes that same ambition and does it in a different way, offering a fresh experience that will still satisfy your thirst for being the very best.			"

												I've played all 3 Escape Velocity games, if that is what these guys were trying to emulate they failed.This game is overly complicated from the beginning, it has a difficulty curve like a mountain and has combat that simply doesn't have a good feel to it, which is important as there isn't much more to this game.  There is a plot, some narration, but honestly the level of the dialouge and the amateur art designs for the charcacters caused me to ignore it after about 10 minutes.This is Diablo in space, you manuever around, try to damage opponents and mostly are just trying to click at the right times to line up shots against VERY agile opponents.   You also constantly have to keep track of how allies are doing, your ship is usually worse then your competitions and there are more of them then there are of your fleet (as opposed to most ARPGs where you have an advantage but you are facing a horde).  It is very easy to die but that's ok, because using your mined resources you can then use them to respawn yourself and your fleet.  But you can and will run out of resources, therefore making you not be able to respawn, at which point the game tells you to go get in a very very very crappy ship and start mining, but anyone with common sense will tell you to reload your save instead to save you the mindless grinding that would entail.This is grossly dissapointing because I feel there is a lot to this game, it generates a new galaxy for every game which would seem to have a huge amount of content but I couldn't get past the second star system and had great difficulty getting past the first (which was the tutorial).  Maybe this game was made for the nintendo hard crowd, or maybe I just suck, but I just don't have the time or patience anymore to deal with that.  Although after looking at the universal badge progress on this game, I can tell I'm not alone.Don't trust the metacritic score, although I will say there is something here but you have to be pretty dedicated/skilled to find it.

												Score BasedChallenge - A- Game is intuitive, presents a reasonable difficulty progression, and a excellent learning curve Starting Tutorial is fun and engaging presenting the necessary information without being boring Minus a few points for content that wile interesting, where also tedious and overly time consuming.Game Quality - C Game is very well designed and provides a fresh and unique feel that sets it apart from other similar games. Content is fun and varied, supports a large number of play styles and tactics, all retaining use throughout the game Biggest hit was for low Replayability.  after beating the game i just didn’t feel any need to keep playing.Refinement – A Played the entire game, start to finish, and never once crashed or encountered a noticeable bug  Balance and effectiveness of ship types and equipment scale well with difficulty (altho some ships never get used due to late availability in the game, making some of the contents use questionable) Developers seam to take an active role in the games player community (very impressive for only a handfull of people)Presentation – B Not a graphics intensive game, however what is included is well themed and well implemented User interface is intuitive and easy to use Kind of hokey in an odd sort of way.  Story line is a little weak, however still fun and interesting enough Hype was dead on.  This game is exactly what it looks like, exactly as advertised, and well worth the play time.Additional Content – B+ Game supports all manner of Mods and additional content Developers have released a small number of fun holiday themed mods for community use Modding utilities have also been released to general community, they are complete and effective they do however require some investment in time, energy, and learning to use correctly  Relatively active player community, including a functional wiki, and several active modding forums.Fun – C+ Surprisingly Immersive, despite its rather primitive look, engaging and enjoyable Intensive enough to keep the players attention, however some aspects did become tedious and frustrating. Wile not in my top 10.  It defiantly has several core quality’s that make it a 'Must Have' for any game collection  Total Grade – Solid 'B+'this is a very good game.  A solid experience all the more impressive due to volume of content, and the relatively small development staff.  At the time of writing, this the game is priced at $9.99 and it is worth every penny.  Will likely get SPAZ 2 when it comes out.			"

												Highly addictive, and loads of fun. You collect resources, fight battles, gain levels, build bigger and better ships to take on bigger and better enemies and further unlock an impressively expansive galaxy. It's not a complicated game, but it can challenge you (and that's a good thing), which is where the addictive quality of SPAZ comes along. You never feel overpowered (not yet at least) because there are always more solar systems to explore with higher levels required to clear them, but you never feel underpowered either, because you get out as much effort as you put in to leveling up. You have to level up, and you have to explore, but level-grinding doesn't seem so bad because there are so many activities to do with a certain ammount of variety to them.  I also like the fact that you can play both sides of the coin when it comes to making allies or enemies out of the two factions of SPAZ's lore, and take on missions according to how your favor with either faction benefits you.I've sunk in about a dozen hours so far and have barely scratched the surface of the universe I'm exploring because of the game's exploratory rewards feeding the kleptomaniac in me. Highly reccomended. Oh, and did I mention that this game is loads of fun?			"

												I was blown away by how awesome this game is! It piqued my interest because it looked vaguely similar to a game I used to play in my younger years (Inner Space, look it up!) but I was not prepared for the awesomeness contained within. This game is my new addiction, I can't get enough of it! The upgrade system is stellar, the different ships and upgrades are varied and lend to an amazing assortment of strategies, suited for multiple play styles. The reputation system within each system independant of each other means you can have fun and not screw up what you were doing in another place. I just love it. I can't wait for #2 now!			"

Take asteroids, give it steroids, add enemies that shoot back, factions, awesome weapons, upgrades, several new dynamics, add in some good ol' zombies, and put it on a galactic scale, and i think you'd have this game. The 15$ is DEFINITELY worth it.			"

												Right off the bat. This game is a joy to play; I could definitely tell that this game was made from someones passion for classic space RPG. It combines mechanics from classic arcade games with modern graphics and a sprinkle of Atom Zombie Smasher; not to mention a standard RPG leveling up system; making a very user friendly, casual and a heck load of fun to play. With a variety of ships to unlock fallowed by weapons and other unique upgrades also customisable ships ; you will be burning through hours and hours of gameplay. However like most RPG games, quests does get repetitive after a period of time such as killing or collecting X,Y and Z etc and not to mention pretty mediocre voice acting. On the contrary, with new updates underway to expand the game, this is sure worth the money. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves classic space RPG or have good taste for games in general :)			"

												For a two-dimensional space shooter, this game has a lot to offer.  It makes me think of what EVE Online might have been if it had been concieved as a single-player game back in 1995 or so.  It excells as a casual stress reliever and is pretty much guaranteed to keep a player engaged in short bursts for a good time.  However, the set pieces begin to repeat themselves after a while- after all, it is still a work in progress- (In the same manner that Team Fortress 2 is a work in progress.) but a damned good one at that.

												The game is hands down one of the best indie games I have played in the past few years, easily in my top 5 indie games when you consider it's ""fun factor"". The graphics are very pleasing especially for a cartoon look. The sound fit's the game well as does the artwork. SPAZ has several difficulty settings ranging from ""casual just play for fun and never lose"" to ""please just kill me now"". On it's most difficult setting even the most experienced gamers will be tested. The galaxy can be created relatively small (still very large offering many hours of gameplay) to massive offering literally hundreds of hours of play time. The map is also randomly generated so replay value is high. Bounty Hunters (free DLC) adds a fourth faction to interact with adding new ways to explore or destroy star systems!All in all a highly suggested purchase that will offer something to all gamers, casual and hardcore alike.

												Goofy name, amazing game.Keeping it short this game is amazing if you're into customizable ships, strategic real time combat, and an open world to travel and explore as you see fit but with a storyline and a specific overall goal. In many ways it's kind of like a real time Space Rangers. And it has a ton of replayability. There are a wide array of skills that dramatically increase the effectiveness of certain mutually exclusive parts (like a shield or a cloaking device) and also allow access to interesting and unique versions of said item. So for instance you might play through one game using cloaks and missiles, whereas another game you might not use a cloak or a shield and instead rely on armor, hull and improving the capability of your crew to repair damage while you're taking it. Options, options, options. All quite well balanced and viable, even if some are 'more viable' than others. "

												This game is 90% great and 10% rubbish.  Its great when everything is going smoothly and you're rampaging around the galaxy killing stuff and its terrible when you get a certain map with an AI ship (in one of the fastest ships in the game) that shoots at you for a bit then runs off when it is near death, then comes back and shoots you again before running off.  When you have done this for 10 mins straight you will hate this game as much as I do - however, with a bit of patience you will realise that you can re-fit your ships mid-match to allow you to catch the tricky bugger or use drones which are faster than most ships.  .

												My only issues were...Pacing:  It felt like it took forever to upgrade the mothership and I ended up using the same ships for hours.  Also if  you need resources it's kind of a grind to accumulate them.  And the upgrade system kind of keeps you locked with regard to what weapons you use.  Switching to a different weapon type costs you all of the upgrade bonuses which typically doesn't work.Saving the game: If you get invaded when going to the mothership to save, you could be forced to fight another 10-15 minutes of ships and reinforcements before you can save the game.  I just ended up getting bored of playing and quit without saving.			"

												If you were a fan of the old school ""escape velocity"" or ""escape velocity nova"", this is the game for you. This is by far the best Space Combat Adventure game to modern date with similar graphics and gameplay. I have replayed this game more than six times already. Most of the Main Mission Quest Cutscenes are voice acted. Can't wait for the second game in the series. If you are you new to this genre of space combat adventure style game i would suggest picking it up and playing it on ""easy"". The beginning is somewhat easy, but towards the mid to end of the game deaths can be pretty costly if you play reckless like i do. Easy to learn and pick up, but hard to master... Suggest to casual and hardcore space combat enthusiasts alike.			"

That is a small map.  40 hours in a game is well worth the money but throw in the replayability of this game and youve got a great little time killer on your hands that has a lot of potential for expansion.  I'd give this game a 8/10 which is high for me. I'd love to see the customization of ships expanded and maybe a little more control on the AI of your fleet. but other than that, its a quality game.

												This is a fun and cheap indie game. I've really enjoyed playing with the different ship loadouts and trying to combo them together in unique ways. It's a basic top down 2D shooter type with spaceships. The physics are a little strange at first, but easy to get the hang of. Once you start planet hoping and blasting through the security gates, the game really picks up.Don't be afraid to wrekt everyone that gets in your way. You earn more by killing enemies than anything else. Relationships with the UTA/Civs don't really matter unless you can't wipe them out easily.My only complaint: The AI for your ships auto-pilot is horrible. The programming for any advanced tactics isn't really there. My ships often would fly directly into the face of enemy fleets and sit still trying to face off against everything at once, no evasive manuevers of any kind. There's not really anything you can do about it except try to switch and make them move out of the line of fire quickly. However, the instant you leave a ship... it begins Rambo-ing in.But honestly that didn't become a big issue until near the end when ships are expensive and extremely powerful.I've had a great time playing despite the AI weakness			"

There is a perpetual grind in this game that really, REALLY grates after twelve hours.It is fun! For a while. Looking past that, it is a good title I recommend. The gameplay and combat is sound with a wide variety of ships and a steady, worthwhile progression system. Oh and the story is top-notch, because it doesn't take itself seriously. Puns, jokes, and general asshattery abound.If you plan on buying it, try the demo first, wait for it on sale, and maybe look out for the sequel.			"

												SPAZ is a top-down space grinder. You start with almost nothing and build your way up to the commander of a squad of ships. As you complete story missions, you gain access to larger hangars which means larger ships to command. You can manipulate your enemies and scavange their ships after they've destroyed one another. You can eradicate infections and undermine the local rebellion or authority figures. Pros-Fun! Collecting the various weapons and tools, then customized your ships to find the best combinations is hours of enjoyment.Unique! Not many games I've played have the variety of units and unpredictability of SPAZ. I've seen ships that shouldn't have succeeded destroy others that are twice their size.Cons-Wash, Rinse, Repeat- A bit repetitive at times. Requires lots of time grinding to find the blueprints for all the ships. Not always the most fun, but it DOES make getting your first HUGE ship so rewarding.Angry? Have some Goons- Very easy to manipulate the factions by bribing them with goons (a sort of influence currency). Once you're on their good sides, you can just wait for them to butt heads and collect the cash, goons, data, and blueprints left over from their conflicts. Not super challenging.Braaaaaaains- The Zombies are very unique and sometimes absurdly over powered. Still need to get used to them, but their initial strategies require you to change your thinking ALOT.9/10 BUY IT (ESPECIALLY IF IT'S ON SALE)			"

												My only suggestion is to play it on normal difficulty or easier, as the harder difficulties compound the problem with this game stretching into the bad end of the repetition scale. Still, with a host of ships to build and customize with many different attachments, it's fun to simply try out new combinations and strategies. The AI is competent enough, though exploitable (and your AI controlled ships are sometimes similarly stupid). This actually works in the games favor, however, IMO. Overall, the controls work great, there's lot's of customizability and skill that goes into your victories and defeats, and this game was made by 2 guys. I want to see what they can do next, personally, so I'd like to see them make some money to do so.			"

I spent nearly a week playing this and that is a lot for me, The story is by no means amazing but it is still decent and quite unique, the gameplay is unique as well and is very fun.As you work through the game you make enemies allies and can upgrade 2 to 3 and soon 4 ships of varying sizes and types.  The flying is a bit wonky least for me so I would usually pick a bigger ship with turrets to sit and fight.This game has a demo and at the very least is worth checking out that to see if you wanna buy it, its better than some of the higher priced games I have bought and very much worth the time and money for an enjoyable indie.

												SPAZ is a great arcade space shooter / RPG with a mouthful of a name.  It contains exactly what it says: space pirates and zombies.  You explore the galaxy, dealing with different factions, doing missions to level up and increase the size and power of your fleet.  The ships handle very well and are very customizable.  Friendly and enemy AI is very competent and can make the game quite challenging, depending on the skill level you set.The one large problem I ran into with the game was pacing.  I ended up having to spend pretty lengthy amounts of time searching for the appropriate level systems to do missions in in order to level up in order to continue the story or move into a particular system that was several levels higher than me.Other than that though, the game is quite fun and a bit of a challenge.  It was worth it, despite all the extra time I had to put in.			"

												Now of course there is room for improvement but it does so many things well. The battles are fun, intense and usually pretty challenging. The management elements have depth and require thought and skill but aren't as daunting as you would expect. Un-lockable hull types with the ability to customize those hulls, weapons, shields and more. A very pretty game graphically, especially for an indie game with a 2 man development team. I've spent time just watching the A.I. battles that play in the background on the main menu screen. Now the ship controls can feel a little odd at first but once you get used to them they make sense. In short, if you have any interest in space battles and fun sci fi stories you have to own this game. I love it and have bought multiple copies for my friends. Good luck and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.			"

												Reminiscent of a golden oldie called EV Nova, SPAZ isn't perfect, but is sooooo much fun; this game is worth it at retail, but it's been on sale so many times that you should just pick it up whenever it's for sale. This game was made by TWO people - AWESOME!			"

												This game is pretty badass. It has the perfect combination of Twitch Skill, Tactical Manuvering, and RPG-like progression. It's horribly addicting to keep cruising around space, hoping the next fight you get into will yield the blueprints you need for a sweet, 6 turret-ed ship to round out your fleet.The story is pretty meh, but I just skimmed most of the dialogue anyway. The background chatter that plays during missions and the billboards floating through space can be downright hilarious though.Since I got this on sale, my only compaint is that it might make me buy Space Rangers 2...

												What's not to love about a game that lets you fly through the galaxy being a giant prick?Tight controls and a very satisfying combat system can drag you into playing this game for hours saying ""Just a few more levels..."" The physics engine is on point and all ships have a very unique ""feel"" to them, tight and responsive fighters, weighty and bulky Doom Cruisers, a little bit of everything in between.Be warned though, being a ♥♥♥♥♥ure Han Solo and getting your flagship destroyed too many times will have you farming up the cash to continue plundering the inner galaxy for hours, the endless grind for money is the only negative on an otherwise flawless indie space shmup.9/10 "

Controls are pretty good and what you upgrade matters (never upgrade your engines and your ship will be super slow and turning will require a huge radius and will be super slow. The game looks really good and actually has a pretty good story. Bottom line, buy this game already! its well worth the price and there is lots of replayability.

												If you were a fan of the old school ""escape velocity"" or ""escape velocity nova"", this is the game for you. This is by far the best Space Combat Adventure game to modern date with similar graphics and gameplay. I have replayed this game more than six times already. Most of the Main Mission Quest Cutscenes are voice acted. Can't wait for the second game in the series. If you are you new to this genre of space combat adventure style game i would suggest picking it up and playing it on ""easy"". The beginning is somewhat easy, but towards the mid to end of the game deaths can be pretty costly if you play reckless like i do. Easy to learn and pick up, but hard to master... Suggest to casual and hardcore space combat enthusiasts alike.			"

												This game is 90% great and 10% rubbish.  Its great when everything is going smoothly and you're rampaging around the galaxy killing stuff and its terrible when you get a certain map with an AI ship (in one of the fastest ships in the game) that shoots at you for a bit then runs off when it is near death, then comes back and shoots you again before running off.  When you have done this for 10 mins straight you will hate this game as much as I do - however, with a bit of patience you will realise that you can re-fit your ships mid-match to allow you to catch the tricky bugger or use drones which are faster than most ships.  .

												This game is fun, but procedural generation is (in general) sort of boring. There are lots of systems, to unlock to get to the core but they are all the same. The thing that adds interest is the progression of unlocking new ships and new weapons and you discover and buy them.Good tip if you are starting: If a faction has things for sale in a certain system, do the quests in that system that make them like you so you can buy it.  Will anyone ever make a game as good as Escape Velocity: Nova? Thats what I want! Seriously if you know of one please send me a message.			"

That is a small map.  40 hours in a game is well worth the money but throw in the replayability of this game and youve got a great little time killer on your hands that has a lot of potential for expansion.  I'd give this game a 8/10 which is high for me. I'd love to see the customization of ships expanded and maybe a little more control on the AI of your fleet. but other than that, its a quality game.

												This is a fun and cheap indie game. I've really enjoyed playing with the different ship loadouts and trying to combo them together in unique ways. It's a basic top down 2D shooter type with spaceships. The physics are a little strange at first, but easy to get the hang of. Once you start planet hoping and blasting through the security gates, the game really picks up.Don't be afraid to wrekt everyone that gets in your way. You earn more by killing enemies than anything else. Relationships with the UTA/Civs don't really matter unless you can't wipe them out easily.My only complaint: The AI for your ships auto-pilot is horrible. The programming for any advanced tactics isn't really there. My ships often would fly directly into the face of enemy fleets and sit still trying to face off against everything at once, no evasive manuevers of any kind. There's not really anything you can do about it except try to switch and make them move out of the line of fire quickly. However, the instant you leave a ship... it begins Rambo-ing in.But honestly that didn't become a big issue until near the end when ships are expensive and extremely powerful.I've had a great time playing despite the AI weakness			"

												I played it yesterday all day long... this is the kind of game that sticks to your subconscious and stays there, I continued playing it in my dreams... all night long. That's why it is difficult to let it go. The crave to advance and enhance your ships, and the way to do it just drains your volition dry. I suspect the design of this game was made taking in to account our neural responses. There is even an evil satisfaction when your crew picks up hostages from the floating escape pods... and some of them will be jettisoned out into space, and teared appart by the ships because they refuse to be recruited... allright I confess I have ran over many of them. Pretty scary.  10/10			"

Vast possibilities of combat, fragile alliances, boarding enemy ships (indirectly), giant explosions, lasers and rapid-fire guns. Also stealth for those who want it. Along with that some RPG aspects like upgrading your tech and commanders. Get a big ship, equip it with death and wreak havoc upon those who oppose you.			"

												Space Pirates and Zombies appears at first glance nothing more than a retro style, 2d space shooter. But after playing it a lot, multiple playthroughs and challenges, it has a ton of depth lying beneath it's 2d surface.You start as the leader of a small band of merchant pirates yourself seeking your fortune by collecting mineral deposits call rez. There are rumors of enormous stockpiles or rez near the core worlds so you set off to seek them out. Along the way you encounter zombies and eventually take on the gargantuan task of ridding the galaxy of them.The first thing you do is set your world settings. There's multiple difficulty levels, 5 or 6 in total so you can vary your experience immensely, as well as settings for galaxy size, pirate density and tech distribution. You can create a unique experience for every game.Once you are playing the game has three main areas. First is the galaxy and system maps. You travel to different systems and you can select various missions in each one to level up your crew, buy or steal tech and collect rez and ship designs. The systems all have different levels so you have to decide what you can potentially accomplish.The next big part is your ship loadout screens, tech and hangar. In the tech screen you spend data (experience) that you have gather to level up various ship systems like beam weapons or shields. Each level increases the effectiveness of your systems and some levels are a prerequisite to advanced tech. Like you need level three beams to deploy particle beams or something. Then in the hanger you choose which hulls to use and what systems to put on them. You start with three hangars at the beginning of the game and get four by the end with larger capacity for larger hulls.The final major area is actually flying your ships on the planet or area of interest screens. They aren't always combat screens, some missions you might gather rez for example. But while on these screens you can switch control between all your ships as well as issuing orders to the other ships to do certain things like rendezvous over here or attack this target. Sometimes pirates show up, sometimes zombies, all depends on the mission. I found there to be a good variety of events and missions.The actual combat is extremely interesting if you make it challenging enough. Because there are so many types of ships and systems the way you fight can be varied. You might make a fast missile boat ship and whittle targets down while keeping out of their gun range. Or you might make a stealth capable ship, get in close and crush em with high powered beam cutters. Or maybe you want to use rotating turrets to track fast moving targets. It's up to you, there's no wrong way to do it, and a lot of times you have to adjust on the fly based on the tech available.Hull designs are obtained by killing enemy ships of that hull. Sometimes one ship is enough but most need 3 or 4 blueprint pieces. Tech for subsystems like weapons, engines and all that is obtained from planets either by trading with them or blowing up their bases and taking it. There's also specialist crew members who give you distinct bonuses like +10% cannon damage. So that has to be taken into account as well.In all there's a ton of ways to customize your game and your ships and it's very fun. I enjoyed leveling in this game immensely. The only downside is the hardest difficulties are REALLY hard and you end up basically grinding resources in low level areas to advance. But hard should be hard so I commend the devs for doing that. I guess you could fly smarter, not harder, if you're really good and get by with less.Finally there's challenges too via a little space arena the pirates run. It's a good way to make money and there's some achievements with it. Some are very hard.This game simply rocks and you have to try it.			"

Its quite a fun take on it all in a 2D top-down shooter.There is any number of ways to build and play, taking a wide variety of options to the gamem but it does ultimetly boil down to a gindfest, but still an enjoyable one.This definetly is one I'd reccomend.

												10/10 Very addictive game.  I played about 1 hour of this game 18 months ago then came back and started a new game 2 weeks ago.  It took me 80 hrs to complete a new game.  The addictive part of the game is chasing the next upgrade, blueprint or skill levelup.   I recomend game saving alot early-mid game.  The game was very challenging till, Hammerhead ship dropped toward the middle of chapter 3. The game became super easy after getting max level cannons and Mammath during chapter 4.  Mammath is OP with triple mount Partical Cannons, double mount Mass Drivers, and Battle Station.   This game reminds me of a 100x more advanced version of Asteroids, that I played hundreds of times in the mid-80s at the YMCA.  The game has a good story and great 2d graphics.  Another similarly enjoyable game to try is Reassembly.			"

												I Dig it, it's simplistic, but then that's kind of the charm of it. If the intro is true, then the aspirations and ideas of the two developers really shine in this game. The best way I can describe it is a 3rd person, space exploration/combat with a large customizable starmap (which is pretty sweet considering you never play the same game), with a healthy dose of rpg and a dash of strategy mixed in..

												SPAZ is an amazing game! It is a real-time strategy game where you control a small squadron of spaceships from a 2D top-down perspective. Battles are fought by the player taking direct control of one ship while the other 1-3 ships are AI controlled. Resource management is pretty straight forward- all ships are purchased with ""rez"" and crewed by ""goons"" that you either recruit or press into service. Ships are highly customizable. I have only two gripes: The written story dialog is terrible, both poorly written and sometimes confusing, and there is some grinding involved to level-up your ships; though overall, the fun game play, simple to use tactical commands, and customization of the ships makes this game a must have.

												Great indie title that can be approached in a variety of ways. On easier difficulties and on large planetery systems it plays like a Diablo-esque version of Beat Hazard where you grind enemies for research (xp), goons (prisoners) and REZ ($) in order to improve your fleet. On higher difficulties and smaller galaxies you need to approach things more cautiously and you'll need to plan ahead. There are many types of ships that you can unlock by reverse engineering their hulls and each ship can be upgraded with a variety of weapons (rocket launchers, turrets, lazers, drones, etc). The game offers a per-planetery system alliance mechanism, a research system involving  dozens of technologies that directly effect your ships (engine,hull,etc), a trading system, some randomized missions and events. Combat is real time but there's also a pause button/tactical screen. There's more than meets the eye in this one.			"

												Its a grinder pure and simple. Story line is about as stupid and weak as you would expect. The missions are hack and slash rinse and repeat ad nauseum. Still its a fun game and the mods make it a little less of a headache. Worth 2-3 bucks but not more. There is a great feel to the game but the content can only support about an hour or two of game play. The problem is that the developers seem to want to make a 100+ hour game and decided to do this by copy pasting the same quest over and over and over again. You fly from one star system to the next and do the exact some thing in almost every single one over and over and over again. Still its a reminiscent isometric game and nostalgia has a high value for some even if it is by definition repetitive. Overall I'd rate the game 3/10.			"

												Don't let the simplistic design and humor fool you, this game can be very challenging at times. The difficultly curve is just right to prove enough challenge to keep things interesting and the progression keeps things fresh enough as to not become too repetitive or dull. I love games that really give you a sense of progression and feel where your actions actually matter. The end-game micromanagement is just tough enough to keep you on your toes but not cause you to rage quit. If you like top-down arcade shooters, flying around as a pirate, managing your own fleet, saving the galaxy, or any combination there of, you should give this a look.			"

												I had a ton of fun with this indie gem.  The game is easy to pick up, but delivers on strategic challenge later on.   The battles are usually fast-paced and enjoyable, with many different valid strategic approaches.  Except for a few technologies that go obsolete, all the equipment you find can be used right up through the endgame, because you can equip small AI-controlled helper ships to help you on missions. I did find that the game was too easy, but I could have raised the difficulty.  Also, sometimes the enemy AI will use a fast ship and simply fly away from you, which it can do indefinitely, making it impossible to complete a mission.  This means that you may have to repeat a few missions for no other reason than that.  If you want a multiplayer experience, hold off and buy SPAZ 2, as this one unfortunately lacks that feature.			"

One unusual item is a list of  ""coming soon"" features on the menu screen. The ""and bounty hunters"" bit is definitely new since I last played, and I seem to see a few new ship blueprints, so obviously they are hard at work adding DLC.

												This could be a good game. Unfortunately, there are a few hoops to jump through to try and get the game to work correctly.It's great that the developer responds to the forum, but it's less than great that so many people have the black screen issue that locks their entire computer up except for sound and mouse movement. Since so many people have this issue, it's a code problem, not a 'my computer' problem. Especially since there are literally no games I can't run except this one and I have a steam library of close to 200 games plus probably another 50 that are installed from other sources.Track down the problem and patch it, don't tell me it's because I overclock when it doesn't affect other games.

												This game is super addictive and fun! Well worth the money.It has an excellent simple to control combat, the difficuly on default normal is just right and I have always felt it's my own fault for not being prepared for a fight or getting in over my head when I've had to retreat. It's also very forgiving of failure, which so far has merely meant licking my wounds and spending a few minutes gathering crew and money. Sometimes by taking my rage out of weaker systems at the same time.The only time I felt I had an unfair loss (I'll skip the mission details, save to say I needed to be stealthy) and the one thing I can point out that actually needs improving is the AI ships on your team that you're not currently controlling will sometimes ignore a ""passive"" command and fire at enemies anyway when you're trying not to engage. I simply recycled those ships and went solo and succeeded later, then rebuilt the ships again which takes mere seconds afterward.The good number of ship selection and weapons, and the ability to place different weapons or boosters in slots give you a advantage, or occasionally disadvantage, and give a feeling of variety and tactics to the combat. If you choose poorly you needn't fear losing a mission usually, you can go into the ""hanger"" screen refit your ship(s) and have them warp out and a handfull of seconds later warp back into the map.It has an ""rpg"" element that you level up and select to upgrade over a dozen types of parts of your ship to work better and be able to equip new things which further gives you a feeling of being in control of your ships.The visuals are very beautiful and colorfull eye candy, but you can see all that in the pictures or youtube vids.

												You're a space pirate out for profit and martial power while navigating a massive, randomly generated galaxy that you can set the size and level of difficulty for.  Blowing stuff up and buying weapon blueprints allow you to reverse engineer better stuff for your personal squad of ships.  There are multiple resources to manage for a wide variety of uses.  As you collect Data, you can invest research into 15 different technology categories to augment your play style.  If you feel you've made poor choices, you can reallocate research... though it causes a reasonable setback.The simplistic design of the game contrasts greatly with its resulting complexity (similar to Chess, but to a much lesser degree).  The amount of freedom is likewise staggering. The  ships, gear, specializations, even the method used to traverse the galaxy, all of this stuff is up to the player.  The very tight controls, thorough balance, and terrifying zombies of course add to the greatness.			"

												A top-down shmup with customiseable ships, RPG elements related to tech, randomised galaxies, and missions... Really. What's there not to like? Has some nice splashes of humor, too. Very beautiful and rather addictive and the controls are simple and elegant. I hope the expansions continue, 'cuz I can't get enough of this game.			"

												The dev said they didnt see any games of the kind and did it thenselves and did it GOOD , its not repetitive as some may describe (like a shooting game you have to shoot and that doesnt make it repetitive) has a very good storyline and playability is awesome , you have to kill a ship to use it or at late game it come by killing some other high level zombie. you get what u fight for and survive to harvest and atack!!!

												This could be a good game. Unfortunately, there are a few hoops to jump through to try and get the game to work correctly.It's great that the developer responds to the forum, but it's less than great that so many people have the black screen issue that locks their entire computer up except for sound and mouse movement. Since so many people have this issue, it's a code problem, not a 'my computer' problem. Especially since there are literally no games I can't run except this one and I have a steam library of close to 200 games plus probably another 50 that are installed from other sources.Track down the problem and patch it, don't tell me it's because I overclock when it doesn't affect other games. Half the graphics cards on the market have custom overclocks from the manufacturer.			"

												I love this sort of game. if you die, its your own fault. you tried the mission, you get the reward of diying. also i love the fact that the first ships you get are extremely cheap. and you can go mining with those, and then... you stock up and get bigger ships. then bigger.. The even bigger. then you get huge.get this. i havent bought it yet.also, i SPAZed when i saw this. hehe.			"

												First my profile: 44y, born in France and living in Canada, I am a casual player for the last 25y ( and an adict the first 5y) so I played tons of games from various genre, mostly on PC.I highly recommend this game, mostly because it's fun.I have rarely completed game twice but as I foundly remembered the game, I tried it once more and realized there was a new update that added bounty hunters and realized they re-balanced the game, which likely explain some of the earlier bad score.I somewhat forgot some of the game mechanic but it all came back and I can  say doing it all over again was pure joy.The game has a good mix of strategy, story telling, action and progression.I love to pilote a small fleet and the many options to go about the difficult missions. Some complain the difficulty curve is too high, especially in mid-game, but I would say that it is a welcome challenge as the AI is quite weak and they are many ways to exploit it. There is a bit of grinding but I kind of like it myself being a bit perfectionist with games and liking to explore all there is to see and find secrets so be warned.It's a two man game and I find that inspiring, those guys have talents and I can't wait to put my hand on SPAZ 2 when it comes out.THe graphics are not for everyone but I personally like it and 2D worked for piloting the ships.The music was repetitive but pleasant and I did not get tired of it. I find music can play a bit part of your long term memory of the joy of playing a game and this one is still lingering in my subconcient.Overall a 9/10 for me.			"

												Definitely unique, the art is nothing to write home about but blasting through blockade after blockade is fun.For the first handful of times anyway. There is a perpetual grind in this game that really, REALLY grates after twelve hours.It is fun! For a while. Looking past that, it is a good title I recommend. The gameplay and combat is sound with a wide variety of ships and a steady, worthwhile progression system. Oh and the story is top-notch, because it doesn't take itself seriously. Puns, jokes, and general asshattery abound.If you plan on buying it, try the demo first, wait for it on sale, and maybe look out for the sequel.			"

												SPAZ is a top-down space grinder. You start with almost nothing and build your way up to the commander of a squad of ships. As you complete story missions, you gain access to larger hangars which means larger ships to command. You can manipulate your enemies and scavange their ships after they've destroyed one another. You can eradicate infections and undermine the local rebellion or authority figures. Pros-Fun! Collecting the various weapons and tools, then customized your ships to find the best combinations is hours of enjoyment.Unique! Not many games I've played have the variety of units and unpredictability of SPAZ. I've seen ships that shouldn't have succeeded destroy others that are twice their size.Cons-Wash, Rinse, Repeat- A bit repetitive at times. Requires lots of time grinding to find the blueprints for all the ships. Not always the most fun, but it DOES make getting your first HUGE ship so rewarding.Angry? Have some Goons- Very easy to manipulate the factions by bribing them with goons (a sort of influence currency). Once you're on their good sides, you can just wait for them to butt heads and collect the cash, goons, data, and blueprints left over from their conflicts. Not super challenging.Braaaaaaains- The Zombies are very unique and sometimes absurdly over powered. Still need to get used to them, but their initial strategies require you to change your thinking ALOT.9/10 BUY IT (ESPECIALLY IF IT'S ON SALE)			"

												I was delighted to see this turn up on Steam, as I'd just downloaded the demo a few days prior and totally obsessed over it all afternoon.  It does remind one of Star Control 2, but it really comes at things from another angle as well.  There's nothing like cruising around with your fleet.  Try the demo!  You have nothing to lose.  The first 30 minutes were confusing for me, which is apparently actually a good sign, because after that, I was powerfully hooked.  I'm going to play the hell out of this one.			"

												The game is hands down one of the best indie games I have played in the past few years, easily in my top 5 indie games when you consider it's ""fun factor"". The graphics are very pleasing especially for a cartoon look. The sound fit's the game well as does the artwork. SPAZ has several difficulty settings ranging from ""casual just play for fun and never lose"" to ""please just kill me now"". On it's most difficult setting even the most experienced gamers will be tested. The galaxy can be created relatively small (still very large offering many hours of gameplay) to massive offering literally hundreds of hours of play time. The map is also randomly generated so replay value is high. Bounty Hunters (free DLC) adds a fourth faction to interact with adding new ways to explore or destroy star systems!All in all a highly suggested purchase that will offer something to all gamers, casual and hardcore alike.

												Top-down shooter with RPG elements. Earn experience, gather resources, upgrade skills and ships.Key points: Sometimes humorous, often annoying voice-overs. New game modes introduced as you progress mix things up, but not a lot. Ship upgrades and passive bonuses make some difference in strategy and formation, but require enormous amounts of resources that can be a drag to collect. AI is capable of possessing awe-inspiring stupidity. This game is nigh endless--you'll become exhausted with this game well before you finish it. Hours of mindless fun.Bottom line: Recommended for people who like goal-oriented and hectic top-down action.			"

												For a two-dimensional space shooter, this game has a lot to offer.  It makes me think of what EVE Online might have been if it had been concieved as a single-player game back in 1995 or so.  It excells as a casual stress reliever and is pretty much guaranteed to keep a player engaged in short bursts for a good time.  However, the set pieces begin to repeat themselves after a while- after all, it is still a work in progress- (In the same manner that Team Fortress 2 is a work in progress.) but a damned good one at that.

												I've been after this pretty little gem of a game for quite some time and may I just say.. It's a truly wonderful, well done game with excelent gameplay that can be both tense and easy at different times. The wide variety of weapons lead to some truly hectic play styles, bombs, lasers, plasma cannons and even turrets are all weapons you can use! As far as I'm concerned, SPAZ is one of those games that I could play for hours, upon hours, upon hours.			"

												SPAZ is truly one of the best games i have played since years.Sure, it does not offer the brilliant uber graphics from many modern shooters, but hey - that is neither intended nor necessary.The whole rest - including gameplay itself, long-term motivation and simply FUN to play - is totally worth it. It is as if you can feel around every little corner of the game how much heart has been put into it.Considering the fact that this game was created by mainly only two guys, it is a true masterpiece.Very good job, guys!

												I love this game it's taking up more of my time then any lately. It's basic but very fun and also kind of funny. I think most will enjoy it if you spend sometime reading how to play it. Like first game set it to difficulity casual and turn off bounty population increase stars to 300. When you comfortable playing than change settings back to default. Also remember in battle you can scroll out using the scroll on your mouse makes it so the enemy isn't always going off your screen which it first really made me hate the game. good luck friends I think you will enjoy this and it's on sale at bundlestars atm for 2 bucks! Well worth it! I can't wait fot the next one.			"

												There's nothing I like more in a space shooter than to be able to select and outfit the ships and this game does it well!  But what makes this game really fun is that you can advance in practically any way you want to.   * Bribe your way through a warp gate or blast your way through the blockade.   * Mine your own asteroids or steal from a mining rig.   * Buy new blueprints or blow up the space station to steal their data!

												One of my favorites.  This game took the basic 2D motion of Asteroids and turned it into a very entertaining space saga.  The graphics are fun, the story is wild and the basic gameplay is a blast.  The only stumbling block is that some of the potential builds are really terrible such as a stealth, missile or mine setup.  The game forces you into beams or particle weapons if you want to kill anything in a reasonable amount of time.  I look forward to the next effort by this developer.			"

												Don't let the simplistic design and humor fool you, this game can be very challenging at times. The difficultly curve is just right to prove enough challenge to keep things interesting and the progression keeps things fresh enough as to not become too repetitive or dull. I love games that really give you a sense of progression and feel where your actions actually matter. The end-game micromanagement is just tough enough to keep you on your toes but not cause you to rage quit. If you like top-down arcade shooters, flying around as a pirate, managing your own fleet, saving the galaxy, or any combination there of, you should give this a look.			"

												This game is a rare indy gem, unlike most indie gems, this game has more gameplay in it than most games released these days. The story is laughable and hard to follow, something about upgrading your mothership and getting a laser or something, but it does take a pretty unexpected twist in the fourth act. The meat of the game is VERY customizable ship combat. Outfit your increasingly powerful ships with lasers, cannons, missles, fighter drones, and more. The combat is great too, the Shield/Hull defences vs. Lasers/Projectiles mechanic requires carefull weapon loadouts, and as long as you keep your less than stellar AI comrades under a good leash, even overwhelming odds can be handled with skill. Also, SPAZ is made by a two-man team who are just doing what they love, and buying this game helps them make the game better. SPAZ has added HUGE amounts of content since launch (Namely the Bounty Hunters) and will keep having content added if people keep supporting it.			"

												Now of course there is room for improvement but it does so many things well. The battles are fun, intense and usually pretty challenging. The management elements have depth and require thought and skill but aren't as daunting as you would expect. Un-lockable hull types with the ability to customize those hulls, weapons, shields and more. A very pretty game graphically, especially for an indie game with a 2 man development team. I've spent time just watching the A.I. battles that play in the background on the main menu screen. Now the ship controls can feel a little odd at first but once you get used to them they make sense. In short, if you have any interest in space battles and fun sci fi stories you have to own this game. I love it and have bought multiple copies for my friends. Good luck and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.			"

												This game could have been called Starscape 2 (see my review on Starscape, If you have played Space Rangers its also like a much better version of that game).  Its very much similiar except quite a bit better.  First of all you get 2 NPC ships that fight along side you which you can switch between.  Second if you get stuck you can fly around to different areas and try to get better equip.  They try to keep your direction open unless you want to advance the story, then you must accomplish certain tasks. Also requires salvage to unlock ships which is a neat idea.  A bloody shame its only single player. This game is worth up to 10 dollars.  If its 5 bucks don't miss it.  On a side note the game was actually made by only 2 guys which is amazing.			"

												This game is pretty badass. It has the perfect combination of Twitch Skill, Tactical Manuvering, and RPG-like progression. It's horribly addicting to keep cruising around space, hoping the next fight you get into will yield the blueprints you need for a sweet, 6 turret-ed ship to round out your fleet.The story is pretty meh, but I just skimmed most of the dialogue anyway. The background chatter that plays during missions and the billboards floating through space can be downright hilarious though.Since I got this on sale, my only compaint is that it might make me buy Space Rangers 2...

												So, the game is not perfect. But it's a great small scale to medium scale top down ship combat game. You manage a capital ship and a small fleet of escort vessels. You can mine stuff, destroy stuff. It's up to you to make your own way through the vast darness of space.Constant support from the dev team and frequent updates are also a plus!			"

												SPAZ... oh SPAZ, how i love you... Space Pirates and Zombies is a game that deserve... Nein! It NEEDS more attention. Its a great game made by 2 great dudes. They are working (slowly) on SPAZ 2.I really have nothing, nothing bad to say about this game. The trailer they got is a great way to show off how to game works, what you see is what you get. So if you like what you see then buy it, its a great game.Here's what i think of the game. The game is a fun little game where you fly around with a small fleet of spaceship. You have a mothership that you can't control and it rebuilds and refit all your spaceships to your need. You start of with only one ship, and gain the ability to use other ships by destroying that type of ship, once destroyed the ship drops a blueprint, collect them to unlock the ship for yourself. The larger the ship, the more blueprints you need. So a small fighter might only need two pieces of that blueprint, destroy 2, collect the blueprint and the fighter is yours. While cruisers and battleships might need up to 8 blueprints, and they usally have alot more health and are harder to kill.You also get the ability to refit your ships with weapons you want to use. Each ship has its own number of hardpoints, you can mix and match and put whatever you want on your ship. Want to fire kinetic rounds? sure. Lasers? Why not. Plasma balls? It's your ship, your rules.Now this might be a minor spoiler but they got it in the title of the game so... Story goes that you are a space pirate, each solar system is cut off from each other so what you do in one system won't carry over to the next. To get to another system (a higher leveled one with more advanced ships) you'll have to fight through a UTA Blockade, they block access to the warpgates you need access to procedd in the game, either destroy them all or bribe them to give you access. Each system has 2 factions. The UTA (Military, always blocks the warpgates with blockades). And the Civvies, they control mining and science operations in deep space and usally let you use their facility freely (So you can mine resource, et.c.). You will randomly get a faction rating in each starsystem, sometimes they love you from the start, sometimes they hate you. You'll never know. Pick your side, start blasting ships from the oppossite side and soon you'll make some great friends in that starsystem.Later on in the game Zombie ships start to appear, and near the end of the game they will be your main enemy. The UTA and Civvies notice the major zombie problem and team up together with you to reclaim the galaxy from the zombies. Zombie ships are unique ships that you can not unlock. They consist of two type of ships, fighting type ships that look like infected normal ships. They will engage anyone mindlessly. And then we got the breed type ships that look like human bodyparts of some sort. They infect ships without shields, if your ship gets infected you have little time to react, either self destruct your ship so the zombies can't gain control of it and use it against you... or make the hard choice and vent the ship of all crew except the captain, so the infection can't spread. It's a hard job late game, but someone has to purge the galaxy from the zombies.There is also a fourth faction that was released freely with the game. And they are the Bounty Hunters. There ships are unique with specific traits and are also very, very over powered. If you go around in a starsystem they ""control"" and wreck havoc, you will start to lose respect with them. Lose to much of it and they will warp in when you least want it (in a difficult fight with another faction) and try to blow you out of the space, for the most part they succedd with this. One of the hardest achivements ingame want's you to destroy their space station in the hardest type of starsystem.So will you use standard weapons like lasers, kinetic rounds or plasma to destroy your enemies? or will you go for missiles and torpedos instead? Why not use EMP weapons and energy drainers to drain all energy from your enemy ships so they can't fire their weapons or escape? Nukes? Sure, SPAZ has them. Drones for carriers, that too. There is alot to do with this game, and it gave me alot of hours of fun.The only three really bad parts about this game are:Interface dosen't look very professional.The story isen't that good, it had one somewhat good plot twist in it tho.The last ""part"" of the game, the ""purge"" all galaxy of zombie threat's is a repeative and somewhat boring job to do. Everything before that is fun tho.			"

												Apart from extremely long start of game loading time, SPAZ is overall a fun top-down 4X game. Customisation is cool, but also feels like once you die (and if you keep dying) you'll be reset back to square one. Forcing you to mine for very small mineral patches and do low level jobs just to get enough to build you crazy expensive ships. Cheap game, so value for money - 6/10			"

Spaz has you going around the galaxy fighting diffrent battles as a merc unit, you origionaly can only control 2 or so ships but eventualy can control 3, the sizes of the ships allowed changes as you play and there are a LOT OF SHIPS, around 8 for each of the 4 sizes. As you play the campaign you can unlock the various technologies, there being around 16 each with 10 levels, this making your ships more effective in that tech and unlocking the more advanced versions, the end result being an amazing amount of customization.

												Surprisingly this is a very good indie game, one of the best I've played.This is a real-time space shooter game that has some RPG and strategy elements in it. Combined together, it is actually a very addictive game that keeps you playing. You can have a fleet of up to 4 ships, and with it you gather resources, unlock new ships and technology, level up for talent points, trade with the 2 factions in the game to become more powerful. You can help or hinder either of the two factions, and the number of ships they can field in battle will increase or decrease, making your actions influence the galaxy.The graphics, sound and story are decent enough, but the game-play is top notch.As of this recommendation, the game is good enough despite being simple. But it could be so much more and the developers plan to add more content. If you have some spare change, consider buying it during a sale and help fund the sequel, SPAZ 2.			"

												SPAZ is a great arcade space shooter / RPG with a mouthful of a name.  It contains exactly what it says: space pirates and zombies.  You explore the galaxy, dealing with different factions, doing missions to level up and increase the size and power of your fleet.  The ships handle very well and are very customizable.  Friendly and enemy AI is very competent and can make the game quite challenging, depending on the skill level you set.The one large problem I ran into with the game was pacing.  I ended up having to spend pretty lengthy amounts of time searching for the appropriate level systems to do missions in in order to level up in order to continue the story or move into a particular system that was several levels higher than me.Other than that though, the game is quite fun and a bit of a challenge.  It was worth it, despite all the extra time I had to put in.			"

												I got this on sale thinking I might get an afternoon out of it but I got so much more.  One thing I noticed, this game has an addiction factor much like the civilization games. Every mission you do makes you want to push on to see what's next, got to get that next ship or that next weapon. GRAPHICS: are very detailed for a 2D game and throw out some nice effects, for example the explosions are pretty decent with bits being blasted off as you bring down a ship slowly, crew being sucked out of a breach in the hull and there are some rather nice backdrops with small details you can appreciate when you zoom in. SOUND:  isn't overbearing, there is an effect for everything but it just lacks a little punch for my tastes.  I would have liked the weapons to sound a bit meatier, right now they sound like pings and pops. The explosions however do sound pretty good when you blow up something big. There is some interesting and funny radio chatter that will put a smile on your face. MUSIC: very much suits a game of this type, it doesn't try to overshadow the sound effects or deafen you when you're in a firefight...which is almost always. It's the kind of music that sticks in your head when you're not playing the game. Your currencies are well balanced and you never have too much, you will of course always run out but then there's always a way to make back the lost currency, unlike a lot of games where you have way too much money and nothing to spend it on, I really do hate that in a lot of games. I'm blown away by how addicting this game is without feeling like it's a sugar rush. What I mean is that it won't give you all of the cool stuff in the first 5 minutes of the game and then you have to grind for another 50 hours without anything awesome to discover. No, this game is one of the best paced games I've ever played and the balance of leveling, tech points and weapon acquisition over the course of the entire game will give you the feeling that you ate the whole cake, not just a bunch of icing or just the cake without icing.....if you catch my drift. At the time of this review, I've clocked 45 hours but I'm still having a blast, still have a lot to discover and upgrade but at the same time I kinda don't want to finish this game. You know something is good when you want it to go on. I just hope SPAZ 2 has that same feeling....			"

												If you are getting old and cranky, and fondly remember the good old days of arcade games with those top-down shooters, fret no more!This is not your regular on-rails shooter though, you have a vast galaxy and can choose to go to several planetary systems. each map is a wide area with several different missions to accomplish. You can follow the main storyline linearly or accomplish side missions to level up your ship, buy blueprints for better weapons and upgrade your systems.All this while managing your reputation with rebellious Civilians trying to fight of an oppressive government locking down free passage through the galactic gateways which connect planetary systems. Pepper in mercenaries which may hunt you down  or aid you depending on your reputation, and you have a space slugfest.Beware: highly addictive. May cause family conflicts and/or relationship breakups.			"

												This is probably the grindiest game I've ever played. It's not a bad game at all, but it has a few hours of fun gameplay spread out over 25 hours repeating the same missions over and over. There's no real reason to explore systems, especially if you don't need a technology upgrade. A little blip of story in random systems or random FTL-style encounter would make it more compelling to explore.The devs in the forums confirm that the best way to play is to put all of your points into one type of weapon. If you don't, you'll have to grind 2-3x as much to viably use multiple types of weapons. Despite all the fancy looking weapons, attachments, and mounting points in this game, you'll probably end up with a ship loaded with all of one type of weapon. You'll also quickly learn to never die so much that you run out of rez, or you'll have to grind away at a mining station for a while just to have enough money to start playing the game again.If I played again, I would play without bounty hunters. It looks like they a balancing mechanism, because the only thing they do is provide a constant drain on your resources. The diminishing returns of their arena-style missions weren't very worthwhile.It does look very good, especially when battles involve different kinds of ships, weapons, and drones flying about. The movement and turning speed plays a major role in the game, so I did like how I feels like naval warfare. Throughout the 25 hours there were fun bits unlocking new ships and figuring out what works well too, but once I figured it out it was back to the grind. It's a decent game to play while watching TV or listening to some podcasts, but it wouldn't hold my interest alone.			"

												Rough around the edges, poorly explained, occasionally feels like a grind, and I love it regardless. The small team that created this did so ""to make the kinds of games they used to make, but not anymore"" and I can't think of a better way to put it. Like many 90s computer games, you'll start off totally lost once the extended tutorial ends, but that waywardness is the price you pay for the freedom SPaZ gives you.The price has gone down to less than five dollars before, so I'd pick it up then. I should also note I had to install a semi-official hack to make the game run at more than 2 FPS late in the game on a rig that can support games like Shogun II, so your mileage may vary in this regard.

												A rare gem. It makes a randomly (procedurally) generated universe for you to explore and battle around in. One of their last updates added bounty hunters, which change gameplay by a fair amount. You can play with or without the bounty hunters, though, as this game has a good selection of options when you are starting a new game. It's almost a sandbox game, but it's really more of a free-form RPG where you can go wherever you want whenever you want. It doesn't overwhelm you, though, because the difficulty for each solar system is clearly displayed.			"

												Played this game for about a week now. I find it enjoyable and challenging even though it gets a little repetitive after while. You are always a step behind in ships but you can upgrade your weapons, shields, armor, etc before the enemy. Early ships are given to you once you beat it in battle. The smaller ships are done in one battle. As you get to larger ships you have to beat the same type ship from twice to, well I am at level 54 and I have beaten some ships 4 times already and I am only at 80% reverse engineered for that ship type.  You always have ways of getting Spaz (money) to spend, sometimes quickly other times you have to work for it. As you move up to higher levels the battles get more intense and are fun. Right now I have three ships on Level 54 the enemy might start with 4 or 5 then as you beat them they warp in a few more with one a little bigger than what you have sometimes. In between battles you can upgrade and find Spaz. The universe is quite larger with higher levels as you get to the inside systems. I just made it to the Zombie level and came back to upgrade more. I was no where near leveled up enough to stay there.I now have played the game twice. Very repetitive all the way through the game. Same thing in each system just as you level up you have more ships to beat, then the Bounty Hunters start showing up right after or during a battle making it that much harder to beat that level. Very long game to beat. Bounty Hunter Challenges are fun.			"

												Space Pirates and Zombies. Remember Starscape? This feels a lot like a very well-done and much-improved sequal to Starscape. You fly around different space zones collecting resources that you use to upgrade your mothership, unlock new fighter chassis and build fighters.So how does it hold up? I think very well. A word about control: Don't bother without a mouse. Personally, there are very few games that require both mouse and keyboard that I will play with a laptop touchpad. This is not one of them. It's a very twitchy game, and the awkwardness of having one hand under my other wrist and having to click both buttons with my thumb is just too clumsy for me.The graphics are fun. The fighter/shuttle designs are different enough to be interesting, and the effects are flashy enough to be from a JJ Abrams movie.They make a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attempt at realistic physics, which is not really the rule with space games. That is to say: inertia is a thing, but not the infinite thing that it really ought to be. If you cut your engines, you will keep going but eventually stop. Is it always impressive when a game DOES have realistic physics? Yup. Is it always fun? Nope.  To that point, SPAZ makes it fun.			"

Maybe the in-development sequel will step a little in that direction to expand the game's horizons. At the price point, it's a no-brainer buy for anyone that enjoys arcade space combat and explorations. Props to the 2-man dev team at MinMax, their story on the forums was a good read.			"

It is rich and deep !You do missions and level up your ships and hangar .You collect blueprints from wreckage's and research and manufacture new components or entire ships. You can hire a specialists and train them to be more efficient as your crew.Dock to the station buy new gear there ,choose which faction you wanna be friends with and which you wanna be seen as foe .But beware there is also a group of bounty hunters that on some stage of plaing SPAZ will start  following your tracks.Travel throu spacious Universe from one solar system to another ,break through enemies gate ,develop your skills and use those ,mine Rez to get rich ,and many ,many more option in SPAZ are waiting for you.Do not hesitate ! :)			"

												Fun little game.  Absolutely worth the price. Only downside is not much replay value, and turns into a bit of a grind if you're interested in what happens next.  I'm hoping they update it enough that it becomes worth revisiting.			"

												This game could have been called Starscape 2 (see my review on Starscape, If you have played Space Rangers its also like a much better version of that game).  Its very much similiar except quite a bit better.  First of all you get 2 NPC ships that fight along side you which you can switch between.  Second if you get stuck you can fly around to different areas and try to get better equip.  They try to keep your direction open unless you want to advance the story, then you must accomplish certain tasks. Also requires salvage to unlock ships which is a neat idea.  A bloody shame its only single player. This game is worth up to 10 dollars.  If its 5 bucks don't miss it.  On a side note the game was actually made by only 2 guys which is amazing.			"

												I recently purchased this game and I must say, I love it!        Dont judge it by its initial appearance. I mostly play games like X3 Albion Prelude which are 3d games with 6 point rotation. The more I played this game the more addictive it became. The game play is really good and entertaining not to mention it has lots of things to blow up. It doesnt require a powerful pc to run it either. It has plenty of help features and It was able to pretty much answer all my questions as I have played so far. Might I mention it also has a good story line to it so far and did I mention it has good explosions lol. If you love space games you will want this one as well. I am glad I purchased it. The price I paid was almost unfair to the developers of this fine game. Cheers!			"

												10/10 Very addictive game.  I played about 1 hour of this game 18 months ago then came back and started a new game 2 weeks ago.  It took me 80 hrs to complete a new game.  The addictive part of the game is chasing the next upgrade, blueprint or skill levelup.   I recomend game saving alot early-mid game.  The game was very challenging till, Hammerhead ship dropped toward the middle of chapter 3. The game became super easy after getting max level cannons and Mammath during chapter 4.  Mammath is OP with triple mount Partical Cannons, double mount Mass Drivers, and Battle Station.   This game reminds me of a 100x more advanced version of Asteroids, that I played hundreds of times in the mid-80s at the YMCA.  The game has a good story and great 2d graphics.  Another similarly enjoyable game to try is Reassembly.			"

												What a game, what a work of art for a two-person team.It's so beautiful, from the debris-strewn starscapes to the twinkling spaceships and spinning starbases. The sound effects are good, too. The background chatter could have used more variety, but it was so well done and unobstrusive that it never annoyed me. The misanthropic humor is pervasive throughout the game, from the main characters' dialogue to the way slavery is tacitly endorsed by everyone.There are lots intriguing ships, weapons, and upgrades to try, though brute-force lasering was how I usually settled things. The beams-cannons-missiles damage system makes you carefully weigh your strengths and weaknesses, while the rez-goons-data economy keeps you hunting for ways to exploit and score. I would have liked more missions and factions, though.The difficulty of the game is quite well balanced until the very end. I got stuck many times, but getting unstuck often required just a different fleet or loadout. And when I needed a break, I could look for other things to do like collect components or free up warp gates.Still, the game is undeniably a grind. With there being only two factions and not much in the way of plot and missions, there is a lot of looking for other things to do. When the game got too repetitive, I'd play it intensely for a few weeks and then stop for a few months before playing again.What bothers me most is how the game ended. In the last chapter, I did the minimum I had to do to proceed to the finale. I then saved the game and went ahead to the finale just to take a brief peek at it, expecting to be defeated right away. Fifteen minutes later, I'd won the game without breaking a sweat. That was really disappointing. I was playing on Normal difficulty with a tech level of 113, so I don't think I was overleveled. In fact, the unique side missions were still very tough for me. Even the story, which I found fairly interesting, ended flatly.			"

												Don't let the stupid name put you off (as it did me), SPAZ is an awesome game. Check the demo to see for yourself.The game is a top down space ship fleet combat shooter. You design ships using modular components such as hulls, weapons, engines and other support systems that you unlock as you go. You can have multiple ships in your fleet but you only control one ship at a time with the ability to switch control to any combat ship in your fleet. You can give basic instructions to your other AI controlled ships via a tactical interface. Story wise it's pretty simplistic, with the occasional bit of juvenile humour. You travel around the galaxy gaining favour in star systems in order to unlock new technologies and access to services and resources.			"

												This game is super addictive and fun! Well worth the money.It has an excellent simple to control combat, the difficuly on default normal is just right and I have always felt it's my own fault for not being prepared for a fight or getting in over my head when I've had to retreat. It's also very forgiving of failure, which so far has merely meant licking my wounds and spending a few minutes gathering crew and money. Sometimes by taking my rage out of weaker systems at the same time.The only time I felt I had an unfair loss (I'll skip the mission details, save to say I needed to be stealthy) and the one thing I can point out that actually needs improving is the AI ships on your team that you're not currently controlling will sometimes ignore a ""passive"" command and fire at enemies anyway when you're trying not to engage. I simply recycled those ships and went solo and succeeded later, then rebuilt the ships again which takes mere seconds afterward.The good number of ship selection and weapons, and the ability to place different weapons or boosters in slots give you a advantage, or occasionally disadvantage, and give a feeling of variety and tactics to the combat. If you choose poorly you needn't fear losing a mission usually, you can go into the ""hanger"" screen refit your ship(s) and have them warp out and a handfull of seconds later warp back into the map.It has an ""rpg"" element that you level up and select to upgrade over a dozen types of parts of your ship to work better and be able to equip new things which further gives you a feeling of being in control of your ships.The visuals are very beautiful and colorfull eye candy, but you can see all that in the pictures or youtube vids.

												Probably my fav indie game of this past year. It really captures the feel of these kind of 'action' oriented space 2d games of yore. Plus it doesn't hurt that the game seems to one up the whole player experience every time you think you are just about ready to 'win it' and throws you back on yer heels. Definate must buy if you have any arcade/2d/space/exploration genre intests. (9.5/10)			"

												Dont let the title of this game detour you, its a rather enjoyable mix of rts/rpg/shooter. Its also a bit openworld/sandboxish. You can appoarch the game in mulitple paths/play styles and what i enjoy most about it, is that it doesnt penalize players for making mistakes or trying sometihng new, in fact it encourages on the fly tatics and skill swaps. Download the demo and give it a shot. 3.5 out of 5 for a indie title.			"

												Now here's a game that quietly passed underneath my radar. I thought it was going to be too strategy based for my liking, but there isn't a whole lot of strategy to it. It's more like a casual space exploration game that integrates action based combat. As you progress, the battles can get pretty intense, but there's no pressure because you don't lose the game if you lose a battle allowing you to experiment and move at your own pace. Usually you just have to reassess your ship configurations if you get into a situation you can't handle.There is a slight learning curve, but nothing overwhelming. The galaxy is very large providing hundreds of hours of potential play and the game always seems to throw you a new challenge as you advance, so it doesn't get repetitively boring. There's plenty to do between the main story mission, side missions, and the variety of faction objectives in each system. Hands down, SPAZ is a game that should be in your collection.			"

												Surprisingly this is a very good indie game, one of the best I've played.This is a real-time space shooter game that has some RPG and strategy elements in it. Combined together, it is actually a very addictive game that keeps you playing. You can have a fleet of up to 4 ships, and with it you gather resources, unlock new ships and technology, level up for talent points, trade with the 2 factions in the game to become more powerful. You can help or hinder either of the two factions, and the number of ships they can field in battle will increase or decrease, making your actions influence the galaxy.The graphics, sound and story are decent enough, but the game-play is top notch.As of this recommendation, the game is good enough despite being simple. But it could be so much more and the developers plan to add more content. If you have some spare change, consider buying it during a sale and help fund the sequel, SPAZ 2.			"

												This was a pleasant surprise of a space sim, in which the focus is as much on the 2D top-down space combat as it is on resource collection, faction negotiation/manipulation, and technology collection. It has a very RPG feel - as you gain experience and level, you place points into the systems of your ship that you most rely on, forcing you to always evaluate your strategy as there are MANY different systems to put points into, and the ships that you receive all use them differently. I did not expect to get sucked into this game, nor did I expect it to last as long as it did. Be careful with this one - it can get addictive very quickly. And once you get going, it's going to carry you a lot longer than you'll expect. It does get too repetitive towards the end of the game, and a lot of that time was spent grinding out materials. 3 out of 5 foxes.			"

												SPAZ, where to begin with this game?It is fun, perhaps not as intuitive as could be, interactive, perhaps sometimes montonous, especially on the first play-through when 'rez' farming becomes a regular occurence as countless little ships of yours get blasted into the dark abyss of space. It's design features and artistic styling leaves little to be desired; there truly is something for everything in this game! The faction system appears bleak, with the UTA, CIV, and Bounty Hunters not being fully exploited to their potential; the game uses the excuse that different star-systems don't communicate, and as such your reputation is reset to a set level in each system, a much better idea could be to have an option of this, but also a ranking system within a faction. Right now 'respect' is the only obtainable quantity with a faction (BH), and even that has miniscule effects on the game.The personalised feel to the game is something that draws you in and, more importantly, makes you want to stay. This game is so engaging, I can see myself losing countless more hours to it! I highly recommend this game, and though the £6.99 price tag may at first appear quite steep, believe me, the hours of fun you will get out of this game makes it all worthwhile.			"

												Top down space shooter with an addictive progression system. It feels like a 2D Freelancer flying around upgrading ships, blowing up pirates, civilians, zombies, police cruisers all the while upgrading your little band of mercenary ships makes for an absolutely fantastic time. The open ended nature of the game gives the player freedom to go where they like while the narrative gives a general direction on where to go next. Combat is fluid and each ship handles a little differently as a space game should. All this made by two people. Weapon and ship upgrades keep the player going for 'just a bit longer' into the wee hours of next week.Get it, play it, love it. "

												This game is a great mesh of the space strategy and space shooter genera's. Like most space games, you start out in a dinky bucket of bolts, and then work your way up to better ships. The main twist is that you get to create a small fleet of ships, which you can then fly into combat. During combat, you can switch between any of the ships in your fleet at will. That feature (along with a high level of ship loadout customization) keeps the game interesting.Don't be fooled by the comical title, this the game is a serious work of art and is a worth a buy. "

												Watch the trailer. If you like what you see, buy it. SPAZ is simply THE best game of it's genre, touching upon all the niche's and features that you might think to add to a top-down space exploration shmup. The Bounty Hunters update added a half dozen more ships and a ton of (voluntary) challenge scenarios.My biggest complaint: the second chapter (four chapters total) is rather long if you're a completionist and want to unlock everything. A lot of people stop playing prematurely and never enter the third chapter, where the zombies appear in earnest.Also: play on a medium sized galaxy. In a small galaxy the level gap between stars can be too large and you'll run out of things to do in a system, and you're more screwed if you♥♥♥♥♥♥off the wrong faction in a particular system. In a huge galaxy there's too many systems between you and wherever you want to go, so it gets repetitive.			"

												I purchased SPAZ on a whim; it's not the type of game I usually play but, more importantly, it's not the sort of game I actively avoid either.To get the criticisms out of the way first, SPAZ has a fairly steep and unforgiving learning curve. Attempting to quickly punch through warp gates and advance the story will end in complete destruction. Lengthy and repetitive grinding sessions are required in order to keep your tech levels high enough to survive.That said, SPAZ is insanely addictive, fun and the payoffs are worth it. What could be better than more, bigger and better ships?... and that's even before the zombies come into play.I definitely can't wait for SPAZ 2.			"

												Its a grinder pure and simple. Story line is about as stupid and weak as you would expect. The missions are hack and slash rinse and repeat ad nauseum. Still its a fun game and the mods make it a little less of a headache. Worth 2-3 bucks but not more. There is a great feel to the game but the content can only support about an hour or two of game play. The problem is that the developers seem to want to make a 100+ hour game and decided to do this by copy pasting the same quest over and over and over again. You fly from one star system to the next and do the exact some thing in almost every single one over and over and over again. Still its a reminiscent isometric game and nostalgia has a high value for some even if it is by definition repetitive. Overall I'd rate the game 3/10.			"

												Bought this on sale a while back.  It's not bad, easy to pass a few hours wandering around in space blowing things up.  There are many ships t choose from each with own strengths/weaknesses.  While you sometimes do have to use strategy, I have found halfway through the game that it's easy to just explore and outlevel the story missions if they are too hard.  Sometimes you'll need to tailor your ship enhancements to whatever encounter is giving you trouble.  I'm usually not too into these types of games but this one has been very entertaining, and through communicating with them on Reddit I've come to like the developers.  I think it's worth a look if you have not found anything fresh lately on the market.			"

One of their last updates added bounty hunters, which change gameplay by a fair amount. You can play with or without the bounty hunters, though, as this game has a good selection of options when you are starting a new game. It's almost a sandbox game, but it's really more of a free-form RPG where you can go wherever you want whenever you want. It doesn't overwhelm you, though, because the difficulty for each solar system is clearly displayed.			"

At the price point, it's a no-brainer buy for anyone that enjoys arcade space combat and explorations. Props to the 2-man dev team at MinMax, their story on the forums was a good read.			"

												I spent a fair amount of time with this version and pre-Steam version, combat is lots of fun with missiles, turrets and mining, game is very atmospheric, and you feel like you are in the groove in the early game. Then.. zombies. Difficulty curve goes way, way up, you die frequently, and start getting stuck in bottlenecks in the map where you have to defeat near-impossible odds to progress. Still, it won't be the first game I never finished but thoroughly enjoyed my time with until it beat the tar out of me. Great game, sequel please....			"

												This is probably the grindiest game I've ever played. It's not a bad game at all, but it has a few hours of fun gameplay spread out over 25 hours repeating the same missions over and over. There's no real reason to explore systems, especially if you don't need a technology upgrade. A little blip of story in random systems or random FTL-style encounter would make it more compelling to explore.The devs in the forums confirm that the best way to play is to put all of your points into one type of weapon. If you don't, you'll have to grind 2-3x as much to viably use multiple types of weapons. Despite all the fancy looking weapons, attachments, and mounting points in this game, you'll probably end up with a ship loaded with all of one type of weapon. You'll also quickly learn to never die so much that you run out of rez, or you'll have to grind away at a mining station for a while just to have enough money to start playing the game again.If I played again, I would play without bounty hunters. It looks like they a balancing mechanism, because the only thing they do is provide a constant drain on your resources. The diminishing returns of their arena-style missions weren't very worthwhile.It does look very good, especially when battles involve different kinds of ships, weapons, and drones flying about. The movement and turning speed plays a major role in the game, so I did like how I feels like naval warfare. Throughout the 25 hours there were fun bits unlocking new ships and figuring out what works well too, but once I figured it out it was back to the grind. It's a decent game to play while watching TV or listening to some podcasts, but it wouldn't hold my interest alone.			"

												This is a pretty good game for old school fans of games like Escape Velocity. Unfortunately the game doesn't do a very good job at immersing you like some of those older games do. The universe feels pretty shallow, and some of the tackier interface and portrait artwork can break immersion. Although many aspects are quite antiquated, the combat system is its redeaming factor, and is the primary focus of the game. I would suggest starting with a smaller sized galaxy since progressing through the game's story can drag on a bit and require more grinding otherwise.			"

There is a perpetual grind in this game that really, REALLY grates after twelve hours.It is fun! For a while. Looking past that, it is a good title I recommend. The gameplay and combat is sound with a wide variety of ships and a steady, worthwhile progression system. Oh and the story is top-notch, because it doesn't take itself seriously. Puns, jokes, and general asshattery abound.If you plan on buying it, try the demo first, wait for it on sale, and maybe look out for the sequel.			"

												SPAZ is a top-down space grinder. You start with almost nothing and build your way up to the commander of a squad of ships. As you complete story missions, you gain access to larger hangars which means larger ships to command. You can manipulate your enemies and scavange their ships after they've destroyed one another. You can eradicate infections and undermine the local rebellion or authority figures. Pros-Fun! Collecting the various weapons and tools, then customized your ships to find the best combinations is hours of enjoyment.Unique! Not many games I've played have the variety of units and unpredictability of SPAZ. I've seen ships that shouldn't have succeeded destroy others that are twice their size.Cons-Wash, Rinse, Repeat- A bit repetitive at times. Requires lots of time grinding to find the blueprints for all the ships. Not always the most fun, but it DOES make getting your first HUGE ship so rewarding.Angry? Have some Goons- Very easy to manipulate the factions by bribing them with goons (a sort of influence currency). Once you're on their good sides, you can just wait for them to butt heads and collect the cash, goons, data, and blueprints left over from their conflicts. Not super challenging.Braaaaaaains- The Zombies are very unique and sometimes absurdly over powered. Still need to get used to them, but their initial strategies require you to change your thinking ALOT.9/10 BUY IT (ESPECIALLY IF IT'S ON SALE)			"

												One of my favorites.  This game took the basic 2D motion of Asteroids and turned it into a very entertaining space saga.  The graphics are fun, the story is wild and the basic gameplay is a blast.  The only stumbling block is that some of the potential builds are really terrible such as a stealth, missile or mine setup.  The game forces you into beams or particle weapons if you want to kill anything in a reasonable amount of time.  I look forward to the next effort by this developer.			"

												Space Pirates and Zombies appears at first glance nothing more than a retro style, 2d space shooter. But after playing it a lot, multiple playthroughs and challenges, it has a ton of depth lying beneath it's 2d surface.You start as the leader of a small band of merchant pirates yourself seeking your fortune by collecting mineral deposits call rez. There are rumors of enormous stockpiles or rez near the core worlds so you set off to seek them out. Along the way you encounter zombies and eventually take on the gargantuan task of ridding the galaxy of them.The first thing you do is set your world settings. There's multiple difficulty levels, 5 or 6 in total so you can vary your experience immensely, as well as settings for galaxy size, pirate density and tech distribution. You can create a unique experience for every game.Once you are playing the game has three main areas. First is the galaxy and system maps. You travel to different systems and you can select various missions in each one to level up your crew, buy or steal tech and collect rez and ship designs. The systems all have different levels so you have to decide what you can potentially accomplish.The next big part is your ship loadout screens, tech and hangar. In the tech screen you spend data (experience) that you have gather to level up various ship systems like beam weapons or shields. Each level increases the effectiveness of your systems and some levels are a prerequisite to advanced tech. Like you need level three beams to deploy particle beams or something. Then in the hanger you choose which hulls to use and what systems to put on them. You start with three hangars at the beginning of the game and get four by the end with larger capacity for larger hulls.The final major area is actually flying your ships on the planet or area of interest screens. They aren't always combat screens, some missions you might gather rez for example. But while on these screens you can switch control between all your ships as well as issuing orders to the other ships to do certain things like rendezvous over here or attack this target. Sometimes pirates show up, sometimes zombies, all depends on the mission. I found there to be a good variety of events and missions.The actual combat is extremely interesting if you make it challenging enough. Because there are so many types of ships and systems the way you fight can be varied. You might make a fast missile boat ship and whittle targets down while keeping out of their gun range. Or you might make a stealth capable ship, get in close and crush em with high powered beam cutters. Or maybe you want to use rotating turrets to track fast moving targets. It's up to you, there's no wrong way to do it, and a lot of times you have to adjust on the fly based on the tech available.Hull designs are obtained by killing enemy ships of that hull. Sometimes one ship is enough but most need 3 or 4 blueprint pieces. Tech for subsystems like weapons, engines and all that is obtained from planets either by trading with them or blowing up their bases and taking it. There's also specialist crew members who give you distinct bonuses like +10% cannon damage. So that has to be taken into account as well.In all there's a ton of ways to customize your game and your ships and it's very fun. I enjoyed leveling in this game immensely. The only downside is the hardest difficulties are REALLY hard and you end up basically grinding resources in low level areas to advance. But hard should be hard so I commend the devs for doing that. I guess you could fly smarter, not harder, if you're really good and get by with less.Finally there's challenges too via a little space arena the pirates run. It's a good way to make money and there's some achievements with it. Some are very hard.This game simply rocks and you have to try it.			"

												I decided to write a review for this game because I noted that I've sunk 31 hours into it, yet I have little to no memory of actually playing.  Therefore, I guess the game was addictive enough to keep me involved, yet not engaging enough to leave a lasting impression.  I vaguely recall zipping around a 2D landscape doing missions that were reminiscent of the Escape Velocity series, but I also remember that there was an annoying amount of grinding.  Still, giving it the thumbs up since it kept me playing for so long, but don't expect any great substance out of this game.			"

												I had a ton of fun with this indie gem.  The game is easy to pick up, but delivers on strategic challenge later on.   The battles are usually fast-paced and enjoyable, with many different valid strategic approaches.  Except for a few technologies that go obsolete, all the equipment you find can be used right up through the endgame, because you can equip small AI-controlled helper ships to help you on missions. I did find that the game was too easy, but I could have raised the difficulty.  Also, sometimes the enemy AI will use a fast ship and simply fly away from you, which it can do indefinitely, making it impossible to complete a mission.  This means that you may have to repeat a few missions for no other reason than that.  If you want a multiplayer experience, hold off and buy SPAZ 2, as this one unfortunately lacks that feature.			"

												This game is 90% great and 10% rubbish.  Its great when everything is going smoothly and you're rampaging around the galaxy killing stuff and its terrible when you get a certain map with an AI ship (in one of the fastest ships in the game) that shoots at you for a bit then runs off when it is near death, then comes back and shoots you again before running off.  When you have done this for 10 mins straight you will hate this game as much as I do - however, with a bit of patience you will realise that you can re-fit your ships mid-match to allow you to catch the tricky bugger or use drones which are faster than most ships.  .

												My only issues were...Pacing:  It felt like it took forever to upgrade the mothership and I ended up using the same ships for hours.  Also if  you need resources it's kind of a grind to accumulate them.  And the upgrade system kind of keeps you locked with regard to what weapons you use.  Switching to a different weapon type costs you all of the upgrade bonuses which typically doesn't work.Saving the game: If you get invaded when going to the mothership to save, you could be forced to fight another 10-15 minutes of ships and reinforcements before you can save the game.  I just ended up getting bored of playing and quit without saving.			"

												Space Pirats and Zombies is a fantastic achievement in of itself.  Its in the same vein as the old Star Control games in that it features an entirely ""Top Down"" perspective space combat experience. Despite what may seem like a straight forward simple game at first glance will quickly be washed away by how massive the galaxy can be if you so choose.SPAZ sports an intuitive levelling system where you earn points to spend on research to boost the attributes of several systems of your ships. From shields to turrets to the crew itself, the inner workings of your vessels will be fine tuned as you grow. Where you choose to research also determines what higher quality systems you will be able to implement as you acquire various blueprints for more efficient arms and armors. I would highly recommend this game to any and all who enjoy space combat. Its very action packed and exciting, at least in my opinion.It is truly the triumph of a motivated two man development team!

I put in about 25-30 hours of casual gameplay into this game before I finally decided to run through to the end.The basic idea is to level up, upgrade skills, and move to higher leveled solar systems.  Doing story missions or misc missions each solar system has.  There is no end to the basic solar system quests.You unlock ships and weapons by killing them or buying them.  Fun to pick what type of upgrades and ships to use in combat.  It can be boring if you want a story or bosses, but it can be fun if you just like collecting things and upgrading.The combat is fun and simple, but sometimes the AI has the advantage.			"

												This game could have been called Starscape 2 (see my review on Starscape, If you have played Space Rangers its also like a much better version of that game).  Its very much similiar except quite a bit better.  First of all you get 2 NPC ships that fight along side you which you can switch between.  Second if you get stuck you can fly around to different areas and try to get better equip.  They try to keep your direction open unless you want to advance the story, then you must accomplish certain tasks. Also requires salvage to unlock ships which is a neat idea.  A bloody shame its only single player. This game is worth up to 10 dollars.  If its 5 bucks don't miss it.  On a side note the game was actually made by only 2 guys which is amazing.			"

The developers appear to be committed to continued development to the extent of putting their roadmap in the game, and the recent halloween mod was a nie touch.			"

												This game is pretty badass. It has the perfect combination of Twitch Skill, Tactical Manuvering, and RPG-like progression. It's horribly addicting to keep cruising around space, hoping the next fight you get into will yield the blueprints you need for a sweet, 6 turret-ed ship to round out your fleet.The story is pretty meh, but I just skimmed most of the dialogue anyway. The background chatter that plays during missions and the billboards floating through space can be downright hilarious though.Since I got this on sale, my only compaint is that it might make me buy Space Rangers 2...

												Es gibt einige Spiele die ich für mich als einige der besten Games der letzten Jahre bezeichnen würde. Dazu gehören viele Indietitel wie Torchlight, Braid, Capsized, Darwinia, Terraria, Minecraft und Defense Grid. SPAZ (Space Pirates and Zombies) wird sich nahtlos in diese Reihe von Top-Indiegames einfügen. Das Spielprinzip ist absolut suchterzeugend, die Mischung aus Action, Strategie und RPG- Elementen ist absolut motivierend. Wäre SPAZ mit einer guten 3D Engine unter einem bekannten Publisher erschienen, wäre dieses Spiel sicherlich viel teurer. Erfolgreicher wäre es deshalb aber auch nicht. Der Developer Minmax Games besteht aus nur 2 Leuten die das Game in 2 Jahren in Eigenregie entwickelt haben. Ich kann nur sagen: Wer sich SPAZ zulegt hat für sehr wenig Geld sehr viel geniales Spielprinzip gekauft und noch mehr Spielspaß!			"

												This was a pleasant surprise of a space sim, in which the focus is as much on the 2D top-down space combat as it is on resource collection, faction negotiation/manipulation, and technology collection. It has a very RPG feel - as you gain experience and level, you place points into the systems of your ship that you most rely on, forcing you to always evaluate your strategy as there are MANY different systems to put points into, and the ships that you receive all use them differently. I did not expect to get sucked into this game, nor did I expect it to last as long as it did. Be careful with this one - it can get addictive very quickly. And once you get going, it's going to carry you a lot longer than you'll expect. It does get too repetitive towards the end of the game, and a lot of that time was spent grinding out materials. 3 out of 5 foxes.			"

												SPAZ, where to begin with this game?It is fun, perhaps not as intuitive as could be, interactive, perhaps sometimes montonous, especially on the first play-through when 'rez' farming becomes a regular occurence as countless little ships of yours get blasted into the dark abyss of space. It's design features and artistic styling leaves little to be desired; there truly is something for everything in this game! The faction system appears bleak, with the UTA, CIV, and Bounty Hunters not being fully exploited to their potential; the game uses the excuse that different star-systems don't communicate, and as such your reputation is reset to a set level in each system, a much better idea could be to have an option of this, but also a ranking system within a faction. Right now 'respect' is the only obtainable quantity with a faction (BH), and even that has miniscule effects on the game.The personalised feel to the game is something that draws you in and, more importantly, makes you want to stay. This game is so engaging, I can see myself losing countless more hours to it! I highly recommend this game, and though the £6.99 price tag may at first appear quite steep, believe me, the hours of fun you will get out of this game makes it all worthwhile.			"

												This game is a rare indy gem, unlike most indie gems, this game has more gameplay in it than most games released these days. The story is laughable and hard to follow, something about upgrading your mothership and getting a laser or something, but it does take a pretty unexpected twist in the fourth act. The meat of the game is VERY customizable ship combat. Outfit your increasingly powerful ships with lasers, cannons, missles, fighter drones, and more. The combat is great too, the Shield/Hull defences vs. Lasers/Projectiles mechanic requires carefull weapon loadouts, and as long as you keep your less than stellar AI comrades under a good leash, even overwhelming odds can be handled with skill. Also, SPAZ is made by a two-man team who are just doing what they love, and buying this game helps them make the game better. SPAZ has added HUGE amounts of content since launch (Namely the Bounty Hunters) and will keep having content added if people keep supporting it.			"

												This game fulfilled my dream of becoming a space pirate. The controls are engaging, the world convincing, the physics satisfying (ship explosions!), the story amusing, the space battles epic, and the graphics pleasing to the eye. Downsides are: the world is immense, but largely homogeneous - the gameplay becomes repetitive after a time. In the challenging systems, if you take a hard hit in a battle, it can take a while to recoup your lost resources. The ship and fleet customization is enjoyable, but there are only a couple missions that require particular kinds of builds. All in all, lot's of great fun to be had for the space pirate at heart, or the person that doesn't yet know they're a space pirate.			"

												Watch the trailer. If you like what you see, buy it. SPAZ is simply THE best game of it's genre, touching upon all the niche's and features that you might think to add to a top-down space exploration shmup. The Bounty Hunters update added a half dozen more ships and a ton of (voluntary) challenge scenarios.My biggest complaint: the second chapter (four chapters total) is rather long if you're a completionist and want to unlock everything. A lot of people stop playing prematurely and never enter the third chapter, where the zombies appear in earnest.Also: play on a medium sized galaxy. In a small galaxy the level gap between stars can be too large and you'll run out of things to do in a system, and you're more screwed if you♥♥♥♥♥♥off the wrong faction in a particular system. In a huge galaxy there's too many systems between you and wherever you want to go, so it gets repetitive.			"

I like how you level in this game and you can play at your own pace - either exploring each system you can reach and slowly getting more powerful, or going all out, rushing towards the galatic centre and leveling like crazy. Play it, play it now			"

												This game fulfilled my dream of becoming a space pirate. The controls are engaging, the world convincing, the physics satisfying (ship explosions!), the story amusing, the space battles epic, and the graphics pleasing to the eye. Downsides are: the world is immense, but largely homogeneous - the gameplay becomes repetitive after a time. In the challenging systems, if you take a hard hit in a battle, it can take a while to recoup your lost resources. The ship and fleet customization is enjoyable, but there are only a couple missions that require particular kinds of builds. All in all, lot's of great fun to be had for the space pirate at heart, or the person that doesn't yet know they're a space pirate.			"

												SPAZ, the space sim with an attitude. Having none other than TotalBiscuit himself as the narrator, it's one of the best hidden gems among space games, with a great story, insane unforgiving but very rewarding gameplay, infinite replayability and a style, that no other game can match. A very detailed universe with it's own history and unique characters, blending all that is nerd (Space, Pirates and Zombies, obviously. No Ninjas though...). What it lacks in visuals, makes up for tenfold in fun.Highly recommended!			"

												For a 2-man indie development team, one would not think that SPAZ could amount to much. Anyone thinking this: Boy were you wrong. SPAZ is a top-down, 2-D space-based shooter that combine RPG, RTS and some two-point elements to combine into a great, trully awesome game.At the time of writing this I have not beat it yet, but I have however sunk over 70 hours into it and really enjoyed myself. The game provides a plot and a purpose to strive for, but you get to chose how you get there. What ships you use, how you equip them, what tactics you employ, where you go, who you befriend/betray/fight, it's all up to you.If you enjoy Sci-Fi and shooters and a simple but great game with a rather twisted, grim-dark universe, all for the low price of 9 EURO's that don't demand a monster of a gaming PC, this is for you.

												What a game, what a work of art for a two-person team.It's so beautiful, from the debris-strewn starscapes to the twinkling spaceships and spinning starbases. The sound effects are good, too. The background chatter could have used more variety, but it was so well done and unobstrusive that it never annoyed me. The misanthropic humor is pervasive throughout the game, from the main characters' dialogue to the way slavery is tacitly endorsed by everyone.There are lots intriguing ships, weapons, and upgrades to try, though brute-force lasering was how I usually settled things. The beams-cannons-missiles damage system makes you carefully weigh your strengths and weaknesses, while the rez-goons-data economy keeps you hunting for ways to exploit and score. I would have liked more missions and factions, though.The difficulty of the game is quite well balanced until the very end. I got stuck many times, but getting unstuck often required just a different fleet or loadout. And when I needed a break, I could look for other things to do like collect components or free up warp gates.Still, the game is undeniably a grind. With there being only two factions and not much in the way of plot and missions, there is a lot of looking for other things to do. When the game got too repetitive, I'd play it intensely for a few weeks and then stop for a few months before playing again.What bothers me most is how the game ended. In the last chapter, I did the minimum I had to do to proceed to the finale. I then saved the game and went ahead to the finale just to take a brief peek at it, expecting to be defeated right away. Fifteen minutes later, I'd won the game without breaking a sweat. That was really disappointing. I was playing on Normal difficulty with a tech level of 113, so I don't think I was overleveled. In fact, the unique side missions were still very tough for me. Even the story, which I found fairly interesting, ended flatly.			"

												Don't let the stupid name put you off (as it did me), SPAZ is an awesome game. Check the demo to see for yourself.The game is a top down space ship fleet combat shooter. You design ships using modular components such as hulls, weapons, engines and other support systems that you unlock as you go. You can have multiple ships in your fleet but you only control one ship at a time with the ability to switch control to any combat ship in your fleet. You can give basic instructions to your other AI controlled ships via a tactical interface. Story wise it's pretty simplistic, with the occasional bit of juvenile humour. You travel around the galaxy gaining favour in star systems in order to unlock new technologies and access to services and resources.			"

												I blame a friend of mine for getting me to play this. I have had a lot of random fun just blasting stuff all across the stars. You can be a nice pirate, an evil pirate, or just flip flop depending on how much of an♥♥♥♥♥you want to be at the time. Killed a lot of time in this game indeedUpdating the Review affter time:This game is worth it. See above for some of the stuff I did. But, it's a classic at this point, and while there is a second game, the second game completely takes what most everyone loved of this game and gutted it. If you want a crazy yet engaging story, some silly dialogue, and a fun combat system, this is for you. The other fun is that each playthrough changes the galaxy you play in, randomizing a lot of things. Makes it a much more ""roguelike"" style.The only negative is that sometimes there's some grind for some resources if you want to get some things, but really, it's up to you on how you play, so if you want to grind to be overly powerful, or risk it all and go underpowered, that's your choice.

The worst ones in my opinion are the sometimes bad game balance (compared to your enemies you are weak, then extremely strong, then weak again) and controls. I never got totally used to them. And the story sucked, but who cares. However, if you think this is the kind of game you might enjoy, definitely give it a go. It kept _me_ busy for almost 80 hours.			"

Huge galaxy with many, many stars as well. Small grind, yes, but it is honestly worth the time and effort.

												This is probably the grindiest game I've ever played. It's not a bad game at all, but it has a few hours of fun gameplay spread out over 25 hours repeating the same missions over and over. There's no real reason to explore systems, especially if you don't need a technology upgrade. A little blip of story in random systems or random FTL-style encounter would make it more compelling to explore.The devs in the forums confirm that the best way to play is to put all of your points into one type of weapon. If you don't, you'll have to grind 2-3x as much to viably use multiple types of weapons. Despite all the fancy looking weapons, attachments, and mounting points in this game, you'll probably end up with a ship loaded with all of one type of weapon. You'll also quickly learn to never die so much that you run out of rez, or you'll have to grind away at a mining station for a while just to have enough money to start playing the game again.If I played again, I would play without bounty hunters. It looks like they a balancing mechanism, because the only thing they do is provide a constant drain on your resources. The diminishing returns of their arena-style missions weren't very worthwhile.It does look very good, especially when battles involve different kinds of ships, weapons, and drones flying about. The movement and turning speed plays a major role in the game, so I did like how I feels like naval warfare. Throughout the 25 hours there were fun bits unlocking new ships and figuring out what works well too, but once I figured it out it was back to the grind. It's a decent game to play while watching TV or listening to some podcasts, but it wouldn't hold my interest alone.			"

												It's a quirky top-down space shooter (Dude, retro! Love it!). I hear there will be zombies that seem to be described similarly to Reavers from Firefly. I don't know and I don't care. All I know is I get to blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up and make weird little ships... which I get the schematics for by blowing up other people and taking their stuff!Totally worth it. :D			"

												SPAZ is not your typical space shooter.  Think: Homeworld meets Command and Conquer.   Randomly generate your own galaxy to conquer, support the faction of your choice, and later destroy the zombie menace.  Along the way research your own tech, customize your ships, and laugh as you ram your ship into the poor hapless crewmen from the ship you just made into space swiss cheese.  The fact that the story is voiced by the popular Youtubeist 'Totalbiscuit' is just icing on the cake.  SPAZ is truly a gem with an art style from games they just don't make any more.			"

												I think there is very little bad I can say about this game, which has taken so many hours of my life. It is just about as much fun as I know how to handle in a space shoot 'em up.			"

												This is very niceThis is a complementary review.The difficulty settings are thouroughly thought. Any complaint about difficulty, rebuilding, etc. Is the player's fault. The difficulty settings, and map/campaign customs at the begining are directly related to adapt the game to you. if your a massive noob, choose the according settings!This is a complementary review.

												A little slow at first, but once you get your first few blueprints for new ships, the amount of customziation you can do is amazing!Fun top-down space shooter, a blend of space invaders, battletech, and Duke Nukem [the humor]. The grahics are both fun, and don't seem to get old very fast. Space shooter plus customizable space craft & tech tree to support your particular playstyle. Like missles or lazers? Want to use mega-bombers, or carriers with a small fleet of its own craft? You get to decide which ships to build in your 'home base', how they are armed, etc.Well worth the price.			"

												Space Pirats and Zombies is a fantastic achievement in of itself.  Its in the same vein as the old Star Control games in that it features an entirely ""Top Down"" perspective space combat experience. Despite what may seem like a straight forward simple game at first glance will quickly be washed away by how massive the galaxy can be if you so choose.SPAZ sports an intuitive levelling system where you earn points to spend on research to boost the attributes of several systems of your ships. From shields to turrets to the crew itself, the inner workings of your vessels will be fine tuned as you grow. Where you choose to research also determines what higher quality systems you will be able to implement as you acquire various blueprints for more efficient arms and armors. I would highly recommend this game to any and all who enjoy space combat. Its very action packed and exciting, at least in my opinion.It is truly the triumph of a motivated two man development team!

												This game is 90% great and 10% rubbish.  Its great when everything is going smoothly and you're rampaging around the galaxy killing stuff and its terrible when you get a certain map with an AI ship (in one of the fastest ships in the game) that shoots at you for a bit then runs off when it is near death, then comes back and shoots you again before running off.  When you have done this for 10 mins straight you will hate this game as much as I do - however, with a bit of patience you will realise that you can re-fit your ships mid-match to allow you to catch the tricky bugger or use drones which are faster than most ships.  .

												What a game, what a work of art for a two-person team.It's so beautiful, from the debris-strewn starscapes to the twinkling spaceships and spinning starbases. The sound effects are good, too. The background chatter could have used more variety, but it was so well done and unobstrusive that it never annoyed me. The misanthropic humor is pervasive throughout the game, from the main characters' dialogue to the way slavery is tacitly endorsed by everyone.There are lots intriguing ships, weapons, and upgrades to try, though brute-force lasering was how I usually settled things. The beams-cannons-missiles damage system makes you carefully weigh your strengths and weaknesses, while the rez-goons-data economy keeps you hunting for ways to exploit and score. I would have liked more missions and factions, though.The difficulty of the game is quite well balanced until the very end. I got stuck many times, but getting unstuck often required just a different fleet or loadout. And when I needed a break, I could look for other things to do like collect components or free up warp gates.Still, the game is undeniably a grind. With there being only two factions and not much in the way of plot and missions, there is a lot of looking for other things to do. When the game got too repetitive, I'd play it intensely for a few weeks and then stop for a few months before playing again.What bothers me most is how the game ended. In the last chapter, I did the minimum I had to do to proceed to the finale. I then saved the game and went ahead to the finale just to take a brief peek at it, expecting to be defeated right away. Fifteen minutes later, I'd won the game without breaking a sweat. That was really disappointing. I was playing on Normal difficulty with a tech level of 113, so I don't think I was overleveled. In fact, the unique side missions were still very tough for me. Even the story, which I found fairly interesting, ended flatly.			"

												This is stupid. And yet, I have played a whole bunch of it. It filled a niche in the games market that I never really had something for. There are a lot of top down space shooters with ships and whatnot, but really, I've only played flash games in that category. I loved them immensely, so when I had a chance to pick this up, I said, why not? I still recall the first day I played it, I got into it a bit, then got dragged down to the pool by my little sister, then a thunderstorm started up, and I came back home and kept playing. How many games can you recall specifically the day you started playing?			"

												A great game and time shredder. As it was said by the developers themselves it is a game like the old ones that seem to not be built anymore nowadays.It's combination of real time combat with round based development progress are come along great. The visial representation is awesome. The gameplay has way more depth then one expects initially and the storyline is catchy.And Zombies. In Space!Warning: Addictive!			"

												Awesome game. I put a lot of hours in this game - probably the most out of any indie title.If you ever like overhead space shooters, but always wished for a little more RPG elements in it, then this is the game for you. You can customize your ships, upgrade the ships that fly with you, and upgrade your main 'base'. There's lots of missions to play so you never feel bored. There's a lot of content in this game and I definitely recommend it!Edit: The bounty hunters update added a lot to the game as well. Excited for SPAZ2!			"

												What a fantastic game. This title has been given alot of love by the developer and it shows. There's a nice variety of weapons and ships for you to play around with to suite different styles. The game runs smooth, i've had no errors or bugs since playing. Leveling up and running around the galaxy after those blueprints for better ships and equipment never gets dull. Worth anyones hard earned this game is.			"

												Definitely an excellent game; when I first saw it, I wasn't so interested, chalking its weird colors up to another rehashed indie game, but it's actually an excellent, fun play that's easy to grasp but with quite a great amount of complexity. It's the hard science fiction 2D lite game you've always wanted.			"

												A very fun game.The player has a space carrier in this game. The carrier usually jumps into a hidden position when jumping into a new system, and launches his smaller ships. The player commands one of the smaller ships, while the other are ai controlled.There are a lot of missions, mining possibilites and upgrades in each new star system. The whole galaxy has about 200 or more star systems. The game options allow it to set the size of the galaxy at the start of the game.The game follows a main story with a lot of side stories and random missions.			"
