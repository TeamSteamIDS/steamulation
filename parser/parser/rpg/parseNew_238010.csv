												Important Note: Your previous saves don't carry over into the Director's Cut due to the integration of the DLC titled Missing Link. Be warned that if you're at a personal point of no return then you may wish to hold off on getting this version.An amazing redux of the original title it does have its flaws. The first of which being that the implimentation of integrating the DLC mission was rather poorly handled and its entirely possible to accidentally leave your guns and even Praxis (the upgrades to augmentations) points behind without meaning to as I had nearly done this had I not gone actively looking for them. For those curious, they're to the left at the end of the mission before getting onto the boat but positioned as such that it can completely escape the eye when crossing by it.There is also NO balancing for New Game Plus. You don't get to carry over your weapons (why?) but your augmentations carry over, which is an odd choice since by the end of the game even a casual player can almost peak out the character and almost break the game when launching into a new game, which wouldn't have been the same had inventory carried over as weapons and items don't have quite the same effect on gameplay that some of the augmentations do leading to some awkward moments where you've long since passed an area and the dialog is minutes behind on registering because you're flying through levels faster than anticipated.The graphics did get a neat little boost, but having come from playing the original version straight to the new one, its hard to really tell unless you know exactly what you're looking for. Lighting effects are perhaps the most noteable and easiest to miss unless you're familiar with specific areas of the game that would have otherwise been completely overlooked.Boss fights are perhaps the most  changed out of everything since there are now alternate ways to take out a boss rather than resorting to using up your ammo or praying you outdamage them. They're still rather frustrating however as their AI hasn't really been modified to accept these changes in level design leading to a rather awkward moment where the Boss paces in just a small area attempting to find you in a room they are completely unfamiliar with, or have to rely solely on bull rushing to get to you before you're able to hack a panel.Overall though the game still stands up, but if you're looking for an amazing Cyber Punk experience and don't mind some dated graphics, seek out the original Deus Ex as it has the most in terms of balance, but for the modern era of gaming there really isn't an experience like Human Revolution.

												Although I've played DXHR back when it first came out, recently I got into Almost Human and felt the urge to replay the game...especially since the Director's Cut version had come out recently.  And now that I've finished it, I must say that I consider this is easily one of my most favorite games of all time.Is it perfect?  Of course not.  But what this game *does* have is, interesting settings, compelling and very possible vision of a world in the near future, fascinating storyline and memorable characters....and all of that will stay with you long after the game's done.  There are multiple ways of going through each area to suit just about any playstyle out there; nooks and crannies to explore, secret areas to discover, emails to read, people to talk to, and sidequests to complete.  The game does not lock you into a specific playstyle, but rather makes it possible, through giving the player the ability to pick and choose their augmentations, to cater to and enhance, various ways of play.  Like to sneak around, hack into things and be virtually undetectable?  You can do that.  Like to just mow everyone down with explosions and heavy weapons?  You can do that too.  Don't like killing anyone?  Yes, you can be a pacifist and just knock people out.One of the most interesting themes the game offers is the subject of the progress of technology and how it relates to us as humans.  Refreshingly, the game doesn't have a pre-determinted opinion on this and doesn't clobber you over the head with whatever it thinks is the right answer.  Rather, throughout the game, it allows you various glimpses and insights into different views from people you interact with, which affect your perception of the matter at hand, and, ultimately, play a huge role in how it all plays out in the end.TL;DR - highly recommended, buy it and play it if you haven't already! :D "

												I will try to keep this recommendation short, but whatever I put here know there is still much more awesome to this game.The game is huge and can take anywhere from 15 hours if you rush through it, to 30 hours if you take the time to read all the lore and details that is everywhere in the game. Said lore is expansive and actually very interesting to read. So is all the dialog, with very well done voice acting especially by the protagonist. The sounds are great too, including the weapons.The game is first person and seamlessly moves to third person whenever you hug a wall or climb a ladder. You can use a variety of weapons from pistols to shotguns, rifles and crossbows, even rocket launchers. There are non-lethal weapons too like tazers and a tranq rifle. You have an inventory you have to manage which holds your weapons, ammo, and everything else you might want. There are plenty of lootable objects, including your enemies.The game works like this: you are given a goal and are free to get to it how you wish. And I mean really free. Not like some other games which try to make you believe their attempt at stealth actually counts, because in the end you just kill the guys anyway. No, here you actually do have a choice. It is quite possible to avoid contact with any enemy in the game (except bosses), and doing so actually earns you more rewards than if you killed everybody. And if you're real good you can silently take everyone out and earn the ghost rewards. You do this by utilizing alternate routes, many of which can only be accessed if you take non-combat perks. You can also talk your way through certain areas, or hack certain things so you can slip by. This is far from a linear game.Perks you can get include higher jumping, more strength (to pick up that vending machine revealing the vent behind it, or use it to access a high ledge, or even as a shield from gunfire or to throw at your enemies for lots of damage), poison resistant lungs (to move through contaminated areas), hacking, stealth perks, and more. And of course there are perks to aid in combat like less recoil, damage resistance, ability to see through walls and mark targets too.Yes there most definitely is replayability. You are given choices throughout the game which does have a minor impact on what happens along that avenue, including what some people will say to you. If you choose to go in guns blazing your first time, you should probably try it a second time as a stealth person; you will learn things about the game you never would otherwise. There is also a new game plus so you can keep your perks from last game and eventually have everything unlocked during your second, if you so wish. Some people don't like achievements, but if this game didn't have one for beating it without killing anyone and another for never setting off an alarm, I most likely never would have bothered and therefore would have missed out on some fun and challenge.Closing remark I would like to say that this game is a very worthy successor to the original masterpiece of Deus Ex. If you enjoyed that classic then you are all but guaranteed to enjoy this too.If you want a very in depth game filled with many hours of memorable gameplay, then do yourself a favor and buy this. At 20 bucks it's a great deal, on sale you have no excuse to pass it up. Buy now!			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a first-person action RPG set in the future. The game's story in addition to the way you choose to proceed through it and the gaming style you choose to follow complement one another deftly to provide you with an exceptional experience.The good things* Story: It mainly revolves around the ethics of ""augmentations"", that is cyberntic extensions that can be attached to a human being to improve the body or/and the mind. You are Adam Jensen, one who was recently cybernetically augmented. Yes, you are the the main character but you'll quickly see that you are part of a very big story with multiple secondary characters having their own agendas. The ending is satisfactory as there is no loose plot, and everything falls nicely into one place.* Level design: There are many ways for you to complete an objective. There generally is the main way (rambo), and many other paths. There is always a secondary path that will allow anyone to get inside a building without requiring special augmentations, while other may require you to level up a cybernetic part of your body. Being curious is a good thing. Also, being a ""hacker"" is great: it's a bit difficult to invest on this from the start but it pays off quickly as you are able to get to places you couldn't reach easily otherwise.* Stealth: You can finish the game without killing anyone, except the bosses. I wish more games do that.The less good things* Boss battles: it's certainly the weakest point of the game. Yes, you can use the environment rather than weapons to kill them, but all boss battles (except the last one maybe) left me underwhelmed.* Difficulty: If you go the ""hacker"" way, you'll find that the game gets much easier. I had only one playthrough (too many games to play to do it a second time) so maybe it's true only for the hacking part.It's also supposed to be an action game, as you can play it ""rambo"" style... But you would miss a lot by doing that. I suggest anyone wanting to get the best from this game to play it in stealth mode: also, try to avoid killing anyone (Pacifist achievement) and avoid starting off alarms. And, play in on max difficulty. This combination should arguably be the best way to play the game.			"

 “To Be, ..More Human than Human” Set in the dark, dystopian future of 2022, ‘Deus Ex: Human Revolution’ is a fantastic blend of the First Person Shooter (FPS) | Stealth | RPG genres and a testament to gaming as both an art form and sublime story-telling medium.  Campaign: Released by Eidos | Square Enix in 2013, the world of ‘Deus-Ex’ is a bleak near-future where Corporations are increasingly more powerful – and Biotech firms vie for control of the Human Cryogenic Augmentation market. These increasingly high stakes result in a growing focus on corporate espionage and security – enter Adam Jensen – an ex-SWAT Commander hired as head of security for Sarif Industries. The opening credits detail Jensen’s brutal execution-style killing during a break-in at Sarif Industries, his resurrection through cryogenic augmentation and drops you into the shoes of the Part-Man, Part-Machine, to piece together the fragmented memories of the past and uncover the cause of the attack. An engrossing, deep campaign takes you around the world, on sprawling open world levels where the broader storyline is broken up through the distractions of a richly atmospheric world, numerous side quests, and lots of collectibles and readable background lore scattered around the maps.Gameplay | Graphics | Sound: Gameplay is aligned around the game’s 4 pillars of FPS based-combat, Stealth mechanics, RPG elements (of character customization) and Player Choice in story-telling direction – and the game seamlessly switches from one mode to another. You are allowed considerable breadth of choice in approaching every situation – Frontal Assault, Stealth or even Smooth-Talking your way past the opposition - building in replayability into the title as well. Several different situational outcomes, great graphics with a trademark orange machine-hue, a brooding pulsating score, responsive K&M controls and controller support round out a well polished title.  Note that this review is based on the ‘Director’s Cut’ version of the game which includes all DLC integrated directly into the overall campaign – resulting in close to 75-80 hours of gameplay to complete the campaign, track down all side-quests, see through multiple endings, read all the lore etc (but your mileage may vary). Flaws: Minor quibbles with the game include the occasional scripted boss battle that while serving to move the broader narrative along, tend to stifle the freedom otherwise celebrated throughout the game. Other issues include longish load times, an inordinate disk space requirement (of 20+ Gigs) and being particularly resource heavy, resulting in some framerate drop issues.Overall however, ‘Deus-Ex: Human Revolution’ is a triumphant blend of story-telling and disparate game genres. A visually stunning and immersive world, a deep, layered campaign, large open world levels, multiple endings determined by player choice, and very good replayability make this one of the best story-driven titles of recent memory. While the game’s broadly Sci-Fi / Cyber-punk theme will admittedly not be to everyone’s taste, for fans of the genre and classic sci-fi flicks such as RoboCop and BladeRunner, this is essential gaming and overall, a shining example of Gaming Evolved.

Short version: 88%Human Revolution, like its predecessors in this line of popular first person role playing stealth games, offers freedom in almost every aspect to fit any play style. As far as multiplatform games go, this is probably the best you can get to recreate the old Deus Ex atmosphere.Long version: Deus Ex: Human Revolution is the third instalment in the Deus Ex series, and it’s also the prequel and the spiritual successor of the highly acclaimed first game from 2000– mostly disregarding the existence of the not-so-popular second game.Deus Ex always liked to promote freedom in play styles. All missions, be it plot-critical or just a side quest, have at least two solutions: go in guns blazing, or be sneaky. Although there is a decent arsenal in the game, and a few lethal augmentations (this franchise’s version of spells), the designers clearly favour the latter: there are hidden routes everywhere, you can bypass security systems, and there are several ways to dispose of the guards in a non-lethal, silent manner. You even get a large praxis (experience) boost when choosing these solutions.The story involves yet another conspiracy, but without any clandestine organisations secretly trying to topple the current society. The scale is smaller: you deal with corporate espionage and political movements resenting the human augmentation technology. You will still encounter soldiers working for the secret government, but the most common enemies are thugs and private security.The Director’s Cut, the only version available now, integrates the formerly separate expansion into the storyline, which unbalances the endgame, but creates a more coherent narrative. The boss fights, the bane of the original edition, also got revamped, but they are only slightly better now. Still, all and all, this is the superior version (despite some technical issues), the one recommended for all cRPG fans, be them new or old.			"

												BUYER BEWARE!The good:Deus Ex: Human Revolution was a fantastic game when it came out. The world is beautiful and immersive, and great care has been given to every little detail in it.The story was intriguing, I was instantly hooked. The voice acting, music and overall sound of the game was fantastic.As of writing this, I've played through the original 2 times and am currently working on my 3rd playthough.The bad:The director's cut of this game is based on an older build, which means that the bugs that were patched out of the original DXHR are back!As of writing this review, the last patch released was back in November of 2013. A year later, there has been no word from Eidos Montreal of another patch. Seems likely that they have simply moved on to other games by now.Issues include:Performance issues even on high-end rigs Broken post-processing Down right horrible texture pop inAnd over 100 other bugs that can be found in this thread: http://steamcommunity.com/app/238010/discussions/0/810939350891608249/Recommendation: DO NOT BUY! Find copies of the original DXHR and the DLC online, and redeem them on Steam.			"

												As an owner of the (original) Deus Ex: Human Revolution and The Missing Link, the Director's Cut does have some improved gameplay mechanics when combating bosses and integrated flow for The Missing Link to be implemented in the game. Unfortunately, small annoying bugs and game breaking exploits brings a lot of frustration to the player. The main question to ask is: Should the owner of the original Deus Ex: HR and TML get the Director's Cut? What about new players who want to play it? The answer shall be reveal. For newcomers, Deus Ex: Human Revolution takes place in the year, 2027, in a cyberpunk universe where the debate about human augmentation vs human nature gone horribly out of control, drawing people from both sides arguing over this controversy. You play as Adam Jensen, an ex-cop and lead security for Sarif Industries, who will unravel a hidden conspriacy among individuals who want to seek a hidden agenda. The background stories in the game is genuinely impressive when reading EBooks (or scholarly articles). The main plot is well paying close attention to, allowing you to make certain decisions in the game that will benefit or hinder you. One of the best parts in the game is dynamic dialogue  and persuasion. Arguably, this dialogue system is well-written and your dialogue choices would not always work in multiple occasions when talking to important characters in the game. The stealth system is really, I mean really, really outstanding. Sure, you can ""Pew pew pew, I can shoot people"", but being stealthy and conduct ""passive"" takedowns feels great. I strongly recommend doing stealth and passive takedowns to get the best experience in this game. I guarantee it. The hacking mechanic is good at first, but the reward system is...too easy to achieve. However, hacking can really make a difference and ease a lot better to passby enemies without too much difficulty. The negative aspects in this Director's Cut are the overwhelming number of bugs, exploits, less optimized than the original DE:HR and TML, and lack of attention/patches from the developers. This is absolutely unacceptable from the developers. At times, the Director's Cut version is a cash cow for owners who have the original DE:HR & TML. It really is for the original owners, including myself. In my personal honest opinion, people who have the original copy should not get the Director's Cut since there's little change and no game fixes for the Director's Cut. However, if you want to support the developers to make future Deus Ex sequels/games, you can. Deus Ex: Human Revolution was released in August 2011 and received rave reviews and awards. There's no doubt that Deus Ex: Human Revolution was a fantastic game that every gamer should experience. For those who never play the franchise, you must get this game (best get the Director's Cut at -75% or -80% off for $5 or $4 USD or regional equivalent). For those who have the original copies of DE:HR and TML, I suggest that the Director's Cut is not worth getting due to unaddressed technical and in-game problems, but you can still buy the Director's Cut if you want to. The Director's Cut has my highest recommendation for newcomers and ""cautious"" recommendation for the original owners.			"

												Deus Ex as a series has since its inception in 2000 been synonymous with its commitment to player choice. Though the freedom it proposed to offer only extended as far as the game had been designed to allow (as does every game by their very nature), its strength was in concealing these limits well enough that your actions still felt independent.Human Revolution (and its Director’s Cut, which is what I will be reviewing and has been my first exposure to the game) intends to carry this torch forward, but rather than simply revive a franchise that has been dormant since the less positively received Invisible War in 2003, Human Revolution presents itself as a fresh start and a chance to redefine Deus Ex. In the process they’ve created a game that often feels ready to fall apart at a moment’s notice, but is uniquely fascinating in that despite all its faults Human Revolution still seems to accomplish virtually everything it intended to.What Human Revolution does best is keep the player in the dark without telegraphing this with obvious plot holes or unavailable mechanics. As Adam Jensen, previous head of security for Serif industries brought back to life through an experimental human augmentation surgery, I felt from the very beginning sufficiently capable for what the game threw at me. I was informed, technologically and physically superior to my enemies, and clear as to what my role was in all of this.Human Revolution manages to keep this up an astoundingly long time, keeping its narrative tightly concealed even when it seems to be spilling open before you. This is largely accomplished through Human Revolution ultimately being less about individuals, but organizations and ideas. The comically evil villains teased at the beginning of the game are quickly eclipsed by motives and plans far bigger and more radical than their mundane attempts at intimidation which are little more than a front. Human Revolution is a game with big aspirations that excels at asking complex, difficult questions with the intelligence they require and a lack of simple solutions to choose between.Transhumanist and metaphysical debate as to the ethical implications of humanity accelerating its own evolution are at the center of all of this, but rather than creating two sides characterized by extreme extrapolations of their ideologies for the player to choose between, Human Revolution intentionally muddies the water so as to require the player to come to their own conclusions as to whose (if anyone’s) side they should choose. The ideas it presents are complicated and logical in a way that is rarely seen in games, which more often fall back to black and white views of morality even as they assume to be more intelligent than a collection of tired, easy clichés.Human Revolution never falls into this trap, going so far as to omit many of the gaming’s standard illustrations of choice and consequence to avoid simplifying itself for the sake of convenience. There are no morality bars which swell and dip with each conversation, no side quests locked out by binary choices or indicators informing you that your decisions have consequences. In this way Human Revolution feels refreshingly unhindered by the freedom that ironically tends to lock games down, allowing you to approach situations and conversations on whatever terms you feel appropriate, and then requiring you to deal with whatever happens later.Upgrades in the form of unlocked augments serve as a much more reserved skill tree than we have grown used to seeing, but rather than narrowing your options for growth Human Revolution has gone to great lengths to trim its progression system down to its most meaningful components. Skill points came very slowly throughout the game, but each time I received one it presented an important choice that had the potential to extensively alter my style of play. I found myself paying a great deal of attention with how I spent each of my points, giving me a greater attachment to my play style and a more noticeable sense of improvement than I initially expected.Whether I was smooth talking a guard to let me by or opting to slip in through an air duct, my actions created natural ripples which often extended further than I even realized. This feeling that I was a part of a world which reacted and changed depending on how I interacted with it, made Human Revolution exceedingly engaging and surprising. It’s rare for me to feel like I’m inhabiting an actual developed world when I play a game, but no matter how long I spent with Human Revolution I rarely saw the edges where that illusion breaks and I’m reminded that these are just images on a screen.Unfortunately though that means when those edges do appear, they’re that much more jarring and disappointing, even more so in this case as when Human Revolution fails it does so in ways you can’t unsee and which don’t go away. Bugs and glitches abound, from spotty hit detection to excessive clipping to instances of guards seeing/not seeing me when they should/shouldn’t to weird animation hiccups and general issues in presentation. More pressing than technical breakdowns though is how disconnected enemies felt from their environment. Repetitive patrol patterns and alert cooldown timers I could deal with, but looking at enemies standing above a stairwell unsure how to proceed, or having them crouch idly outside a vent I had just crawled into rather than proceed in after me made it hard to view my adversaries as people rather than models running on scripts with some very narrow parameters.Human Revolution makes up a lot of the slack created by its incapable patrols with level designs I loved exploiting and experimenting within, often discovering routes where I least expected it and feeling incredibly clever each time I found a new solution to a problem I’d been stuck at. This is stripped away completely though in each of the games widely criticized boss fights, which amount to giant warts on a better game than they deserve to be a part of. They’re boring, simple, allow effectively no room to experiment, and are typically so easy as to make me wish they had simply been replaced with a cutscene that would at least have taken less time.The worst offender in regards to wasting your time however isn’t a boss fight (or not entirely, that is), but the mini campaign originally released as DLC, The Missing Link. In the Director’s Cut this is integrated directly into the story as you play, but it is so abundantly clear it wasn’t originally a part of the game that you’d never mistake it for anything but an underwhelming add-on unceremoniously popping up at a pivotal point in Human Revolution proper. It’s a very tedious, meandering mission which essentially resets your progress in the game up to that point and takes several hours before it’s even clear why you should care about what’s going on, at which point it’s very nearly over.There are so many rough edges to Deus Ex: Human Revolution that it would be easy to pick it apart bit by bit as half-baked and overambitious. Doing so though would miss what makes it so impressive and interesting. It’s a game with so many layers, of interconnected systems and the  dynamics that crop up between them, that even when one element breaks down it is held up by everything working together with it to create an experience that feels so uncharacteristically AAA. Human Revolution takes a lot of big risks with its design, not all of which work and some will likely fail to resonate with certain players, but its willingness to commit to itself feels inspired in a way I haven’t felt from a big budget game in quite some time.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												The Director's Cut for HR doesn't do anything particularly dramatic, but it makes changes where it counts. The graphics are touched up a little bit, there's New Game+, the boss fights have new rooms that enable you to take them out as a hacker character, the preorder bonuses are more sensibly placed, and the Missing Link DLC, which was previously a standalone game, is integrated into the story (though in a somewhat lazy way) - along with some minor changes, like the removal of being able to punch a certain boss in the face and end that fight in one punch. But the real gem of this edition of the game that makes it totally worth coming back to in my opinion is the developer commentary option, which I think everyone who has played the game should go through at some point. It fills the game with hours of commentary nodes from a group of lead developers from the game, and it's presented in such a casual way that it almost feels like you're playing the game alongside a group of friends or something. They go into detail on every aspect of the game's development, and point out a ton of things that you probably never realized no matter how many times you may have played the game. It's not recommendable for a first playthrough since they talk over the cutscenes and occasionally spoil things, but if you're returning a second time I'd highly recommend turning it on.Though some of you may be playing for the first time, and wondering how the game is in general. As a whole, while Human Revolution isn't my favorite in the series, it does a great job of maintaining the Deus Ex feeling of having plenty of choices and ways to navigate each level to accomodate different playstyles. It has a few issues that still aren't fixed by the DC, like how it awards XP for hacking things (which discourages you from ever bothering to use passwords) and  the conspiracy generally isn't as interesting as in the old games, but it's still an all around pretty great game, and definitely worth checking out whether you've played the old games or not.

												One step forward, two steps back.Deus Ex: Human Revolution was a good game; a bit flawed, but a great experience overall. This is essentially a glorified (and badly-executed) patch/cash grab, which reworks a few things (mainly boss fights and DLC integration), but breaks a lot of things that were already fixed in patches.The reworked boss fights are great, especially for those who prefer the stealth/non-lethal approach and had trouble dealing with the bosses in the original version. The Missing Link DLC's integrated into the game now, though it still feels disjointed, and an option to skip it or launch it from the menu instead of having to go through it on every playthrough would have been nice.Unfortunately, in everything else, this ""ultimate"" edition of the game falls flat on its face compared to the original DXHR. Performance is worse, the game takes up nearly twice as much space (18.2 GB vs 10.6 GB for the original + DLC) for no apparent reason, and bugs that were fixed in the original version are back, along with some that weren't even in the original release (look here for a list: http://steamcommunity.com/app/238010/discussions/0/810939350891608249/), lending credence to the idea that they used an older build of the game for development. The much-complained-about gold tint's gone, but I'm not certain that change was intentional, because post-processing (which includes the gold filter) simply does not work. Depth of field doesn't work either, and a lot of the textures have problems appearing correctly.I've uploaded a few comparison screenshots here so you can see the graphical issues I'm talking about: http://imgur.com/a/AjaRgIf you don't own Human Revolution yet, find a retail copy of the original if you can; it's not available on the Steam store anymore. You'll miss out on the DLC, but at least you won't have to play through a bug-infested main game. If you already have the original, don't bother buying this unless you _really_ want to see the updated boss fights, do a New Game+ playthrough (you'll have to start from the beginning, though; saves from the original don't carry over), and/or listen to the developer's commentary, because that's all the Director's Cut really has to offer.EDIT 2014-03-29: kamil950 shares that while the original game's been removed from the Steam store, other digital stores still have the standard edition + DLCs which can be activated on Steam.

												!!! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME !!!Director's Cut is a scam. The game uses an old version of the original game, which means it has all the bugs that were patched years ago in THE ORIGINAL GAME! Only handful were fixed in DC. In addition to the new bugs players have found, this version also seems to have downgraded graphics, such as low quality SSAO, broken Post Processing, streched textures, missing colors etc.Game's forums on Steam and on Eidos site shows no one in the company - including moderates - care about this game. Steam discussions page shows at least 144 unfixed, missing features/bugs for this game.The only ""enhancement"" in this version is the toned down yellow tint a.k.a.♥♥♥♥♥♥filter, which IMO was too much in some areas of the original game. It's an artistic question. I personally prefer it off just because I have finished the game and found it hiding details in otherwise dated looking game. I also like more vibrant colors in general. They could've just toned it down in the areas where it was too much, not in the whole game. There should've been at least an option to turn it back on if desired.If you like the toned down yellow tint in DC, you are better off with the original as you get far better results by trying out different SweetFX profiles.To people who own the original and TML:Play those instead. You save HDD/SSD space, have the best bug-free experience with less chance to get graphical glitches. Yes, the boss battles were questionable, but you are only missing slightly more open areas in boss battles that were probably done by some trainee in one weekend anyway.To people who don't own the original nor TML:Find a boxed copy on your local store's bargain bin or get an activation code for Steam from a legitimate cd-key market site. Don't worry about TML (The Missing Link). It's like the fourth episode in Duke Nukem 3D. Unnecessary. Just a nice extra. TML only explains ""three days in statis"" and is attached to the main story in DC.There was no need for explanation really. I didn't even notice days were passed at that point of the game. You can get a key for TML online, e.g. Amazon if you really want.			"

												I loved the original Deus Ex: Human Revolution. To this date it's one of the best games I've played, so it's great to be given the chance to play an updated, more complete version of the game.The common complaint about the boss fights being out of place was quite true. The Missing Link's boss encounter was a much better example of how this idea should have been approached. The revisited boss fights are interesting, but not worth the price of admission alone. The true reward is simply playing the game again, Missing Link included, all the way through in this updated format.I wish there were a few new side quests on offer here (outside of the Tong rescue mission - which was great to play for the first time). Especially after hearing about what may have been cut from the game, and as well as the fact that only a single DLC was released. In this regard I'm left a little cold by the so-called Director's Cut - but I can still recommend playing this, the most complete version of one of my favourites. Highly recommended.			"

												Don't read this buy it. It is worth the 75% off.A solid 9.5/10Since 2011 had many popular games (ex: Skyrim), many games went under the radar (such as Deus ex Human revolution, Kingdom of Amalur).I have played Deus ex Human revolution before. I decided to buy the Director's cut for the missing link.The Good:-The story. This story for this game takes a few twists and turns. A lot of unexpected events that happen-Re-play value and diversity: Whether you decide to go stealth or reveal it all, this game is for you. -Skill points: An interesting buffet of skill points. Many skill are very good. Cloak, a skill, allows you to turn invincible for a few seconds making stealth easier. Additionally, there are a lot of hidden Piraxis kits. I recommend using a guide to get them. I think you can fill out 2/3 to 3/4 of the entire skill tree.-Achievements: You can get all the achievements fairly easily. However, I recommend using a guide because many are hidden. None of the Achievements are bugged.-Music: the soundtrack is amazing. I really enjoyed the music.-Voice actor: Elias Toufexis does the voice of Adam Jensen.  He does the voice for Batman. I am Batman!!!!The Bad: A little too much facial hair. Just kidding!-You cannot reset your skill points. Therefore, choose your skill points wisely. Improve your hacking skills in the game. I recommend having a clean save in Adam's apartment where you stockpile skill points. This way you can go backtrack without replaying the entire game.Overall, in my opinion, this game has been very under-rated and is a must have.Can't wait for Deus Ex Mankind Divided.			"

												This game is going to be one where a line between love and hate is pretty defined. You will love this game's story if you have a philosophical type of mind. This game gives you something to think about in regards to the morals and ethics of technological impacts on society. This concept is part of the core of the story. The one drawback regarding this is you'll have to use your imagination to fill in some of the gaps. A lot of information regarding this concept in the Deus Ex world is gotten through emails, ebooks, radio, TV, and random people talking on the streets. The story definitley had potential to be more. There wasn't enough character development for many of the characters in the game. All the antagonists were pretty shallow, even some of the people in the side-quests had more personality than these guys. In terms of gameplay, if the thought of sneaking around gives you joy, then you'll like this game; however, if you're looking for some solid stealth gameplay, this may not be for you.  The enemies are generally easy to sneak by. They patrol back and forth in an area, but they never go beyond the area where you may be hiding. I like being sneaky, so I didn't mind so much, but it could have been better.  Going lethal is fun though, and may even be more challenging than stealth because your character is not immortal like in other modern FPSs. For $20, the game is worth playing, and if you're interested in a dystopian, stealth, FPS, RPG style game, you'll find plenty of replay value.			"

												Incredible single player game, the best one I have played so far. You have to think on what to do and not rush and gun like in COD.  Everything you do in the game has an impact on the game environment, the different ways you can play the game and the story are awesome. The game is well made and will give you a lot of hours of gameplay I am 1/3 of the way and have 24+hours(counting side quests and exploring the world). It also has a huge variety of weapons you just have to look for them, you have to use your ammo count carefully.			"

												While this version includes a few nice features and combines the excellent Missing Link DLC into the main game, it is simply NOT worth it.The pc version of the directors cut is based off of an old build, so all the bugs and issues that plagued the original game on release that were patched out are back. Besides that, the postprocessing that was part of what gave the original game its interesting aesthetics don't work at all (the setting does nothing), so the game looks markedly worse than the original in my opinion. (opinions differ on this, YMMV.)My conclusion: see if you can find the disc based version of the original release and buy the missing link separately (if possible.)			"

												The most immersive action RPG ever just got better. I love all of the improvements of the Director's Cut. I was extremely pleasantly surprised with the new options they have added to beat the boss fights. I also thoroughly enjoyed the Developer Commentary and it provided a lot of insights that I never knew about the game. But the biggest and most noticeable change is actually having two beautiful energy bars that automatically refill to play with. Makes everything so much easier. The ""golden haze"" effect will be missed, however, but the game still looks great, almost remastered even. The cutscenes just now feel a bit out of place compared to the rest of the game.If you haven't finished Deus Ex: Human Revolution yet, get this and do it now. There's no reason not to because you are seriously missing out. Highly recommended.			"

												Human Revolution remains today as two years ago, an interesting game, multi-faceted, multi-faceted. A title that has tried to do, with good success, something different, light years away ""monodimensionality"" that too many products in this generation, have shown. It is a pity that the clear vision of Eidos did not influence other game designers, and we hope that in the future the free and open approach to this Deus Ex can be considered a strong point for many other creative. This Director's Cut comes demonstrating a strong production effort: corrective actions are many, some more successful than others, and certainly all in line with the demands of the fans. We would not say that these ""grafts"" vary appreciably the overall quality of the game experience, and yet fail to update the title so that they feel a bit 'less than two years from the original. "

												Human Revolution is an absolutely MUST HAVE title! I'm pretty sure that I can't put to words everything that I love about this game but I'll do my best, as usual. It's set in the same universe as the first game, and though having played the first one is not required, recognizing some music and character references was a rewarding experience to me.I finished this game three times : first when It came out, then a pacifist playthrough at maximum difficulty, and another just so I could listen to developer commentary.Visually speaking, the game is unique, the art fits, character concepts and environment design sucks you into the game and the famous orange-ish theme only adds to the it's identity, once in a while you have to revisit a map, but the story events change the way it plays, so I can't say the scenarios are repetitive. I also have not found any bugs related to graphics.Gameplay is a mix of first and third person shooting with cover and rpg elements. From stealth takedowns, advancing through enemies cloaked, shooting tranquilizing darts, to hardcore combat with a variety of firearms, explosives and scenarios elements to use at your advantage, the combat in this game couldn't be better, it's as if the game says "" hey, choose one of these, and do it your way! "". It will often give you choices, for example : at the first mission, you could go straight to the objctive, or try to rescue the hostages among the way, an option speaking of wich, has more then one way to be accomplished. It's one of those games where you're given freedom inside a linear level path, and this is called replay value! There is an Augment system, each time you gain a level or buy a praxis kit, you can upgrade something that might have a huge impact on gameplay : reaching higher places you otherwise wouldn't be able to, skipping a set of enemies by going invisible, breaking through walls and moving heavy objects to reveal shortcuts and rewards, it encourages you to play again and again in different ways and once you finish the game, you enter NG+ with all the previous augments you had. The story is well written, I won't spoil anything, the plot makes you want to search for answer at all moments so expect twists, also, there are four distinct endings depending on your choices, and in case you can't get enough of it, hit the wiki for more Deus Ex universe.Sound effects are okay, voice acting is great, Elias Toufexis made Jensen come alive as well as the other actors with other characters.The game can be maxed out on mid-end machines and run smoothly, I'm running at 1080p on 650ti Boost, i5 3570 and 4GB Ram.I'd recommend this game for everyone, in fact... GO BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW.tl:dr+ Replay value+ Well written story & some cool references.+ Option to end the game without killing anyone+ Fluid combat with arsenal and path veriety+ Developer commentary-  Endings could be more dinamic			"

												If someone asked me to describe Deus Ex: Human Revolution in one word, I would use the word...Think.You have to think about an answer to the constant, yet lingering, quetion the game throws at you of whether or not robotic augmentations are politically correct.You have to think about where you're gonna explore and what tools you'll need to be able to explore it, because if you're not careful, you might have some areas of a game closed off.You have to think about how often you should use a weapon, because if you're not careful, you'll probably run out of ammo and end up screwing yourself in a specific situation.Thinking is the main gameplay mechanic of Deus Ex. Sure, you can argue that it doesn't have a specific gameplay mechanic at all, considering it's a mesh of different genres such as being a sandbox, or an rpg, or just a straight-up fps. But, no matter what you're doing, no matter what genre you play this game for, it always requires you to do one thing:Think.Deus-Ex is a FPS with RPG elements that somehow feel balanced and extremely well fleshed out. One moment, you're in a facility, either sneaking around or killing, soldiers and terroists on the look-out for you. The next moment, you're in a city-hub, being enraptured in a world full of dark secrets to find in sewer vents or apartments. It's truly a game that can appeal to anyone!The story of the game is that you play as an Ex-Cop named Adam Jensen, who, after handling a few terroist attacks with his new augmentations, send him on a quest full of conspiracy and political tension as he looks for a close friend of his. I can't say much after that, because then the story would be no fun! :) Let's just say that you're in for a fun ride, and we'll leave it at that. :)Overall, I recommend this game to any gamer of any kind. It's a game that is a perfect blend of a variety of genres that requires you to consider all of your actions, even those outside of dialogue sequences! So, yeah, you may have never asked for this, but trust me: You won't regret it! <3			"

Transhumanism. Is it right or wrong?Deus Ex: Human Revolution is one of those games that are a must for FPS, RPG, and cyberpunk fans. It even brings up Transhumanism, which has been debated for a very long time. I already finished the game with Pacifist and on the Give me Deus Ex difficulty. (I just felt like bragging here :D...keep reading)STORY:In the year 2027, technology has advanced to great lengths and corporations are increasing in greed. You are Adam Jensen, an Ex-SWAT working as security for Sarif Industries. A company that plans to change human evolution for the future. When a special faction raids Sarif Industries, Jensen's whole career changes. As Jensen, you will explore Detroit, Hengsha (in China), and some other locations around the world, discovering new secrets and finding truths. Visuals:While DXHR might look a bit dated, there is still a ton of attention put to detail. Want an example? When you go inside any room, look up. The ceilings are designed with a lot of different abstract patterns. Hengsha is very impressive as the developers were able to take modern day China and put a cyberpunk twist to it. I'd recommend even stopping for a bit and just looking at the statues and architecture of the buildings. ""Future Detroit"" might not look as interesting, but put on some headphones and enjoy the city sounds.Sound:Michael McCann is like a God for ""futuristic-vibe"" music. All the music that plays goes very well with what is happening on screen. While playing, you will also overhear many conversations by civilians and guards. Many sounds in the enviornment will help immerse you into this dark futuristic world such as aircraft passing by and just feeling the wind blow. Voice acting is also well done. Jensen definitely sounds like a character who is eager to find the truth behind everything and the people you engage in conversation with will have realistic diaogue and body movements. Gameplay:This is where the game shines the most. You can choose if you want to go in guns blazing or be sneaky peaky like. More often, you will want to stealth since sadly, there is not much incentive to go loud (besides finding some ammo and credits). Stealth opens up many different ways to finish an objective. You can hack a turret to turn it against your enemies. You can find a vent and just avoid all combat. Hell, you can even finish the game without killing a single person.The Director's Cut also has a mode called ""New Game +"". Once you beat the game, all your augmentations will carry over in your next playthrough. (This makes Hard difficulty rather easy). The only thing about the Hard difficulty is that enemies are more aggressive and have more.Should you buy Deus Ex: Human Revolution?If you want a Cyberpunk FPS game, with a yellow color theme (this is not supposed to be offensive), then you will love this game.This Director's Cut includes the DLC from the original game, improves the games graphics (the yellow filter from the original game is gone though), and includes developer commentary.The game goes on frequent sales for $4-$5, which is an absolute steal for a game like this.Begin augmenting your first person experience by purchasing this game.

Run the ♥♥♥♥ for your life5. After youve found  a considerable safe spot, weep for a few seconds while panicking over the millions of possible ways you might die as you regenerate6. Remember that theres still a fight going on7. Grow a pair and try to confront them all at once like a badass8. Die miserably9. Respawn and stay in your previous safe spot and wait for them to come get the b810. When they fall for the b8 gun them down or use a takedown, repeat steps 1 - 10 (hopefully avoiding step number 8 if you already got the hang of it)11. Keep repeating steps 1 - 10 until you meet up with a boss12. Panic and run the ♥♥♥♥ for your life because you have just entered a boss fight without knowing there was going to be a boss fight and you were probably not even prepared for this and you probably didnt ask for this13. Realize that theres about 100 powerful weapons (or 1,000 regular weapons) with enough ammo conveniently placed there because even if you didt prepare for the boss fight the game lets you prepare for the boss fight in the middle of the boss fight14. Kill the boss and realize that all your panic and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t for this boss fight was unnecessary since the boss fights here are honestly so easy they feel like overly dramatic tutorials on how to run for your life and shoot while doing such15. I forgot to mention that youre probably going to be talking and making desicions based on morale more than you will be shooting or playing in this game.16. Repeat steps 1 - 15 until youre halfway into the game17. Start arguing with politicians, millionares, scientists, and even your own boss and discover that youre litterally fighting the Illuminati (Faze clan apart)18. After youre done arguing over the upcoming genocide continue along with the used-to-be-DLC-but-was-included-in-this-version-of-the-game-at-the-same-price-of-the-original-game-and-now-feels-like-a-fundamental-part-of-the-game-anyways part of the game, as in: The Missing Link19. Youre on the boat without your augs or weapons so you feel helpless at this point.20. Get released, from your ""prison"" and do a process similar to steps 1 - 9, only this time youll initially rely alot on takedowns since you bareley find ammo for the guns you find21. Get your augs and weapons back, and get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off over the fact that you dont get all your praxis points back for all your augs22. Continue with The Missing Link *insert spoilers here*23. Youre probably at the near end of the game after you finish the used-to-be-DLC-but-was-included-in-this-version-of-the-game-at-the-same-price-of-the-original-game-and-now-feels-like-a-fundamental-part-of-the-game-anyways part of the game so, Congratulations!24. Final boss fights and end-game parts, just stick to your thing, but only this time theres a whole lot of nightmare fuel in this, the more you progress, the more things youll need to change since you probably♥♥♥♥♥♥them because of the nightmare fuel25. Finish the game, no matter what choice you make at the end your mind, your way of seeing things, especially humanitys relations with Technology in the future, are all ♥♥♥♥ed, really, really, hard... (edit: you also become a sort of a technophobe for at least 30 minutes because of this)26. Stare at your computer screen while saying ""What the ♥♥♥♥ just happened..."" or ""What the ♥♥♥♥ did I just do..."" for as long as the credits last*I have absoluteley no idea if this should be considered a spoiler or not but what the hell, you decided to read this anyways which is pretty impressive if youve made it this far considering all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in this, especially since im writing this in the middle of the night*27. Watch the ""surprise ending"" at the end of the credits and yell out ""I WANT A SEQUEL, I NEED A SEQUEL, IF THERES NO SEQUEL I WILL DIE"" for about an hour or so and get mind♥♥♥♥ed over how this just might connect with the original Deus Ex, just about as mind♥♥♥♥ed as one can get with Bioshock Infinites ending and its relations with the original Bioshock, but thats a whole 'nother story or as mind♥♥♥♥ing as on how the worlds of Portal and Half-Life are supposedly the same.28. Never sleep again.Or thats just my personal experienceHonestly this games end is scarier than all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t FNAF games combined10/10 would get mind♥♥♥♥ed, get scared to death, and augumented again even though I never asked for this.

												The original Deus Ex is widely considered to be an iconic game – its scope, ideas, vision... it was ahead of its time, and gaming conventions first seen in the first game have reverberated within the game industry ever since. Seems like a tough act to follow, but Human Revolution has not only managed to be a game that's worthy of the name, but a worthy game. Period.Human Revolution opens with the protagonist, Adam Jensen, being brutally attacked and downright nearly killed as mercenaries invade the headquarters of his employer, Sarif Industries. In Robocop fashion, Jensen is rebuilt and augmented with the latest in biomechanical technology. Jensen doesn't get long to rest though, because six months later, another attack is made on Sarif and he is sent in to handle things. In true series fashion, what starts out as a local terrorist attack spirals wildly into a global adventure as Jensen uncovers the pieces of a global-scale conspiracy to influence the future of humanity. As you would expect, choice is the name of the game. From basic things like whether to do a particular side-quest or not, to conversation options, to what augmentations you want. There's plenty of flexibility when it comes to your choices. Choice even permeates elements like what weapons to take with you, as even with an expanded inventory you can only carry so many weapons at a time and so much ammo. My favorite setup was a pistol and assault rifle combo, customized with silencers so I could maintain stealth, but there's a wide variety of weapons from rocket launchers, to laser guns, crossbows to stun guns, along with various grenade and mines. The pace of combat frequently shifts, and patience is not just a virtue, but is completely a must. Unless you want to try and blaze your way through a level, waiting, watching, and attacking from behind is the order of the day. In the beginning stun weapons are useful for a stealthy take down. There are some sections that force you to go all gun-ho, but usually you can suss these out ahead of time, and prepare accordingly. Sometimes you may not have the right skill-set or augmentation to get by unnoticed, so you will have to fight your way through. The environments are huge, detailed, and full of secrets. The developers sought to ""tell a story"" with the environmental details, and they have succeeded. Looking around in an apartment can tell you an entire story of its occupant without ever hearing a single line of dialogue, and in today's ""in-your-face-obvious"" world of game storytelling, I can't commend Eidos Montreal enough for this. The audio fares equally well, combining a stellar sci-fi score with immersive environmental ambience and sound effects that truly draw you into the world. Combined with the huge amount of detail in the graphics, you have a game that truly creates a place for you to get lost in. The voice acting is solid, though the Asian accents are goofy and borderline offensive at times. Adam Jensen is expertly cast, offering a gritty performance that is equal parts JC Denton and Chris Nolan's Batman. Where the actor truly succeeds, however, is in showcasing that Adam isn't a one-note wonder. He does sarcasm, humor, and compassion equally well, which is something I was worried about before I played the game in its entirety. Playing through Human Revolution, it was hard to find anything truly wrong with it. In terms of technical polish, it was one of the most polished release-builds I'd seen in a while, with few-to-no glaring technical hiccups. The only time where I felt genuine disappointment was in the last area of the game. I won't go into specifics, but unless you've been one of those people who've been trying to blast their way through the game, this last section can be very jarring. Almost uncomfortable. Still, the actual 'ending' ending, apart from a strange boss fight, does really hit home what the game is all about. Personally I felt the ending could have been a bit better and more conclusive in some respects, but the game does set things up so that the choice you have to make at the end really makes you stop and think. Coming from a background of having not played the original Deus Ex (don't hurt me!), I can't comment from a fans perspective. Make no mistake though, franchise fan or not, this is a good game – challenging, addictive, immersive...provided you like stealth-based action – there hasn't been an action/RPG this good in a while. Highly Recommended "

												Priceless.Actually, this game is often had for under $5 at this point. Which brings me to my next thing: if you dont own this game, you are probably doing something wrong with your life.Seriously, in my opinion, this is a top ten all time great game. It has everything....great gameplay, great story, and even now, great graphics. Additionally, the Directors Cut did a great job of optimizing everything, making the graphics look even better, seamlessly integrating the DLC into the campaign, and generally making what was already a great game a definite all timer.One of the main issues I had with the original version was that, although you are encouraged to craft your Adam Jensen in whatever way suits your gameplay preferences best, when it came to the boss battles, you could easily be completely dominated over and over because they forced you into stand up fights, which dont work well when you are playing a completely stealth build. Even with the OP Typhoons, it was still pretty cheap. What the Directors Cut did is create new areas and program the boss battles a little bit differently so that, should you choose stealth and planning over might and brawn, you could still come out on top. I really appreciated this change above and beyond all the other tweaks and adjustments. It also, by virtue of this fact, increased its replay value by quite a bit.Anyway, I will just leave it here: I have played this game on all platforms, and it has been and always will be one of my favorites. With the new Deus Ex slated for release in the not too distant future (no pun intended), you owe it to yourself to try this one out if you havent already.			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is probably my favorite game. I am a type of person who's not into stealth genre. I guess it's because I don't really wanna go through all the crap of finding a way to clear a stage without being seen lol. But this game, this made me love this genre. It made me enjoy the whole gameplay. I didn't realize how fun it is to keep on repeating the same mission, trying to find an alternate route, hiding, and sneaking. I actually felt proud of myself when I got the Ghost achievement wherein nobody saw me while I'm doing one of the missions here. Lol.No boring part on this game. From the main quest up to the side quests, everything is worth doing. I can say that I enjoyed every bit of this game. I didn't know that I can be so patient when it comes to gaming. I remember when I was playing this game a few weeks ago (prolly 20hrs of game time already) I really thought that I'm so close to finishing the game, only to find out that there's a whole lot more to the story. 3x that I felt that I'm so close, but everytime, Deus Ex is giving me another quest after another after another. But don't get me wrong, I really love doing those quests :) So to those who's planning to play this, I assure you, it's worth your money :) "

												Absolutely fantastic. The plot of this game is extraordinary. As a writer, I found myself thoroughly enthralled at the building conspiracy within this game. The Director's Cut offers a much better experience than the original release, which I have on console. The combat is fluid and extremely versatile. There are always alternatives to every given situation. If the player wants, he/she can pilot Adam Jensen through the whole game without killing, or even incapaciting, a single person (excluding the three boss fights).   I highly reccommend buying this game, and lose yourself in the rich storytelling that Square Enix delivers in Deus Ex: Human Revolution.And remember...""Everybody Lies.""			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is an excellent addition to the gaming community that shakes up the traditional genres of gameplay. Deus Ex is essentially an role-playing game (RPG) that utilizes the first-person unless in cover in which the third-person perspective is used for looking over corners. When it comes to combat, it's mostly a cover-based shooter, but those that aren't gunrunners, Deus Ex offers alternatives such as stealth, hacking and social workarounds. While not as diverse as some other open world RPGs, Deus Ex still gives you a satisfying sense of a large environment with multiple avenues of completion and, above all, an engrossing story. The Director's Cut features all the bonus content and revamped mechanics like textures and boss fights.			"

												I have to say i'm late to the world of Deus Ex.  It's been around for quite some time but i never really had a chance to play and fully experience it until recently.  It blew my augmentations off!  Just WOW!  I loved the gameplay, the look, the story.  I went the route of stealth and hacking and felt right at home.  I love stealth and this game did not disappoint. If you haven't played it yet please do so and enjoy yourself oh and don't leave your augmentations behind because you will need them for this game. 10/10.			"

												Being a cyberpunk nerd, I liked Deus Ex: Human Revolution so much that I was happy to spend money on the Director's Cut to get all the DLC for my second playthrough. Wow, was I disappointed. :(Although the first patch is out the game is still worse than the original. The main thread for complaints in the forum on Steam has listed 151 bugs, of which Eidos currently has fixed 15.If you feel like spending money to feel like a beta tester and ruin a game you like, go ahead.

												What a thrilling experience this has been! Amazing game at all levels. I haven't played many RPG's before mainly because some of them tend to get boring over time or you get stuck very often. DEHR makes it very easy for you. Doesn't matter how you play, using stealth or direct combat, you can always get through. Same goes for passage ways, there are always atleast 2 different routes you can take, so you don't get stuck or read a WT or anything. Whatever choice you make, will have consequences and will definitely affect the story and the ending. A great game overall. Definitely recommended.			"

English Version: Starting from presupposition that I'm a fan of the Metal Gear Solid's saga since the first chapter, I have found that this chapter's gameplay, above all if it's played in a stealthy way, is as deep as the older games like MGS that I played years ago making so my game experience even more exciting.The plot is intriguing and quite twisted, It pushes the player to complete It, intriguing him even in doing side quests in order to understand better the game's world and the issues addressed such as, for example, transhumanism and the ethical and moral implications of progress scientific.The story is about a man, Adam Jensen, who found himself involved in a terrorist attack facing the Sarif Industries for which he works as a security guard. He is mortally wounded and converted later into an enhanced cyborg.There's a high graphic detail, which allowed me to admire some beautiful landscapes. Among them one in particular is still in my memories. The secondary characters are poorly characterized, and this is a shame, but the choice that is given to us to respond to the various dialogues on the basis of what we want allows us to give some peculiar personality to the protagonist.Furthermore, the possibility to choose the skills of the protagonist based on the type of game you want to play (ranging from the action to stealth) is quite guessed, so we can complete the game several times in different ways, although not influencing the ending, unfortunately.The only flaw? The difficulty! Do not get me wrong, it is quite high in the general gameplay, especially if played in stealth mode, but I personally found the boss a bit too easy to overcome!I loved to play this game from the beginning, so I recommend it to everyone.Italian Version:  Partendo dal presupposto che sono una fan sfegatata della saga di Metal Gear Solid fin dal primo capitolo, ritrovare un gameplay che se giocato in maniera stealth sia profondo quanto quello evocatomi anni fa da MGS ha reso la mia esperienza di gioco più emozionante.La trama è intrigante e parecchio intrecciata, cosa che spinge il giocatore sia a completarlo sia ad incuriosirsi anche nel compiere sidequest per capire al meglio il mondo di gioco e le tematiche trattate quali, ad esempio, il transumanesimo e le implicazioni etico-morali del progresso scientifico.Racconta di un uomo, Adam Jensen, che ritrovatosi coinvolto in un attacco terroristico rivolto verso le industrie per cui lavora come addetto alla sicurezza, le Sarif Industries, viene ferito mortalmente e trasformato, successivamente, in un cyborg potenziato.Il dettaglio grafico è elevato, il che mi ha regalato alcune splendide panoramiche da ammirare, delle quali ne ho conservato una in particolare. I personaggi secondari sono poco caratterizzati, e questo è un peccato, ma la scelta che ci vien data di rispondere ai vari dialoghi in base a ciò che vogliamo ci permette di dare una personalità nostra, al protagonista.Inoltre la possibilità di scegliere le abilità del protagonista in base al tipo di gioco che vuoi effettuare (dall'action allo stealth) è parecchio azzeccata, così da poter completar il gioco più volte in modo diverso, nonostante non influisca nel finale, purtroppo.Unica pecca? La difficoltà! Non fraintendetemi, è abbastanza elevata nel gameplay generale, specie se giocato in modo stealth, ma ho trovato personalmente i boss un po' troppo facili da superare!Ho adorato giocarci fin dal primo momento, per cui lo consiglio a tutti.

Story, world and atmosphere of the gameIn Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut (hereafter: 'Deus Ex: HR' for short) you're Adam Jensen, the chief of security for a company that deals in technological augmentations for the human body. The company gets raided by a group of people who are opposed to augmentations and its consequences. You see, society is divided between people who are for augmentations and people who are against them. This leads to tension, protests and full-fledged riots. After the attack on your company, you're heavily wounded and the only way to save your life is to turn you into an augment. After that, you're dispatched to investigate the attack, to find out who's behind it and to stop them from repeating their destructive actions against the company.The game puts you in a futuristic world that's utopian and dystopian at the same time. Technologically it's a very advanced society. But socially, it's in shambles. The developers of Deus Ex: HR managed to create a world where you feel both at home (you're not on a different planet or in a magical fantasy setting) and out of place. The technological advancements you see are impressive enough, compared to the time we live in. It's not just the main idea for the game i.e. the technological enhancement of the human body. The futuristic atmosphere is also created by means of small details like computer screens have no visible edge and they project an image that can be seen from either side of the screen. It all feels 'near future', making it a believable setting. I have to point out that for me personally, the first part of the game that's set in the city of Detroit, felt a bit generic and started to bore me after a while. I even considered quitting the game to play something that's more fun. I'm glad I stuck with it though, because from the last part of Detroit until the end credits rolled, I had tons of fun with Deus Ex: HR. I'm not sure why I got so bored with Detroit. The city feels large but a bit empty. The decor is repetitive: a dozen garbage cans and news stands in every street, a bunch of 'civilians', 'punks' and 'police officers' you can't really interact with, and a lot of buildings of which you can enter only a few. Maybe I still needed to get into the game or maybe it was because Jensen doesn't have a lot of augments (skills) yet at that point. But whatever the reason was, the game got a lot better after Detroit so you may want to know this, in case you feel the same during the first part of the game.GameplayDeus Ex: HR is a first-person stealth action game. But you can play it as a first-person shooter, too, if you decide to take the more aggressive and harder route.Don't get me wrong. Gun combat in this game is certainly enjoyable. There are different types of guns (pistol, revolver, stun gun, assault rifle, sniper rifle, laser rifle, rocket launchers, ...) and there are a few skills to enhance your shooting skills and your defense against opponents. Also, you can systematically upgrade your weapons to really give you an edge. However, in the first part of the game you won't be equipped to survive more than 3 seconds of actual combat, so you'll automatically turn to sneaking and sneak kills, at least partially. The whole sneaking system, which is pretty much the essence of Deus Ex: HR's gameplay, is exciting and fun, although it can get a bit repetitive. You watch the opponents' patrol routes, pick out one of them, sneak behind him and then push a button on your keyboard/controller to eliminate him silently. You then drag the body out of sight of any remaining patrols or security cameras, move on to the next group of opponents and repeat. Besides sneaking and/or shooting your way through the game, you'll spend a lot of time hacking computers and electronic locks. I think it's too bad the hacking minigame is based on pure luck. You can increase your luck by investing skill points but it always remains a minigame based on luck. There are some consumable items that can make hacking easier, but you'll want to save those for the really difficult hacks. So long story short: you'll be reloading a lot. I would have preferred a minigame that relied on logical thinking or on dexterity to one of pure luck, especially since you'll be playing the hacking minigame a couple of hundred of times. People tag this game 'RPG'. I do not completely disagree with that but it wouldn't be one of -say- five tags I'd put on this game. Yes, you gain experience points for doing stuff but your character doesn't gain levels per se. Every time you accumulate a certain amount of XP you just get a point to spend in a skill tree but you'll get plenty of skill points and it's abundantly clear which skills are good and which aren't, so everyone will end up playing the same character. There is only one personality skill and it's completely superfluous. You're offered some dialogue options during the sporadic conversations in the game, but mostly the result is exactly the same and storywise your choices make no difference at all, nor do they impact what the game world looks like. During the conversations with side quest givers, you can even go through all the conversation options e.g. be a complete prick and ask for a reward from your dead ex-girlfriends' mom for looking into her death, and it changes nothing about the quest,  its reward or the quest giver's attitude towards you. I guess it depends on your definition of 'roleplaying game' but in my book, Deus Ex: HR is a game that may have some vague RPG elements but where 97% is about action and/or stealth. From what I hear it's comparable to Mass Effect 2 & 3 in this regard. If you consider those two games an RPG, then you'll feel that Deus Ex: HR is an RPG, too.Graphics and soundThe graphics are quite nice. The characters' faces look decent and the animations are lively. After a while though, the techniques that are used to achieve this (like the nodding of the head when any person is talking) become very obvious and the initial feeling of being impressed starts to fade a little. Surroundings and objects are detailed, except for objects in the far distant background (e.g. the city's skyline when you look out of a window) which are low resolution images and look just ugly and out of place. Other reviewers mention this was not the case in the original version of the game, making this even stranger. The voice acting is top notch. My only gripe here is that most of the voices have a slight echo, making it sound like people are always standing in a large room with bad acoustics, even when they're outdoors or in a small room. This is a strange production decision that diminishes the excellent performance of the voice actors a bit, which is a shame. It also ruins immersion because often the voices literally sound out of place.The music is nice, atmospheric and not intrusive. Sound effects are sharp and clean.On Steam's extra featuresDeus Ex: HR has 9 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 5 while running the game.The Steam Achievements are varied and challenging. You have the usual unmissable, story-bound achievements. There is also one achievement for each side quest. There are a few interesting optional achievements like 'fully upgrade a weapon' or 'silently take down 100 opponents'. There is one 'collection' achievement for which you need to find a few dozens of items across the game world. And then there are the real challenges like 'play the whole game on hard mode', 'finish the game without killing anyone', 'finish the game without triggering one single alarm', and so on.			"

 If you passed on this one you cheated yourself. I'll keep this pretty brief because others here have already described Deus Ex: Human Revolution a lot better than I can....This is the best game I've played last year. it's perfect (no game is 'perfect') but because it represents the ceiling in modern gaming -- this is what other video games should aspire to be in 2011. Human Revolution allows and encourages player experimentation and freedom. There is no 'right' way to play it, be it good, evil, stealthy, talky, actiony, or any combination thereof. The level design is freeform and there is always more than one route to your objectives. The dialogue writing is solid, and the plot is compelling. The augmentation system is fantastic, and if you choose intelligently you can make Adam Jensen whatever kind of superhuman you want him to be. Minor quibbles include some spotty voice acting and stiff animations, but neither detracts from the fact that this a strong game of the year contender. I recommend this to just about anyone who likes video games. There's something in it for everybody.			"

I'm only getting max power on one of my cards and performance isn't as good as non-Director's Cut.  Apparantly alot of textures and other effects are different as well. If you're interested in this game, get the non Director's Cut version, it will run alot smoother.UPDATE 10/09/2014:  SLI profiles have been added as well as a Geforce Experience profile for nvidia users.

												A downgrade, basically.While the new boss options are nice everything else about the Director's Cut is worse than the original. The biggest issue is in looks, where the gold filter has been massively toned down. Even if you disliked the gold however this change disrupts a lot of textures, effects and backgrounds and makes the game look odd in several sections. Also since the game was originally designed around the gold you're suddenly navigating endless grey hallways without much unique about them, which is disappointing. There are also scattered texture glitches, and on my PC the loading stutters are back, though they were originally fixed. In short it looks and performs worse.The DLC being integrated is poorly handled. The silenced sniper rifle is available almost immediately and is way too powerful for the game. The automated unlocking mechanisms are plentiful enough to make investing in the hacking tree much less important than it originally was. The Missing Link add-on mission still resets your augmentations, then the game clumsily gives them back to you at the end along with what you just earned again, making you way overexperienced heading toward the finale. Game design and balance is a tough thing. Throwing in weird overpowered items can throw off this carefully made balance, and changing art styles via a simple processing change can't negate years of work designing the game around a different style. The Director's Cut changes the game in ways detrimental to the intended experience, and even the added boss options feel pasted on to a different skeleton. The best way to play Human Revolution is the original version, and to play the Missing Link add-on separately, as was intended. This version is an added expense for a lesser version.			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is the prequel to my favorite game ever made: Deus Ex. Since I had already put the precursor to this title on a pedestal and was hyped to all hell, how does this game fare in comparison?Not bad, actually.Because this game is a prequel, it is totally fine to jump in and start playing it even without playing the previous games, although I caught many references and call backs to Deus Ex throughout. In fact, I’d probably recommend most players today to start with this game, as Deus Ex hasn’t really aged all that well in terms of graphics/ mechanics.Deus Ex was a Cyberpunk dystopian FPS/RPG hybrid that was full of deep choices and free-form gameplay. The storyline dealt with world spanning conspiracies and epic world ending narratives, but Deus Ex: Human Revolution takes a smaller, more focused approach, mainly dealing with the basic morality question of human augmentation, corporate espionage, and how technology positively and/or negatively impacts the “natural” human experience. This smaller approach was somewhat disappointing at first as it’s not nearly as “epic” as the first game, but it still told an interesting story, full of little peeks at the larger conspiracies overall. The main character has the  pretty cliché motivation of revenge and delves into a complex web of intrigue that’ll keep you guessing until the very end. The ending is somewhat lackluster, but the upcoming sequel Mankind Divided promises more nuanced endings that depend on factors through the game. All in all, the many different character’s motivations and the many moral choices you make in the game paint a convincing near future cyberpunk world that is easy to get immersed in.This game isn’t the prettiest, being initially released in 2011, but even back then it didn’t look so great. 2011 was the year Skyrim, Dead Space 2, L.A. Noire, Battlefield 3, and Arkham City were released. Deus Ex: Human Revolution already looked dated back then compare to these titles. However, the game remedies this with clear art direction. Most locations are flush with a calming and surreal old yellowed parchment art style that bathes the world in amber-yellow hues. The effect was designed to give the world a Renaissance style, with people learning so much about the human body and augmentation that extreme advancements were occurring rapidly, without the necessary societal changes to keep up. There is also plenty of Icarus/ Daedalus parallels as well, with humanity flying too close to the sun and getting burned as a result. Animations are mostly decent, but facial animations are pretty wooden and everyone looks somewhat like plastic. However, this game’s strikingly distinct art style more than makes up for the lackluster animations and textures and is one of the more memorable parts of the game.The great part of this game’s design is it’s free-form approach to quests. You can complete the game without killing a single character (except the boss fights), and in some situations you can talk your way into areas that would normally be considered trespassing. For example, a quest near the beginning of the game requires you to retrieve something from a police station, which is off limits to civilians. However, you can either talk your way in (using CASIE augmentations if necessary), stealth your way in through a back alley, or kick in the front door and start shooting people in the face. Anytime a game allows me multiple approaches makes me feel like I’m actually using my own wits and not just blindly following a waypoint, although there are some quests that boil down to just that, unfortunately. Nevertheless, this level of freedom does a good job of reminding me why Deus Ex 1 was so good, as there were multiple approaches in that game as well. Going in guns blazing is viable, although the shooting mechanics feel a bit clunky compared to other FPSes.This is also an RPG in addition to being an FPS, and there are different augmentations(skills) to put Praxis Points (Level ups) into. For example, if you’re making a loud, guns blazing character, you may want to invest in recoil management, Dermal Armor, and the Typhoon Explosive System, essentially an AOE attack that blows everything up in a 360 angle around you. However, if you’re a sneaky beaky kind of guy you may want to upgrade your ability to see enemy’s cones of vision on your minimap, as well as cloaking yourself. If you want to explore all the nooks and crannies the game has to offer you may want to upgrade your legs to jump super high and land from great heights without taking fall damage. There are many different things to level up, although I wished there were a bit more. It looks like Mankind Divided will have many more skills to try out, which I’m very excited for. One thing I felt was pretty OP was the cloaking in this game. Enemies can still hear you running around, but as long as you have plenty of cyberboost proenergy candy bars, you can make your way through most levels just by constantly gorging yourself on candy bars with cloak activated and running through the levels, awkwardly sidestepping enemies like Harry Potter with his invisibility cloak. Hopefully in Mankind Divided they nerf this, or at least make special enemies who can see through cloak or something.Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a great Cyberpunk FPS/RPG that everyone who has an interest in the genre should play. It’s a prequel to one of the best games ever made in my opinion, and while it doesn’t quite live up to the first game, is still a fantastic experience in its own right. This game often goes on sale for $5, and at that price, it’s a no brainer considering you’ll get 20-25 hours of solid entertainment out of the experience. I’m very excited for Mankind Divided.			"

												Seeing this game on sale for 5€. Price-quality ratio through the roof! Just buy it! The only ""big"" problem with the directors cut version is the integrated DLC. While it's a well made and lengthy expansion that tries to innovate, it feels like it's measnt to be played after the main story and the way it's just tacked in there will cause a substantial difficulty-spike first time through. That said, you can't get much more polished and enjoyable AAA stealth gameplay this cheap.			"

I never asked for this, but I’m keeping itDeus Ex: Human Revolution brought the cult-classic original back into mainstream in 2011, but did it’s changes bring a classic back into it’s heyday?Pros:Great Level Design that incentivizes players to take all sorts of unique routes and playstyles into consideration.An interesting and lively universe with tons of lore scattered across mapsThe game tackles it’s political themes with enough subtlely to keep it engaging and intriguingThe game’s plot is interesting with it’s unique, engaging topics and stellar voice acting.The shooting, RPG mechanics, and stealth, while not all consistent in quality are far more consistent and more polished than the original.The soundtrack helps invoke a dynamic and interesting sci-fi atmosphere. It’s not memorable but it really elevates the game’s quality.Nitpicks:The writing in the game sticks out like a sore thumb. Not terrible but definitely too cheesy and cliche at times.The ending for the game was ungratifying, to say the least. That’s not to say it wasn’t interesting, however.The dialogue isn't as well-written as you'd hope for, but it's still fine.Cons:The Director’s Cut for the game is a horrible mess and excuse of a re-release. Somehow the game is even more buggy and less optimized due to the game using a different build from the one actually used for the game’s original launch, and the game’s presentation looks worse than the original (Somehow?!?!). It also poorly mixes the game’s expansion The Missing Link and the final hours of the game suffer from it.The game’s quality takes a huge dive near the end, where the last level becomes a tedious, boring and not rewarding conclusion to the overall game.The bosses in the game suck.The ReviewDeus Ex: Human Revolution revitalized the long-gone semi-linear first-person action shooter RPG genre that was widely popular in the early 2000s. In its attempt to bring the cult-classic back it’s made a seemingly cohesive blend of old elements (grid-like inventory system, emphasis on stealth) with new mechanics (aiming down ironsights, emphasis on melee takedowns). Coupled with it’s non-linear level design and it’s huge skill tree of augmentations, it allows so many diverse playstyles to enjoy the game as they see fit.The one thing that sets me back when it comes to the original Deus Ex is that by today’s standards, it feels like a terrible mash of genres where none of the RPG Mechanics, Shooting, or Stealth was actually good but just “good enough.” With a more solid structure, Human Revolution’s Stealth is significantly enjoyable, it’s shooting is stiff but solid overall, and the RPG mechanics are incredibly sharp and do their job well. Design-wise, it took everything about the original in consideration and did it all again with a much more polished execution. It’s not perfect, but it sure as hell pulls off of the ambition of the original and improved it just enough to make it an incredibly addictive and enthralling set of intricately designed game mechanics.Unfortunately, this does not carry on in the game’s boss encounters, which play out as a simple shooting gallery with simplistic strategies and no way to non-lethally defeat them. They’re not only boring and easy, but they flat out go against the open-ended approach the rest of the game takes towards encounters. This is further worsened by the game’s last segment, which just felt like a long shooting gallery that felt like they had to throw out their design philosophies to get the game done at the last second. One of the most striking elements of the Deus Ex games is the universe itself. Through its political themes, diverse landscapes and strikingly relevant messages, Deus Ex connects itself as a possible “What if” scenario for our world today. Although it often shoves it’s themes right up your face too often, it does add enough subtlety and nuance to make it a intelligent and entertaining take on the future.However, Deus Ex: Human Revolution’s writing often ruins this potential with it’s cheesy, often laughably cringey dialogue. Out of all of the major components of the game, the writing itself is the one aspect of the game that seemed as if it didn’t get the touch of intelligence and ingenuity as the rest of the game. However, that definitely doesn’t mean the story isn’t entertaining as hell though. Coupled with a great soundtrack and it’s visually unique art-style, Deus Ex: Human Revolution oozes atmosphere.Now, you have all of the components of what is basically a really well-crafted experience. However, there’s one major issue I have with the overall package.The Director’s Cut. The re-release for this game is mind-bogglingly mismanaged, with it’s poor attempt of integrating the game’s DLC “Missing Link” into the main story and running a buggier, less optimized build of the game. The game’s color palette somehow looks terrible in this version as well. While it’s not a huge deal-breaker, if you already own the original on your account, play that instead of this version.But if that’s not a big deal-breaker, then what are you standing around for? Play this game. You won’t regret it.TL;DR - [Despite it’s shortcomings, Deus Ex: Human Revolution revitalizes and does justice on a cult classic.] Cautiously Recommend if you already own the game, Recommend for everyone else!For more reviews on all sorts of games, follow  Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews  here!

												As a fan of the old Deus Ex, it had been a long wait since the early 2000's for a worthy addition to the franchise. Set 25 years before the original, Human Revolution is a very convincing take on the FPS/infiltration/adventure genre with yet another compelling story whose ramifications deepen as you progress through the game. The numerous characters are supported by a very solid voice acting cast, and the quality of the writing helps create a strong feeling of immersion.The game gives you a degree of freedom in how you handle situations, but in spite of providing you with a vast array of weapons, it greatly rewards stealth and non-lethal takedowns. You are also given multiple choices in how you approach interactions with other characters, and can sometimes persuade them to help you a little more than they were prepared to. As the plot thickens, so does the level design: between the first mission and the later stages of the game, the areas you have to work your way through become more and more complex, and stealth becomes more and more of a challenge.Luckily, progress through the game allows you to upgrade your character's abilities with a simple-yet-rewarding XP system. Will you invest points into your hacking abilities? Enhance your social skills with a body language analyzer? Upgrade your dermal armor in anticipation of unavoidable combat situations? The choice is yours! This system succeeds in giving you more options without ever turning you into an overpowered killing machine. On the highest difficulty setting, combat will always be hazardous as you can die very quickly: all the more reason to go for a stealth-based approach.The Director's Cut version is supposed to offer revamped boss fights (the original ones were an abomination). A commendable effort that is supposed to give you more options, but shooting them in the face remains the most viable one. A more convincing selling point is the integration of the game's only DLC campaign (The Missing Link) into the adventure. Good DLC, bratán - intriguing story elements, good characters and some well-designed new areas to infiltrate will provide for a very welcome extra few hours of gameplay.The Missing Link almost makes the final two areas of the game a bit bland in comparaison. The penultimate one feels a lot simpler than what you've just been through, while the last one is simply disappointing - necessary from the story's viewpoint, but entirely forgettable when it comes to gameplay. Nonetheless, Director's Cut is a solid excuse to give this modern classic another go and, why not, get back into the Deus Ex universe in anticipation of Mankind Divided's release.			"

												Dues Ex: Human Revolution is an amazing game with moral choices and decisions that change how your game is played out. The Stealthing Mechanics are top notch and each new area presents a new challenge for the ninja or the head on attacker. But remember that you are not a tank like in other FPS games. Remember to use your Praxis wisely as it can be the difference between success and failure.			"

												Just some remarks for the DE:HR director's cut edition. First, the integration of missing link into the main game is very smooth which makes it a better game as a whole. And some game mechanics are re-worked for example energy cell and enemy AI. Right now Enemy will notice you more easily and Jensen can regenerate two energy cells except the highest difficulty level.  The overhauled boss fights will allow more tactical approaches. The new level designs for those boss battles are quite interesting although I felt it's still easier to blaze your guns through. Overall this game is a very good if not the best action/role-playing games in recent years. Stealth/action/RPG lovers should try the game and the older players should get this upgrade too.			"

												It shows I didn't play that game, because I had played before Director's Cut.I'm a fan of original Deus Ex game. I was very curious how this new one will be, but on the other hand, I was afraid that this may damage legend of this classic title. To be honest I didn't believe that new version may be as good as original. And I was wrong! It is such good! It's great game in every aspect, well designed, polished, almost perfect. This is a pleasure to may play such game.VERDICT:If you are a fan of original Deus Ex, you probably played it. If not, what are you waiting for?!If you don't know original Deus Ex, doesn't matter. If only you like RPG shooters or stealth games you will enjoy it, I guarantee.Like this review?

												A profound, mature game based in the not-too-distant future where your actions and choices have consequences.I couldn't be happier with how this game turned out. It remains very faithful to the original game in all of the areas that mattered. Best of all, it has completely overhauled the series' weak spots into some of its strongest features. The cover system makes stealth through the levels possible and even rather fun. The melee takedown system is nicely balanced and clears up the stragglers a satisfying, conclusive manner.I've never liked the idea of robots or futuristic games, but this one gets it right. It grounds itself in reality by predicting where new and up-coming technologies will be in 15 years' time. It's evident that the developers have put a lot of thought into making this a grim but believable world. I get all smug every time I hear about augmentations on the news and how we're one step closer to the depressing orange world of Deus Ex. In a way, I want it to happen!Deus Ex's main strangth has always been the choices it presents to you and how it faithfully follows your decisions to the end. You can kill as many or as few people as you like and the game will continue to carry on as if what you did was how it was meant to have been done. Brilliantly, failing an objective won't result in a 'game over' screen but will instead fill you with so much guilt that you'll be tempted to lose several hours' worth of gaming to try and do it right. For example- a couple might be executed by terrorists and you'll think nothing of it. The second time you play through the game, you may be able to save both and they're so thankful they invite you back to their apartment for tea and biscuits. The third time, one might die and you have to give the news to the other one, which is more heart-breaking than it should be.There are still lots of pointless areas for you to explore should you want to. The levels themselves aren't as large as in the original game, but are still large enough to give you a decent amount of freedom. Occasionally the environment feels 'levelly' but for the most-part it feels like you have the freedom to do as you please. You can develop your character as the game progresses in basic but meaningful ways and it adds even more replayability to an already exciting game. Oh, and the music is brilliant and very memorable. I particularly like how you can hear songs from the original game on in-game radios.The game itself is a little rough around the edges and I fear that it may age worse than other games, but for now it's the king of the Deus Ex genre. Now that the boss fights have the same degree of freedom as the rest of the game there is absolutely no reason not to give this game a go if you haven't already. I believe that this game has rebooted the series in the same way as Doctor Who has done in recent years and I'm willing to accept sacrifices and changes to the game if it means that today's generation can feel how I did when I played the original all those years ago. That being said, to say that this game is merely a shadow of the original would be an injustice. It's a step in a new and exciting direction and I can't wait to see what they do with the franchise next.			"

												Not many developers can pride themselves in making a modern sequel to an all-time classic and not screwing it up completely. Even less can put out a game that lives up to the huge hype that surrounded it, and boy, what hype it was (remember the fetus teaser? concept art in The Nameless Mod?).These guys did the impossible, the game is almost on par with the original in my opinion.Eidos Montreal nailed it perfectly, surely not without some shortcomings that usually come with console ports (simplified UI, resource limitations) and time constraints (rushed ending, outsourced bosses). Its strongest point is how it feels like a genuine love letter to the best game ever created, they knew exactly which elements were the most important to implement into the new game and how to do it with a modern touch (the good kind), hell, they even got the (bad) voice acting right in some places! To the point that the locations are almost beat by beat based on archetypes of the ones from the original game, which some could see as a detriment, I didn't mind it that much, because there was enough new ""cyber-renaissance flavor"" to mask it. Unfortunately there were also some places cut, like India or Upper Hengsha.What has buggered me the most about the story though, is that it didn't match the level of worldbuilding the first one had, focus was shifted hard onto transhumanism, often felt like everything was revolving around it most of the time, forgetting about the usual people stuff and foreign affairs, the in-game books didn't flesh out these topics as good as the books (and even some conversations with NPCs) did in the original. More locations would have probably remedied that, but they were cut. What a shame.Of course it didn't lack ideas of its own, like the brilliant ""social boss fights"", the hacking minigame or amazing interior design of the offices, labs and various other places, as well as the atmosphere of city hubs, accompanied by a great ambient soundtrack. I also quite enjoyed the focus on media in one of the chapters, a nice little springboard from the constant augmentation debate, there just wasn't enough conspiracy stuff for my taste. I loved the Alex Jones-like radio DJ.Overall, it's the best Deus Ex sequel we could (not) have asked for, and it's really the best sequel that I have ever played.As for the Director's Cut edition: I didn't mind the♥♥♥♥♥♥filter that much, wish there was an option to toggle it, in fact I think it masked the blurry textures pretty well. Combat boss fights are actually fun now, with new tools to deal with them on-site. The Missing Link DLC is quite lengthy with interesting level design, where each conversation and the action you take has an impact on later stages of the DLC, really cool stuff that they could experiment with, without worrying about time constraints, and on top of that it has a good sidestory behind it that ties into the main story.The ""making of"" video is pretty cool, but the main feature that makes Director's Cut worth buying is the commentary that I highly recommend checking out once you play through the game once or twice, it's really interesting and very funny. You can't not notice how passionate they were about it, the commentary discusses a lot of content that was cut, as well as design choices, inspirations behind the concept art and a lot of other very subtle stuff that you probably missed the first time around, and some you'd probably never thought of. One thing I didn't get is why did they remove the photos of devs from the ending credits, those really made the ""passion project"" vibe that much more authentic.Now, Deus Ex ""predicted"" 9/11 right? While replaying Human Revolution in 2016, I got a funny feeling about the anti-""fascist police state"" riot group, funded by global elites and supported by the mainstream media pushing an agenda. Just a funny feeling... "

Deus Ex: Human RevolutionDeus Ex: Human Revolution is the third game of the Deus Ex series. The protagonist, Adam Jensen, is the Chief of Security for the biotech company Sarif Industries, in which he joins forces with Task Force 29, aiming to hunt down and capture augmented terrorists.Positives and some minor complaintsPositives There are always multiple ways to complete a mission; really rewarding exploring over blazing through a level. Immersive, strong ambiance. Both in an excellent soundtrack, as in the visual style. Your choices, both in action and dialogue, really do matter and influence the outcome of your deeds. Great world building with all the e-mails, pocket secretaries and news reports. A lot of augmentations (upgrades) to choose from, to determine your own style of completing missions. Very rewarding and well implemented stealth-system. Story revolves about a really interesting matter, being the way augmentations do or will influence mankind, for better or worse.Minor complaints Obligatory boss fights, which does break the immersion if you're going for a full stealth replay. You're forced to fight the bosses head on. Somewhat dated character models.  Poor AI at times.ConclusionThis game is a classic for a reason. Although I've never played the previous Deus Ex games, this one is really accessible and great if you want to try out the series. With the strong futuristic style, great world building and impacting dialog choices, this games immerses you in the futuristic world of 2027.			"

IntroWhere to start? Cyber punk games are really interesting because of the philosophy of the cultures. The factions of people who are for augmentations and those who are against it because they think its inhuman to do and against nature itself. A society always questioning the benefits and tradeoffs of disregarding some of your flesh in order to speed ahead of those around you in competitive areas.Dynamic Design+ Dynamic Navigation from point to point+ Upgrades contribute to navigationGame is very dynamic with many interesting ways to get from Point A to Point B. The way you move around the environment depends up to you and what upgrades you get. The stealth in the game is great, and so are the ways you can sneak past enemies or use an object in order to lure them away from their defensive post.Bosses + Multiple ways to take down bossesThe bosses in Director's cut actually have multiple ways to take them down instead of just shooting and running and more shooting. You can actually use hacking and stealth to take down your enemies and there is various different ways to do it. This was a huge improvement over the original game and the main flaw it ""used"" to have now this game is easier to recommend thanks to the upgrade.ConversationsThe conversations are very interactive and can be quite hard at first to get what you want from the characters, however it feels really rewarding when you do smooth talk them into it. ConclusionOverall i would say this is a very unique stealth game with  a great story.

												I find it hard to recommend Director's Cut over the original game - essentially, it adds more weapons (useless sniper rifle that can't kill on headshots, useless shotgun, a grenade launcher) and a rather lengthy interlude halfway through chapter 3 that used to be the Missing Link.Unfortunately, Missing Link sucks. The boat is alright, but the base has endlessless backtracking (go to the office to active your id, go to the detention center, go back to the office to pick up a cybernetic eye, go back to the detention center, go back to the lab) and mindbogglingly annoying loading screens (""biometric security scans"" which were persumably needed to hide the loading screens on whatever toaster the Missing Link was originally developed for, but on PC they simply extend a 60s dumb backtracking objective to a 90s dumb backtracking-and-watching-the-loading-screen objective. So yeah, stick with the base game if you own (Steam is no longer selling it, so sucks for you if you don't already own that - have fun staring at ""loading screens"" that are no longer needed).			"

												An amazing single player experience that predicts what one of the worlds darker futures could be, and tells the story in a intriguing way. The gameplay is very good too, and could last you up to 100hours to do everything (i have just done 1 playthrough). Discount or not it is worth your time for sure.9/10			"

												Deus Ex is one of the best rpgs in modern times. It's a mature story about the nature of one's humanity, technological progress, and the evolution of our capitalist society towards dystopia. The stealth is fun, if a bit forced. The director's cut has some performance issues, but it wasn't much if a problem. I give this a full recommendation, especially with the sequel coming out this year.			"

  INTRODUCTION   Deus Ex: Human Revolution  is a  cyberpunk-themed first-person action role-playing stealth  video game developed by  Eidos Montreal  and published by  Square Enix  in  2013 , it is the third game in the Deus Ex series, and a prequel to the original game released in 2000.   GAMEPLAY   As Adam Jensen, you are taking main, missions and side missions, if you choose (you can’t get back to finish side quest if you already finished the main missions). Missions allow you the freedom to complete them according to your preferences: You can choose to infiltrate a building with lethal or non-lethal means, to sneak around and never engage the enemy or to use hacking and turn existing security features to your side. From the outset, you're given all of the tools — guns, a takedown move (in both lethal and non-lethal flavors) and the skills to hack into systems — and let loose into the world.You also have choices when it comes to your skills and abilities. You earn ""praxis points"" by gaining XP from main quests and side quests, which are good for spending on the ""augmentations"" you'd like. Earning XP has a lot more different minor ways — you’ll be more interested to explore more through secret paths to gain traveler/explorer/pathfinder XP and using non-lethal take down to your enemies to earn expedient and merciful XP really brings this game to the more maximum stealth game. There are abilities associated with each kind of play style — stealthy upgrades like a limited-time invisibility cloak (which I think is the most important skill that is super helpful to pass through guards waves, lasers, cameras, robots and etc. like a ghost if you like to play with non-lethal style), thicker skin for the pugilistic, hacking skills and etc. This emphasis on choice — along with often brilliant level and mission design — makes playing Human Revolution a powerful experience. I went into missions tense, worked my way through waves of guards, talk and investigating people with people like a detective and challenges methodically and always felt satisfied by my progress. Human Revolution made me feel like a smart genius resourceful spy.  PERFORMANCE  The game draws remarkable atmosphere between the sterility of the corporate world and the grit of the city with its cyberpunk, transhumanism, futuristic style. Office interiors feature clean lines and metallic surfaces; in trash-street corners, the sewer, the homeless huddle around flaming barrels for warmth.  It all comes back to that gold and that black. The color combination rivals teal and orange for its known visual appeal, but the color palette's impact goes beyond its attractiveness. In China, the term ""black gold"" refers to political corruption and corporate greed, key narrative elements in Human Revolution. The colors recall the brightness of modern machinery and the darkness of Detroit's alleyways, and evoke the works of Botticelli and Da Vinci, who ushered in a renaissance, just as David Sarif hopes to lead the world into a new era of enlightenment. There is so much meaning in this single detail.   GAME TIPS   Always take a cover! — Combined with the stealth augmentation can provide with some excellent flanking maneuvers Upgrades! — Look for weapons upgrades or buy them. Remember to focus on upgrades that would help you not only offensively, like Recoil Reduction, but also defensively such as Dermal Plating. Carry around other weapons along with extra ammo; you never know what upgrades you may find for your extra weapons or what kind of situation you would need it for.   Unlock Cloak System to give you temporary invincibility. It’s the most useful praxis in my opinion. It will let you pass undetected from guard waves and all the security systems such as camera, lasers gate, robots, turrets and etc. It will help you to earn extra 500 XP if you can get through the wave undetectably in each missions.   Drink alcohol! — Whiskey, vodka, beer, spirits, and etc. I only know that alcohol drink in this game is to increase your health capacity almost in the end of the game. It’s kinda odd in that way but it’s cool and unique. Try to use the vent as often as possible, it sometimes leads you directly to the mission point and remain undetected as well as without needs to look for the security gate password to pass.   REPLAYABILITY  Might be sometimes will get it try with the “Give me Deus Ex” difficulty (hardest). Moreover, they have four different endings ! And you will unlock new game+ after you ended the game. Surprisingly, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is one of the best ending game ever made.  VERDICT  8.8/10In addition, as the newbie in Deus Ex series, which Deus Ex: Human Revolution is my first Deus Ex series game; I’m eagerly looking forward with the upcoming sequel of Deus Ex: Human Revolution,  Deus Ex: Mankind Divided  next year, 2016. Moreover the main character name is almost similar with my name. Jensen <> Jhonson. It’s a pleasure when they are calling Jensen in the game. It’s like I’m interacting with them directly. Oh yeah~			"

												This was the 1st Deus Ex game for me. I haven't played the 1st one or the Invisible war.You are the main protagonist Adam Jensen, who is working as a chief of security in an extremely advanced biotechnology company called Sarif Industries. Game starts with you walking around the lab with your love interest, scientist Megan Reed. You both get separated at one point and a few moments later Sarif Industries is under attack by skilled and well-trained soldiers. After fighting your way to Megan you meet an augmented enemy. The last things you see are your love interest getting slapped and falling down on floor and the augmented soldier putting a bullet in your head. 6 months later you are back at Sarif Industries. You are not who you used to be. You never asked for this (augmentations). So begins your action-full adventure in finding information about the attackers and Megan. Through the story you will also discover much more (conspiracies, double-crossings etc.)If this raised interest in you, then I think you should get this game.Pros:+ Entertaining story+ Entertaining side quests+ Your choices and actions matter+ Multiple ways and styles to play this game+ A lot of things to find+ A lot of places to explore+ Quite often game is very challenging (especially when you are trying to do everything with stealth)Cons:- Game feels way too bright (afaik DX11 issue)- Hubs have a ""linear level"" feeling (especially Detroit. There could have been more paths and more buildings, more.. depth I guess)- Fast and stealthy takedowns sometimes don't work (guard turns around, sees me for less than 1 sec, I perform a takedown, he's unconscious but other guards are alarmed and hostile somehow).

												Let's get something out of the way first: human Revolution is a masterpiece, plain and simple. It became an instand classic and a must play, and frankly- quite deservengly so.With that being said, it still has some minor issues. HR is a prequel to the first Deus Ex, taking place 25 years before the first title of the series. The setting probably, is the strongest part of the game: it's art direction, music, visual representation and overall style are simply breathtaking. It is worth playing, simply to experience all of it. The gameplay is reminiscent of the first Deus Ex with 2 significant changes:1.Chest hight wallsYes, I am afraid that trends of modern gaming didn't pass HR completely by, so get ready to shoot people from behind cover. While shooter part is diminished by ever present chest hight cover, the stealth part is actually enhanced- it is extremely convenient to be able to see behind corners, and plan your approach accordingly. 2.Level design While Deus Ex provided HUGE open ended areas, with a lot of freedom, HR' s levels look more like corridors. We are still able to choose from a verity of approaches, (vents, breakable walls, sewers and so on), but the illusion of freedom of movement has been diminished somewhat. We are still however have an absolute freedom in game play aspect of problem solving: stealth or  direct approach, lethal or non lethal, guns or melee  takedowns.The story  itself I will break into 3 parts: plot, setting, and  philosophical context.1.The setting.Simply amazing. Frighteningly realistic, it menages to build a bridge between our reality and the bleak  dystopian future of the first Deus Ex. Geo-political disputes, ethically bankrupt  corporations, shadow governments and rampant abuse of technology create a world almost as believable as it is repulsive.2.Philosophical contextHR's main focus is on  transhumanism and the plethora of questions around it: The ethics of human augmentations, self controlled human evolution and the line between the man and the machine.3.The plot The weakest link in HR. While the plot itself is serviceable, characters don't  have arks, motivations are lacking, and  by the end the plot runs out of steam, disconnecting you from the story and characters completely. The missing Link DLC included in the director's cut provides about 2 hours of gameplay and indeed  enriches the story, but itself consists of nothing but straight corridors with even less freedom to explore. In conclusion: A masterpiece. Highly recommended.			"

												Amazing game... The details, the graphics, the storyline, 0 bugs/glitches throughout the whole gameplay. I recommend this game to all. I am a big thief fan, so it is hard to find a game that you can sneak till the end of the game instead of going guns blazing. The storyline and voice actors were also amazing. Not a single negative comment I can think about this game.			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is such a bold and a brilliant game there is nothing but praise for this game. There is just nothing like itThe plot is very well written and story is told in such a brilliant non-linear fashion it is something that is to be admired. Not only are you searching for redemption but the sub-plots which focus on darker side of technology, what it means to be human, the guilt, reason, hunger for power, manipulation, humanity, conspiracy the game tells so many things which is just brilliant. It's not just a game where cyberpunk genre is slapped, the events that happen are actually realistic and could happen in the future. Little details about how the technology is used and is implemented is very well done and clearly the developing team paid very close detail to the actual technology and how to implement it in a realistic fashion. Dialouges are great too. Gameplay is very unique and excellently executed, variety of weapons, the way they are handled and used in different situations is excellent. The way you choose to progress is bloody brilliant, you may choose the stealth approach or could go guns blazing, you could explore hidden paths and reach to your destination without going through so much trouble or you could simply do a combination of both. You can kill or just knock enemies down or simply just manage to avoid them or hack your way through with minimal combat. Objects could be used to hurt enemies or be used in puzzle solving. You can literally choose the way you want to play the game and every method is well executed. There are augmentations which will enhance your combat, you can become super-strong or become invisible or know more about your enemies locations and so much more. Controls take a while to get used to but it's okay because the gameplay is just so different naturally the controls will be different too. Also depending on how you are progressing, the outcomes can be different ultimately affecting everything that happens in the journey.The game looks good, the art style is well done as it gives the dark distopian tone of the near future and enhances the atmosphere, the sounds are well done and the music which is all electronic just adds more to the vibe of the distopian future they wanted to create.Overall, a splendid game staying true to the spirit of previous games in the franchise as well as doing something different, it pays homage to it's predecessors as well as intoduces new people into the franchise. A casual gamer will love it and so will the hardcore one. It is just utter brriliance and a well executed game.			"

												I enjoy games with an interesting story, such as; Mass Effect, Bioshock, Various Final Fantasy games, and more. Deus Ex: Human Revolution ranks up there with them, as the kind of game where the story is so compelling, you want to delve further into the world and learn all about it. It has all the classic aspects of a good RPG, Interesting Characters, side quests, even emails on hundreds of computers throughout the game, some with easter eggs, others with stories all their own. This is a game you can enjoy for hours, play through a second or third time and make different choices for a different ending. I am excited to see where this franchise heads in future games, but for now this is a title I whole-heartedly recommend!			"

												An immersive, somewhat deep in gameplay and open-ended FPS RPG involving conspiracy, international conflict, human dilemmas, spying people's emails, choice and dialogue making, crawling in every vent on a bulding to avoid the same looking guards, playing a stupid hacking minigame, spending adequate time to stealthly and skillfully for a no lethal  killing everything that moves and checking every corner for the two or three items you actually use in your playstyle to then watch 480p-tier prerendered cinematics.

												I finished this game three times in a row, and have played it for over 120 hours. For atmosphere purposes: The game is best played during the evening and night. I talked to almost every individual that walks in the cities, read all emails, hacked all computers and read all e-books in the game. It costs a lot of time, but they contribute well to the brilliant story. I think in reality we are getting close to what happens in the game. For that matter the game is even more interesting and makes the time reading stuff worthwhile.Playstyles The first time I played the game by sneaking most of the time, and when appropriate use Q to put the guard in a deep sleep. I hardly killed anyone, except for the bosses of course. The second time I used to be a ghost and sneak through every mission. Helped by my first time I finished the game, I knew exactly where all the vents and roofs were to avoid the enemy. Also you know how to use the augmentations for maximal potential. I managed to finish the game as pacifist and only knocked out Burke (from the missing link). I also managed to finish the missing link without using any augmentation. Unfortunately, although I was never noticed once, I didn’t get the foxiest of all hounds achievement. The second time I didn’t read the emails, books, didn’t talk with civilians anymore, and could finish the game in 15-20 hours.The third time I changed the setting to “Give me Deus Ex” and I went in to go as a FPS, to kill everyone. The gameplay is totally different if you use another style, what makes the game worth to replay in a different style. The shootings are somewhat difficult, since a direct confrontation with a soldier, especially a heavy, is not easy. You will be killed easily, even if you have armor upgraded to the max. If you sniper a heavy, or sometimes even other soldiers, in the head, they turn around in a second and shoot directly at you, and they rarely miss. That is not very realistic in my opinion. I am used to shooters like Medal Of Honor: Allied Assault, Doom, CoD, Duke Nukem, but this is different. To my opinion this game is not really suitable as a shooter, although it is fun.Most of the augmentations/upgrades make sense and make the game better for Adam Jensen. All augmentation can contribute to improve a certain playstyle. And with all augmentations the game is really open to finish a certain situation on different ways.Atmosphere/Music/VisualsThe atmosphere is what makes the game so good. The music is outstanding and really creates an atmosphere to be soaked into. Every level and situation has different music what really fits. The cyberpunk lovers really got what they are looking for here! Deus Ex is a game about choice and unlike other games that advertise choice as a key aspect of the game and fail to deliver, Deus Ex delivers it. Many choices can have later in the game huge implications. I won’t spoil too much in here, but I definitely made some decisions I regretted later on. The game looks really finished. I hardly encountered any errors while playing the game.Not so positive/negatives: - To cloak makes the game too easy. They could have let that out of the augmentations. If you cloak you can kill guards/enemies easy, walk away and hide. The soldiers most of the time only look around for some seconds but almost never are really going to explore the area to search for you. And if they do you cloak again and can kill them easily again. You can just stand before them with an upgraded gun and pop them in the head. No skills involved there. - The boss fights are far too easy. The Typhoon ammo is far too strong. 3 of the 4 bosses didn’t even struck me once and the battle sometimes lasted less than a minute. If you go into the fight with full battery, go into cloak-mode, use 2 typhoons and 1 or 2 rockets it is most of the time enough. The end-boss doesn’t even see you so won’t shoot you. You can add F4 (silent running) to it, so that it makes it even more impossible for an enemy to fight you.- The endings are a bit easy to choose. I would rather have seen that decisions in your style of playing would influence the ending. Now you can just hit one of the four buttons. - The hardest setting is hardly any more difficult than the normal mode, a bit disappointing. The second/third time you play the game, it is really easy since you know all the situations and the layout of the maps.- The movies/video could be a bit better. Personally I don’t care that much, but that would make the game even better than it already it.I can really recommend to play Deux Ex Human Revolution, but only if you want to invest some time in it. If you just finish it quickly, I think you miss out of a lot. Have fun playing this game!			"

												In short: wow! What a phenomenal game, and it sure did not disapoint my expectations either! Keep in mind, I have have only played the director's cut edition, so I will be basing my review on that version alone.Let's begin:Aesthetics 8.25/10 The game looks very good, and the unique orangeish-hue scifi color is obviously present as well. The soundtrack was composed by a person that has receieved great appraisal, Micheal McCann. The music fits a very diverse set of locations, ranging from the iconic chinese jingles in Shanghai to futuristic stealthpumping action music. The game knows it's setting well, and shows it. The voice acting is great, but the lip-sync is kind of awkward and the animations for various npc's are reused over and over again, if you can overlook the usual shrugs by the females, then you'll be dandy.Controls 9/10The controls are near perfect for Deus Ex. Besides the usual flip flaps and glitchy control support, the game on keyboard and mouse is perfection.Story/Characters 9/10Words cannot describe the masterpiece that is the story, however the characters are somewhat bland, excluding Jensen. The story revolves around an augmented spec that works for a tech-company. As the game progresses, we see the various changes that have effected the world due to human augmentation. The game plays with the minds of the scientific illititerate, so as long as you have some standing knownledge of the original sequel to the game, you might get slightly lost.Gameplay 8.50/10The game is around 35-50 hours of gameplay. Not too long and not too short, a perfect margin. The game will try to force you to stick to stealth, however. As it does not condone nor reward you for killing people, you don't want to be a bad apple. The stealth system is so much fun, it's actually better than most stealth games actually! The hacking mini games are unique in the start of the game, but if you max out the hacking skill early on, it get's boring late-game. Lastly, the RPG system is a bit flawed, but  it does reward exploration. If you like to explore, you'll be treated to some augpoints.Final Verdict 9.30/10The game deserves the praise it is recieved. Buy the game, it's cheap and if you're into scifi and dystopian-esque societities, this is for you.TL;DR: Robo-Cop "

												A pale shadow of the original, DX:HR's troubles aren't its mediocre gameplay or poor game design. It's the story, and the story's presentation. The original game introduced the villains quickly, and always kept them -- and their motivations -- just inside the shadows, giving players a delight in discovering the depths of their schemes. HR's villains are either so deep in the darkness that their motivations, even at the end of the game, are inscrutable and their methods obscure, while others are so front-and-centre that they border on the comical. Even the cast of protagonists flail about like marionettes, their strings being clumsily pulled to and fro by the writers with no idea of how to tell a compelling story.The out-of-touch boss fights are the most direct merging of the bad story-telling with the poor gameplay, and the ""alternative stealthy solutions"" to those fights in this Director's Cut edition boil down to nothing more than some hackable turrets or sentries with which to gun down the bosses, clumsily added to levels without even bothering to update the minimap for the new level areas It's true that you can choose to shoot, hack, subdue, or sneak, but the game clearly favours sneaking, hacking, and subduing, with massive XP loss if you fail to hack every terminal (even when you know the password!), search every vent, and knock out every guard. Do all this, and the XP rewards ensure you will be a veritable God by the endgame, invulnerable to the pathetic attempt at shock and horror in the final level.No matter how you choose to play Adam Jensen in the game, he will never be as stupid or as incompetent as he is in the cutscenes, which serve to ham-handedly enforce idiotic plot twists. And whereas the original gave three interesting solutions to humanity's future, with different, equally valid reasons to select, presented by different, generally equally likeable characters, offering differing mission challenges, and brief, direct, and meaningful conclusions, this game gives us a choice of four buttons to press in the final room, followed by vague philosophical meandering to a vague montage that wouldn't look out of place on a YouTube conspiracy video.Long story short: The gameplay is disappointing and the story is not compelling. It's a mediocre ride at best, and does a disservice to the Deus Ex name.			"

												Well-made remix of the original Deus Ex, presenting beautifully crafted backstory and solid, entertaining gameplay. It is wise, it is made of nothing but best efforts and good intentions. A brilliant of the game. I see truth in every sane positive review, in every high mark that title got. Superb stuff, which is worth every penny.Yet, I’m not satisfied with it. For some reason, I feel that game is too tied to the past, to be something I call cyberpunk.Deus Ex Human Revolution has everything I could only ask from cyberpunk game. It calls itself so. But that’s a lie. Not completely, of course. You know, the standard definition for cyberpunk sounds like “Hi tech. Low life”, and that’s that we see a plenty in our game. But I’ve got another quote for you, from our precious W. Gibson: “The world has never had so many moving particles and so few labels for them”.I think the label “cyberpunk” is not fitting Deus Ex HR completely, because it is way too caring about what’s going on, in a global meaning. It is way too conscious for an action game. And it is praising a human life so high, that it makes me sick sometimes. In Hengsha events, to be precise. And even worse – in that embedded, crushed into the flesh of the original game, DLC Missed Link. I know I’m facing the bad guys, who are not caring about human lives at all. Why should I care for their lives? I don’t know. But all those bonuses to Exp points, all those achievements like Pacifist or Factory Zero, all the given pre-history of my protagonist Adam Jensen, insisting I should leave them be. And that leaves a mark.Okay, I know that does not convince you about my point. Have another: the creators of Deus Ex HR were too attached to the original Deus Ex of the year 2000, to create really new game. I understand them, surely: were they too innovative, and all those fans would destroy a game’s name in the media, made a lower metacritic score, and that would be a disaster, of course. But again, cutting off  something new and of hi tech because someone cares and could dislike you – does it sounds cyberpunk to you? For me, it’s  plain and pure conservatism there.So many good things in this game:1) brilliant level design, there you always have the choice of routes, for every tactic you would like, would that be stealth, assault, some kind of “social engineering”, or mix of those.2) Delightful hacking mini game and all interactions with computers in general. It is certainly quite natural and adding much of context in the game. Wish we had something like that in the new Shadowrun series...3) Speaking of context, I also enjoyed the level of detail through all the game. For example, when I suddenly decided to kill some merks on my second walkthrough, I couldn’t find their leader later in the game. Because he was expecting me, for one, and was feared that I won’t spare him, secondly. Damn right he was! Funny thing was  that I remember in my first trip when I knocked him off, I was deciding, whether to kill him, or leave him be… and obeyed the Pacifist rule, to get an achievement. 4) Not only every situation in the game could be untied in various styles. There are some options which I believe was not even predicted by the designers! Like: there are two guards and turret. I can crouch behind guards, but if I want to deal with them, to have clear backside, I need to deal with turret first. I can switch it off, but guards will notice me doing so. I can sneak behind the turret and shove her into a corner, where it can’t be a problem anymore. But once I just picked that turret and threw it into the guards. And knocked them both by that throw! Pure luck, I guess.5) Music is nice, I still have some of soundtrack in my playlist. Voicing is gorgeous, can’t wish for better. All the visuals part is good, even if some details are look exactly like in the first Deus Ex.Bads list is small:1) Even with all good effort on details, there are some very generic elements which I can’t tolerate, like the looks of offices, office decks and, worst of all, damned faxes everywhere! Oh, why?2) Implementation of the “Missing Link” dlc in the middle of the base game is furies me. I really don’t think this was a good idea, and good implementation. I like that dlc the way it was. It reminds me of the Sleeping Dogs Definitive edition, where they messed all the fun both from the game AND dlc stuff by implementing it.3) That game takes too much effort “to make it right”, in Pacifist way. It is so persistent with that “what’s right” thing, even (especially) in the endings… I can’t bear it. The game supposed to be multiplexed, fit every approach… but no, all that freedom of choice is something of illusion. I know people who like Dishonored more, for their choices make a bigger difference in the end. Me? I prefer Alpha Protocol.Overall mark 8.99/10, for the amount of work, and with handsel to the next game, which, as I knew already, will do better.NB: check this article: http://ludo.mwclarkson.com/2011/10/adam-jensen-dmpd/ "

												this is a really good ''final version'' of an already great gamethey speeded up the slow rolling and dodging animations from the original to make it a bit faster paced to match the rest of the gamethey also revamped the energy sysem so now you recharge all your available energy cells not just 1 so you can really use the cool augments without spending a fortune on energy barsthey also hugely improved the boss fights in the orignal thet were not scriptrd nut the only way you could beat them was by run and gunning and if you played as a stealth guy you had almost no guns so....they completely re-made the boss arenas to allow the boss to lose you so you can hack the security system or set upn an ambush do whatever you like and it worksthey also touched up the levels here and there more loot better hiding places and the like			"

												This game is amazing from the depth to the unique approach to combat. You have all the skills to be a badass but it takes a skilled player to use them. What i love most about this game is the depth of the storyline. Most games these days are hack-and-slash or cliche military operations, but this one is way more personal than your standard operation. The customization and upgrade for your armor and weapons are really nice as well as the interface. I HIGHLY recommend people who love 1st person shooters to place this game, a great experienece!			"

												It's years late and on a different product version than the original release, but this game deserves a positive review enough that it's better late than never.Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a prequel to the original Deus Ex, taking place almost 30 years before the events of that game and about 10 years before the creation of the primary antagonist faction in that game. Mechanical human augmentation has changed how people view humanity, leading to the revolution of human ability. However, corporations that are more powerful than governments vie for dominance and secret societies try to have their way with the masses. Adam Jensen, an ex-SWAT that now works for a biotech corporation, is forcibly augmented by his employer after an attack that leaves him wounded and many of the scientists he was meant to protect dead. In trying to find why his company is being targeted, Jensen begins to unravel a global conspiracy to control augmentation technology and humanity itself.Human Revolution brings about a number of changes to the Deus Ex formula to bring it closer to what the audiences of 2011+ expect from games, such as regenerating health and bioenergy (to an extent) and a 3rd-person cover system. But it's still Deus Ex at its core, allowing multiple solutions to almost every problem. You can sneak past almost every enemy using cloaking and alternate pathways, fight them with a variety of lethal and non-lethal methods, hack security systems, or try to talk your way out of problems.A few flaws to point out: In the original 2011 release, boss fights required you to use combat to succeed (and the 4 original bosses will die even if you try to be non-lethal). This version introduces a few new ways to succeed, but not every build will be able to access these alternate methods, so be ready to have 3-4 tough fights, just in case. In addition, the integration of The Missing Link into the full game means that you'll have your augs reset near the end of the game. You'll get back your praxis points (and a few extra), but it can be jarring to those used to the original release. (Be sure to grab your gear before ending that mission, after you get your praxis back, or it will be lost!)The story of the game focuses on transhumanism just as much as the conspiracy, and brings up a lot of important topics that are gaining relevance in our own world. The story examines what it means to be human when people can replace their flesh-and-blood body parts with better, mechanized versions. The conspiracy and its primary members will be familiar to those who played the original game, but there are enough new faces to keep from confusing new players with the call-forwards to Deus Ex. While the story often leaves the player begging for answers just as much as Jensen is, much of the conspiracy is explained, either in the story scenes, ambient conversations, or emails. The game comes to a final confrontation with the conspirators in a climactic ending level, though the final boss fight isn't built up very well (even with the additional plot hooks in The Missing Link). The endings are ultimately canned monologues based on who you sided with in the final level and your playstyle (lethal, non-lethal, or mixed), but they cover a number of important philosophical themes relating to the game.Lovers of modern FPS or RPG games, or anyone who enjoys cyberpunk, Deus Ex, or the ""immersive sim"" style of solution-finding gameplay should find something they enjoy in Human evolution. With 15-25 hours of content (depending on optional objectives and playstyle), there's lenty of game to play. A worthy first game in the revival of the Deus Ex series.			"

The idea of getting the whole thing in a bundle plus some new features seemed like a great deal since they cut off a percent of the price for people who own the original. Little did I know that when I started it up that the performance would be complete garbage! Nothing but stuttering, frame rate issues, and to be perfeclty honest...it's ugly as sin! I'm sure there is more content in this package, but I'm never going to get to see it because I cant bring my self to play through the tutorial.			"

												The Director's Cut is an unplayable money-grab, returning older, frame rate-killing bugs and graphics errors while adding only questionable value in the form of slightly modified boss fights. The orginal version had problems, too, but those could be tweaked and resolved. The bugs in the Director's Cut cannot be resolved and never will be addressed by the developer, who is already working on the sequel.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. If you want to play it, be sure to find the original version, instead of the Director's Cut.			"

												Deus Ex: HR is a really good game for the most part, and the improvements made to the Director's Cut, like the alternate means of fighting boss fights, definitely add to this. Whether you want to run and gun or you want to sneak around and not be seen by anyone in the entire game, or anything in between, there are a lot of ways to play the game. And it's pretty fun, though you may find that some parts drag a bit.Only two minor annoyances:1.) The switching between FPS and 3PS as you move into and out of cover can be jarring. Honestly, I rather wish they'd made the whole game 3rd person, or at least offered it as an option. 2.) Character animations are often weird and jerky during cut-scenes; it's like they were trying to have the characters make emphatic gestures with their dialogue but just didn't pull it off very well. Other than those very minor things, everything else is pretty good. The story is enjoyable, the environments can be interesting, the combat is solid, the voice acting is acceptable. A game worth getting. Or, in the case of those who already own the non-director's-cut version, worth the few bucks to upgrade to this version.			"

Great story that keeps you guessing, great characters and voice acting, great gameplay mechanic, great soundtrack. The level designs let you approach them with direct confrontation or stealth including the boss fights. The environment really feel alive with NPC chatting various topics, hacked computers contains funny emails between NPC, moveable objects, etc. The firearms can be modified with various upgrades and the player can also be augmented with various upgrades. The only down side is the graphic quality, but then again, this game originally released back in 2011. A really solid RPG game, you have to get this one.			"

												The director's cut version of Deus Ex 3 is quite disappointing, there's VERY little difference from the original, it has the DLC ""The missing link"" incorporated in the game, but the difference from playing the original and then playing the DLC at the same point it is inserted here is none. The director's cut claims changed boss-fights, which would've been really nice, since they were one of the major weak points of DX:HR, but unfortunately what they've changed is equivalent to an afternoon's worth of work for 1 developer. All in all, quite the disappointment, tho still a marginal improvement(emphasis on marginal) on the original. In my opponion not worth the money.			"

												DXHR had a rather deep story. It talked about realistic things. The entire franchise was based around augmentations. Every thing the player was of their own choice. You can be stealthy, or go in guns blazing. You could be a pacifist, or a murderer.  The game kind of tells people to be pacifists. (You get more XP for being a pacifist). There are a lot of different ways to play the game. Do this, or don't do this. It *usually* has an eventual impact further in the game. Thus, it has plenty of replay value.  10/10 would get augmented again.			"

												As someone who could never get into the original Deus Ex/Thief series for their lack of guidance, I find myself surprised how Deus Ex: HR and Director's Cut got me into the ""immersive sim"" genre. I am also shocked how a ""photorealistic"" modern game can stay true to the genre.Unlike the original--which was marred by terrible gunplay and RPG mechanics, but redeemed by its chaotic, player-driven shenanigans like the Postal series--Human Revolution is a great game to play. You don't need to play the game twice (or have a guide) to play it correctly.Is it the best in the series? Perhaps, but it's the first I can easily recommend in spite of its missing qualities of the original. The real beauty of HR is not whether or not it's a true ""Deus Ex"" game; it's the fact that immersive sims can still be made with all the fluidity of the player's consequences and all the accessibility of modern games.Human Revolution vs. The Director's CutI am fortunate to have bought HR before it was taken down from Steam, and I have played both games to completion recently with 18 hours in the original and 16 hours for the DC (w/ commentary).Here are the many changes I have found:- Performance is slightly WORSE on DC than the original. The new textures (and omission of the filter) caused me to lower the quality slightly as well as suffer many missing texture issues. (Textures with flat colors like neon-green shoes.) For comparison, I never suffered any graphical issues in the original.- You seem to have more ammo in DC. I always played non-lethal as I saved up for bosses, but I noticed my inventory was often packed with 150 to 200 ammo for three guns. This could be because they added in more weapons to the game. (And yet I had fewer gas-grenades.)-Boss fights are significantly better for hacker-playstyles with stealth being an option. -Contextual dev commentary on the map that can be interrupted in-game or it may prevent you to progress.-You can no longer get the Missing Link for the original if you own it. (Adds maybe 3 - 4 hours of padding.)-Energy cells recharge to two cells below ""Give me Deus Ex"" difficulty.The DC offers a significant change in quality, sometimes for the worse, but I think if you want the ""defintiive"" experience you will want DC. The commentary is exceptionally helpful for added details to explain the subtler parts of the narrative. What Makes A Deus Ex?The core idea behind not only immersive sims but of Deus Ex goes back to the Latin phrase, ""Deus Ex Machina."" The player is the driving force that brings about change in guiding the protagonist; s/he makes choices for how to resolve obstacles with violence or avoiding it.HR mostly abides by that philosophy save for the forced boss-fights and choices where you choose between two options (or neither). The latter aspect can be excused for dramatic tension but the former goes against Deus Ex. Even if you used non-lethal means it will be a fatal blow. Aside from that issue, which is addressed in the DC, the consequences found in older Deus Ex games are here.Ironically, although this modern take is more realistic with its gameplay, graphics and storytelling, the gameplay feels more ""gamey"" than the original. You won't be making ladders from trip-mines like the original, but there are changes made that I don't think was for the better. For starters, the XP system. It is too rewarding for non-lethal, hacker playstyles and if you want to make the game more entertaining than a standard FPS it's also better to play with discretion. Stealth is optimal for all playstyles, and the third-person cover system makes it satisfying while being simplified from peaking around corners. Perhaps if non-lethal ammo was more scarce I would be fine with how non-lethal builds are rewarded but you will hoard ammo if you ration it carefully.Second, which ties into the first, there always seems to be an optimal solution. ""Social Boss fights"", air-vents and other deviations always seem structured to give you the best reward if you follow a specific path. If the XP system wasn't an huge influence for getting augmentations, I could ignore it rather than feeling like I made a mistake. It's a greater problem if you want the replay value of the original where it had items and skill-points based on exploration.Lastly, which is also a criticism of the story, the game is too linear of a progression. The HUBs are nice distractions to offer more non-linear options for every playthrough, but my favorite parts of the game are the missions you do outside of the HUB. If the progression was designed for choosing  various missions in whatever order the player desires like in Shadowrun Dragonfall, then we would have a greater value for replaybility. It would be demanding to pull off but it's something that would have made HR vastly superior to the original.These blemishes on an otherwise flawless recreation of a forgotten style of game doesn't make HR terrible. They are sources for improvement now that there is a foundation to make games in a similar vein, and where the series can improve from here. Hominum Ex MachinaWhen it comes to the story I am of two minds about HR. On the one hand, the plot itself feels too straightforward for a conspiracy story. Clues for the next objective can be made spontaneously and without player involvement, which is somewhat the fault of designing a game with a linear mission progression. (Perhaps if it was an open-ended route of missions you could uncover different clues or facts that lead to the same conclusion. It could still be bottlenecked to the truth but the process would be more rewarding.) For what the game offers, there is still the mystique of uncovering the truth but it's without the player's involvement. It would also help the plot if the ""villains"" were not confused with the bosses because they are also pawns, and depending on who you wish to side with it will influence who you consider to be the villain(s). The way antagonists in this game are handled is rather commendable.What I was surprised about the most was how the theme of transhumanism is handled. It is treated so carefully it actually becomes a part of the gameplay that won't click until you finish the game. Neuropozyne addiction, industrialism on augmentations for working classes, economic influences on augmentation and many other aspects offer a thoughtful discussion about the matter without being preachy. The resistance against augmentation wasn't as ignorant as I first thought it was.In fact, when it comes to the game's subtext about ""humanity"", I didn't catch how it tied into the core gameplay itself until I chose my ending with Hugh Darrow. ""How many times, in the call of duty, did I almost fall in the trap of making shortcuts using the abilities or resources at my hand? I resisted because I valued human lives [...] [U ]sing technology to become something more than we are risks losing our ability to love, to aspire and to make moral choices. The very things that make us human; it also risks giving some men the power to make men how they choose to regard human dignity."" These words make more sense of the player's role if you change ""to love, to aspire"" to ""to empathize, to think through obstacles."" Unlike the original where the player is a deus ex machina, the player of HR is the hominum ex machina for Jenson. To what end you think is best for humanity, of how you handle fighting other men and of how humanity should progress are questions the game lets you ponder for yourself and to make your own conclusions.I Did Ask For ThisI've always wondered if a game could tell a story solely by player's actions with open environments. Fallout New Vegas proved it could be done in mass; HR proved it could be done with thematic purpose enclosed.			"

												""Transhumanism (abbreviated as H+ or h+) is an international cultural and intellectual movement with the goal of fundamentally transforming the human condition by eventually developing and making widely available technologies to greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities.""The 3rd entry to the Deus Ex franchise, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a cyberpunk themed stealth RPG. Developed by Eidos Montreal, the original Deus Ex is considered one of the most influential games of all time, pioneering on player choice, RPG mechanics and stealth. With all this said, Human Revolution has quite a bit to live up to as part of the Deus Ex series. Prior knowledge to the Deus Ex series is not required to play Human Revolution, apart from a few nods and easter eggs to the original game, you can safely play Human Revolution without knowledge of the first. So how does Human Revolution stand on its own?Set in 2027, 25 years before the events of the first game, the world is on the brink of a human revolution. Augmentations, human enhancements that allow people to improve themselves through the use of cybernetic limbs, neuroenhancements bionic eyes. Humans are now able to improve themselves through augmentation technology, some simply using it to replace a lost leg or fading vision, while some augment themselves into super-humans, replacing their limbs with cybernetic ones, turning themselves into more machine than man. Multinational corporations now have more control over the people than their governments (sounds like the world today), from the rise of augmentation technology. But not all organizations support the notion of humanity reaching beyond their limits through augmentation technology.One one side there are those who see augmentation as the next step for humanity, allowing mankind to break free of their natural limits and using augmentation as the next step for human evolution. On the other side are the ""anti-aug"" or ""pro-human"" groups, who fear the ethics of augmentation, and the power it can give to augmented individuals, believing humanity should never have that power. Deus Ex: Human Revolution has done an excellent job of presenting the augmentation debate into a coherent and believable story. The game presents many overarching themes, such as the ethics of transhumanism, human survival, poverty, the power organizations have over people, and most importantly, questioning what it means to be human. It can sound all pretentious on paper, but Human Revolution at no point feels like it is trying to be more than it is not. Do humans lose part of themselves when they replace their limbs with cybernetic prosthetics, even when it may give them a better life? Is a person that is more machine than man still a human being? The game asks these questions but does not give any answers, instead allowing the player to form their own opinion.This cannot all have been done without the fantastic effort gone into the world building of Deus Ex. All characters you meet have something to say on the argument, whether they are for or against augmentation. You find newspapers scattered across the game, with stories ranging from anti-augmentation protests, a fully-augmented pop-star winning at an awards ceremony, the next games for the ""National Enhanced Hockey League."" You hear a husband and wife arguing with each other, upset that they no longer love each other because one had become augmented, less human in the others eyes. News reports coming from the television talk of U.N debates on whether to regulate augmentation. These are all such small details, but it makes the world of Deus Ex: Human Revolution so much more than just an open world to explore.You play as Adam Jensen, a private security officer for Sarif Industries, one of the worlds leading biotech corporations. After an attack on the company, Jensen is severely injured, forced to go through augmentations throughout his entire body to survive. Throughout the game, you can upgrade your augments through XP, which is awarded for completing quests, eliminating enemies, successfully hacking an object, finding hidden paths and areas or sneaking through an entire area undetected. The progression system is extremely well done, with all augments being extremely different from the other. There are several ""paths"" in which augmentations are categorized, namely ""combat,"" ""stealth,"" ""hacking,"" and ""social."" All of these offer different playstyles in which the player has the option of customizing as they please. Combat augments are as expected, allowing maximized armor, less weapon recoil. Stealth augments range from cloaking, to silent footsteps, to seeing enemies and objects through walls. Hacking augments allow players to hack doors, sentry turrents, cameras and robots, allowing players to find new hidden areas or potentially disabling/turning robots and turrents on the enemy. The social is the most interesting augment. and one that is extremely well done. Throughout the game, you can engage in ""dialogue battles,"" and ""boss conversations."" With the social augments, these allow you to see the personality of the person (Alpha, Beta, Omega), and a psychological profile listing that persons psychological traits and personality, which give hints to how the person may react to certain dialogue options. Using the information given and paying attention to the reactions of the person, you are able to ""win"" these dialogue battles.Level and art design is masterfully handled. You have several open hub areas, namely Detroit and Hengsha, where you can explore the city, get side-quests, find hidden areas and buy equipment from merchants. In both side-quests and the main story, you are given a free reign on how you wish to approach it and get from point A to B. All missions in the game have various direct and hidden routes, such as entering a guarded complex from the sewers below, approaching it straight from the front, or climbing the roof and entering from a neighboring building. This freedom allows all players, no matter what style of play they chose to make their own decisions on how to complete an objective, and one of the games best features. Art design in the game is aesthetically appropriate to the games cyberpunk theme. Both Detroit and Hengsha are filled by towering buildings with large electronic billboard advertisements, neon signs pointing to the nearest attractions, the slums and sewers below filled with the homeless and those who have chosen to reject augmentation. The black and gold hue of the game suits it well, being able to evoke the futuristic atmosphere of the game very well.Despite all this, there are a few flaws in Human Revolution that deserve mentioning. While the progression system is generally well done, it is a little imbalanced, favoring the ""stealth-hacker."" Throughout a level you can find pocket secretaries in drawers or hidden elsewhere, which often contain passcodes or passwords for computers in the level. However even with this information, the same result can be achieved by simply hacking into the computer or door, which can give both XP and cash/credits, while entering the passcode/password does not. Finding hidden paths and alternative routes to the objective is one of the main elements of the game and is one of the best, however it is unbalanced by the XP reward given by finding these areas. Finding a hidden area is always rewarded in giving 100-300 XP, a huge amount relative to the other alternatives. Lastly, the boss battles feel out of place, despite the Director's Cut allowing hacker oriented players to beat the bulletsponge bosses by hacking nearby computers to turn the robots against the enemy. That being said, these a minor aspects which do not detract from the larger game itself.Deus Ex: Human Revolution is one of the best games I have ever played. A must buy game for RPG, stealth and cyberpunk enthusiasts.			"

												A masterpiece Sci-fi at it's best !I played this game for the second time, the first time was the original and now the DC.I haven't noticed many changes, some little ones but still it was totally worth my time, this game is one of a kind, with very good gameplay and a story that keeps you itching to know more and more.I recommend this game to all people who love Sci-fi and stealth with a awesome story !PS: I replayed this game because of the release of Mankind Divided. Going to start Mankind Divided soon and hope it will live up my expectations, especially after playing Human Revolution.			"

												This game... oh wow. Talk about ""won over by a game""  or ""missing out for too long"".I did play the original Deus Ex wayyy back when, but for some reason I wasn't interested in the sequels, and didn't try them. And this one... I had heard good things about it, but for some reason, either some other game kept me busy, or I simply wasn't interested.Until now. Boy, did I miss out.StoryHR is IMO quite in the spirit of the original DE... there is stealth, but you can also try to fight openly. There are different methods of solving a situation, there are secrets, and...there is a great storyline.Indeed, the story is quite fascinating, and even though The Fall sucked, you might wanna consider reading ""The Icarus Effect"", a novel that is kinda set in between The Fall and HR (no spoilers though!)Anyway, so the story is rather deep, and there is a strong Mass Effect vibe to it all. You get sucked into it, and your answers in conversations do make a difference. If you want to, you can enhance yourself to be able to ""read"" people and manipulate them.StealthWhich leads me to one of the coolest parts about the game - the stealth approach. Stealth in this game works great, and it is so satisfying to sneak through a large area, dodging all enemies, not alerting them. If you fail, you can still fight openly or try to get away, so it's not as frustrating unless you really want to avoid being detected or killing anyone... if you wanna do that, it can be quite challening, but o so satisfying once you nail it.The augmentations can be very helpful, allowing you to fall from great heights, find alternative routes or even becoming invisible for a short time.The stealth-system, to me, was insanely fun. You can try to play this Rambo-Style, and I think that can be fun too, as the cover-system works well (IMO even better than in the more recent The Division), but to me, it was all about being a ghost.The Director's Cut makes quite a difference - because the boss battles now have new methods of winning them. In the past, before the DC, if you were fully specced and equipped for stealth, the boss fights felt pretty frustrating and not like fun. I mean, you spend 90% of the game trying to be sneaky, and then have to do an open fire-fight with a strong boss?Each boss has a method you can use if you are more into stealth or using tools (again, no spoilers). It doesn't make them totally trivial, as using those methods still can be tricky or risky. With the first boss, I didn't find the ""stealth method"" at first, and felt totally put off by that fight, until I experimented and suddenly found... again, no spoilers.Exploring and always looking for alternate routes (vents) will allow you to avoid most fights.GameplayControls work great (used a controller), but I did switch to a mouse for hacking. Hacking is a mini-game which is essential for the game, as it unlocks doors, shuts down security traps, unlocks secrets etc. Fortunately, it isn't that difficult (again, I found doing this with a mouse quicker and easier, compared to the controller), unless you wanna pick up special bonusses you get from nodes in the hacking grid... it's your choice.I recommend to save often, and use the quicksave (F5) a lot. If things go wrong, reload and retry.The AI is not incredibly smart, but it's decent, and I had fun taking the guys out with the stun gun.Graphics:The graphics ARE showing the age of the game a bit, but they're still decent and add a lot to the atmosphere.Music:Just great, nuff said.Pros:- Fun stealth system- Lots of optional methods to solve situations- Enhancements- Storyline/writing- The dialogue game- Alternate methods for bosses, especially the ""stealth solutions"" added in the DC-  Challenging, depending on your difficulty settings and your own goals (Non-lethal, stealth etc)- Lots of optional secrets and ""lore""- Atmosphere- Good performance even on older systemsCons:- Showing it's age a bit- A lot of running forth and back on rather small maps- Clunky management of the small inventory imo- If you pick up a weapon you already have, you only get the ammo. No way to pick up the wep and sell it for profit. Money isn't all tjhat essential, but allows you to buy more skillpoints, so if you're a packrat, this fact and the small inventory might be a downerVerdict:At full prize, 8.5 of 10, at anything between 5-10 EUR (sale) I give it a 9-9.5. Yes, it's showing its age and has some flaws, but the stealth, the story, atmosphere and protagonist make up for all of that IMO. It's really really good, and if you can't get into the much older DE because it feels a bit too old school, please consider giving this one a try. I love it.			"

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. The game allows you to choose many ways to achieve your goals and is filled with hidden areas. Usually, I am not interested in exploring a game completely, but with Deus Ex: HR I really wanted to read all emails, hack all doors and so on.Someone stated that the story in this game is ""too good"", and I really wondered how that could be. But now I agree; although the world in this game is much more technologically advanced than the current real world, most, if not all, things in this game could become real in the future. Combined with the smart dialogues and options therein, this makes the game great and engaging. Highly recommended to anyone who likes action or stealth games!			"

												This was my first Deus Ex Game, and at first it was kind of weird with all the clunky controls and graphics. But the story and the plot became really really good after the introduction and you get used to everything in the game. The story is absolutely amazing as you travel to different areas around the world and you actually get to feel a different world in the game. The moral of the game is also something that leaves you hanging on your thoughts about science and how far people will go on the quest for human augmentation. 10/10 for me, can't wait for Mankind Divided.Thanks to my friend Fine Night for gifting this to me!

												This is a solid stealth game ! [8,5/10]Gameplay : The level design, even in the bosses arenas, never fails to use most of your abilities and allows you not to go full frontal so the role playing elements are well integrated to the stealth formula. Graphics : This game aged well as it did not try to be too photorealistic, relying more on design than graphics.Story : The story is rich and intresting, going into details with an intresting lore for the ones willing to listen to bystanders, scavenge for mails of employees and notebooks in air ducts, but also a great story accessible just by going threw the game. In the end, it made themes proper to cyberpunk quite accessible to a broader audience, and that's something.			"

 Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut  The main character is Adam Jensen, head of security in the company Sarif Industries, which during the attack is badly wounded and is rescued thanks to the numerous operations and body modifications. The gameplay is great and you can finish the game while killing everyone or completely anybody while passing near them. This production is brilliant, it offers a great story, a lot of nice and diffrent locations, incredible soundtrack and interesting characters. The game is definitely set to silent approach. Shooting using a guns is ok but it is not so cool. According to me, this is a brilliant title that offers a lot and is pretty well made stealth game. This title is a definitely worth of our time. "

Posted: November 8, 2014
												I find myself having a little bit of trouble on whether I would recommend this game or not, although this is definitely not a bad game by any measure, I just don't quite see how it is as good as the ratings, and other reviews seem to indicate. (See the bottom of this review for a TL;DR) So, I will attempt to give as unbiased an opinion of this game as I can, by category to make it easier.First is the gameplay: I have to say that the gameplay is good in the fact that is offers you an array of options to choose from with any given situation, you can either go in all guns blazing, or go sneaking around all stealthy, or find a balance between those 2 styles. I liked the fact it gave you the freedom in this regard. However, to be honest, I just didn't really find the combat particularly fun, I'm not quite sure why, perhaps it was the whole switching out between first and third person shooters that did it. Unlike other games, I never really felt like a badass while taking bad guys down, and I felt the combat is a little unforgiving (I was playing on normal difficulty) but given that stealth is an option that is acceptable because otherwise the stealth approach would be a little less inviting. In terms of how the stealth mechanics play out, I thought they were quite well executed, when you keep your wits about you, you can slowly, but surely make your way past pretty large groups of bad guys, but if you trip up you may find yourself forced into a fire-fight, but that is how a stealth game should be, so that is not a problem. Additionally, I thought the hacking mini-game was extremely well done, unlike many hacking mini-games (such as Mass Effect 1 or 2) it is not tedious and boring and you enter into it thinking ""uh...better hack this damn terminal..."" The hacking mini-game in Deus Ex requires some planning, strategy and quick thinking, the hacking mechanic was masterfully implemented. Player Progression: Player progression is pretty good in this game, without going into any spoilers, you get xp points in which you can upgrade both passive, and active abilities at a reasonably regular basis, you can also buy xp for credits at certain stores. the game has a pretty extensive amount of upgrades and I think you would be hard pressed to upgrade all your abilities by the end of the game, this is good because it forces you to make decisions on prioritising upgrades for what your play-style is, for example: do I upgrade my stealth vision or do I give myself more armour? However, the amount of xp you get is not too prohibitive, you don't get so little xp you are forced to do go down one tree and you are stuck there, you can branch out over several ability trees to suit your style, just not all of them. The game seems to have plenty of weapons and items, and introduces them at a rather nice pace, you don't get 1/3rd of the way through the game and find you have already unlocked all the guns like some games, you get new guns right up until the end. In terms of purchasing equipment, it's a pretty standard RPG kind of set up; you do quests, loot various things, sell items off at stores, you get credits for it, you can then buy various upgrades, ammo and weapons at stores. Stores...*shudder* i'll open that bag of worms later in thie review. Interface and Navigation: This games interface is quite nice, it has a nice high-tech feel to it and is rather well done, apart from one aspect, Navigation. The navigation in this game is horrible, although you have a map, it is never really useful for telling you where to go, the map is made up of un-detailed blocks that don't show you anything of the terrain or buildings in the area, so you don't know where to go to get to where the quest marker is. Remember that can of worms about shops I mentioned earlier? yea, here it is, sure, this game has shops, but they are NEVER marked on your map, you can only find them by remembering where they are, and given how useless the map is, and how the city hubs all look quite similar, it's damn tricky to remember, it also gives you no indicators as to where other points of interest are, such as your apartment. Sound design and soundtrack: I know not everyone is as concerned with these two things as I am, but for those few who are; the actual sounds in this games sound design seemed pretty good, but they always seemed somewhat delayed by a few miliseconds, like, I would fire my gun, but it didn't quite match up with the muzzle flashes, perhaps it was just my imagination, or perhaps not. The soundtrack for this game served its purpose, it created the desired atmosphere, so I guess thats a plus, but it didn't really do much more than that. The soundtrack isn't bad but don't expect any amazingly epic soundtrack orchestrated moments. Plot: Now, plot is a big part of this game. It's hard for me to be to critical of this games plot because, I can't really find anything wrong with it...but at the same time, I just didn't really find it all that engaging. It has everything one wants from a plot, a good concept, decent lore and an interesting world in which it is based in, some good plot twists, revelations...but...it just never seemed to get me particularly engaged in it, sure, there were a few moments where I was like :o but only a few. In all truth though, now that I think of it, there isn't anything wrong with the plot, but the characters. The characters all seems so two-dimensional, even the character you play as seems like he has no personality at all, he just seems like a bit of a robot, I guess, perhaps if that's how you wan't your character to be thats great, but I don't. I personally don't like his voice actor, he seems like he's trying to do some kind of forced batman voice most of the time, and he never shows any expression or emotion in his voice, there was only one point in the game where the character actually had any kind of decent voice acting. As for the other characters, the only one I came remotely attached to was the chick who flys you around in a helicopter, at least she had a little bit of personality. As for villains, they seem a little basic and somewhat generic for villains, theres nothing about them that really makes you think ""gee...that guy actually has a point?...is he/she really the villain I have been led to believe?"" Perhaps I have just been spoiled by the characters from games like Mass Effect and Starcraft II, but I just didn't really connect with any of them. Graphics: For a 2011 game, they seem about what you would expect, nothing really good or bad about them. Bugs/Issues: I did have issues with my screen flickering white until I turned the game to direct X 9 rather than using 11, which is somewhat unfortunate because I would have liked to get the benefits of using DX11. I also got low frame-rates in few-second bursts every now and then, and my system can more than handle this game. I have a hunch that you probably are safe from the screen flickering issue on an AMD graphics card, given that this game seems to be optimized for it, but it should still run fine on any Nvidia card. All in all (A TL;DR/Summary): This is a decent game with a few different gameplay styles to choose from, it has pretty standard and character progression that is neat in the fact that it forces you to chose a play-style. it has pretty standard sound design and soundtrack. It has a nice interface but has terrible navigation. It has a very interesting world in which it is based and an intruiging plot, but is let down by rather two-dimensional characters. My final verdict: Do I recommend this game? well...it honestly depends on the price, and the full $19.99 listed here, I would have to say no, however If it is on special, say $10.00 or under It might be worth picking up, if nothing more I will keep you occupied for a good 20-30 hours. Hopefully you find this review useful :)			"

												*Note I have over 80 hours logged on the normal Deus Ex: Human Revolution.Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a phenomenal game.  Human Revolution takes place in 2027 and is a prequel to the original Deus Ex.  Playing the original is not required at all to understand the story, but I do suggest playing it simply because its a great game.  The story of Deus Ex: Human Revolution tackles the subject of Transhumanism in a way that really makes you think.  The subject matter is complex and is an issue that we will likely face in the not to distant future.  The gameplay is really solid but there is a lot of room for improvement.  The game gives you plenty of tools and lets you approach a situation however you like.  However the game favors certain types of play styles more than others.  Playing stealthy and taking everyone out non-lethally will give you the most XP, which means you can get more upgrades.  You can upgrade Jensen with praxis kits.  You get these praxis kits by getting enough XP or buy buying them in clinics.  There's plenty of stuff to upgrade but some of the augments you get are pretty useless.  For example ""Smart Vision"" allows you to see through walls.  Sounds pretty useful right?  It would be but the game has a Metal Gear Solid Style radar that lets you see enemies and their field of vision(with an upgrade) so it's actually pretty useless.  The only problem I had with the original HR was the boss fights.  Luckily the Boss fights have been fixed to an extent in the Directors Cut.  The PC port is good, no real problems except that tessellation can cause faces to be covered in white and black dots. Score: 9/10			"

												Well now that I unlocked every single achievement I can safely say that this is one amazing game!No matter if you like playing all out guns blazin' or take the stealthy approach, or even smooth talk your way past enemies, this game grants all these options and leaves the choice up to you!Furthermore, there's Always at least two ways to proceed; the level design is far from linear, more often than not you will find three different ways to cross the same courtyard utilizing the different abilities that you can acquire. The tactics aren't solely limited to the battlefield here but even to the choices you make when unlocking new abilities since those will determine how many possible options you will have at your fingertips when proceeding from point A to B.These days I rarely find a game that is even worth finishing but this... This is one hell of a ride from the beginning to the end and easily worth a second playthrough.			"

												This game is the epic of the epic! I feel that it is better than Metro 2033 and last light, Bioshock infinite. Meta score: 91 ! So many side quests, story rich! Profound Meaning! Funny jokes and e-mails! Easter eggs! Hiden acchievements. Many choices and decisions to make which will influence your later missions! Many ppl that u saved will help you in later missions, giving u credits (money) and Praxis points (skill points, perks) to upgrade ur Augmentations and weps. This is an AAA game needs you to think, not just kill la kill.. the more thinking in this game, the more you will remeber this game! Thinking also helps u to feel and remember the profound meaning of this game. Moreover u are not tied to the main quests, there are many side quests help you to explore the world and get to know your character and the epic story -- great freedom in this game. Edios used 3 years to create this game....Such a long time...for a single game... i feel deeply impressed!The Doge meme: so many secrets, such an epic story, how profound, very addictive, Mr. Jensen, Wow! IF YOU HAVE NOT BOUGHT THIS GAME AND PLAYED IT, I FEEL SORRY FOR U! JUST FEEL THE GREAT STORY! MATE!			"

												'I never asked for this.'This catchphrase - that even spread a meme - defintifly doesn't apply to this 'Director's Cut' for one of my favorite games of the last years. Mainly unsatisfied with the 'Missing Link' DLC being completly seperated from the main game, I looked forward for this complete package.With the integration of the 'Missing Link' DLC and some other small Pre-Purchase DLCs into the main game this would just have been a simple 'GOTY edition', but you get a bit more. Beside some better facial animations and the redsigned Boss fights you also get a full developer comentary for the whole game.This changes and additions combined with a big standard discount for owners of the original version (and 'Missing Link' DLC) on Steam make this a must have for everyone who plan to play this game again.To the game itself is not really much to say. The setting, the visual style and the sound/music are wonderful and make the world believable. The only negative point for me is the not real existant free decision in terms of ways to solve the problems/missions in the game (the stealth and hacking way gives you way more exp points). It is also sad, that the developers skipped the possibility to choose through the whole game if you prefer heavy augmentation or try to stay as mainly 'organic' ... meaning your way to deal with the changes 'You never asked for.'!

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a story-driven action adventure RPG, taking place in a cyberpunk future ruled by scientific breakthroughs and corporate greed. You play as Adam Jenson, an ex-cop turned fully-augmented head of security for one of the worldwide leading companies in technological advancement, Sarif Industries. You'll travel the globe, sneak into top-secret enemy facilities, and eventually unearth a conspiracy hidden to the public eye. Needless to say, the story of Human Revolution is very deep; the game deals heavily with themes regarding humanity, freedom, and limitation, and has you questioning the morality of scientific advancement in post-modern society. While it takes a while to set up an engaging story, the game keeps you playing based simply on its fascinating vision of the not-too-far-off future. The choices you encounter along the way effect the story in meaninful ways as well. In short, Human Revolution may not feature the most emotionally compelling story ever in a video game, but easily one of the most intriguing. Human Revolution can be completed in two differing ways; by sneaking past all your enemies stealthily, or going guns-blazing into every encounter. Because the level design is incredibly well done, both approaches are commendable. I usually prefer the stealthy approach, but only because it's more rewarding and has more features available. As you level up, you'll earn Praxis Kits, which  upgrade your augmentations. Let me just say that no game I've played has offered as many useful upgrades as are available here. The game also has a hacking element, which is basically a simple minigame. However, hacking also acts as one of the unsung approaches of Human Revolution; you can disable cameras, gain access to secret files, and even turn programmed turrets on your enemies. Enemy AI as well is usually pretty intelligent. Any time that I think I've been spotted while stealthing, enemies will most definitely have spotted me. Overall, the gameplay here is fairly well thought-out and challenging.Overall, Deus Ex is the cyberpunk game that I've always wanted, but never had the chance to play. While it's definitely built as a stealth title, players used to the combat approach will still have a fun time. The soundtrack might I add is also amazingly good. On a final note, the Director's Cut merely includes a DLC expansion into the main story, adding about an hour or two of additional gameplay, though it's still worth it. If you're into conspiracy-heavy plots, cyberpunk settings, or just a well-built stealth game, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is the ideal game for you.9/10 - Worth it at current asking price (Definitely get during a sale of you're not too sure how you'll enjoy the game).

												In the year 2027, mankind is about to enter a new era of self-propagated evolution. Technology that blends man and machine has allowed ""augmented"" humans to run faster, think quicker, grow stronger, and rise above their genetics to be the person they want to be -- provided they have a lot of money and don't mind requiring lifelong medication to ensure their bodies don't reject the enhancements.Oh, and they'll have to endure contempt from everybody who isn't like them, fear growing civil unrest, and live in a world rife with unchecked corporate power and corrupt political machinations.Yes, the world of Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a miserable one. However, you won't want it to end.Deus Ex: Human Revolution tells the story of Adam Jensen, head of security at Sarif Industries, an American corporation making huge strides in augmentation technology. However, not all of humanity is appreciative of Sarif's dabbling in human progress, and after a group of mercenaries attacks the company headquarters, Jensen is mortally wounded. He doesn't quite die, however, becoming both the beneficiary and victim of his own company's latest step forward in human modification. He returns to the world of the living better than he ever was, but that doesn't mean he has to be happy about it. After all, he never asked for this.Thus the scene is set for a game that travels around the world, weaving social commentary and philosophy on the nature of transhumanism throughout a tale that touches on corporate espionage, global conspiracy, and well-intentioned extremism. As well as living up to the sacred legacy kickstarted by the original Deus Ex, Human Revolution's narrative takes the very best of Metal Gear Solid, merrily pinches elements from Blade Runner, and adds its own unique blend of fascinating characters and satisfying plot twists. It is, in short, one of the most intriguingly written, thematically ambitious games I have ever played.In no small part does Human Revolution owe its narrative success to an absorbing atmosphere. This crapsack world, driven by stunning advances in technology but stifled by class conflict and growing social resentment, is an absolute joy to navigate despite being so utterly depressing. From the tightly designed action stages to the overwhelming hub maps, there's a consistency to the game's world that one only rarely sees, and everything from interactive newspapers, hacked emails and conversations between non-player characters creates a compelling ambiance for a world that is hard to want to leave. It's most certainly a world nobody in their right mind would ever want to live in, but it's an intoxicating place to visit.Human Revolution is mindful of the huge weight that the Deus Ex name carries, and I am thrilled to report that it lives up to the daunting demands that such a pedigree entails. As with the original classic, this is a game designed to let you play it your way, with a variety of upgradable augmentations to create an Adam Jensen that suits your personal idiom. Whether you want to be stealthy or aggressive, lethal or merciful, you have the tools to do the job. Combat is a unique blend of first-person and third-person gameplay, where forward-thinking and pragmatic actions are rewarded. While there is a run-and-gun option in the first-person perspective, such activity would be suicide. Even when one fully upgrades their ability to absorb damage, Jensen is far from immortal and will drop in seconds when exposed to gunfire. With a right-click (or shoulder button press), however, Jensen will stick to a wall and the camera will shift to a third-person perspective. This is not only crucial for stealthy play, it also gives a great vantage point in what can become a very intense cover-based shooter.Success in combat is determined by careful planning. Securing an exit should things go wrong, choosing (and changing) advantageous positions, and identifying which target to fire upon first, as well as which weapons to use, are crucial. This is not a game that just lets you open fire and trust in your reflexes; this is a game in which strategy is just as important as skill. Adam Jensen may be an augmented human, but he is still a human, and the game never lets you forget it.Stealth is simply superb, and players who wish to remain subtle will find that the game is perfectly tailored to their secret-agent fantasies. The third-person viewpoint in cover gives players an excellent view of the surrounding area and allows them to memorize enemy movement patterns without becoming exposed. Even with this benefit, however, stealth is no cakewalk. Enemies don't just march along patrol routes, oblivious to their surroundings. They love to intermittently walk backwards, or stop at crossroads in corridors to check all available directions.Whether players choose to be stealthy or violent, they will find that the ""Takedown"" ability is a lifesaver. When Adam gets close to an enemy, he can instantly neutralize him with a single keystroke. The camera will switch to third-person and Jensen will take down an opponent with a beautiful, empowering combat animation. Simply pressing the ""Q"" key will see Adam knock an enemy unconscious, whereas keeping it held will cause him to extend some vicious blades from his arm and put the poor victim away permanently. Do not think that this skill is a game-breaker, however. Adam can only perform takedowns if he has at least one full energy bar, and only the first bar ever recharges automatically. Hacking is by far one of the most essential elements of the game, and it's highly recommended that hack augmentations are equipped early. Not only does hacking net significant amounts of XP and cash, it also unlocks doors to vital equipment and plot-sensitive areas, rewards players with heaps of cool information and Easter eggs, and eliminates various security measures such as lasers, alarms, cameras and turrets.The only downside to the hacking is that various cool skills, such as the ability to control enemy turrets and robots, aren't all that useful. Their applicable uses in the game are minimal due to the limited number of computers that actually control such items, and the sheer effort it takes to reach them.Finally, we have the social gameplay. This aspect is presented as a variety of ""Social Boss Battles"" in which Jensen must verbally outwit an opponent in a debate. This represents one of the game's most accomplished innovations, and also its biggest missed opportunity. In short, these conversational fights are incredibly well done, with the player needing to anticipate which responses will work best against characters, using whatever they've learned about their personalities and how they react to Jensen's words. Each of these sequences is engaging and unique, just as accomplished as anything found in RPGs like Mass Effect.There's no question about Human Revolution's sheer volume of content. There's lots to see, even more to do, and multiple ways of enjoying both. While one could theoretically blast through Human Revolution in eight or ten hours, there's much, much more to be getting on with. City-based hub areas contain side quests that are as lengthy and intricate as any of the mandatory tasks. I managed to spend a whole five hours simply wandering around the Detroit hub, soaking in the sights, exploring every square inch, listening to enthralling NPC conversations, and beating all the quests.What truly impresses isn't so much the scale of the game, but its staggering consistency of quality. Every quest is a compelling story; every level is beautifully, ingeniously designed; and not once does the game ever become dull or lose its pacing.Deus Ex: Human Revolution, like its augmented hero, is a step above its mundane peers. With its flowing, open approach to mission structure, thoroughly engrossing story and gorgeous visuals, this is the kind of game that all others should strive to be.			"

												DXHR:DC is basically like paying for a patch, which is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in this day and age, but I would still recommend it to people who liked the original DX1 or the original DXHR. They've changed up the boss fights a bit so hackers and other nondirect combat characters have a way of winning (although there are still no non-lethal methods to deal with these bosses)The rumors that the devs restored a lot of cut content such as the Montreal and India hubs is simply not true, the only ""new"" game content is the merging of the missing link into the main game, so it's not a separate thing you run anymore. Your equipment will carry over after you finish, as well. Once you beat the game, there is a new game + mode that lets you keep all your augments (but I don't think there is any additional difficulty beyond what you choose, as I haven't ran into any yet)Overall I feel like it's a good buy and a bit of an improvement over the original, despite these fixes being something that could have just been released in a patch.

												Such a great game!!!It's hard to make a succes when you have so famous predecessor, but this game made it.Awesome stealth action RPG, with a very smart, well written and interesting story full of conspiracy.It's combination of classic shooter and Mass Effect, the combat system is great you can choose between direct violence if you enjoy  it or sneaking around and knocking down enemies.You are a killer, you are thief, you are a hacker, whatever you want to be..There is two type of weapons, lethal and non-leathel, so you can use weapon but you are not a killer.Game sets you in open world so you can free roam, you can investigate a bunch of places around,The main thing Human Revolution gets right is giving you options: every mission gives you a labyrinth of ways to get to your objective...Totally recommendation!!!

												Deus Ex, the game which shocked the FPS scene back in 2000 with it's innovative ideas. Eleven years later comes DX3, a game in a franchise I had never before played. I was pleasantly surprised how nice this game was. It's an Stealth/Action/RPG/FPS where you progress your character to get new abilities and usually have multiple ways to handle a situation. So you have plenty of options to choose from.You play as Adam Jensen who is head of security at this company and you will have an event that almost kills you. So you are turned into an augmented person inorder to survive. When augmented, you get different kinds of abilities that will help you along the way.I was not into RPGs prior to this game but I have always loved almost anythign Scifi and if you're anything of the sort, play this game. You will most likely get into RPGs a bit more like I did.Only negative side about this is the bossfights. There are couple of bossfights in this game and they feel somewhat out of place, since apparently in DX1 it was possible to entirely avoid them. Though supposebly this Directors Cut version of Human Revolution added bunch of additional ways to finish the bossfights (stealth, hacking..) among the normal ""fight to kill"" way.Recommended.			"

												Bwee. A re-release of the yummy DXHR from 2011. So what's new? To be perfectly honest, not very much. This is pretty much the same game we got then. I can only really list 3 notable changes: A slight alteration in the look of the game so it is less ""yellow"" than before, some new (mostly hacking related) options for the first 3 boss fights (the final one is still the same as before), and the merging of DXHR with it's DLC Missing Link. That's it. The boss fight one is probably the most notable, but truth be told since anyone with a brain maxes out their hacking skill very early on, this makes the boss fights alot easier since you can get turrets and robots to join in and lay on extra firepower. Namir in particular was hit by this because I got two robots to blow him away. A fight I used to have some difficulty with I breezed through with no trouble whatsoever. And yes, I was playing on Hard.There's also new game plus, but i've not checked that out yet. From what i've heard though, it simply lets you carry on your augments into a new game. As if you need to be more overpowered...So yeah. Not very different. The boss change is sorta nice, but that's just about it. If it wasn't for the fact that the base game is damn good as is, this wouldn't get a recommendation from me. But it's still good and still fun. Ultimately that's what matters. :D			"

												Deus Ex, what a wonderful game in the series. It's funny because I got this game for the xbox from Eidos themselves, my dad worked in the anti-piract business and I never beat it on there. Then, I bought the game again, for the PC, never beat it, AND then I bought the Director's Cut and I waited a whole 8 months to play it, and I recently beat itDeus Ex, is about a man named Adam Jensen, he's an ex-swat member, who is now a security guard for a big, augmentation corperation called Sarif Industries. In his line of work, he has two co-workers, Megan Reed, a scientist that has made a breakthrough in augmentations and Francis Pritchard, a computer person or whatever. Then, Sarif Industries was attacked by augmented spec ops, who kidnapped Megan and 4 other scientists. You were trying to save her, but in the process, you get gravely injured and have to get augmentations. After you get them, your mission is to find out what happened to Megan and her team and get them back.This game was crafted so well, the gameplay was fluid, a FPS shooter mixed with an RPG styled level up system. You put points into augments to upgrade and make better and upgrade the ones that better suit your play style. Stealth or go head on. Mine was going head on, I hate stealth. This game had a various amount of weapons, grenades, abilities, etc. All were different in their own ways. The quest system was quite, course directed, besides the one or two side missions in each mission location. The interaction with people was fun, you could get information out of them or you could just go up to them and knock them out. I like doing that. The DLC, Missing Link, comes with the Director's Cut, incorperated into the game, was absolutely horrible and was not needed. Who wants to know about the time he got all his augments stripped from him and he has to fight his way to get them back. It was really boring, a lot of running back and forth, and not to mention all the damn biometric scanners. I wish I could have chosen to play the DLC at the end. But, putting it, into the story, made somewhat of a difference. It does work well with the story, but honestly it wasn't what I was looking for in a Deus Ex DLC.I know this is a shorter review than normal but, I'm not really feeling well, but this game was a masterpiece, this is the only Deus Ex game I've ever played, but I plan to play The Invisible Wars. But, for now, I loved this game, I can't believe I never finished it. I beat the game in about 15 hours, plus watched all the endings. So I give this game a 9.5/10 :D			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is set in one of my favourite universe: the Cyberpunk universe, set in a near future where all is black and there is no more hope. Even if a lot of games use that universe, Deus Ex: Human revolution makes it look fresh and new. And this time you play as an overpowered Cyborg ex SWAT with bionic arms with bombs and swords in them! The story is set before the original Deus Ex, and just like his predecessor, Deus Ex: Human Revolution has an addicting story and you will immerse yourself in after only a few minutes of gameplay (at least for me). The game also has really good soundtracks that perfectly fits in the game.There are a multitude of lethal and non-lethal guns, rifle, shotguns, pistols etc.. that looks unique and different, and almost all the weapons can be upgraded with weapon mods. there is also a multitude of explosive weaponry such as RPGs, grenade launchers, grenades and remote explosives. Or you can go with the takedowns, which allows you to kill or knock out an enemy when close to them. And you can also hide their bodies afterwards. There is also a small hacking mini-game which allows the character to hack multiple electronic items such as keypads and computers. There is also a persuasion mini-game which allows the character to persuade other characters to do special favors which can unlock other side missions. The mini-game are fun to do and are not overused.The game is an action based game mixed with stealth with multiple choices of mission completion. The game takes about 20h to complete and there are multiple side quest at certain points in the game. The missions are all unique and mixed with multiple choices of gameplay which adds variation to the game.There are multiple augmentations for the character to acquire, almost all of them are varied and creative. per example, you have one that allows your character to see through walls, or another one that allows you to deploy multiple small bombs that instantly kills all the enemies around you which make you feel like a total badass. The game also has a lot of Unique NPCs, bosses and enemies to encounter all included with Robots and Cyborgs.With the Director's Cut, the game now has a New Game+, Which allows the character to carry over his augmentations in a new game, which is really awesome. The Director's Cut also added the DLC: The Missing Link in the game instead of making a separate game like in the original Deus Ex: Human Revolution, which makes it feel more natural. There is also multiple small additions and tweaks added in the game.However the game has its flaws, first of all, the character isn't that powerful at the beginning of the game. The new body of the character uses energy, so some equipment that the character has such as the invisibility cloak, the advance vision or the sound suppressor will use energy, which makes sense, and the character can regain energy over time or by eating food or vitamins, but the thing is that energy is also used when doing a takedown, so your going to end up waiting 30 second for your energy to fill up just because you punched a guy in the face to knock him out, which is kind of pathetic for a Cyborg ex SWAT. But the character can acquire augmentations that will give him more energy and that will make the energy fill up faster, which allows him to do multiple takedowns before using all of the energy available.The game has no Multiplayer, which would have been awesome, but the game makes it up with its awesome Singleplayer.  Also, any save of the original Deus Ex: Human Revolution won't carry to the director's Cut version. Forcing you to start alll over again.You will need to buy the game again if you already bought the original Deus Ex: Human Revolution once in order to have all the bonuses that the Director's Cut offers, so you are going to end up with the original game, the separate DLC, and the Director's Cut version with the game and the DLC combined, which is kind of pointless.The Goods:+ You're a Cyborg, nothing more to say!+ Unique and creative augmentations for your character.+ Now with New Game plus, which allows the character to carry his augmentations to a new game.+ Improved textures over the original Deus Ex: Human Revolution+ Now with the developer commentaries.+ Reworked bosses over the original Deus Ex: Human Revolution.+ Addictive storyline.+ Good soundtrack+ Fun and varied missions.+ Unique and different NPCs and enemies.The bads:- Loses energy when doing takedowns.- End up with three games if you already bought the original one and the separated DLC.- No multiplayer.- Any save of the original Deus Ex: Human Revolution won't carry to the director's Cut version.I recommend it if you're a fan of the Cyberpunk universe, and the action stealth type of game if you haven't already bought the original one with the separated DLC, or if you simply want the small additions and tweaks that the Director's Cut version offers.Final Verdict:9/10.Must Own!

												If you liked the first Deus Ex you will definitely love Human Revolution. Acting as a prequel to the first game in the series and taking obvious inspiration from classic cyberpunk movies like RoboCop, you play as ex-SWAT Adam Jensen who ends up unraveling a conspiracy behind the death of a team of scientists that were on the brink of revealing one of the biggest breakthroughs in science yet, one that could potentially merge man and machine for good. Though little does he know that his trip down the proverbial rabbithole has barely begun.The game is very much a seamless blend of stealth and action and like the first game leaves how you play the game entirely up to the player. You can sneak your way in, you can hack your way in or hell, grab a gun and kill everyone in your path. It's all up to you.I highly recommend checking out the Director's Cut if you're a big fan of Human Revolution or haven't played it yet. The added developer commentary, DLC integration, and not to mention the improved boss fights makes this the definitive version of the game in my opinion. The boss fights was one of the biggest gripes with the game and this version adds far more tactical options to them for players who use different playstyles. It also helps that the graphics look far better in this version since the yellow filter is more toned down allowing for more colour variation. I also wanna mention the addition of a New Game+ mode that makes replaying the game on harder difficulties a bit more fun and achievable.			"

												This game is one of the greatest games ever.Deep story, nice dialogues, good graphics, awesome level design and atmosphere music.THIS is the ""Directors Cut"" it includes the DLC ""The Missing Link"". The DLC is bound into the game story, so there is no ""DLC"" button in the main menu, you will play the DLC when the story comes to it.Also there is a Documentation included which is around 40 minutes long. And explains very much how the game was developed. Which difficulties and such.And you ALSO get ""Developer Commentaries"" like in the games from ""Valve"". You can optionally activate them in the options. So in the game world are now the commentaries and you can listen to them.Deus Ex: Human Revolution gives you nearly always a chance how to handle situations. You can kill everyone, you can stun them or you sneak. And in dialogues you have also chances how to react, angry, nice... like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also how you handle some missions can affect the line of the story, not completly but some dialogues and such are changing.It's a RPG game with a cyberpunk setting. The RPG aspect is really great. Besides your inventory you also have ""Augmentations"" which gives you bonuses, like you don't make any noise when you walk, or you are invisible for a few secs, knocking 2 enemies unconscious instead of only 1, you can hack more computers and security systems, jump heigher, sprint longer and much much more.But you don't have all these upgrades from the start, you need to earn them with ""Praxispoints"" you get them if you search the enviroment for ""Praxiskits"" or when you have enough XP. You get XP when you kill an enemie, knock him unconscious or just exploring the enviroment, as well when you complete mission targets.There is no ""Level"" system like in other RPG games, also the XP limit you need to earn an another praxis point is always constant.Anyway, one of the greatest games i ever played. Just buy it and play it. I currently playing it for a second time through, there is much to explore and it still makes fun, until now i played 37 hours. Really even when you straight run through it you need a minimum of like 12-14 hours.			"

Worth it but far from perfectIt took me 33 hours to finish and I took my time exploring. I played it in the course of 3 months since I didn't feel engaged enough. I do have some rants: Stealth guns don't have as many upgrades as regular weapons. It felt like the game treated them as toys; Stealth ammo is really hard to come by, while regular ammo is abundant; Boss fights are much harder if you make a stealthy build; The Pacifist upgrade: You get it by not killing anyone throughout the game, except for bosses. I didn't get it even thoughI can't remember conciently killing a target. It's sad because the game is so long and I had no feedback at the time so I could return to a previous save; The ship part is really frustrating: You're stripped of all your upgrades and have to escape captivity. After a while you regain some of them, I'd say 30%. At the end of the arc you regain all of your upgrades, but still I felt it was a poor game design choice; The last part is also messed up: You're supposed to find Taggart and Sarif and talk to them, but there's no indication on the map of where they are and the place is full of 'zombies'. I didn't want to kill any of them, so searching was really obnoxious. I had to resort to an online video to find Taggart because I was so fed up; Energy recharges only to 2/5 batteries over time. If you want more than that you need to eat energy bars and whatnot; The voice acting for the main character reminded me of Keanu Reeves but not in a good way. It's so monotone and flat it makes Kristen Stewart's face look like the magnum opus of human expression.It wasn't enough to stop me though.I got it a long time ago on a sale on one of those Humble Bundles, so I don't remember how much I paid for it.

												Режиссерское переиздание одноименной игры 2011 года. Начну с главного-все DLC были встроены в игру. Тоесть в начале игры вы не получаете стартового набора предметов включая деньги. Все это разбросано по всей игре, или же можно это купить. Так называемое ""Недостающее звено"" было благополучно портировано и стало ""Достающим звеном"". Кто-то говорит что был убран золотой фильтр, лично я этого особо не заметил. Ну и ладно, он придает игре свой шарм!Согласно заявлению разработчиков, в игре был улучшен ИИ и стелс. Да, сие действительно есть, теперь нельзя нагло выглянуть на мгновение, чтобы враг не встревожился, а в особых случаях не ""спалил"", ну если только он на вас не смотрит. Добавлена вариативность убийств боссов-теперь их можно уничтожить используя окружающую обстановку не используя оружие.Оценка: великолепно 9,5/ 10, за великолепный геймплей и сюжет, за отсутсвие ""великого и могучего"".

												In Deus Ex, Johnny is like half-robot, which makes Johnny super strong and super pretty.“I am Johnny Bravo, the one-man army!”Now say it with me, “hoo ha hooah!”Also, Johnny learned the importance of vents.  Vents are as important as Johnny’s hair, and Johnny doesn’t need to tell you how important that is. Well, let me tell you how important it is. It makes Johnny, pretty. Hair = Vent  "

												I FREAKIN love the Deus Ex franchise and who can blame me? It revolutionized gaming as a whole especially FPS games and action RPG's. Naturally when I came into Deus Ex Human Revolution(which will now be referred to as DXHR because it's just way easier) I had a lot of expections and I'm happy to tell you all that the game delivered! The game takes an ""have it your way"" style approach with the diverse skill tree it gives you which is basically activating your cyborg augmentations(I get to that once I get to the story)giving you many challenging situations and even more ways to complete them. Are you the kind of guy who likes to go into battle guns blazing? Well then you should pick up the dermal armor and recoil reduce upgrades! Perhaps you would rather take a stealth approach, or you just want to hack a few security turrets to kill off your enemies for you, or even just punch a whole in a wall or climb through an airduct to avoid confrontation all together. This is one of the games biggest strenghts and what makes it all the more better is the fact that the developers put a ton of thought into level design and teach you the rules of the game very well that if you can think of a way to overcome obstacles there is a %99.99 chance that it could work should you execute your plan effectivley. Now right now I'm sure any of you who haven't played the game are drawing comparisons to another great ""have it your way"" kind of game, Skyrim. Well the key difference is that Skyrim focuses more on where you want to explore(it is open world after all) but doesn't provide to extreme variety in play styles or how you choose to play that kind of style. What I mean is that in DXHR you can be a very stealth oriented player, but not be confined to that style of play because the skill tree is very friendly to players and allows you easy access to the basic skills required for any play style. This even carries over to the boss battles,unfortunatley non directors cut players will be very limited when it comes to how you take down a boss. Rather sadly though this doesn't mean the boss abttles are great. They are by no means bad or terrible, but they can be a little, how you say, confining. As I said before the Directors cut gives you more options when it comes to battleing bosses. By that I mean it gives you 1 more option when in most other scenarios there are several options to take down the baddies. Not to mention I found the boss battles to be boring and kind of pointless other than being used for the story of course. I think I've spent enough time on gameplay at this point, how about we turn our attention to story?              DXHR packs an impressive story about Adam Jensen, Head of security for the BioAugmentation company Sarif Industries who used to be S.W.A.T but quit after being given a questionable order. He soon finds Sarif under attack by heavily augmented mercenaries who leave him for dead after brutally attacking him and scientist in one of Sarifs labs. He miracously survived at the cost of getting heavily augmented over the course of about 6 months I believe. This gives him access to every upgrade in the game, but his body needed time to naturally turn them one one at a time unlocking praxis points to spend on said augmentations as you gain expierence by completing quest, killing enemies ect. From here you follow several leads to find the mercenaries and where they fit in the bigger picture which takes you to places like, Detroit, China, and Montreal to name a few. There are also a lot of moral decisions to make through the story especially at the end giving you three tough options to choose between. Another nifty feature is conversations with branching dialouge options that actually have an effect on the game. For example early on in the game you are tasked with getting to a morgue in the local precicnt. You have the option of sneaking in, killing everyone(that strategy is not reccomended), or you can just talk the guard out to have him let you in. That's what I love about this game. It does so many interesting things with its gameplay that affect the story and vice versa. It makes the game unique and helps it to stand out from other games. In the end DXHR packs an impressive story into the mix too, but unfortunatley it doesn't show us the worts of it. When we hear about all of this gross things like harvesters who kidnap people to strip them of their augments and sell them we don't see that. It should have followed Blade Runners example and shown us everything. The last comment was made by Angry Joe in his review and I drew to the same conclusion and whole heartedly agree with what he said. Thankfully thought that is the only negative when it comes to the story.            As far is presentation goes the game looks and sounds fantastic. The soundtrack fits the futuristic theme quite well, the color palette consist mostly of gold and black, and the sound design in general all come together and fantastically emersed me into the games world. One small gripe I have with the graphics though is that facial animations are very stiff which doesn't do much for the wonderful looking game. Speaking of wonderful the backgrounds in the game look gorgeous and make the world all the more real. Also I forgot to mention voice acting so I'll do that now. All of the voice actors do an incredible job reading the scripteven Jensens voice actor although I found his voice to be a bit to raspy like Batmans but that is just a minor nitpick. Overall the game does incredibly well and stands up there is one of the best games I've played in a while which is why I'm glad to say Deus Ex Human Revolution earns an 8.5/10 it was worth the $60 dollar price line as it is but now that you can pick it up for $20 you'd be crazy not to pick it up.

												While playing through Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut, I noticed this is not like any other game I have played before. Its very unique with a very story-rich storyline that you won't forget. This game alows you to be a stealthy shadowy figure while doing the mission or you can be crazy and own everything and cause high chaos. Its totally up to you. I think the story line is right up there with BioShock, Dishonored and Half-Life + Half-Life 2. Very entertaining game. Oh yeah and make sure you save the game before you make a decision at the end of the game. This game has 4 very unique endings that you can experience. 10/10 would visit Saif Industries again.			"

												Best Cyberpunk experience ever. If you love Cyberpunk you will love this game. If there is any game that captures a truely dark, futuristic atmosphere, it is this game. I personally think this game and it's mind blowing music score should be the epitome of Cyberpunk games, seriously...  all jokes aside. If you want a Metal Gear Solid style game with Mass Effect style choice making and The Matrix / Ghost in the Shell style atmosphere, then this is the game. It has it's moments where it can be buggy, such as a ""flashing screen"" problem it had when I first started it, but if you disable tessallation in the games settings, or even switch to Direct X 9, it should stop. I even turned the graphics up all the way to full blast and suddenly the flashing screen problem was gone, so idk... it's weird. People said it's a Nvidia update that was causing it. It's not that big of a deal to the point where I'd quit the game. You have to give this game a chance!			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution has made me a fan of the franchise.One of the greatest things about the game is the augmentations. You can pick your route and how you want to play the game through the augmentations. It doesn't penalize you for going straight into the fray or stealthing your way through missions. There's usually more than one way to accomplish a task and with that type of freedom I felt compelled to try everything. Nothing's more fun than walking around China slums causing havoc in their gangs or flexing on unsuspecting enemies.There's no black and white in Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and the end hinges on the player's choice. Even your interactions with the NPCs is affected by the player's choice. In the first mission as a newly augmented human being, Jensen is tasked to infiltrate Sarif Industries company and rescue the hostages. The SWAT team is put on hold so that he can go in and find a resolution. David Sarif gives you two options: Lethal, or non-lethal.In the end, it doesn't matter because Jensen comes equipped with enough moves to subdue opponents peacefully or lethally. However, your perception in the game will be determined how you handle these situations. Will you have Jensen murder all the terrorists to set an example? Will Jensen rescue the hostages or botch it up? Will you engage the terrorists leader at the end or talk him down? These choices will manifest as you play through the game and people's opinion of you will be set.These are the type of games I love because it gives you the freedom to choose. It may be a small thing, but it was enough for me to play through the game multiple times and in different ways.Like Deus Ex: Human Revolution, what will you choose to do after this review? "

												It's not often that I put together any sort of cohesive thoughts in any of my reviews, instead resorting to a ""GOOD OR BAD,"" similar to the way CNN runs the news.After playing this game for 22 straight hours, I can say that it comes highly reccomended as one of the best games in the past 10 years. Rock solid gameplay mechanics, deep progression and customization options, and a plethora of items and gameplay styles to suit any player.The game is definitely my favorite narrative experience in a game in the past year, and I could probably rank it in the leagues of Half-Life 2.

The amount of flexibility in the conversation system is pretty great and the voice acting is sufficient (though not stellar) and moves the story along just fine.So yes, I definitely reccomend this game to anyone who likes a good shooter, or a good stealth game, or any game with a good narrative.

												Be a diplomat, a brute or just avoid the hassle and crouch walk past everything. Deus Ex Human Revolution really lets you decide how you want to play. The Characters are well thought up, the world you play in feels alive, and the controls are very comfortable. The only cons I can think of are the rare crashes that can be fixed very easily and the 99 save limit. All in all the game is very much worth your time.			"

Did this on the Xbox 360, did this with the regular game, and now the Director's Cut.A perfect tribute to one of the greatest games of all time, you can approach problems and tasks from many different ways, sometimes stumbling across a hilarious or brilliant resolution accidentally. The world-building is excellent, and (most) voice acting is superb.The story is a glorious mix of classic Deus Ex with 'modern' sensibilities.

												Can't recommend this enough. I really love delving into this cyberpunk world of human enhancement technologies, mega-corporations, mysterious figures behind the curtains and conspiracy theories. It's definitely a game for the curious and explorative type and those who like some older game theory mechanics like limited inventory management. Playing this through with the developer's commentary has been a blast; It's been great to discover just how much love and care went into this game, the little details that people paying close attention could notice (some of which I did and some I had no clue about) all over the place - I absolutely love the philosophy of a game world telling the story, their philosophy of ""show, don't tell"". It's just such a shame that technical, resource and time constraints limited the vision of the developers because despite DEHR being an already good game, I would have loved to have seen that full vision. Definitely recommended.			"

												This is easily one of the best games I have ever played in my life. It wasn't perfect (due to some bugs and glitches here and there), but otherwise, it was pretty damn close. May contain one minor spoiler.The story itself was absolutely phenomenal. It was nice and deep, and explored a forbidden territory. Yeah, I suppose it can be a bit stereotypical where [Future Technology] is used by a government to militarize it and then [Religious] group/s riot and organize their own terrorist groups to fight it. We've seen it in many sci-fi games and movies. Regardless, the story was still very enjoyable and captivating, and it always kept me wanting more. I never skipped any of the cutscenes or cinematics, and I really liked the multiple endings at the end of the game. I also really enjoyed the side quests. They didn't contribute directly to the main story, but they showed how other people are being affected by it, such as certain girls being forced to get augmentations for their ""job"".As far as gameplay goes, it reminds me a lot of Mass Effect, because of the conversation system (it looked almost identical) as well as the cover system. That's not a bad thing, though. Both of those things work very well with this game and let you pursue three main types of gameplays (though you can alter them as you go): Ghost, Pacifist, and Rambo (as I refer to them). Regardless of what you choose, the gameplay mechanics work well, hardly there is ever an issue with them, and there is just so much you can do in the game, such as hack terminals, or convince people to spill information, or stay in cover and kill enemies without them ever knowing where you are. The possibilities of what you do in the game are virtually limitless. It even has an open-world map that is divided into sections, so you can always explore it as you wish without having to be confined to tiny areas and be forced to do the main story missions, which is always a bonus for me.The sound design was brilliant, too. The sound effects were decent, but the soundtrack was absolutely to die for. One of the best game soundtracks I have ever heard in my life. They never felt out of place; rather, they always complimented the gameplay, regardless of where you were, i.e. exploring the city, stuck in battle, watching a cinematic, or even just screwing around for fun. I will admit there were a few points where the soundtrack ""froze"" and was stuck in a tiny loop, but that was just a minor bug that was easily solved by just saving, restarting the game, and loading. A minor inconvenience, if you will.All in all, this game was absolutely amazing. I'd easily give it a 9/10. It's a shame about the few bugs and glitches here and there, but again, they are minor inconveniences, and if you overlook them, this game is easily one of the best sci-fi games ever to be made. I honestly want to see more games made like this.			"

												The Directors Cut's new Features are mainly only the new Bossfights and the Audio-Commentary. As a Fan the Audio-Commentary is pretty interesting and the Bossfights are like how they should have been in the first place.Other than that the Game is pretty much the same as the normal Game, except the DLC is already integrated. I guess it was worth the 3.99€ for the Upgrade, but I would not pay the Full-Price for it. If you don't have the Original Game just wait until the DC is on Sale for 75% off.			"

You'll say: tech-noir, grim future, dystopian world, cyborgs, augmentations, hackers and cyber-crimes, memorable characters, self-aware AI etc. Can all that stuff be perfectly combined in one title? You bet!Don't let the strict graphics and yellow fleur fool you: it's a real benchmark of the genre, with an engaging story, interesting open locations, great voice acting, excellent tactical combats, smart stealth and verily fantastic soundtrack.  Is Human Revolution as good as the original? Most likely. But it also has some elegant fresh notes of improvisation that makes this game absolutely real new classic of our age.

												Deus Ex is a cyberpunk-themed, action-adventure sci-fi game developed by Eidos. It is an FPS but shows our character from the third-person perspective once behind a cover. The game, thus, puts a lot of emphasis on stealth-based approach taking down enemies one by one without allowing them to see us. The more silent approach you pick the more experience point you obtain after a successful takedown, therefore, the easier to level up. Once at a new level you can spent your hard-earned Praxis points on various skills further enhancing your capabilities: you can learn taking down enemies by smashing through walls, you can run and jump almost silently or if you want you can just become invisible for a short period of time.There are two areas where Deux Ex shines:1) Story: You need to find out why Sarif Industries, the world's leading nanotechnology firm was attacked by an unknown group of mercenaries. You look for clues in Detroit and overseas in China, Singapore and even Australia. Each city offers a lot of side missions for you to further develop your skills and to get to know more of the story or just the world Deux Ex takes place in. It is common that you can make a decision as to how you want to accomplish a mission: if the requests are coming from more people you can decide who you'll favour eventually. There are collectibles in the form of e-books providing you with further background of the year 2027. 2) Gameplay: As mentioned, while running and gunning is also an option the game is best played by picking the silent approach: each section offers extra bonus if you do not eliminate anyone and if nobody sees you coming. I also liked the hacking sequences - I hacked each and every panel in the game even when Jensen was in possession of the code to unlock a specific door or to turn off the turrets aimed to protect a certain area.Now, the Director's Cut is a newer version and has been available for a while instead of the vanilla edition. It comes bundled with the game's DLC and offers some graphics and AI improvements. As you can see from the store page patches were released as the DR version suffered from some pretty annoying bugs. Personally, I did not encounter any of these and I liked how they changed the boss battles in favour of those who decided to remain silent assassins throughout the game. The Director's Cut employs more vivid colours - I can understand this irritates some people. We have some documentary videos, audio commentaries and the good old new game plus mode which is so famous nowadays.Overall, I was satisfied with Deus Ex and with the Director's Cut I completed the game 3 times. That's 3 times 30-35 hours if you complete all side-missions and talk to everybody and explore every corner just to see if there are some extra equipment or Praxis Kits lying around. What's more is that the game offers 4 endings but in order to be able to see all of them you need to complete a lot of missions in the last segment of the game.If you want a story-oriented, long-lasting cyberpunk experience then Deux Ex is for you. With the Director's Cut coupled with a discounted price you cannot make the wrong decision by purchasing Human Revolution.			"

												Truth to tell, DXHR is the most amazing stealth action game I've ever play.You play as Adam Jensen, most handsome game character ever made, that beard d'oh, makes me jealous.**BACK TO THE REVIEW**Personal Rating : ""Worth playing""Traditional Rating : 9.5/10Platform: PCGenre: Action FPS/StealthGameplay (9/10)Nothing beats this, first person combined with third person when you stealth-ing is work flawlessly. And things become more perfect since you can choose what style suits you best. Do you like stealth? sure to avoid camera and enemy, hacking into places, doing things unnoticed while taking down enemy one by one (and make a human pile with it). Or you love shooting enemy in the nuts and going uproar, the choose is yours.Story (10/10)Every. single. action you take have different outcome. You like to kill? it's fine, you like to save people? you can do it too, you want to make someone get busted? there's an option for it. and not to mention those option is only for single event.There's so many option you can do, from bragging, lowballing, anything. that makes you feel you're not tied to a single linear story. Different ending makes this game even more replay-ableCharacter, Sound, and Narrating (8/10)Sound effect absolutely awesome and well made. Meanwhile in every game you may skip every chit-chat because it's so boring, but not in DXHR, the character sub was very excellent, that you will sucked into and obviously don't want to skip it.Graphics (8.5/10)graphic is subjectively depend on the person and objectively depend on the system. but for myself, graphic was well made, characters detail was top notch. City landscape, ship, labs, and every other place, including elevator, totally awesome.TL;DRAWESOME STEALTH ACTION GAME, if you never try deus ex before, go for this game first. it sums up every other deus ex game to date.

												[EDIT FOR ALL POTENTIAL PLAYERS: These stuttering/performance issues seem to have been completely solved with a patch.]Probably the best stealth shooter I’ve played in the last decade.I have way more hours logged on this than Steam indicates, with 2 play-throughs on my old console. It's important to consider that this is not like the original 'Deus Ex', a story-heavy RPG. This is more a stealth action shooter with RPG elements. Decisions you make WILL influence how you have to go about things but the entire game doesn't rely on it. You will pretty much get to the same points as you would have done, it just about how you get there. Game-play is a great mix of stealth and action, with a large range of weapons, both lethal and non-lethal. The game offers many strategies you can follow in order to defeat enemies, you can either go in guns-blazing, which wastes really great stealth mechanics which are some of the best aspects of the game, or you can sneak pass or sneak up on enemies. The latter is much more fun, as the game rewards you for dealing with a situation with discretion (e.g. non-lethal, stealth), where as just shooting everyone up can actually prove quite difficult.The visuals and soundtrack are beyond amazing, it’s so rare now-a-days to find a game with a truly unique style and atmosphere that flows throughout the entire game.If there is one area where this game falls slightly short, it’s the mechanics. On the whole, there decent, guard move where they are supposed to move, all fine. But the A.I can act a little dodgy, with enemies not noticing quite obvious movements, but it rarely crops up when playing the game and doesn’t tend to affect the stealth system at all. The gun mechanics are also somewhat clunky, but they are fine after you get used to them.The story is great, following the life of Adam Jensen, Sarif Head of Security, after an incident at their HQ. Jensen is effectively killed in the attack but is “saved” by his boss, David Sarif, by being pumped full of power augments, some necessary to his survival... some not so much. I’ll leave it there so not to spoil anything, but if you’ve played the original Deus Ex games you’ll notice a number of links.A word of warning though, the Director's Cut Edition which solved perhaps the only real problem with this title, the boss battles, does up the specs and will require a better system than the original. Don't let that put you off though, you can always just drop the graphics a bit when you load up and you should be fine. There have also been a few reports of slight stuttering on the Director's Cut version (which I think steam forces you to buy now) but many fixes are available online, all of which helped me. [EDIT: These issues appear to have been patched out, but again, many fixes also exist online]If worse comes to worst and you are worried about if this will run on your specs, you can always pick up a hard copy of the original which is still excellent.

												Des Ex is back and here to stick around. Blending old elements from the previous games and intergrading new ones makes a perfect blend of fun, smart, 1st person, 3rd person and interesting gameplay. With outstanding visuals and a soundtrack that does it thrilling justice. This game is set in the future where corporate greed and the illuminati control the world. You play the head security detail named Adam Jenson as you try to uncover the truth of augmentations, politics, and who is really on your side. Multiple ways to play and go through the game give it amazing replay value. Your choices actually effect the world and can impact many missions and dialouge. If you are looking for a chilling story, amazing soundtrack, and a game that actually makes you think this is a must buy.Final Score 9.25/10			"

												Story: A+Gameplay: B+The story is excellent and thought provoking. The Directors Cut includes the controversial Missing Link DLC. I think the extra plot information added by the Missing Link DLC is important, and the level layout is very good, but the transition mechanic they decided to use (you automatically get captured and lose most of your augmentation points until finishing the DLC) was kind of a cheap cop-out from the designers. Players invest alot of time building up their character and taking all that progression away, even temporarily, is frustrating for a player.However you do get your augmentation points and other gear back after you finish Missing Link, and the story added by it is important, and thought provoking.The game is definitely worth getting, just be sure to focus on the excellent story when you're playing Missing Link DLC and remember the pain of losing your augs will be temporary.

The music of the game is also unique and beautiful, especially ""Icarus"" wow, it's sounds like a soundtrack to a epic movie. And last but not least.. ADAM JENSENS IS ♥♥♥♥ING BADASS LIKE COME ON, HES LIKE THE FUTURE AUGMENTED VERSION OF CHUCK NORRIS DAMN. If you are a big fan of sci fi or cyberpunk and if you're looking after a game with a incredible good story, then don't miss this game out, give it a try, Deus Ex Human Revolution delivers it all.

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution, a prologue to the first Deus Ex, and a masterpiece indeed. It retains all the elements that made the Deus Ex franchise captivating and interesting, such as: multiple choices, first person combat, an augmentation talent tree and stealth. The game itself is very atmospheric and the environment is great. The soundtrack adds up to the future setting of the game and creates a whole new ambient and vibe for the player. However, the voice acting can be sometimes dull, being a fan of voice acting in every game, I can say that this particular one is rather questionable. In terms of gameplay, Deus Ex: Human Revolution has done it's job, it's smooth, challenging and you need to act fast in every situation.To top it off, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a step forward for the cyberpunk RPG genre. Hopefully, we'll some more in the future.			"

												My favorite game of all time. Just... wow. Where to begin?Well, the basic premise of the game is that you take the roll of Adam Jensen: an ex-cop and current security manager of Sarif Industries, a leading developer of controversial augmentations, which allow a person to be genetically and mechanically enhanced in almost any way possible. You are witness to a massacre and mysterious raid on a Sarif Plant where he and his girlfriend work, and you search to find out what happened, and where the scientists and Megan, your girlfriend, have gone, if they are even still alive. And as you go on, encountering key players in the government, augmentation industry, and military powers, the conspiracy grows deeper, starting to reveal a darker intent that expands into almost every facet of human society.Needless to say, the story is phenomenal: with gameplay and conversation based-choices that impact how the story progresses, and what others think of you, this game lets you play it the way YOU want to, not just as some on-rails shooter like Call of Duty, both based on Story and Gameplay. This game will make you think, not just about how to approach obstacles, but about what is 'right and wrong' in how humanity must evolve, what actually makes us human? How far must we go to get what we want, even if others might get hurt in the process, and more.Specifically about the gameplay: you can play this game, much like the original, in just about any way imaginable. Lethally or non-lethally, stealthily or guns-blazing, or even solving problems without having to knock anyone out or killing anyone, just by proper communication through the persuasion of who you are talking to. Outnumbered and outgunned, you can use many routes to accomplish your goal, using vents, moving heavy objects, back alleys, even hacking computer terminals to open doors, disable cameras, and turn turrets and robots off OR against your enemies. There are a variety of weapons and tools, from standard weaponry like pistols and rifles, to laser weaponry and even non-lethal guns like the Tranquilizer Rifle and Stun Gun. Each weapon can be upgraded through weapon mods you buy and find hidden in levels, and also, just about every aspect of your character can be upgraded: from health, to shooting, even hacking and taking out multiple enemies with melee attacks.Put into simple words: this game is played how YOU want to play it, performing actions and making choices based on your preferences of playstyle and even ethics. You do what you feel is right, and what you feel needs to be done to reach your goal in a world full of risks, people who will lie, decieve, and manipulate, where conspiracies are abundant in a technologically advanced world, that shows that even with advances in the world around us, humanity itself will always face the same problems that they must overcome, in trying times of uncertainty.A instant classic that you simply NEED to play. Especially if it is on sale. This game is worth playing: it's a smart, sexy, classy FPS and RPG hybrid that nails the story, atmosphere, soundtrack, and gameplay in just about every way imaginable, and is my all-time favorite game that deserves to be experienced.

By far the best mix of Stealth, and problem solving shooter I've had the honor of playing through, multiple times.One does not even need to know the story of the previous games. Deus Ex: HR is an outstanding blend of sci-fi, with modern urban elements to make it relatable and all the more scary that the events could happen some time in the near future. The plot and dialouge are done so well, you can't help but want more once you get through the rough start.The weapons are convinient, the combat system is rewarding and not too easy, yet not too challenging.You cannot help but be immersed in this beautifully shaped, open world through the eyes of the protagonist. A ways into the game, you will begin to believe you are him as every decision you make has heavy impact.  Even after the game is completed, players feel compelled to play through again, re-experiencing the game like they had just bought it, discovering new secrets and hidden lore, all jampacked into this amazing gem of a game.I believe anyone of age, and interest level simply Must play this game through.

												This is a fantastic game, far better than I expected. Every situation has multiple ways of solving it. You can play as a pacifist stealth player, or you can mount an all-out assault. The augmentation system is well-done and gives you plenty of bad-*** moments.My only gripe is that the story is so-so. The overall theme is thought-provoking -- is the idea of human augmentation good or bad? -- but the writing itself is pretty cliche. We have big evil corporations, Illuminati, subplots within subplots ad infinitum, and so on. The actual gameplay is super-fun though and makes this a must-play game.			"

												I just finished the game. What to say. It was really cool game. I really liked the atmosphere of locations and music. Story is very interesting. Game is pretty long. It took me about 60 hours to complete but I played for pacifist achievement. Some people says that DC has a lot of bugs but I didnt noticed any of them. Game runs smooth and without any issues. It really deserves to be finished at least twice for different gameplay styles...""new game+"" will be interesting :) So I really recommend this game especially because it has all dlc including missing link which was made very well.

												Director's Cut is just an improvement to the other game, Although I don't think it's worth it to buy if you already have Deus Ex Human Revolution, but if you're new to it then this should be the one to go for.This allows for way more different types of playthroughs (including fighting the bosses differently!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!).And if it makes a difference it has The Missing Link DLC from the original Human Revolution Built in, so thats coolI still think this is one of the best games available right now if you're into Stealth/RPG/FPS and Not asking for things			"

												This game is freaking awesome, its and RPG with the option to kill or knock out enemies.  Besides that the story is amazing and one of the best I've ever played.  The animation is great and the maps force you to look for other ways around enemies and obstacles.  I definitely recommend it to anyone.			"

												9.91/10 - Perhaps the most intelligent, and inspiring game I have ever played.  By far the best mix of Stealth, and problem solving shooter I've had the honor of playing through, multiple times.One does not even need to know the story of the previous games. Deus Ex: HR is an outstanding blend of sci-fi, with modern urban elements to make it relatable and all the more scary that the events could happen some time in the near future. The plot and dialouge are done so well, you can't help but want more once you get through the rough start.The weapons are convinient, the combat system is rewarding and not too easy, yet not too challenging.You cannot help but be immersed in this beautifully shaped, open world through the eyes of the protagonist. A ways into the game, you will begin to believe you are him as every decision you make has heavy impact.  Even after the game is completed, players feel compelled to play through again, re-experiencing the game like they had just bought it, discovering new secrets and hidden lore, all jampacked into this amazing gem of a game.I believe anyone of age, and interest level simply Must play this game through. I've already purchased the PreOrder for the Sequal, I cannot wait!			"

												Best single player FPS games I have played since Half Life 2. Great RPG elements and a ton of different ways to approach missions/objectives. With a lot of games, I find myself losing interest and rushing through them to move on to the next game (on my ever increasing list of games to play). With Deus Ex HR I found myself not wanting it to end, but by the end I was satisfied. If you want to see everything the game has to offer, it will take 50+ hours to complete, and in my opinion, exploration is worth it, for the story, insight into the world and the rewards of cool stuff and bonus upgrade points to put into abilities.I wish that they would listen to the fans and do a modern day re-imagining of the first Deus Ex. If they kept it true to the original, I am sure it would sell very well and be critically acclaimed (again).			"

												Like its predecessors, this Deus Ex follows the story of an augmented man, trying to save Megan Reed, his girlfriend, who was kidnapped in front of him.	To begin with, this game can be played the way you want : you prefer to be sneaky, and bring down silently this guard with a cool cut-scene (you can either kill or knock out), or even sneak into a highly protected place without touching a guard? Sure, you can, and is in my opinion the funniest way to play this game. As a bonus, every bosses in this game can be killed/knocked out while staying in the shadows. This way, you can even finish the whole game without firing a single bullet.	Or maybe do you prefer those frontal assaults, doing ♥♥♥♥♥ons of noises and killing every enemies on your way ? Well, you also can, thanks to the complete arsenal at your disposition, rewarding every play style, such as sniping targets from afar, or going all-in with that heavy rifle, along with a couple mines/grenades.	Whichever play style you choose, the levels are incredibly detailed, and often full of computers you can hack to discover secrets, hidden doors, stories about the background of the game, or even mails telling you that this guy went to the bar with some friends some days ago, giving life to the characters, even the minor ones. Exploration will also be highly rewarded, such as giving you alternate ways to take care of the bosses, unlocking some side quests, or providing more information on your surroundings. Additionally, there are ALWAYS more than one way to do something.  For example, I especially loved the part where the prisoners and the scientist you had to save are being killed by the gas, and you are prompted to quickly choose between saving the scientist or the prisoners. Most players didn't realise that there is an other way, which is to find and destroy the hidden gas tank really fast (of course, the game doesn't tell you that such a possibility exist, neither where the gas tank is), rewarding you with help later in the plot. 	Also, it is important to say that your actions have consequences on the future of the game. Thus, if you let that guy live out of mercy he might come back to try to kill you once more. Or maybe will he help you, it's up to you to choose. 	To achieve your objectives, you will be able to choose from a wide number of augmentations, helping you jump higher, fall from any height, immunising you to gas, making you tougher, able to see through walls, or even changing you into a master hacker.	Finally, as usual in the Deus Ex's, the devs make the player doubt, making him question the morality of his actions, and also raising quite a lot of philosophical questions related to the development of the human race.	A major problem about this game is that if you actually explore every levels carefully and unlock these secrets, you will quickly realise how easy it is to gain experience to level up your augmentations, thus making you able to get every augs in one single playthrough, which is kinda game breaking. TL; DR: #buythisgame "

												This is my fourth playthrough of this game. Twice on the original and the rest in director's cut and there are still tons of things to explore. There are so many ways to play this game, and the choices you made in the game really matters. You can either go all gun blazing or play stealth or even sweet talk people to give you what you want. Each mission has so much replay values because you can always try a different approach. 10/10 for me, all time favourite.Oh and by the way, I never encountered any bug so far in this game.			"

The game also gives you a lot of freedom and includes very detailed environnements. It's also great that the Director's Cut includes the dlc, but personally I didn't find that it was as good as the main game.			"

												A fantastic stealth/action game that offers a great amount of replayability and enjoyment! While the weapons could use a bit more balancing and such (the shotgun doesn't do much for me), overall the game is very cohesive at least to me and I sunk plenty of hours into this one 100%ing it, and I even began doing a playthrough of it on my Youtube channel if anyone wants to check that out :) I highly recommend this one and can't wait for Mankind Divided!

												I love this game. It's a truly amazing experience, especially given that it was made in 2011 (and still holds up very well!).Graphics-wise, the game does show its age, but it doesn't take away from the experience in the slightest. Of course, certain textures won't have as much detail as we have become accustomed to, certain animations will appear slightly inhuman or other such events may appear, as they would with any older game. However, the artistic style of the visuals completely makes up for this, and I can still find myself easily immersed into the world of Deus Ex.  The level design and stealth mechanics make the game incredible to play, especially for a stealth enthusiast. Huge maps, with tiny details make the entire experience a nonstop adventure, with the constant search for the best path to infiltrate a given zone. The NPCs are also balanced, I didn't experience any seemingly omniscient demigods automatically knowing my exact position, and there weren't any deafblind ones either. Everything made sense.Now, to one of my favorite parts, the story. I prefer not to say much, as it is something best discovered on your own, but it is AMAZING. I had no idea what to expect, and despite that my expectations were blown out of the water. Nothing is rushed, everything makes sense (Along with unexpected twists), nothing is overlooked and everything is thought out perfectly. I could not recommend it enough, especially for those who love a good story or who are looking to play Mankind Divided.Finally, the music. Sends chills down my spine.I strongly recommend this game.

												Awesome single player game, a FPS/RPG hybrid with optional stealth game-play. The theme is hard sci-fi about human enhancements involving ethics, politics and corporations.I'm gonna be short and say that if you played any other Deus Ex before than you wont be disappointed! Knowing previous games i went for the pacifist achievement, which means stealth game-play (no kills) and i really enjoyed it! "

												This game is simply brilliant.The story starts out with Adam Jenson, a security officer, doing tours around his company's labs. Mercenaries strike without notice and steal some key technology regarding augments for the human body. Worst of all, a doctor that was leading the research is either dead or has disapeared with the attack. The story begins to get a lot more interesting and offers some serious ethical and moral issues behind merging the body with machines. I finished the game and from start to end there is no shortage interesting dialogue. The game play is simply stunning on this one. What I liked about this Deus Ex having played previous versions, is that they didn’t decide to completely forget what the old games looked like. Rather, they put in place a modernized version of what used to be without too much of the shiny glitter you see in newly developped games. What I absolutely love about this game is that the environment is able to be manipulated. There is always a direct course of action, but there will be options available to go around conflict VIA vents or ladders. Some quests will require the player to stack some barrels in order to climb them to jump over a fence. Some quests there will be enemies in your way and you’ll be comtemplating about throwing the dumpster you’re taking cover behind. To throw heavy objects such as the latter object mentioned, the player needs to upgrade Adam’s arms to be able to pick up such weight. Praxis points are upgrade points that allow this to happen. Not only can Adam’s arms be upgraded, his eyes for example can be upgraded to see enemies through walls or see where they are looking. His strength can be further upgraded to punch through walls (that are slightly cracked) to hurt an opponent on the other side. Other body parts can be upgraded but not simply for more strength, attack abilities can be added or movement abilities. Some upgrades require 1 point while some take 2. To fall from any height requires two points, but is a great ability to have when jumping off a ledge running from multiple enemies (or if your just impatient and would rather jump down ladders). That is only the start of what can be upgraded, and it is only the start of adding a new depth to the game. The one minor complaint I have is that there is a limited ability to melee. The player requires certain energy cells to be at full power before Adam can use his special abilities (such as punching through a wall, a silent kill or knockout, or an explosive ability). The same applies to a melee scenario. Unless you want to use all your upgrade points on power cells, stealth speed is definitely limited. It is a good idea but when it comes to having the option of a melee button, it isn't there which sucks when your under pressure. The game is a beautiful in it’s FPS/RPG elements, but they’ve added a third person element when it comes to taking cover. Pressing LT will put the camera over the shoulder of Adam and allow for a Gears of War shooting style. This is greatly appreciated as the player can quickly get overrun by enemies. If that’s not enough depth, they’ve added hacking features. This isn’t limited to hacking simple computers, camera’s, turret’s, heck even giant mechs can be hacked. It isn’t any boring hacking game either, the count-down timer and the art styles they chose to display the hacks can really make a player nervous when it comes to cut-throat last seconds. When not in a mission, the player is allowed to free roam and explore the area. Area’s can be tampered with and civilians or thugs (or even police) can be knocked out or killed. Once you do this though, that is it, you’ve made your bed and if anyone caught you, they may hate you for the rest of the game. There definitely is no shortage of game play here. Be careful in choosing when to use a gun as the game watches how you act morally (whether you kill or knock out opponents). The AI enemies also are quite brilliantly done. They will not go one dimension on you and attack from one spot, they will move around and often will try to ambush you from all sides. Really well done here. The player can choose to follow the main story line missions or choose to do side missions.The sounds are appropriate and the visuals are quite stunning. The setting the put the game is absolutely suits it. One minute you feel like your walking through a rich neighborhood and the next your looking at a gloomy sky from some sort of ghetto projects. The dialogue is excellent and the voice acting is far from cheap. The saving scheme was done absolutely right for this game. There is an auto save feature but there exists a saving feature where if you save it, that’s exactly where you’ll be loaded. If your in the midst of being shot, and like saving in a heated situation, by all means go for it. Even if you forget to save the auto save has your back ! I wish every game had this. The menus are all neatly organized and easy to navigate. This game absolutely nailed it when it came to interface. I would absolutely recommend this game on sale or not. I wish that they made an online multiplayer mode and would be something to work on for future Deus Ex games. Heck, even local coop would add a lot of re playability here. I would love to see them keep this sort of concept when making the next one, but I wouldn’t mind a few surprises. The environment can be manipulated and at times broken but I’d like to see real world elements of where if a explosive goes off, I’d like to see a few walls or floors rip. RATING : 8.2/10Gameplay A- Story / Campaign A Visuals / User Interface B+ Sounds / Music B+ Replay-ability B- Overall  B+ScreenShots : Visual screenshot. I used a controller the entire game but as shown below, you can easily switch to keyboard.

 TLDR VERDICTDE: HR is really the definitive Cyberpunk RPG of today, and I don’t see that changing until the already announced sequel, Mankind Divided, releases. That, or CD Projekt Red starts talking about Cyberpunk 2077 again. An absolute must buy on sale if you haven’t played it.FULL REVIEW BELOW“I never asked for this. If you want to make enemies, try to change something. The year is 2027. It is a time of great innovation and technological advancement. It is also a time of chaos and conspiracy. I don’t even know whose side I’m on.” – Adam JensenAdam Jensen is a retired SWAT specialist and current chief of security at Sarif industries, a leading biotechnology company that is in the business of human evolution. A sudden attack on the company’s Detroit laboratories leave Jensen all-but-dead and brought back from the brink through mechanical augmentations. Six months later, Jensen returns faster and stronger than ever to hunt down those responsible…This review is written from the perspective of a massive fan of stealth action games with an emphasis on multiple approaches to scenarios. Also a fan of story driven RPGs with ambiguous morality, however I have not played any previous Deus Ex games. It may also be worth mentioning that this was my favourite game of 2011.GAMEPLAY AND DESIGNDeus Ex: Human Revolution is… well it’s whatever you want it to be. It can be a cover-based third person shooter, a first-person shooter, a violent stealth action game, a silent ghost stealth game or some sort of weird amalgamation of all of those things. The level design is absolutely stellar and accommodates all of the options listed above. The game gives you a start point, an end point and lets you figure out how you want to get there yourself. It’s down to you to investigate all the hidden nooks and crannies for that air vent or item stash and exploration and player intelligence is definitely rewarded. You get the option on how to approach combat too. Naturally, murder grants the most options and non-lethal or complete pacifism limit you more for an increased challenge. It still feels rewarding to have traversed a level without anyone knowing you there until after the fact, similarly to Hitman.Unfortunately, some players may feel limited despite the number of options, due to the nature of the character progression system. Jensen starts the game with a fraction of the augmentations he is supposed to have, requiring you to “turn on” the rest of them over the course of the game. These grant pretty cool bonuses that suit various playstyles like better armour for gunfights or seeing through walls for stealth. Unfortunately, these upgrades are tied to an XP system where you get a point every time you level up. Non-lethal and stealth playstyles are rewarded with more XP than loud and lethal playstyles. This can make players feel pressured to do everything stealthy just to keep up with upgrades even if they may not want to.The boss fights were also a pretty big gripe for a lot of people playing this game when it originally came out. They broke up the narrative as the player was force to kill them, meaning those focussed on non-lethal stealth runs couldn’t beat the game with a 100% clear conscious. It also affected gameplay as stealth players had to waste inventory space and augment upgrades on lethal weapons just for bosses. This was annoying, as most people wouldn’t use that stuff in any other context. Luckily, the Director’s Cut version of the game has reworked the boss fights, allow you to sneak around the arenas using hacking and stealth to take out bosses. Unfortunately, all the bosses still need to be killed, except for the DLC one who can be subdued non-lethally.STORY AND NARRATIVEThe story in DE:HR is wonderfully crafted. It starts as a fairly compelling justice/revenge story (depending on how you roleplay) that ends up turning into a worldwide conspiracy hunt. You go from location to location, following lead to lead without it ever feeling stale. It constantly keeps things fresh by throwing more and twists and deception without really overdoing things. There are dialogue choices which can influence things to a degree, but Adam Jensen remains very much his own character as opposed to a blank slate to imprint yourself on. There are some pretty neat sections in the game where dialogue choices have to be used carefully in order to coerce certain characters to do things by reading them and telling them what they might want to hear. It feels refreshing to have an RPG protagonist with an actual past and a place in the world as opposed to being an empty vessel with the sole purpose of driving the story forward. Of course, if you are into customisation and heavy roleplay you might be a bit disappointed.As much as people like to make fun of the “I never asked for this” line, the voice acting in the game is pretty good and serves its purpose well enough. It’s not exactly exceptional and it can be pretty jarring when Elias Toufeix (Adam Jensen) delivers lines that are supposed to be compassionate, cold, convincing, pleading etc. in the same raspy voice. Granted, it is a pretty awesome voice. The strength definitely lies more in the writing itself rather than the actors delivering it. The game is able to tackle a lot of complex themes, with a very prevalent one being the ethical implications of artificial human enhancement. I found that it really made me think quite deeply on world issues that haven’t even happened yet, but I was still considering what side of the argument I might want to fall on by the end of the game.The world and atmosphere is built up pretty nicely through NPC banter, ebooks, newspapers, pocket secretaries and emails scattered everywhere for you to dive into or ignore completely. Side quests are also done very well, with the developers having opted for quality over quantity. There are only a few of them per hub area, but they are all compelling with their own self-contained story. Regarding DLC, the Director’s Cut version of the game is the definitive one. It incorporates the DLC into the game where it chronologically goes rather that making it a separate install like in the base game. The DLC is also a very good one (they only made one) and that alone makes it totally worth getting the Director’s Cut version of the game.VISUALS, PERFORMANCE AND PC PORTDE: HR came out in 2011 and is a decent looking game for its time. The Director’s Cut version did improve some textures, but the game does still look pretty dated overall. The character models look pretty nice, but awkwardly done lip syncing on the faces during conversations is pretty jarring. The animations are all pretty well choreographed and the melee stealth kills are super satisfying as a result. The pre-rendered cinematics are a bit off putting, considering that in game engine actually looks better than most of them. Fortunately, there are only a handful of them throughout the game.The world design is where this game really shines. The game really prevails in its visual design and art style rather than raw graphical fidelity. All of the environments are designed and come together really nicely to create this ideal cyberpunk feel that no other game has really come anywhere close to. Every area looks unique and vibrant and it was more than once that I had to stop running around and just look out the window to appreciate the background of whatever future city I was in.The game performed well for me, on several systems ranging from a HD 7770 to a GTX 970. I rarely noticed any drops from a stable 60 if there were any at all. Graphics options were all acceptable with everything you would expect. The game has full support for both M+KB and controller, but you'll want to opt for the former if you can.			"

												The new Deus Ex, which is a different Deus Ex. The story doesn't make sence in the Deus Ex universe as apparently it takes place before the original Deus Ex, and yet all the augmentations are years ahead what we saw in the original game. It's not bad if you don't consider the older games though. The characters are interesting, and the quests are far from being boring. Moreover, the audiovisuals are great! But the style changed and black and gold dominate now what was blue and dark in the old games. Unfortunately, the combat system is terrible and a real nuisance. Every fight I thought how much of a better game it would be if there was less of it. Then I encountered bosses and asked myself what were the developers thinking, putting a Final Fantasy crap in Deus Ex. You cannot avoid combat with bosses, because fk yu. Fortunately you can stealth your way through other encounters, which is more fun and - on hard difficulties - sometimes quite challenging. Overall, it's a very good game save for combat, which holds me from replaying it. If you haven't played old Deus Exes, play the first one before playing Human Revolution! ...and skip the second one.			"

												DXHR: DC has a few problems. Mostly technical issues like graphical stutter. However all of this was fixable either through toggling something in the registry and an occasional fix here and there. It justifies it's price of admission in a few ways. The biggest difference you'll notice if you bought all the DLC already and played through the game is that the Director's Cut encorporates all the DLC far better. Now you have to find all the preorder weapons in the world, and the Missing Link is fully encorporated into the main game.Not only that but they added a few interesting new features. Boss battles have been reworked inorder to allow for multiple ways to kill them. Such as hacking turrets, allowing for non-lethal and stealthier players to get past those sections. As well they added New Game Plus and Developer's Commentary. Allowing just enough content justification to warrant another playthrough.Whether it's worth your extra money remains to be seen. I for one really like the changes and I'm glad Square went back and fixed this game of it's issues.			"

												I was a bit miffed when I heard about what the Director's Cut added. ""Five bucks to fix the boss fights?"" I yelled at my computer. ""Go to hell and take your cheap augs with you!"" This is why I'm just getting to playing it now, and I really wish the publisher didn't pull this move. Charging people money to fix parts of the game that are sub-par is something I expect from small developers who genuinely need the dough, not from multi-national publishers who complain that six million sales of a video game constitutes a financial failure. There's a lot of stuff in here - the Director's Cut unifies the game with all of its pre-order content and DLC packs, puts the DLC chapter ""The Missing Link"" where it's supposed to be positioned in with the story, and FIXES THE AWFUL BOSS FIGHTS. Also there's upscaled textures, commentary, blah blah blah, like a game from 2011 really needed upscaled textures.In my original review for Human Revolution, I called it 75% good because the boss battles kept ruining the atmosphere, and the end of the game is just basically little more than a zombie level with a big room where you push a button and get an ending. Massively disappointing given how high the game was flying.But unfortunately, time has not been kind to Human Revolution, much like time has not been kind to Deus Ex. I've just realized how much the structure of the game ♥♥♥♥s with the atmosphere and I ended up skipping past entire (not very well voiced) conversations to get to the part where I get to figure out the best way to troll soldiers and gangsters. (The best way to troll them is by dragging a vending machine into the room and using it as a big corporate capitalist battering ram, I've found). The game is not as smart as it thinks it is, and talks all these issues over transhumanism and whether chopping off your arm for a robot arm is a blah blah blah I'M BORED MR. VENDING MACHINE WANTS TO SELL YOU SOMETHING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥It's a big, fascinating game with lots of secrets and things to play around with. You can mix and match your playstyle with the lovely augmentation system. Whenever it tries to talk SERIOUS, THOUGHT-PROVOKING ISSUES I just tune the ♥♥♥♥ out.If you want to play Human Revolution, get the Director's Cut if you don't have it already. If you have the original, you're not missing out on much, but you will have to play with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss battles, so don't lean too hard on your non-lethal playstyle. Whichever version you get, I have some advice for you: Before you enter Panachea (the last section of the game), quit. Start a new game if you like. Just pretend Adam Jensen says ""♥♥♥♥ this, ♥♥♥♥ you, you're all doomed"", and goes to Aruba to beat everybody at competitive speed limbo competitions with his augmented body. Make up your own ending, if you don't like that. But if you play the last part, you'll be massively disappointed.			"

 Here’s the review of my friend  Aliona  Click here for Russian Version  WHEN MAN PLAYS THE CREATOR, THE WORLD IS GOING DOWN.Fascinating vision of the future in Blade Runner style. Breasts and p e n i s extensions, liposuctions, silicone lips and butts?In 2027, plastic surgery is long outdated. Now the body is ""augmented"": high-tech prostheses replace original even healthy body parts, organs-tuning is en vogue, artificial eyes can see through walls, there are even weapon implants to order.Only the cybernetic optimized people can make a career. The society splits into ""optis” and “normalos”. A bitter dispute over human intervention in the evolution rages there.In the meantime in billion dollar business with body parts unscrupulous multinational corporations are stepping over corpses in their pursuit of profit ignoring the law, ethics and morality.Adam Jensen, hired as security chief in one of these boom-companies, has to experience the situation himself. He is mortally wounded and mutilated during a brutal act of sabotage and now, unwillingly “augmented”, has to hunt the mastermind of the terror act till the end of the world. He is caught between all fronts and, as Cyborg against his will, passes through the heavy identity crises.Cyberpunk-thriller Deus Ex: Human Revolution, mixing various game genres, attracts primarily for its high intelligent plot and the terribly tragic story causing excessive sympathy to the protagonist.The terrible and painfully real picture of social dystopia in the hopelessly dark version of our future leaves also a deep impression.The profound soundtrack by Michael McCann (SC Double Agent, XCOM) makes the story even more emotional.I also attribute to the advantages of the game, its many possibilities and walkthrough styles which are based mainly on Jensen’s cybernetic body that can be improved through the mixture of different augmentations.Any mission involves different ways and decisions from stealth and diplomacy till assault. We then need to be optimized specifically: to the brilliant rhetoric spy or a human metal gear.My general rating:	10/10Detailed:Story:		10/10Graphic:		8/10Soundtrack:      11/10!Locations:		9/10Control:		10/10Guidance:		10/10Gameplay:         10/10Replay:		10/10  "

												It doesn't play exactly like the original game and it does take some liberties with the overall story, but Human Revolution is a remarkable game, offering an experience that feels very much as a Deus Ex game should and plays just as well, with a captivating and intriguing plot, a terrific soundtrack and more. The Director's Cut amends the infamous boss fights, bringing them in line with the rest of the experience and also adds DLC into the main flow of the game. It's one of the best ways to play what is one of the best FPSRPGs of the 2010s.			"

												The perfect blend of role-playing, stealth, first person shooter and delayed-consequence/dilemma simulator. I didn’t had high expectations for this game, but it ended up being a lot of fun. It’s possible to finish the game without killing anyone (except the bosses), or you can simply unleash hell over the bad guys. Graphics are a little dated but at least it’ll run on 60fps on most gaming gigs, voice-work is excellent, the characters are interesting, the story is engaging, there’s no reason not to play it. 9.5/10.

												Human Revolution is incredible, simply put. The beauty of the Deus Ex series is that you have to think about your actions and act more tactically then you would normally do in other games, and this is shown throughout all stages in Human Revolution. As an admirer of stealth games in general, I love the fact that Deus Ex implements this capability so well into their series. You can complete the entire game without setting off a single alarm - unless of course you would prefer shooting the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everyone in sight! Thats the wonderful point to this game: the choice is yours. If you are a newcomer to the series I couldn't recommend this any higher - you won't find many other game environments as enjoyable then this futuristic, augmented reality. It is not essential to have previously completed the others in the series, however after  the ending credits it does have a wonderful reference to the original game. An easy search on Wikipedia can help anyone who didn't understand the link/reference. Bring on Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. Can't wait.  "

												This game took me 34 hours to complete while still not completing all of the side missions apparently and nowhere in those hours did I ever lose interest. I even want to play through it again for more achievements that I missed on the first play through and most games nowadays fail to in interest me that much like COD Black ♥♥♥♥♥ (cough cough Activison sucks). Most games don’t have play value but this one did. This game was intense and kept me on the edge of my seat because of the amazing storyline and how well this game was compiled. The excellent graphics added to a more immersed experience to make me feel like I was there snapping a man’s neck behind a wall. The stealth mechanics were outstanding for a game that also focused on an extensive combat system with an upgrade system. I really enjoyed the boss fights as well because you had a choice to how you wanted to defeat them using hacking, pure strength and fire power, or using the environment against them, it gave a sense of freedom. The futuristic feel this game had was amazing and it was an amazing experience overall. It even inspired me to write a paper about biotechnology and how it is stealing fire from the gods for my college professor that got an A. This has to be my favorite “modern” game of the decade and I recommend that anyone who has a soul to play this game. I even let my grandmother play it and she said she almost fell out her chair when the Typhoon came, but she felt like a bad♥♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME GETS AN ELEVEN…OUT OF A POSSIBLE FIVE.			"

 I never asked for this...(But I sure as hell liked it.)TL:DR:An interesting and engaging cyberpunk game set decades before the classic Deus Ex game, Human Revolution is a stealth-action FPS featuring an alternate history where mechanical and cybernetic augmentations became widely spread among the world's population, with mega-corporations starting to assume control of society as our protagonist, Adam Jensen, plays a pivotal role while the world faces a true revolution.OverviewDeus Ex: Human Revolution is a game set in a cyberpunk world, with this interesting contrast between technology rising to an apex, and society facing a status of decay. The game begins in 2027 with Adam Jensen, an ex-SWAT now working as corporate security advisor for a large bio-tech company, Sarif Industries. During an attack at Sarif HQ by an unknown military unit, Jensen is critically wounded, and is forced into surgical procedures to remain alive. While Adam survives the incident, his body has undergone enormous changes due to the cybernetic augmentations. Now made a true super-soldier, with his new set of skills he must find out who was behind this attack and what were the reasons for it to have happened.The world the player meets is one with a massive duality. On one side, biotechnology and cybernetics have been taking man to new extremes, with augmented senses, intellect, abilities and giving normal lives to once-disabled citizens, painting a bright picture for some. The less fortunate, however, are faced with poverty and an economic crash with massive worldwide oil shortages, as well as the augmentees who could not pay for maintenances and a necessary drug to avoid implant rejections often end with being driven into insanity and other drug overdoses, causing a tone of tension, apprehension and uncertainty about the future. The population is polarized between those who support the improvement and usage of augmentations, as a hope for a brighter future, and those who oppose this, as it's being exploited as a mean to control the population, and blurs the line between human and machine beyond a reasonable point.Jensen's actions-- and views on this world, are only for the player to take.PlotHuman Revolution's story progresses from what seems to be a tragic incident of corporate warfare against Sarif Industries, as the bio-tech industry sparks animosity between population to the point violent demonstrations occur from both sides. These attacks, and violent demonstrations prove to be different parts of a grand scheme, as Jensen finds out the truth and the plot unravels.The story decidedly had some thought and care put into it. Details both small and large are to catch the eye and this unique world-building provides an interesting base for a debate on the matter of what measure would be human as the augmentations in the game both show how far new abilities can take augmentees, and how high the cost is when the barriers are pushed too far and start to blur between a decided human and a machine.GameplayIn Human Revolution, players are provided with a variety of skills and tactics to play through and a number of different approaches to try the game. Lethal, actiony combat, nonlethal combat, stealth infiltration and approaches, are among some of the possible gameplay tactics a player can adopt. Having done a Pacifist, a mixed and a guns-blazing run on the maximum difficulty, it's somewhat safe to say the combat and overall gameplay value will depend on how the player chooses to act, and how well they do at it.A skill tree with cybernetic augment abilities and a variety of weaponry provide the player with a number of choices. Sensing enemies through walls, optical camouflage, physical strength among others are some of the abilities the game offers, along a selection of sniper rifles, crossbows, sub-machineguns, handguns and assault weapons.GraphicsThe game is rather dated, so admittedly, graphics didn't exactly age the best. In my personal opinion, it's nothing to write home about but they do an acceptable work of conveying a good visual experience along the gameplay.Music and SoundEnvironments such as factory and laboratory interiors as well as warehouses provide this variety of industrial machinery and computer sounds, while the streets and alleys of the city hub areas give the player a sense of a busy urban center. The soundscape is paired with the original soundtrack featuring lead composer Michael McCann (also known for leading soundtracks of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent and XCOM: Enemy Unknown) provides a sense of mysterious tension and a suspense among Human Revolution's world of dualities, as it's filled with a fast-paced mixture of heavy percussion and synthesizers along orchestrated pieces for combat tracks, and synth ambient tracks for non-combat situations.Personal favorite pieces include Sarif Industries' ambient theme, Derelict Row's Combat theme, ""Hengsha Daylight"" on both the ambient and combat segments, the title song ""Icarus"" and the finale's theme for the Hyron Core Fight.Other NotesFor old-time fans of the original Deus Ex, this game has seemed to be polarizing due to its major differences between the original game and this piece of the continuity. While I cannot give a proper opinion yet as I haven't had the chance to fully play the classic and compare the two fairly, this should be taken in consideration. In my opinion, Human Revolution on its own merit has earned some credit despite a few issues such as some cut content.Personally, I am looking forward to see what Deus Ex: Mankind Divided has to offer into the scene.ConclusionIf you're a fan of the stealth-shooter genre, this could be interesting for you. Anyone interested in cyberpunk might also feel like checking DX:HR out. In its own merit, it's a game with a great story and gameplay, and has good promise for the upcoming sequel.			"

												Absolutely a phenominal game. The best story in any shooter I've ever played, with philosophical themes ranging from what it means to be human to questioning the price of progress. The game also covers many contemporary thoughts about social equality, wealth inequality, corporation rights vs the people's right, what life is like in a police state and what happens when a few men without morals control the outcome of an entire generation. For gameplay itself you can approach it stealth style (metal gear solid esque) or go rambo and try to kill everything in sight (this usually ends in failure though). There is quite a few different weapons for each approach, for example tasers and tranqs for stealth, machine guns, rifles and rockets for rambo. You can upgrade most of them with items you find for exploring areas or sometimes upgrades you can buy at blackmarket dealers. There is also an upgrade system for you character which allows you to do things such as sprint faster, get more armor, hack computers easier etc. Overall this work of art gets a 9/10 from me, if the shooting mechanics were a little more unique I might give it a ten. Definitely worth the sale price and possibly the full steam price if your into near future style shooters. (btw my first review)			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution deserves a 99/100.- Challenging game and you can choose a playstyle that suits you best (guns blazing, stealth, or a combination of both)- Unique skill tree that serves to further compliment your preferred playstyle (do you want to spend your upgrade point to see through walls or shoot explosives out of your body?)- LOTS of weapons, but not enough inventory space to keep every weapon makes the game interesting and realistic- You have to make tough and meaningful decisions within the story- Good graphics and movie-like voice acting			"

												-Can be played two ways depending on your style of gameplay: stealth or full on assault (perhaps even a bit of both).-Even though there's kind of a story to follow, you are also free to roam around as you wish. You pick your fights.-Can be a little rage inducing from time to time, but extremely satisfying when you get the results you were looking for.-As previously mentionned, adapts to every player's style of gameplay very easily (situations can be dealt with differently).-Very addictive.-Frankly one of the best FPS games I have played in a while.-If this is usually your type of game then trust me, you won't be disapointed.9.5/10 would play again			"

												This piece of art is not only one of my all-time favorites, but also a milestone in gamedesign.Why?It has an excellent story, which unfolds not only in cutscenes, but lets the player discover many details ""on the side"". If one is just gunning through, a lot of detail will be missed and the menace, which builds up more and more with every step forward, will feel less drastic.The world could not be any more authentic - same for its characters. One will encounter a lot of information about the world as a whole, about its history, about the society and its problems and tensions, ethical and political questions and international conflicts.As for the design: One of the most impressive art styles I have seen in a game so far; it all suits extremely well. The interiors, the streets, the clothing of the characters - just wow!The machanics are very satisfiying and won't get boring at any point. Augmentations, the freedom of choice at every moment, the upgradeable weapons, optional sidequests… The combination allows the player to pursuit ones very own way to complete the tasks ahead.All in all this game is simply - as written above - a piece of art....well, it has a few bugs, but none of them will keep you from finding out the truth out there.

												Bought this game during the Steam Summer Sale of 2014, downloaded and played it for the first time in Sep, 2014. 0.9 hrs done, got stuck at a point, hated the game, considered it a waste of money, never played again.That is, until June, 2015, at which point, got a hang of the game, stealth et al, fell in love with gameplay, characters and of course, the protagonist. The augmentations are gob-smackingly awesome!!!I'll be honest, not a big fan of stealth games and hence this was an acquired taste for me, but I'm so so glad I gave this game a chance, because DXHR DC sucked me into its world slowly but surely.There's a lot going on in the story, can get really confusing, but by the end it somehow all makes sense(or at least that's what I told myself). I felt like there is no such thing as a ""correct"" choice at the end, but still try getting all the options.All in all, this game deserves to be in every stealth-lover's library and even if you are not, give this a shot, it will be worth it.8.5/10*SPOILER ALERT*One of the most emotional parts of the game for me was saving Malik, I would quit and try again and again, knowing I will not be able to go ahead in this game if I failed to save her. Never felt more accomplished. :')			"

												This game is certainly on my list of all time greats as far as single player goes. It's got everything I could wish for wrapped up into one package. A mix of action/stealth/role playing with an engaging storyline. The ability to make various decisions throughout the game which suits your style or personality & will take you on a different course of direction depending on your choices. A nice freedom of play by all means. Personally I find the music awesome with it pulling you into the deus ex universe. Everytime I start the game up & hear the music play, I'm like yeahhh I'm playing deus ex love it. The gun system is a nice touch being able to customise most of the weapons you come across once you have the parts in your possession. The Aug system is a players dream enabling you to upgrade your bionic body parts. Soon enough you will become a mighty force of reckoning. But don't let that kid you, you can still die just as quick if you become a bullet magnet. That is something I like about the game, is the fact you haven't got a health bar that can absorb millions of shots before death. A few shots or 1 good shot will still kiss you goodnight. I highly recommend this to anyone who has not played before. A fantastic game with plenty of replayability. I cannot wait for the next installment of the deus ex franchise, I know it will be outstanding so hurry up with it lol			"

												""I never asked for this""A lot like some of my other favorite games of all time Deus-Ex Human Revolution started out as one of those games I had heard of, but had never gotten why people loved them so much. I picked the game up along with the original and the two other games for around $7, a pretty good deal considering how amazing I consider this game to be.Story22 years in the future from right now mankind has created augmentations, essentially robotic limbs and prostetics, a field we are actually exploring right now for birth defects, veterans, and work place injuries. With the creation of more and more advanced augmentations the public starts to worry that with the steady increase of aug users, will people begin to abuse it? The actual game story (and not the backstory) starts after waking up from a 6 month coma, where you wake up heavily augmented as to save your life. You play as Adam Jensen, the head of security of Serif industries. After an attack on your company which was the cause of your coma, your new augmentations, and the supposed death of your girlfriend and 5 other scientists. As you systematically track down the perpetrators of the attack it leads you into an even bigger bunnyhole on a global scale.GameplayThe cover system and stealth mechanics feel a lot like the Metal Gear Solid series. With guards and enemies responding to every noise and thing they see. If you're jumping around trying to find a route past them, they're going to check it out. If you leave a body laying around by another guards patrol area they're going to call it in and raise the alarm. Actual combat is a bit lacking though, if you want to go all in and just shoot everything you're just going to get holes shot in you as you die in about 10 shots. Boss battles, (excluding the last one) are a bit lacking, as one battle just has you shoot the guy in the head and that's it. He taunts you for a good 30 minutes and once you get to him, bang, zoom, 6ft under. While silencers for your pistol and assault rifle are rather hard to find in the beginning, they come around later along with damage, reload, target seeking, lasers, armor piercing, and even magazine upgrades. You can even upgrade your augmentations to be able to carry more items (the inventory has a set size which is kind of BS), be able to punch through walls, be able to takedown multiple enemies, fire explosive ball bearings out of your chest and more.GraphicsMy laptop is a bit♥♥♥♥♥♥but even as it was on my computer it looked pretty good for a game released 4 years ago. You can argue that Skyrim came out around the same time but that probably had a much bigger budget than this game.VerdictAmazing game, one of my favorite single player games along with Dishonored, Dead Space, and Wolfenstein. The game itself, and not the bundle, was on sale for less than 5$. If that discount ever comes up again or even if it doesn't I highly recommend getting the game. Just remember that you never asked to have this much fun.			"

												Great voice actors, gameplay and overall experience that will keep you coming back for more to try different routes with upgrades. You won't be disappointed if you like the first Deus Ex mainly for the voices and story and i would recommend this game to all my friends who refuses to pay 60 dollars for a 2 hour game just for achievements.

												After Invisible War, vast swathes of people who enjoyed the original Deus Ex clung to the common hope that Human Revolution would be a return to form. While the initial release of DX:HR in 2011 went some way to accomplishing this feat, it didn't emerge from its development completely untainted by the effects of the modern day.The story and the world were certainly much closer to the original game than its predecessor, allowing multiple methods of accomplishing the game's objectives and a near-future setting depicting the burgeoning transhumanism that the original game - set 25 years later - would have embraced.However, the main gripe that the fans had with the DX:HR of 2011 was the boss battles; the unavoidable fights into which the story shoved you which could only be done a single way: utilising brute force. This simply wasn't the Deus Ex way and, as expected, the outcry was quick to begin.Thankfully, with the advent of the Director's Cut edition, this gripe has very much been ironed out. While the fights themselves are still present - due to the adversaries being somewhat pivotal to the storyline - the arenas in which they take place have had themselves an overhaul, allowing a player to finally use their Jensen's strengths to dispatch the enemy.Now, the ""brute force"" approach is just one option of many as opposed to the mandatory route of progression. While it's not possible to simply sneak out the door and bypass the fights, those players who went for the stealthy hacker route will finally have a way to use those strengths directly, whether by controlling turrets, awakening mechs or opening up lockers full of additional supplies.The Director's Cut edition also comes with the Missing Link DLC fully integrated, meaning that instead of having to load up the DLC separately as required previously (the original editions of both come up as separate ""games"" on Steam), the Director's Cut will simply transition into the Missing Link content at the appropriate point in the base game's story, making the complete game a more cohesive whole as well as more convenient to play than the original release.And, at only £12.99, it's definitely worth it if you're into the Deus Ex series. While many will argue that the original Deus Ex, coupled with mods such as New Vision, is the better game, the Director's Cut version of DX:HR is by no means a bad entry in the series. If you were holding off on account of the boss battles or the DLC being separate from the base games, now's probably the time to jump in. It often ends up getting discounted in Steam Sales too, so there's that.			"

 I never asked for this...(But I sure as hell liked it.)TL:DR:An interesting and engaging cyberpunk game set decades before the classic Deus Ex game, Human Revolution is a stealth-action FPS featuring an alternate history where mechanical and cybernetic augmentations became widely spread among the world's population, with mega-corporations starting to assume control of society as our protagonist, Adam Jensen, plays a pivotal role while the world faces a true revolution.OverviewDeus Ex: Human Revolution is a game set in a cyberpunk world, with this interesting contrast between technology rising to an apex, and society facing a status of decay. The game begins in 2027 with Adam Jensen, an ex-SWAT now working as corporate security advisor for a large bio-tech company, Sarif Industries. During an attack at Sarif HQ by an unknown military unit, Jensen is critically wounded, and is forced into surgical procedures to remain alive. While Adam survives the incident, his body has undergone enormous changes due to the cybernetic augmentations. Now made a true super-soldier, with his new set of skills he must find out who was behind this attack and what were the reasons for it to have happened.The world the player meets is one with a massive duality. On one side, biotechnology and cybernetics have been taking man to new extremes, with augmented senses, intellect, abilities and giving normal lives to once-disabled citizens, painting a bright picture for some. The less fortunate, however, are faced with poverty and an economic crash with massive worldwide oil shortages, as well as the augmentees who could not pay for maintenances and a necessary drug to avoid implant rejections often end with being driven into insanity and other drug overdoses, causing a tone of tension, apprehension and uncertainty about the future. The population is polarized between those who support the improvement and usage of augmentations, as a hope for a brighter future, and those who oppose this, as it's being exploited as a mean to control the population, and blurs the line between human and machine beyond a reasonable point.Jensen's actions-- and views on this world, are only for the player to take.PlotHuman Revolution's story progresses from what seems to be a tragic incident of corporate warfare against Sarif Industries, as the bio-tech industry sparks animosity between population to the point violent demonstrations occur from both sides. These attacks, and violent demonstrations prove to be different parts of a grand scheme, as Jensen finds out the truth and the plot unravels.The story decidedly had some thought and care put into it. Details both small and large are to catch the eye and this unique world-building provides an interesting base for a debate on the matter of what measure would be human as the augmentations in the game both show how far new abilities can take augmentees, and how high the cost is when the barriers are pushed too far and start to blur between a decided human and a machine.GameplayIn Human Revolution, players are provided with a variety of skills and tactics to play through and a number of different approaches to try the game. Lethal, actiony combat, nonlethal combat, stealth infiltration and approaches, are among some of the possible gameplay tactics a player can adopt. Having done a Pacifist, a mixed and a guns-blazing run on the maximum difficulty, it's somewhat safe to say the combat and overall gameplay value will depend on how the player chooses to act, and how well they do at it.A skill tree with cybernetic augment abilities and a variety of weaponry provide the player with a number of choices. Sensing enemies through walls, optical camouflage, physical strength among others are some of the abilities the game offers, along a selection of sniper rifles, crossbows, sub-machineguns, handguns and assault weapons.GraphicsThe game is rather dated, so admittedly, graphics didn't exactly age the best. In my personal opinion, it's nothing to write home about but they do an acceptable work of conveying a good visual experience along the gameplay.Music and SoundEnvironments such as factory and laboratory interiors as well as warehouses provide this variety of industrial machinery and computer sounds, while the streets and alleys of the city hub areas give the player a sense of a busy urban center. The soundscape is paired with the original soundtrack featuring lead composer Michael McCann (also known for leading soundtracks of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent and XCOM: Enemy Unknown) provides a sense of mysterious tension and a suspense among Human Revolution's world of dualities, as it's filled with a fast-paced mixture of heavy percussion and synthesizers along orchestrated pieces for combat tracks, and synth ambient tracks for non-combat situations.Personal favorite pieces include Sarif Industries' ambient theme, Derelict Row's Combat theme, ""Hengsha Daylight"" on both the ambient and combat segments, the title song ""Icarus"" and the finale's theme for the Hyron Core Fight.Other NotesFor old-time fans of the original Deus Ex, this game has seemed to be polarizing due to its major differences between the original game and this piece of the continuity. While I cannot give a proper opinion yet as I haven't had the chance to fully play the classic and compare the two fairly, this should be taken in consideration. In my opinion, Human Revolution on its own merit has earned some credit despite a few issues such as some cut content.Personally, I am looking forward to see what Deus Ex: Mankind Divided has to offer into the scene.ConclusionIf you're a fan of the stealth-shooter genre, this could be interesting for you. Anyone interested in cyberpunk might also feel like checking DX:HR out. In its own merit, it's a game with a great story and gameplay, and has good promise for the upcoming sequel.			"

												Absolutely a phenominal game. The best story in any shooter I've ever played, with philosophical themes ranging from what it means to be human to questioning the price of progress. The game also covers many contemporary thoughts about social equality, wealth inequality, corporation rights vs the people's right, what life is like in a police state and what happens when a few men without morals control the outcome of an entire generation. For gameplay itself you can approach it stealth style (metal gear solid esque) or go rambo and try to kill everything in sight (this usually ends in failure though). There is quite a few different weapons for each approach, for example tasers and tranqs for stealth, machine guns, rifles and rockets for rambo. You can upgrade most of them with items you find for exploring areas or sometimes upgrades you can buy at blackmarket dealers. There is also an upgrade system for you character which allows you to do things such as sprint faster, get more armor, hack computers easier etc. Overall this work of art gets a 9/10 from me, if the shooting mechanics were a little more unique I might give it a ten. Definitely worth the sale price and possibly the full steam price if your into near future style shooters. (btw my first review)			"

In first playtrough boss fights are really hard (Yeah, there is new game+). Even they cause that you would want to have a break for a while. After second boss, mine was about a month.Besides, you can buy this game in a sale for a ridiculous price, but deserves full price anyway.Nothing to say more, just play this legend if you are not a casual player.I'm starting again for the pacifist now.

												- Gameplay design that allows for multiple playstyles, whether you would like to be a cyborg ninja or an unstoppable war machine.- A beautiful, original, and consistent aesthetic that can be seen in the games many settings.- Some of the better writing in video games and the dynamic character Adam Jensen.I have very few complaints with DX:HR. About the only thing I can think of is that it is too easy if you have a lot of experience playing stealth games. Which is funny because one of the complaints voiced at launch by others was the difficulty of the boss fights for stealth oriented builds. Don't let that whining dissuade you from picking up this enjoyable experience. I'm going to say it straight up. Anyone, who said they had difficulty with the bosses, sucks at video games.Note that the biggest change to the game in the Director's Cut is that the bosses fights have been altered to offer more opportunities succeed for stealth builds and in general. I'm not complaining. The boss fights in this version are much more fun.			"

												This is a great action/stealth game that is well worth your money. However you want to mix it up is perfectly viable. Sneaking pacifist, gun slinging psychopath? It's up to you, but fair warning, there are portions where stealth is absolutely mandatory and the game will straight up murder you for run and gun. The story is interesting and thought provoking. The zones are fantastic looking, and the upgrade system lets you customize but will leave you wanting more upgrade points (which it should). It is an absolutely fantastic game that is horribly, horribly let down by it's ending. It's ME3 levels of bad, or at the least incomprehensible and baffling. It's a very unfulfilling way to end Adam Jensen's story. My advice, buy the game, play it, love it, and just try your best to forget that the last 0.1% of the game was such a letdown after how good the first 99.9% is.9/10			"

You pick your fights.-Can be a little rage inducing from time to time, but extremely satisfying when you get the results you were looking for.-As previously mentionned, adapts to every player's style of gameplay very easily (situations can be dealt with differently).-Very addictive.-Frankly one of the best FPS games I have played in a while.-If this is usually your type of game then trust me, you won't be disapointed.9.5/10 would play again			"

												Quick Note: The original Deus Ex: HR entry has now been replaced by the newly released Director's Cut edition, so I will write my recommendation on this.Deus Ex: Human Revolution is an action RPG set within a modern cyberpunk world in the year 2027. You enter this world as Adam Jensen, a private security officer working for Sarif Industries. As you initially start the game, you'll see it is a time where humanity is split due to their contrasting views on human augmentations, but of course, that's not all there is to it.Story-wise, this game is absolutely perfect. The game is set before the original Deus Ex game (25 years earlier to be exact). The script is very thought-provoking and quote-worthy. As you proceed through the game, you'll be able to read scattered e-books lying around, as well as e-mails on specific computer workstations. This will give you more insight into the story. If you approach random NPC's, they will tell you their own personal views. There are 5 main locations that you'll be able to visit, all of which have their own side quests scattered around that'll also give you even more insight within the outstanding plot of this game. There are many organizations, such as the aforementioned ""Sarif Industries"" that serve their own specific purposes. There are also references to certain mythologies that serve a subtle connection to the original game.Graphically, the game has a wonderfully intense gold and black theme that is present throughout. There is a somewhat common issue that you may experience where certain glitches such as tearing and stuttering may occur, as well as character models (both face and body) acting quite irregular. However, I am pretty sure this has been corrected within the Director's Cut edition of the game. (Don't quote me on this). Textures have generally been improved also.In regards to gameplay, you essentially have two approaches: stealth or non-stealth. Hell, you could go for the mixed bag, but I wouldn't recommend it. Both styles have their own advantages and disadvantages, but I'll leave you to decide your play-style for yourself. The game showcases specific weaponry tailored to either style that you'll come across whilst playing. There are boss fights within the game that the new DC edition has reworked completely to allow players to use different play-styles instead of being restricted to a non-stealthy approach. There is also the addition of a new documentary and commentary by Eidos Montreal. Previous DLC expansions and missions have been fully integrated within the game and another new and exciting feature that has been implemented is the 'New Game+' mode. This mode allows you to carry over your augmentations and weaponry from your first play-through. For anyone who likes collecting achievements and trading cards/backgrounds/emoticons, those have also been implemented.Personally, this game is a firm 10/10. I absolutely adore this game and I could not recommend it enough. It is worth the full price-tag by far. This game is a firm number two on my top-ten list of games. Also, if you happen to own the original version of DE:HR, you'll receive a 50% discount for the Director's Cut edition. Furthermore, if you own the 'Missing Link' DLC expansion, that will add 25% to the discount giving you 75% off the entire game, which should work out as $5 for those of you in the USA and around £3.25 for the British.I implore you to buy this game. It is outstanding. "

												Deus Ex? Deus Ex. Now that was an adventure! And a fun one at that. And fairly long too. Playtime: 64:19 hours; played offline mostly so Steam didn't track the time. Non-lethal, completionist on hardest difficulty. Didn't go for all the achievements though. There's a lot to be said, so let me just get onto it.Story. I usually have a hard time describing how was the story or whatever the flaws were, 'cause over time I tend to forget details and I also am guilty of actually having fun while playing video games which often leads to something as simple as taking everything at face value - this especially being the case with fantasy settings. Here, the story was fairly easy to follow and had a certain flow to it that... made sense. I often catch myself checking questlog to see what the hell was I supposed to do to progress or what exactly did they ask me to do - none of which happened during this playthrough. All was laid down nicely, your mission is clear. Solid, engaging plot that near the end took a slight dip - that doesn't mean it's suddenly terrible. It was more linear than not, yes, but that was only for the better. The game still offered a lot of freedom to play around - but about this later. It all left me with questions some questions still unanswered and some new ones emerging - personally I wouldn't take it as a negative, all the more reason to do another playthrough and catch on/connect dots previously missed.Sidequests were very well done. Surprisingly even, I'd say, considering how many games just throw those in to artificially extend playtime that way. Written and introduced in a way that - keeping Jensen's background and general attitude in mind - they made sense for him to do them. Majority also had additional layers, depth, that made them even more interesting and offered multiple ways to complete that weren't straight up abandoning if it didn't fit what you'd do. And the best part is, only one of the bunch was a traditional fetch-quest. Conversations and general dialogue was definitely a highlight and something nice to see. The challanges to convince someone to give out information, give access somewhere and other similar actually required some thinking on how to act and what to say. What makes it even better, it's all doable without the social augmentation. Just wits and proper analysis. Definitely a welcoming change from a bunch of titles that required certain amount points into certain skill which afterwards unlocked new options that might be actually successful in opposition to default ones.Now, gameplay part. Deus Ex is an action game - an action game you can entirely stealth through. I stealthed it all as much as I could and it was damn satisfying and well done. There is no wrong way to play it and whatever you choose to do, game gives you the means and ways to do so. It REWARDS creative thinking - like obscuring turret's sight with boxes so you can pass through to the next room or taking objects from the other end of the city just to stack them on each other and pass to another area. There are many more examples of this; it really did feel satisfying to see an unorthodox solution work in the end.The AI, while not the smartest, was very perceptive. Enemies could spot you from very long distances - same goes for turrets and the like - and would force you to act fast. There was no room for sitting in one place for more than few seconds, no matter if in the open to scout the area better nor if moved a bit farther away from cover for whatever the reason could be. From playing 'Dishonored' a lot I got a habit of trying the get the higher ground, mainly because NPCs rarely look up - here it was the opposite. You could get spotted very high up by a guy that walked a bit farther away on the ground. Those guys also looked behind - now that's something.Boss fights. There were four boss fights in the game, although I'm not really sure if I should count one of them. Those were interesting. There was a bunch of enviromental stuff one could use against them, areas were big and gave a lot of room to move around. My main complaint would be how easily exploitable they are, what (un?)fortunately makes them easy to beat. I am not used to boss fights in stealth games - what made those probably harder than they would be, aside from being a terrible shot - and the fact that I could get the boss stuck in a behaviour loop and shoot him to death was... dissapointing. The final fight is also very lackluster comparing to the previous ones and incredibly easy. It took a different approach but it was very much 'meh'. Not really feeling like the final fight should.City areas were big and well designed. They allowed player to go pretty much anywhere, uncover little secrets, learn a bit on daily lives of people - and not only. There were quite a few missions happening inside them and the freedom to come and go, maybe continue story stuff in short bits without getting punished for 'leaving the quest area' was damn good.Graphics were alright, nothing mindblowing nor necessairly bad either. Only thing that struck me as awful was lip sync and facial expressions - or lack of them, rather. They definitely took an interesting art direction, moving away from the regular blues and grays of cyberpunk and using goldens, yellows and browns, giving the game warmer palette. It could also be linked to the idea of the story revolving more around the rich and powerful - thus giving golden all the more reason to be a main theme, being generally associated with those circles. As much as the main cast varied in terms of clothing and looks, regular civilians were as boring and as regular as one would expect. Maybe with exception to punks and gang members but I'd say even they weren't all that different once you've seen a couple.Final verdict? Damn worth grabbing. I'm not sure how would one enjoy it as a regular action game, but as a stealth fan it's a must. It had it's flaws but not strong enough to take enjoyment out of the game and it was definitely an experience worth having. I highly recommend it to anyone that happens to be a fan of cyberpunk or stealth games - bonus enjoyment points for both - and at least giving it a go if one finds it's concept interesting.			"

												The game Deus Ex: Human Revolution Director’s Cut is sort of a “game of the year” edition for the original Deus Ex: HR in that it includes the DLC missions. Apparently there are other changes such as improved textures and increased gameplay options for people who like to find roundabout solutions. Personally I didn’t see much difference from when I first played the original version a few years back. DE:HR is similar to the Hitman games because it seems like “smart” players would have a lot more fun. I usually like to run and gun so I don’t really look for different ways to exploit the environment in a game (like tricking an enemy into a room and gassing him).The story of DE:HR is pretty complex and if you read all the literature in the game you’ll probably spend about 30+ hours on a single playthrough. In the near future, prosthetic technology (like artificial limbs) has become very advanced and widespread. In fact it’s become so advanced that most people with “augments” are getting them by choice. Basically they’re just upgrading themselves in a bunch of different ways. This is leading to a huge conflict between people who think augmentation should be outlawed to preserve humanity, and people who think augmentation is the next step in human evolution. And of course it also turns out that the military is creating augmented super soldiers. You play as Adam Jensen, a corporate security chief who gets augmented “against his will” after nearly dying in an attack (kind of like Robocop). The game is all about hunting down the people responsible while the world tears itself apart around you.The game is mostly stealth although there are a ton of different ways to kill people (sniping, rocket launchers, machine guns). Your augments give you various advantages such as seeing / punching through walls and hacking devices (you’ll spend a large percentage of the game doing the hacking minigame). I’m trying to get the Pacifist achievement this playthrough, so I’m using only non-lethal takedowns and hiding the bodies while working my way through the story. That probably adds about 5 hours to the game time though, so if you’re impatient just blast your way through and leave the corpses. I believe the game averages 25 hours to beat so if you bought this game in the recent Humble Bundle you’ll definitely get your money’s worth. Pros:Excellent stealth game. You can play through the entire game and not kill anyone (except bosses). I tried playing a non-lethal runthrough but must have killed someone accidently because I didn’t get the achievement.Excellent story - the highlight of the game.Very cheap game, I traded 1 TF2 key for it when it was part of the recent Square Enix Humble Bundle.Cons:Kind of dated graphics. The game came out in 2011 and really it doesn’t look much better than Half Life 2 (which came out 2004).There really isn’t much use for money in this game other than a few times when you buy upgrades. I ended the game with like 80k credits and nothing to spend them on. Inventory space is limited so I couldn’t just load up on ammo.If you do not like stealth games, don’t play this! It’s a large download (more than 10gb) and you might just hate it anyways. If you try to Rambo your way through you’ll get shot down pretty fast. I don’t really care for the way the “Missing Link” DLC was integrated into the game. I understand there wasn’t any other way to do it, but it’s jarring when it happens. The Missing Link was a DLC that was “standalone” which means you don’t share the save files from the regular Deus Ex HR. When you start Missing Link, you have no skill points and no weapons. In the Director’s Cut, this is a problem because when you reach that point in the story, you lose all your skills (including the skills that expand your inventory so half your loot drops on the floor).Overall, Deus Ex: HR is a definite Must Play if you don’t mind stealth. The graphics can be a little dated compared to modern games but it’s really all about the story. I’ve heard that they might be making a movie based on the game, and I can certainly see that happening. You hear about movies based on games all the time and mostly they’re bad ideas because video games are all about interactivity and accomplishment. A movie based on an awesome game like Bioshock Infinite would be like watching your brother play the game and he doesn’t let you play. Deus Ex on the other hand has such a rich backstory and realistic premise that a movie would tell the story wonderfully. I can totally foresee cybernetic augmentation as being a real world hot topic in the not so distant future.  "

""If you wanna make enemies, try to change something. The year is 2027. It is a time of great innovation and technological advancement. It is also a time of chaos and conspiracy. I don't even know whose side I'm on."" - Adam Jensen Deus Ex: Human Revolution is fantastic. It's gameplay is smooth and easy to control but most of all it's fun. The story keeps you engaged and is on par with the original the whole way through; the visuals and the music are wonderfully done and should be highly commended. One of the best game I've played and I felt that way from the start and having now spent my time experiencing it again through this version my enthusiasm has only gotten stronger.The Director's Cut improves very much on the original's release especially in regards to the boss fights and the inclusion of a new game plus however I have to be honest and admit for my experience the dlc which here is implemented in the story was not enjoyable. The Missing Link is a back-tracking fetch quest mess and doesn't contribute anything as it takes away all of your weapons and augmentations at the beginning and you are forced to start over which really was a kick in the teeth; either the developers weren't interested or were forced to make more content but nevertheless it doesn't work for me and feels entirely different to the rest of the main game and would've been better as an option after the main plot.Nevertheless should you buy this game? Yes! It’s brilliant and you'll enjoy the experience; despite some of the flaws I can't recommend it enough.  "

												Deus Ex Human Revolution is not as much a game as it is a interactive prophetic novel. In a scientific clarity and realism, situations and persons are contrived which epitomize the philisophical challenges of these new technologies. The questions such as; what are the inherit qualities of nanotechnology, robotics, and artificial intelligence? Do they leane towars the positive or negative? Are they like other tools, in which then it is mearly defined by how they are used and seen? You see this game is filled with these intellectual riddles. Do you help direct humanity, by examplifying the usage of this technology in a positive manner? Or do you exemplify the risk of such technology going postal? In turn, situation after situation, you define the answer. You create your future. One cannot disregard story in games. It is quintessential to a quality product. This game epitomizes that. The characters, their depth, their intricatcy. Their human nature and its ability to exploit any environment and situation. It shows you humans tryin to deal with this new technology. It shows how the black market and why, it would develop. It shows you how, with so much power, it would without a doubt produce 'abuse of power.' The graphics are clean and crisp. The environment has a color tone consistent with the mood and atmosphere that the game creators were clearly trying to portray. They also never failed in producing a stylistic, yet technology robust environment. Simulateneously, they effectively showed the cotnrast of socio-economic status and their concording types of technology. There was no atmospheric shortage of visual stimulation. Although some NPC could of used better models, it is essentially irrelevent.The gameplay is a mixture, the original deus ex fused with MGS/GearsOfWar style stealth and cover. The PC is most definitely the best way to play this game. I have played it on the PS3 and, while it was fantastic, it was even better on the PC. It is still, easily, one of the best games I have played in a long time. Even though it has it's flaws, the story is so good at sucking you into the world of Deus Ex, you forget all technical wrongs and focus on finding Dr. Reed. You quickly learn it is bigger than a mere rescue mission. It becomes a question of humanity and society's right to guide itself or be guided. The philisophical depth of the game forces you to consider every move and every word, for every action has an equal re-action. So sit down, smoke a cigerrate, and get ready becauase this game will do more than entertaine. It will make you think.I must of played atleast 50 hours on this game. That time is including the original Deus Ex Humar Revolution. The game doesn't bore or disincentivise. It fosters inquisition into the truth. You want to know what is happening and why, your not forced, like so many games feel. Furthermore, what the truth is...well that is relative.This is the newly released Director's Cut, which has also been patched and is fully functional. I had absolutely no problems after the patch.Stop reading a bunch of nonesense, stop doubting yourself. This game is worth every cent, especially if it's discounted.			"

												A throw-back to the classic shooters of the 90's, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is more about story and exploration than it is about actually shooting things. The game is partly a stealth shooter, with many ways of approaching a series of rooms full of armed guards, giving options such as: sniping from the rafters, cloaking and hacking the turrets, quietly picking them off with hand to hand combat, or just nuking the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of anything that moves with a rocket launcher.  Though some may wish that therewere more options to choose from, anything is much better than the linear shooters we have come to know, where all one has to do is hold a button, run down a hallway. and aim for the head.  The other part of this is game is heavily plot driven, giving ~40 hours of story which is very engaging, but unfortunatly a little predictable.  Dealing with the morallity and ethics of cybernetic enhancement, the true meaning of freedom, and the role of corporate greed in both, the game provides thought provoking scenarios and opens up many topics that humanity should probably start thinking about in the near future.  Personally, I found that the only setback story-wise was the inability to roleplay, or even feel like your character is developing with the information you are discovering.  Many times in the game I found that my natural reactions to events were not presented by the games main character, who tends to be either extremely sassy, or just ignorant and impatient.  This game is a great play and definetly worth checking out, and I would recommend it to anyone that isn't deterred by the fact that it is ~40 hour game about sneaking around with robot limbs trying to stop the ILLOOMINAUGHTY.

												-Can be played two ways depending on your style of gameplay: stealth or full on assault (perhaps even a bit of both).-Even though there's kind of a story to follow, you are also free to roam around as you wish. You pick your fights.-Can be a little rage inducing from time to time, but extremely satisfying when you get the results you were looking for.-As previously mentionned, adapts to every player's style of gameplay very easily (situations can be dealt with differently).-Very addictive.-Frankly one of the best FPS games I have played in a while.-If this is usually your type of game then trust me, you won't be disapointed.9.5/10 would play again			"

												Human Revolution is a Shooter/ Stealth game with heavy ammounts of RPG elements that asks you to make some major choices, like do you want to play it as a stealth or shooter for example.  This is a well polished, well put to gether game and everything  you excpet out of a AAA game.  The game play is engrossing.  The options given to you seem meaningful.  The world is well crafted and expansive (while not open world, the use of large hub-worlds is even better givning the player space to explore while still keeping the game focused).  Finally, the story is strong enough to get you engaged.  And all of this is true, at least at first.  Human Revelution though, is a game that suffers the further you proceed and really collapses in on its own wait.  Not to undercut how wonderful this game is, but there comes a point where the gameplay stops to be compelling, the choices seem pointless and the story becomes downright stupid.    As bad as all that sounds, I still think this game is almost a must play.  The game works so well for so long that I highly recommend it.  The fact that it falls apart at the end doesn't take away from how strong it starts.    It's not a game I recommend you finish, but considering the large ammount of play time you can squeeze from it; that is all right.  Find some time to play this game.			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution deserves a 99/100.- Challenging game and you can choose a playstyle that suits you best (guns blazing, stealth, or a combination of both)- Unique skill tree that serves to further compliment your preferred playstyle (do you want to spend your upgrade point to see through walls or shoot explosives out of your body?)- LOTS of weapons, but not enough inventory space to keep every weapon makes the game interesting and realistic- You have to make tough and meaningful decisions within the story- Good graphics and movie-like voice acting			"

												For all that the original game of the series was a such a classic experience, the sequels never quite impressed me the same way. Human Revolution especially had a hard time, with its horrid orange-tinged graphics, DLC-shredded storyline and terrible boss-battles. Still, it did recapture the feel of the original in many ways and that alone is enough to earn it a recommendation.The Director's Cut edition removed the gold filter from the graphics of the original released version of Human Revolution, which was a welcome change. Unfortunately, without the softening tinge everything looked too harsh and this only emphasized the age of the graphics. Similarly, the Director's Cut rolled the stand-alone DLC into the main storyline. Alas, this too backfired; while the ""Missing Link"" quest was interesting and added some interesting detail to the storyline, it had obviously been padded out. This was okay when ""The Missing Link"" was a stand-alone product but - integrated into the main quest - it overstayed its welcome and completely ruined the pacing of the main story. And sadly, nothing had been done about the awful, awful boss-battles which felt so out of place I decided to bypass them using god-mode cheats. Still, the core gameplay was solid, even though it doesn't feel half as innovative as it did 15 years ago now that every game has imitated the original. The obvious divisions of the solutions (talk, puzzle or fight) available to bypass a problem, were too mechanical and game-like to sell the illusion , and the conspiracies didn't have quite the depth or believability as those in the original. But it was still fun to creep around through the vents and take down enemies (non-lethally!) like some cyber-ninja. Some of the level design was really nice too, especially in the latter half of the game, although I felt there was too much similarity to the original game there as well. So overall it was a fulfilling experience, if nowhere near as memorable or innovate as its predecessors. "

												I had alot of fun playing this, the story is really good. The game is different from the others, as this is a different character and from what I remembered, its a prequel. This game brings interesting conspiracies, and its really great. Like other games, depending on your actions will have what others think of you, but you progress through nonetheless. Whether you kill someone, you spare someone, you save someone, you left someone to die, all entirely up to you. This game is amazing, and took a real long time to finish it.So whats your choice? Lethal or non lethal, save someone or kill someone, save a million people or save one person that holds the knowledge to save the world. All is up to you.			"

												Deus Ex, has always been one of my favourite game series. This did not disappoint, if you are a fan of near futuristic gameplay, with an immersive and story driven experience, this good sir is the game for you. From the hit off, the game does not fail, amazing soundtracks during an explosive introduction, leading to the main player Adam Jensen, being critically wounded in a lab takeover by ""mercenaries"" working for a yet unknown corporation or collective. (play to find out who), and the near future of Detroit in 2027 is just absolutely perfect as a setting for this type of gameplay. From missions that take you to Hengsha's dirty triad underworld working as an undercover operative for a private corporation, to the TV stations of Vancouver, you as Adam Jensen have an amazing array of upgradeable nano-mechanic and machine powers. Adapatable to any environment and situation, use simple ingenuity and smarts to escape/maim or kill if you wish. 9.5/10 great graphics, amazing gameplay, story driven lineage, great characters, no thumbs down for this game at all, well done Eidos. Expecting a sequel, if you liked the original Deus Ex games, you'll love Human revolution director's cut. Wholly recommend this.			"

Dialogue is fun and engaging. Exploration is fun and rewarding. Every situation can be solved in more than one way. And honestly, I can think of plenty more pros. It just has so much going for it.The only real complaint I have with the game is the poorly balanced skill tree. There are several skills that are just completely worthless (countdown timer) and others which are super essential (cloaking). It doesn't feel balanced in the slightest, but not everything can be perfect. And if that's the only bad thing this tough critic can say about it, then it's pretty damn good.			"

												Deus EX: Human Revolution.Hmm.How do i even begin this?From the start, i was interested in the game. Hell, even the name has a certain ring to it that makes it sound so imposing.I immediately fell in-love with the story. I love how you have choices about how you'd go about your mission, choices about Adam's augmentations, choices about what weaponry you carry with you and what upgrades you put in it, and choices about what to say.I loved how even with all the augmentations you have, you'd still be vulnerable and mortal.I loved how the Side missions unfolded, i loved the not so hidden pieces of lore and secret areas where you find free praxis kits and of course the END of it all.It accomplishes what it set out to do in my opinion. Tell a gripping story, engage the player and show me what being human truly means when you are now thrust into a world where man becomes half machine. A vision of what might be in the far future and a sort of warning to those with the intellect to make augmentations in the future. Traditional morality and humanity fight a seemingly hopeless battle against the lust for power and the darker side of technological advancement. Absolutely gripping.I have some qualms about it though:-The citizens don't seem to feel believeable, its like they're generic NPC's. This disappointed me because of all the technological advances in gaming, they could not make it feel like i was in a techno centric world filled with interesting randomly generated NPC's.-I keep hearing about harvesters in-game. They apparently take augmentations from people and sell them, literally ripping and harvesting them off people. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO EPIC TO FIND AND FIGHT OFF HARVESTERS.Something like ""The more you get aug'd the more they'd come after you"" kind of thing.-For an augmented person, Adam Jensen's movements were quite stiff. Minor issue but an issue nonetheless.-I feel that this would have been great if you could choose to shift between third person and first person view. WAIT. Hear me out. I know the deus ex games have always been FPS games. Sure. But look at Fallout 3 and New Vegas, the ability to choose makes a lot of difference. I'm the kind of guy who likes to see his character do some cool♥♥♥♥♥♥and sometimes i'm in the mood to see it in first person so i feel truly immersed. To each his own but yeah you get the point.All in all, this game is something you must play. Period.Damn, if you feel like the price is steep, wait for the sales. But the Devs deserve the money so buy it even if it isn't on sale.I give this game a solid 9.5/10. If this game was a chick, i'd totally bang her.In all seriousness, get the game, play it, play it again afterwards. and again and again and again.And again and again and again until augmentations become available to the general populace and then you get to live the game.

												Deus Ex Human Revolution is a brilliant yet flawed game. A game that I love for a multitude of reasons. But as per usual, I want to quickly place a little disclaimer for those planning to buy this game with a LOW-END PC. You'll be able to run this game perfectly well with no issues. Maybe 720p or hell, native resolutions. My old laptop didn't pass the minimum requirements (it had a 1.8GHz Dual Core CPU) and it ran the game with 30FPS at it's native resolution (1366x768) with minor slowdowns at times. But the game is well optimized and not really a bother in that department so don't worry about that. Now. Let's get into the meat of this review. Deus Ex Human Revolution is the prequel to 2000's Deus Ex. There were no other sequels (Don't mention the Fall or Invisible War, they don't count in my book) and it plays out the story of Adam Jensen. A former SWAT member that got ''kicked'' out of the team for taking part in the Mexican Town Massacre. This leads to Adam becoming the head of Security at Sarif Industries. Recommended to David Sarif by his ex-girlfriend, Megan Reed. I'm not going to spoil much of the story as the game's story is a brilliantly crafted experience.  The gameplay It works and is easier to understand than 2000's Deus Ex in my opinion, but then again, I'm an idiot and took me a while to understand Deus Ex (2000)'s UI. The gameplay has been a bit simplified but the enemy AI is quite dumb at times but are accurate. There is infact Health Regeneration (which is meh in my opinion when it is done wrong which means that you're basically immortal), but it only heals you after a battle so you don't worry about running around looking for Medpacks, but that means that Devs can skimp over the level and not have to bother with Health Packs. The gameplay let's you do the usual ''Play it your way'' that most Stealth games let you. I'm calling this a stealth game as the game rewards you more for stealth rather than the original rewarding you equally for any sort of playstyle. The controls feel quite fluid in my opinion as it worked well. At first it was a bit awkward but then it became easier for me to play and was easier to see why they chose the default keymappings as they were. I also recommend having a 5-button (or more buttons) mouse due to the fact that the Augs themselves are mapped to F1-F4 like the original, but at times, it's easier to just press a sidebutton on your mouse to activate the Stealth Cloak Augmentation or the Smart Vision Augmentation. The Audio The OST itself is a brilliant one with tracks that consistently fit the mood of the area or situation you're in. The main menu track itself is a beautiful one that brings joy to me each time I boot up the game. The opening theme itself, named ''Icarus'' is amazing to listen to in both in game and outside the game.Either way: The OST is lovely and awesome. That's always a plus in my opinion.  Enviroments and Levels The game will often recycle areas but for reasons within the story, you'll go to Detroit and Hengsha twice. But that doesn't mean that the game is just being cheap and making it seem awkward. It's just reusing the same areas but with some sort of reasoning within the story and has some new areas to explore or new side missions to play around with, or even a new bunch of characters or existing characters that have new interactions with for your past actions.The enviroments seem realistic and yet futuristic. Most areas have atleast two or three ways of traversing around or fighting your enemies. The thing I hate about the areas and gameplay is that you can camp in the vents and just pick off the enemies one by one which makes it a giant camp fest if you're not bothered to try thinking to defeeat your enemies. Well, in my personal opinion, you should most definitely play this title for all the positives. And the Boss Battles are reimagined so they're not giant turds like they were in the original version of this game.. BUT this game has more glitches. (none that I encountered but some others have)			"

												Played this game on release back on 2011, and I must say first things first, it has visually aged quite poorly for the most part, unfortunately, especially when i remember being absolutely blown away first time playing it. The director's cut version of this game provides the extended DLC called the Missing Link that was I believe to be a separate game (typical transaction bs from publishers). REMINDER: THE DLC PLAYS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MAIN STORY, IT IS UNMISSABLE, so don't worry about somehow skipping it.Human Revolution is a game about politics, philosophical questions on what makes us human, and throwing vending machines at people. It is also set in the Year 2027, which from playing the game, it seems they probably shoulda pushed the years quite a bit further into the future, because we are FAR from reaching this point in technological evolution.The game's story, characters, and development throughout is refreshing, and the atmosphere put down on the table is one of a futuristic Renaissance-esque type, floral patterns and colouring indicating a style they were going for. Quite different from the original Deus Ex's straight up cyberpunk atmosphere. The change, while making it more mono coloured, is a very unique one, giving it a very distinct feeling.The soundtrack also deserves a special mention because it truly encapsulates the feeling of Deus Ex on a whole, providing an epic score of emotional but revolutionary sounding music, blending a mixture of the old and new.The gameplay itself is one of great variation, and like many stealth games on the market, like Dishonored and MGS, the game provides whatever playstyle you want to go for, whether it is guns blazing, stealth approach making little noise, strongman which can jump 3 metres in the air (no I didn't make that up). The best part of this is, unlike other games, where the options are available but are gimmicky, and provide no real advantage over just doing the same thing over and over, is that EVERY playstyle is important. playing non lethal and stealth will punish you in some aspects, along with rewarding in others, so preferring to one playstyle will make it more difficult on the player in certain areas, and vice versa.It really feels like the developers wanted to balance out the augmentions (essentially your character's skill trees) to make it feel like you werent some overpowered player, unlike certain games like Dishonored, where you become some one man army. Careful preparation and strategy is rewarded in the long run, and can also affect the game's AMAZING variation in speech in dialogue based on decisions and choices, along with your own playstyles. characters in game will react differently to your different playstyles, while one person may like your upfront ""kill all"" playstyle, another character may take interest in your ""stealthy infiltration"" playstyle. The game makes replayability a joy, just like the first game in the series.I didn't wish to discuss the story, because while it is incredibly good and engaging overall, it is best that the player unravels it himself, and like I said, you carve your own path based on decisions, so most people's storylines will vary.Overall, a game of incredible depth and enjoyment, a close call to its ancestor in the series, and shows what developers can do when they are creative.Here's hoping to a successful and wonderful sequel, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided.

												A little review on a big game!Graphics: Everything looks like it's been drawn using oil paint. It is cool, but gold-brown colors nearly everywhere make game look the same other and other again. At least, you will not hurt your eyes. [8/10]Gameplay: You can complete the game without killing anyone (except for bosses) ... WITHOUT KILLING ANYONE, CARL!. Or, you can go gunz'blazing  and kill every single person in a game, even civilians, they won't do a damn thing xD. Lots of augmentations which will enhance your gaming experience and will give the game higher replayability chance. Also, choices you make really affect gameplay. You might get a few codes from the guy you saved or get a few achievements :P. Maps are big, you can explore them to find new paths to your target. [10/10]Music: ""It's a ♥♥♥♥ing Miracle!"" [11/10]Story: Once upon a time, a guy was thrown through the bulletproof glass and got shot in the head... He barely survives the accident and is supposed to find the group who nearly took his life and took his friends. Game has a high replayability due to tons of choices and approaches you can make. [10/10]Difficulty: Well, it's not that hard to complete the game on it's hardest from your first try, AI is not as smart as it could have been. You can just run'n'gun everyone easily or stealth through the whole game. (Dev's shoud have added: ""I never asked for this"" difficulty :3 ) [8/10]Verdict: ""I ALWAYS ASKED FOR THIS!"", Freaking awesome re-boot, totally a must-have.			"

												So I finished my first playthrough today. I learnt about this game a long time ago, shortly before it's release in a gaming magazine review. I was impressed by what I saw, so it's stayed in the back of my mind until recently.I don't consider myself the master of stealth in any way. This game, like all the Deus exs so far, is centred around Stealth; but it's much more than that. It allows you to be resourceful, persuasive, and is an overall immersive experience, I actually felt like I was a special op agent the entire time.Story: 9/10; The story is great, and I could follow it with rich enthusiasm. I thought it would be predictable, but it wasn't, and was actually emotionally moving/confronting at times. There's a lot to follow, but if you're patient, the story will be quite a fulfiling experience. Several elements of the game broke proffesionalism/realism, and therefore immersion, but it's forgivable.Gameplay: 10/10; the stealth approach wasn't a chore, the combat controls are great, the large selection of weapons and gadgets is nice, and the ability to combine brains and brawn is a welcome change.

												Simple. But complex-My Experience- I was babysitting two dogs for family and this was the only game i could find and decided to delve into the Deus Ex world and see what the fuss was about. After playing it and going absent a while, i was then recommended itThis game has a great story and 2 possible ways of playing it. Full force all guns blazingStealth and mercy knock outs-Atmosphere-The game does alot in the sense of putting an amazing futurisitic outlook. Even more so when you hit the Asian levels.Even the music is good and suspenseful! Tense and fearing-Gameplay- Initially it is hard to get used to because im so used to the gameplay of standard shooters. But eventually you work around it.Although a shooter, it is mostly a stealth and minimalistic invasion game. The shooting is averageThe cybernetic side of the game is exceptional and, like previous said, the two types of gameplay in my opinion will make you have to decide what you really want from your upgrades and cybernetics.Interaction can work itself well, thought be wary of one or two issues with the,,, main characters love interests mother side quest as it can cause issues,,,,Thoroughly enjoyable and a good idea for a futuristic game plot!

												FIX THE GAMEI love the game itself. Played it on my xbox few years ago and decided to get it on PC during sales. There are 2 main problems. #1 the mouse acceleration is designed for xbox or ps3, but not for PC. It means, that you will aim better with controller - not with mouse... on PC... in the half-shooter game... ; #2 Bugs! Lot's of them, of all kinds! And it would not be so bad, if there won't be a 50% chanse that the game will crash while you are hacking computers during gameplay. I could not complete the 2st mission in the game, because of it, and spent 40 mins retrying.			"

												!!! DEUS EX !!!Fortunately, the massive hype surrounding 2011’s “Deus Ex: Human Revolution” was matched by an equally outstanding game. With its beautifully-realized cyberpunk world; stealth gameplay that rivaled top-shelf espionage titles; enough conspiracy theories to shake a tin foil hat at; and, best of all, its return to the “play how you want” formula that made the first game so good, “Human Revolution” was a success.  Despite its brilliance, “Human Revolution” was far from perfect, bogged down by unfairly difficult boss battles that were skewed towards specific play styles, the occasional bland texture, and sometimes wonky enemy A.I. The Updated Version of this game ""Director's Cut"" has solved these problems and polished the game so much more.The main complaint of the game, to date, is its color choice while looking through Adam Jensen's augmented visor. A hew of yellow coats the screen. Acourse this can easily be solved with any one of the many many graphic mods for this game revealing it's true colors. The color choice, for me, was never an issue. With its flowing, open approach to mission structure, thoroughly engrossing story and gorgeous visuals, this is the kind of game that all others should strive to be. While there are some elements that don't feel quite as developed as they should have been, and augmentation is more Hobson's choice than true choice, Human Revolution provides a level of quality that only the most adamant cynic could fail to be impressed by. More importantly, it is everything a fan of Deus Ex could want in a game.I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves Si-fi worlds and rpg based games. A ""Must Play"" game for sure. - XeroSyphon			"

												Games commonly offer you a choice in whether you want to be good or bad. To go guns a blazing or to be a ghost seen by none. Often the way it is done is so obvious that the illusion of choice is broken. This is where this game shines. I was able to play the way I wanted to throughout. If I wanted to sneak around and crawl through grates to get through to the room I wanted I could. If I wanted to speak to someone and convince them to let me in, more often than not, I could. If I wanted to hack the door to let me in undetected I could. Those are only some of the ways that the developers  employ  in progressing through the game. There are some drawbacks however. During the bossfights you would have to exercise some sort of violence against your enemies. Otherwise, this game was a lot of fun. It wasn't just a polarizing good or bad story line but it felt like I could really choose my own path in this cyber punk world. This inlcludes the leveling system. No matter which way you go you'll find that there is no bad power. Although it's old, I'm glad I gave it a chance.			"

												A wonderful game. Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a FPS RPG set in the future where cybernetic augmentations have created a rift between the people in society who can afford them and those who can't. You play as Adam Jensen, a bad♥♥♥♥♥Pros:+ Level design(except bosses): Human Revolution's levels and maps are ridiculously flexible, as there are hundreds of ways to go through the levels. You can sneak past everyone, not harming a soul, or leap in, guns blazing. I've seen a video on Youtube where someone went through the whole game with nothing but a box as a weapon, throwing it to deal damage.+ DLC: The DLC is integrated into the game - I didn't even realize it wasn't part of the regular game.+ Gameplay: There are many kinds of guns and many mods for those guns, which allows you to supplement your chosen playstyle with your preferred weapon(s). You are also offered ""augmentations"", or, in other terms, a skill tree. These can significantly affect playstyle, as you can leap higher or take no fall damage, punch or see through walls, shoot rockets, take less damage, etc. There are also parts of the game where you talk to people. These scenes are relatively fluid, as you choose your dialogue options in an attempt to persuade or interrogate. It is very similar to an actual, real life conversation.+ Story: Your typical action-packed conspiracy theory rich Deus Ex story.Cons:- Uneven FPS(maybe just my problem)- The graphic aren't very good, but the cutscenes look nice.- Boss battles: ""Boss"" battles are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ as it forces you to go ""guns blazing"" playstyle and feels out of place.I can add more to this list, but that would be nitpicking an otherwise solid game.I rate this game 7.25/10 - recommended to just about anybody.

												Played the original human revolution. This game got me immediatly due to the theme. I like the conspiracy concept with the near-futuristic slightly possible technological advancement.The added missing link will boost the playtime, however, after completing the original within 30 hours, I was a bit shocked by the ease of difficulty imho. Maybe this is due to me playing Deus Ex 1 a lot ;). I should note that i didn't do all the side missions, not looked for all the books.The biggest downer after playing 20 hours or so is seeing 2 hub districts and realising these are the only 2. Though I did not expect anything, I was hoping for a larger plot, and maybe 1 more hub city. The missing link, nor the directors cut don't feature a new hub city, though there was mention of it during development.All in all, I'd recommend this game due to theme, game franchise done right and gameplay. The story is ok, a bit short in my humble opinion. The difficulty could've had 1 more mode (the 'do not sound any alarm achievement' was easily achievable) where the AI would shine more.			"

												It's a masterpiece in my view. I always want to play it over and over again. Sometimes the enemies can be stupid enough to don't see you while in direct eye contact but it's a game I can't judge it. It gives you multiple choices. Like kill or spare and go slient or loud. You always have to choose the sensible choice depens on your situation. You play as an ex-SWAT Adam Jansen. The whole game connects to you because you are special. I am not giving any spoilers so find out yourself. But sometimes it can be confusing because there is so much detail and miscellaneous things. You should focus on the main problem and the main story. Of course there is side quests which give more experince points and some information about the main quest but you don't have to do those in order to complete the game. With ""Director's Cut"" version ""Missing Link"" DLC comes along with the game. There is a lot of weapon selection and weapon setups. Silencer, laser targeting etc. You will definetly enjoy this game. And don't forget to check ""Praxis Kit Locations"" on the Steam Forum because you are going to need it. :)			"

												[Small Spoilers]Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut is a solid first person action/stealth game set in a wonderful, cyberpunk future. You play as Adam Jensen, an ex-swat member, who now is the lead security at a massive biotech company. After an accident at the facility, you became badly wounded. Thanks to the power of ""augmentatioins"" you were rebuilt, and now possess many possible enhancements to help better your stealth, combat, and various other things. You're tasked with finding out what actually happened the day of the attack, why it happened, and who is behind it. For my playthough I mainly focused on stealth. Other than boss fights, which even after being enhanced in the Director's Cut are still dull, I did not have kill a single individual (which I really like). Exploration, things like finding hidden air vents to crawl through, hacking doors, and hacking into computers, are really satisfying and help set the atmospehere. I encountered a glitch late game that didn't let me progress, but other than that I found few bugs. Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut is a soild game. I highly recomend it, especially if you're a fan of steath. Gameplay: 9/10 (Focusing primarly on stealth, not gunplay)World Design: 7/10 (The ""hubs"" are made of many different levels, because of this it can sometimes be confusing on where exactly you're susposed to go.)Graphics: 7/10Voice-Acting: 7/10 (The main characters are voiced very well, but some of the minior characters are absolutly horrible.)Overall: 7.5/10			"

												Human Revolution is an awesome game. It took me a while to get into the dark scenario and to be honest, I didn't do much exploration. The story however is okay and the gameplay, especially when playing stealthy, is just awesome. The controls (i used keyboard and mouse) where smooth and did what I wanted in the very most cases. This makes sneaking around and even waiting and observing fun while keeping it a challenge at the same time.The story feels a bit generic but has quite a few surprising moments and decent characters. There could've been more though and especially the end is disappointing. Since your previous descisions don't really play a role for the ending sequence you'll see, there is practically no re-play value to it. So you'll get some 20 hours of really nice gameplay with a motivating story. Since the game is utterly cheap these days i certainly recommend it to anyone who does not absolutely hate anything first person.			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut is an amazing game with all of it's weaknesses fixed. Terrible bossfights used to be it's downside but now it's completelly rewamped and allows you to kill bosses with bit more of variety. If you wonder whenever you should buy this game or or not I'd say it's worth full price. It's well written, well executed game which will make you play it more than once. You may play how you please (rambo mode or ghost), but I find it more challenging and fun to play as hacker/ghost type since you heavily rely on stealth. You play as Adam Jensen ex-swat who got augments against his will and is pretty conflicted whenever he speaks to somebody about it. As much as he tries to look like a victim his augments makes him BAMF. Anyway after accident in which his girlfriend died he tries to live on as an augmented person. 6 months after he got augmented he got a call from his boss asking for Adam's help. And so your journey starts to find who's responsible for an incident in which Adam's girlfriend presumably died and destroyed her research and why terrorists wanted to take out Sarrif Industries out of augment bussiness.Overall good game, finished it 4 times and enjoyed it 8/10.

												Excellent overall game.  It's a cover based rpg shooter where you can go guns blazing or use stealth to work your way around.  You can do a no kill run or as close to it as possible which change things up here and there but nothing too significant (some achievements are locked though I think) which is always fun for a challenge.  I played stealth, leveled my hacking as fast as I could and hacked everything.  I really enjoyed playing the game that way.  33 hours on my first play through, definitely worth the buy.			"

												To me Deus Ex: Human Revolution is an absolutely brilliant and astonishing cyber-punk. The environment of the game is simply fantastic: beautiful cities, locations that you want to explore, characters you want to talk to and quests that can be completed in so many ways that the game requires at least 3 playthrough to see all possible scenarios. In this game a traditional RPG and a linear shooter are so intensely mixed giving the impression of a whole different game genre. I can’t compare the visual aspect of the “Directors cut” with the original since I never saw the original. But, in conclusion: 20 out of 10! There is nothing like it, a masterpiece!			"

												pros: multiple conversation choices, main story has a ton of content (can be a bit convoluted, full of plot twists & conspiracies), side quests are interesting to do, many interesting characters (except pritchard), multiple routes to approach an objective, multiple endings, a lot of objects in the world are interactable & plenty of things to hack, hacking mini game is a mix of skill & luck, expansive quest hubs, multiple skill upgrades & weapon selection (lethal & non-lethal), epic soundtrack, director's cut offers extras on the main menucons: frame rate drops especially when loading map sections, clunky movement & controls, graphical glitches & instability (ive experienced several crashes), I couldn't complete a quest because the npc bugged out (I had to leave the instance & return so the npc could reset), im supposedly augmented but I can't sprint longer than 2 seconds, awkward animation every time you do a melee takedown, map display is unhelpful especially when trying to navigate higher & lower levels, a lot of missions have you backtrack through long distances, low res skyboxes, boss battles are tedious & uninteresting, terrible execution of the final game objectiveOverall, this game is a complete rpg/fps experience with 20+ hours of content to offer. I suggest trying to hack as much as possible to gain all the bonuses. Eidos Montreal can't for the life of them create a map display that is easy to understand & navigate, they should outsource mapping to a different studio imo. This game to me was a worthwhile experience from start to finish, which I never asked for this.Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Directors Cut has my recommendation.			"

												Deus ex: Human Revolution is an amazing dark and gritty FPS set in the dystopian future of 2022 where humans are divided on how they feel about the new augmentation technology. Augmentations allow humans to rise above their limitations by being able to do things such as react quicker, run faster, or jump higher among many other things. The story focuses on an ex-swat turned private security director, Adam Jensen, for Sarif Industries, a major biotech corporation. Because of a discovery that was made at Sarif Industries a team of highly augmented mercenaries attacked their headquarters and killed the team responsible for the discovery making sure that it would never reach the light of day severely injuring Adam. As a result of his injuries Adam had to be heavily augmented against his will to keep him alive. With his new found abilities it is up to Adam to track down those responsible for the deaths of the scientists and to find out the truth about what really happened that day. The player has the ability to choose how Adam goes about a situation being able to choose between dealing with enemies passively or lethally which changes the way characters address him. With multiple endings the game offers many choices for the player to make that affects the story. Overall, the game poses a question that can be applied to science even today a decade before the game takes place which is should humans play god and it is up to the play to choose where they stand for themselves based on what they see throughout the game.

												DE:HR is a fantastic experience with enjoyable writing and acting, mature themes and some of the coolest art direction I’ve seen. My main disappointment is how it motivates you to play in a very narrow way (a certain stealth approach); rendering all of the cool gadgets you collect null. I’ll explain later.The game throws you right into the middle of things, and you need to pay attention to understand who’s who and what’s what. There’s no slow prologue telling how the world came to be in the state it is and how you find yourself there. It's something I like, because it helps establish this sense of realism that sticks throughout the entire game - that this is an actual world, not dependent on your existence to continue moving. You are part of it, not the center of it. Still, I’ll help you with the basic orientation.You’re Adam Jensen, former SWAT and currently chief of security at a biotech company, that is at the forefront of human augmentation (mechanical upgrades to humans) research and development. You are an existing and set character, not a blank slate, so the choices you make are limited to what is reasonable for Adam to do. Many people enjoy creating their characters out of scratch. This is not that kind of game. Personally, I prefer this format. It’s a fine balance that offers some amount of input, but not too much to the point that it sacrifices the depth of the story just to give you more choices that end up being shallow. Speaking of which, the consequences of your decisions are also pleasantly felt later on. I didn't find them to be too drastic, but the small nods were satisfying nevertheless.Augmentation is the main topic the world is embroiled in at 2027, and the debate about its pros and cons extends to ethical, political, economical and social aspects. It’s a nice take on sci-fi that manages to keep things still relatively grounded and credible, while also enjoying some creative liberties where the developers wanted to emphasize the subject. Suspension of disbelief is required in some places more than others, but overall the game manages to sell a believable, alternate world. And it’s a bleak one. Earth is in the midst of a cyber renaissance, but once you move away from the socialites to the streets and alleyways, you will feel an atmosphere that is opposite from the optimistic aura of revolution that is present among the upper class. The change the world is going through isn’t embraced by all, doesn’t grace all, and there is an obvious tension in the air. The title of the next game is Mankind Divided, but the hints and seeds of that segregation are already found here.The progression through levels is linear. While you revisit some of them, they’re in a changed state, and you can never go back to a level you’ve finished. They’re divided into the regular hub areas you know from most RPGs – open areas for your exploration to restock, talk with people, do side quests, etc – and the hostile levels that are much more fight or stealth oriented. Less talk, more action.Augmentations are the source of your abilities, and they’re varied enough to make leveling up an exciting occurrence. DE:HR isn't plagued by endless passive upgrades (e.g. 4% damage increase) that leave you with nothing to look forward to. You have plenty of enhancements that are new abilities, which allow you to do things you couldn’t previously achieve. There’s an interesting dialogue system that triggers with certain, important NPCs. One augmentation helps you better analyze these key figures to find the correct answer. Hacking is everywhere, and the mini-game that seems confusing at first turns out to be simple and fun. You can choose to jump higher to reach new areas, punch through weak walls or move heavy objects to open additional routes. And on the RPG note, you even have an old-school inventory system that forces you to choose what to take and what to ditch. Weapons or stealth equipment? You can't have everything.All these abilities and gadgets have their uses thanks to great level design. Stealth games can be compared to puzzles, and each room in DE:HR has multiple solutions to it. You can crawl through vents around your enemies, hack into the security system and turn turrets or robots against them, move huge crates that offer you a shortcut or jump up high to snipe them. You also have some cool tactical augmentations that make things easier and allow you to better plan or execute your actions. You can see through walls, turn invisible or run silently without alerting enemies. It’s all very fun, and part of the reason for my inflated play time – other than just enjoying the stroll slowly and taking in all the details of this beautifully crafted world (or, uh, alt-tabbing) – is because I always wanted to explore each region to its fullest after I cleared it of enemies, in order to see all the alternate routes I didn’t utilize.You can also just shoot your way through, but here is my main complaint about the game, and it’s a fairly big one. DE:HR, strangely, offers you a huge array of tools, from lethal to non-lethal, loud or silent, but doesn’t encourage their use. You can silently kill people with your crossbow, loudly blast them with a rocket launcher, tranquilize them, stun them, throw grenades, set mines, use robots, or just engage in massive gunfights with several fun options in weaponry. And while the fighting mechanics aren’t top of the end, from what I toyed around with, they’re still fun. On the hardest difficulty you die very quickly if you’re reckless, but your enemies aren’t bullet sponges, either – and that makes for intense battles. The problem with all of this is that DE:HR rewards an extremely specific game style. It’s not even that it’s just stealth – it’s stealth takedowns (melee). Meaning that even all your stealth equipment might go unused.If you don’t care about min-maxing, this won’t matter to you. But I have this suspicion that most gamers do want to unlock more powers, and when you get 10 XP for shooting down an enemy from afar, or 50 for taking them down in a non-lethal manner from up close, I imagine you’ll be inclined to do the latter. That 50 piles up in the long run. You also get bonuses at the end of the mission, depending on whether or not you were spotted, and whether an alarm was raised. Together, these bonuses amount to a huge sum that you’ll never enjoy in an aggressive approach, since it doesn’t offer some alternate reward for different achievements. This also caused me to quick-load over and over, since letting things develop dynamically felt more like a punishment. By the end of the game, a non-lethal, melee takedown playstyle will end up rewarding the player significantly more, mechanically, but will also become very repetitive. It’s disappointing that the game offers so many fun instruments, but motivates you with its XP distribution to use one single function alone throughout the entire playthrough. There’s an NG+ option in the director’s cut, and I might do a second run sometime in the future with my developed build, so I can enjoy fighting my enemies guilt-free and without that fear of missing out. But for a single playthrough, it ends up feeling like wasted potential. The gameplay offers you many options but draws a thick, red circle around a very specific one with a big smiley above it.It’s a major complaint from my perspective, but regardless, as a whole, the experience remains terrific. For anyone interested in a stealth-oriented game with a mature and interesting story and awesome setting, DE:HR is highly recommended. For those who want a sci-fi action game, you can find it here too, albeit discriminated against. You need to approach it with a mentality that doesn’t fret about receiving the bare minimum XP.			"

												Deus Ex:  Human Revolution does justice to the original.  With the augmentation system, you can approach every obstacle in multiple ways.  And this opens up gameplay to multiple styles -- whether you go guns blazing, or stealth your way (a la Metal Gear Solid).  This is a game worth multiple playthroughs since you can always vary the approach.			"

[This an elaborate/analytical review not only from the perspective of Deus Ex 1, but also from a die hard fan of the original since the years it was made. If you haven't played DX1, don't read the following - just buy Human Revolution, you'll absolutely love it]Seems like Eidos Montreal decided they could never equal or better the first game, and given the colossal mess that was DX2, they made DX3 a tribute to the first, instead of an independent prequel. The number of similarities to DX1 are overwhelming, and so many elements are copy-pasted that as a die-hard DX1 fan, it makes for a bittersweet experience; it's a reminiscent mashup of things most people love: DX1 + Batman + or other games, yet it lacks depth and originality.Deus ExAdam Jenson from DX3 and JC Denton from DX1. Same syllables in name. If that sounds like a silly similarity, relax, I'm just easing you in. The list is endless: [spoilers] being captured, getting set free by an anonymous hacker, your pilot's chopper gets blown but you had a chance to prevent that fate, ladies-restroom scene, identical ending choices; Illuminati; Dark Age; ""Merge and Rule,"" conspiracy theories, Francis - your hacker colleague. Even the so called ""Purity First"" group look like a graphically enhanced version of NSF personnel BatmanThe original DX3 was orange/gold bearing a stark resemblance to the general theme of the movie The Dark Knight. They sort of went overboard with that, but after backlash from critics and players, ended up normalizing it in the Director's Cut edition. If you pay close attention to the Detroit music, there is that famous intro theme to Batman TAS, which I'm surprised they would throw in there and expect to get away with it. Moreover, a lot of people have even commented that Adam Jenson talks like Batman.ProsThe hacking mini-game is a terrific change, Typhoon augmentation, tons of ""easter eggs,"" holstering your weapon, overall the music is very cinematic and atmospheric, with cultural influences too such as the zhong-hu instrument in ""Hengsha LIMB Clinic"", and vending machines are finally made useful, environments are much more ""fuller"" than doors/vents on an empty canvass like in the original Deus Ex, different ammo takes up inventory space (instead of one kind of ammo for everything), which is realistic. There is still a lot of detail in the world, which is great as it makes the world immersive. Critical conversations actually require you to listen to the other person, analyze their personality, and at times even their body language, which is brilliant.ConsBut 13 years have passed since DX1 and the AI still says, ""huh, what? nevermind I'm hearing things"" after you drop something in front of their face and successfully hide. This AI mechanic was revolutionary when it was introduced in Thief but games haven't built upon that. I threw 5 cartons on top of several open cubicles at a police station and everyone only said, ""what was that?"" and got ""suspicious."" This even goes for sound. Takedowns don't alert an enemy standing 2 feet away, even when the person you're taking down lets out a muffled squeal. I felt that was weak. Any alarmed state can be nullified if you simply ""walk away"" from the scene, which is so manipulative it becomes unfun, and I think is an element largely influenced from the batman games. Of all the games whose AI they imitated, if only they would have sampled Metal Gear Solid; once there is a state of alarm it never reduces back to normalcy.DX1 broke boundaries, and was The actual ""revolution"" in the gaming world. DX3 is just a revision of the first, and a safe recipe of things that all gamers would love. It's unfortunate that Warren Spector was excised from the DX3 project by Eidos Montreal. Silly how the world works, doesn't it? He made a mind-blowing blockbuster of a game (DX1), but DX2 fell short of that standard, therefore he was boycotted. Cruel, given that he was the main brain behind this whole series, how could you leave such a man out completely? If DX3 has a 9/10 rating for you, then relatively DX1 should be 11/10. Eidos played it safe when making this prequel, and I guess you can't blame them. Not everyone can improve on perfection, but many can merely honor or mimic it, which is what they've resorted to.			"

An interesting story, amazing gameplay with multiple paths to your objective, and some of the best voice acting I've ever heard make Deus Ex a ""revolutionary"" approach to FPS RPG games. The story is absolutely amazing, that always keeps you interested throughout it's main course. With so many twists and turns it's hard to tell who's good and who's bad. Not only that, the voice acting in this game is superb, with real emotion pouring through every line. Gameplay is so varied, you could play this game 4 times and get a different way to every level and different ending every damn time. The graphics are OK at best, but who the hell cares when you have this deep of a game. 9/10			"

												To me Deus Ex: Human Revolution is an absolutely brilliant and astonishing cyber-punk. The environment of the game is simply fantastic: beautiful cities, locations that you want to explore, characters you want to talk to and quests that can be completed in so many ways that the game requires at least 3 playthrough to see all possible scenarios. In this game a traditional RPG and a linear shooter are so intensely mixed giving the impression of a whole different game genre. I can’t compare the visual aspect of the “Directors cut” with the original since I never saw the original. But, in conclusion: 20 out of 10! There is nothing like it, a masterpiece!			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is number 8 on my top 10 favorite games list; it isn't the greatest game ever made, but it definitely deserves your attention and a few bucks from your wallet. It takes the fantastic concepts of the first DE game, fixes what Invisible War messed up, and adds a thick and convoluted new story to enjoy. My personal score for Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a 9/10. There are a few kinks that keep it away from perfection, particularly the less-than-ideal gunplay mechanics, but it's an overall blast to play and certainly shouldn't be missed by any fan of games with a strong story and lots of replayability.

												This is a great game for people who like stealth + cyberpunk games.  It has an interesting , well thought-out storyline and beautiful graphics.  It supports very different styles of gameplay, deciding on whether you're more interested in stealth or shooting, and you can switch back and forth between play styles as you choose.  Great mechanics and gameplay overall.  Definitely one of the best games I've ever played; I really can't recommend it enough.My only criticism was that the DLC expansion seemed sort of shoved into the main storyline; it didn't fit particularly well and the mechanic of waking up somewhere with you equipment + augmentations all gone felt entirely overdone.

												Basically a masterpiece. Except for the final boss fight, which you can beat in literally 10 seconds if you have the laser rifle. Nope, I'm not kidding. However, the flexibility this game allows you is quite amazing. You can take pretty much any path to beat the game, and there's so many side quests you probably won't ever beat the game. And if you open up the game, play the prologue, and think ""this sucks"", remember, the game normally has an ammo counter. Only issue besides the boss fight is that after you get  taken on the boat and strapped into the EMP chair	 in about chapter 15, you lose all of your weapons. Probably not a disaster if you had a 10mm pistol and a stun gun, but a bit more of a disaster if you had a laser sighted, tracking bullets, silenced, damage upgraded combat rifle, a laser-sight damage upgraded silenced armor piercing 10mm pistol, a silenced sniper rifle (which can only be found in one place to my knowledge), a grenade launcher (again, you  can only find it in one place) and a laser rifle with 600 ammo like I did. I considered rage-quitting after that, but just stick it out, there's only like 5 more hours if you forget about all of the side quests.Worth it. Take the time to beat the game.

												Deus ex: Human Revolution is an amazing dark and gritty FPS set in the dystopian future of 2022 where humans are divided on how they feel about the new augmentation technology. Augmentations allow humans to rise above their limitations by being able to do things such as react quicker, run faster, or jump higher among many other things. The story focuses on an ex-swat turned private security director, Adam Jensen, for Sarif Industries, a major biotech corporation. Because of a discovery that was made at Sarif Industries a team of highly augmented mercenaries attacked their headquarters and killed the team responsible for the discovery making sure that it would never reach the light of day severely injuring Adam. As a result of his injuries Adam had to be heavily augmented against his will to keep him alive. With his new found abilities it is up to Adam to track down those responsible for the deaths of the scientists and to find out the truth about what really happened that day. The player has the ability to choose how Adam goes about a situation being able to choose between dealing with enemies passively or lethally which changes the way characters address him. With multiple endings the game offers many choices for the player to make that affects the story. Overall, the game poses a question that can be applied to science even today a decade before the game takes place which is should humans play god and it is up to the play to choose where they stand for themselves based on what they see throughout the game.

												Just perfect. This game should be played by everyone at least once. It has everything: well-developed gameplay, beautiful story, good graphics, everything. This is the perfect way to spend a good afternoon after work or school. Plus, every DLC is packed in this now relatively cheap Director's Cut edition,  which finally delivers a complete, finished and fully enjoyable product.Buy it and play it from the beginning 'til the end, you'll have no regrets.

												Completed DE:HR (100%) in 45h yet still managed to enjoy DE:HR - Director's Cut for ... 70 hours more!Slightly improved graphics since non-Director's Cut version and integrated Missing Link DLC are pretty nice additional features to the already great story the game offers. However the best new thing for me are boss battle changes - it's good enough to get the Director's Cut and play it.Loved the developer's commentary (thanks to the guide that lists the location of all of them) - it shows how much effort was put into the game, changes view of the game a bit, makes you look around even more often and notice small things left in the game you might have missed. Even if you have played original, Director's Cut version is best excuse to experience the story again, and again, and again ....			"

												This game is possibley my favorite game and story ever made (apart from Deus Ex GOTYE) it takes you a variety of places and absoluteley nails it with the sound track and atmosphere. there is ALOT to do and it's worth doing, maybe 30 hours + if you do all the side quests and explore the universe.9/10~SPOILERS~Only down side is that because this is a preqel, the game has a set destiny. this is a issue towards the end where it gives you 3 choices to end the game on, you stand there and think: ""well, it doesn't really matter what one i choose, because the universe will just be a run down, terrorist riddled, infected and corrupt world with my back stabbing x girl friend made a clones/virus (for no reason) as depicted in Deus Ex."" Another thing i thought was stupid was the lack of closure. Assuming you chose the canon ending and killed your self and every one else in Panchea, it just didn't really answer your questions: was Megan all ways working for Bob Page from the beggining? wich project did she end up working on? why did she allow all the suffering (and future suffering) ""just for science""?In the end, it doen't matter who you do or don't kill.all in all its a epic game and series, it just could have enlightend us more. 9/10			"

												Really enjoyed it. The freedom of choosing your own play style is woven well into level design and story telling. In my eyes, the weakest part was the ""Missing Link"" quest line, that was a DLC/Add-on in the original game and ""built-in"" here in the Director's Cut (repetitive and with hardly any consquence on the main story). It just felt out of place while playing it.Played it the stealth way on ""Give me Deus Ex"" (hardest difficulty) and was very pleased with it. The cover system works, augmentations are interesting and using them is fun. Also, there is plenty of optional lore detail hidden on datapads and computers. The issue of human augmentation, with progress, purity and morality in between, managed to captivate me like no other in any other video game lately.Graphics and audio are satisfying (really liked the soundtrack), most animations are fluent and good looking. On the other hand: cut scenes vary vastly in terms of quality (some seem old and some might have been freshly added with the Director's Cut) and a lot of face textures and animations look like PlayStation2 imports.Well presented, immersive and fascinating vision of the future with some story lengths and gameplay flaws you can easily overlook if you let yourself in for it. 8/10			"

												I can declare - without any doubt - that this is my favorite game. It helped me see things different and finally I could be in a universe which really interest me: our world. I believe that this game shows the truth. The fate of mankind both in the present days and in the future. This version includes all the extra content you can get, the Missing Link DLC (see below) and many hours of developers' commentar. I played through the regular version in 24 hours, while this one took more than 40. Worth the extra money?Definitely!But don't worry, I'm not going to chant odes about how great this game is, simply because it isn't. From a technical perspective, mostly. First of all, this Director's Cut version uses an older build of the game, so the many bugs they fixed in the normal version are still present. These include graphical issues, like presented here, here, here, and here.  The character animations - especially during dialogues - are also ugly, and it seems they forgot mimics too. Although they said they had a lot technological limitations, it's a shame considering it came out in 2011. I found one npc fail as well. Also, I had problems with getting a decent fps. It dropped many times below the playeable limit. It was nice to see how they improved the visuals in the DLC. It was stunning . The ""improved AI"" as they promoted is still dumb as a rock. Once you get into a fight they can hunt you down, but as far as you prefer stealthing, they're easy to fool. Too easy.Other than these, it's an outstanding piece of art. As I listened the developers I kinda realized how much effort they've put into this game. Level designers, voice actors, story writers, everybody did an honest and dedicated job. The story, is by far the most complex and well-written I have seen. It always keeps the tension, has many twists and makes you play more only to see what'll happen next. They hit the nail on the head with this cyber-renessaince design. It fits very well to the atmosphere. I mean, it creates the atmosphere. A dark near future world full of transhumanist aspirations and the contrary between technologycal advancement and human dignity. Takedown animations are badass, the weapon arsenal is diverse, the stealth mechanics works as well as combat situations. There are plenty of ways how you can achieve your goal. I discovered many (and I mean MANY) other alternate routes for the second playthrough. One very important thing I can not go past without a word is the music. Michael McCann is an amazing talent, his melodies define my every day life. I listen to this album regularly, and yet I can not get enough of it. It's a masteriece. To sum up this review, you must really play this game if you're interested in the topics mentioned above. It worth every minute you spend with it. Wait for a sale, then go, buy it!			"

												Gem in gaming industry.Playing as Adam Jensen, an ex-SWAT specialist,you can both kill and be pacifist,you can play in old ""Rambo"" style and you can be stealthy hacker who avoids every contact with enemies,turning their weapons against them,Only flaw is necessity of fighting boss battles which abolishes a concept of game where you don't need to kill anyone(like original Deus Ex),but that is one flaw that can be overlooked.All in all,masterpiece,plus the story is amazing,especially if you are fan of conspiracy theories.

Everything, from the music, to the story and setting, to that rush you get from finally sneaking into the optimal position to punch an enemy in the face and slipping into the nearest air vent with his money, is satisfying in ways that few other games can replicate.If you feel the need to play just one hard-boiled science-fiction action/stealth/hacking/chatting/CONSPIRACY game this year, ask for this and accept no substitutes.

												Played the original human revolution. This game got me immediatly due to the theme. I like the conspiracy concept with the near-futuristic slightly possible technological advancement.The added missing link will boost the playtime, however, after completing the original within 30 hours, I was a bit shocked by the ease of difficulty imho. Maybe this is due to me playing Deus Ex 1 a lot ;). I should note that i didn't do all the side missions, not looked for all the books.The biggest downer after playing 20 hours or so is seeing 2 hub districts and realising these are the only 2. Though I did not expect anything, I was hoping for a larger plot, and maybe 1 more hub city. The missing link, nor the directors cut don't feature a new hub city, though there was mention of it during development.All in all, I'd recommend this game due to theme, game franchise done right and gameplay. The story is ok, a bit short in my humble opinion. The difficulty could've had 1 more mode (the 'do not sound any alarm achievement' was easily achievable) where the AI would shine more.			"

												It's a masterpiece in my view. I always want to play it over and over again. Sometimes the enemies can be stupid enough to don't see you while in direct eye contact but it's a game I can't judge it. It gives you multiple choices. Like kill or spare and go slient or loud. You always have to choose the sensible choice depens on your situation. You play as an ex-SWAT Adam Jansen. The whole game connects to you because you are special. I am not giving any spoilers so find out yourself. But sometimes it can be confusing because there is so much detail and miscellaneous things. You should focus on the main problem and the main story. Of course there is side quests which give more experince points and some information about the main quest but you don't have to do those in order to complete the game. With ""Director's Cut"" version ""Missing Link"" DLC comes along with the game. There is a lot of weapon selection and weapon setups. Silencer, laser targeting etc. You will definetly enjoy this game. And don't forget to check ""Praxis Kit Locations"" on the Steam Forum because you are going to need it. :)			"

												[Small Spoilers]Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut is a solid first person action/stealth game set in a wonderful, cyberpunk future. You play as Adam Jensen, an ex-swat member, who now is the lead security at a massive biotech company. After an accident at the facility, you became badly wounded. Thanks to the power of ""augmentatioins"" you were rebuilt, and now possess many possible enhancements to help better your stealth, combat, and various other things. You're tasked with finding out what actually happened the day of the attack, why it happened, and who is behind it. For my playthough I mainly focused on stealth. Other than boss fights, which even after being enhanced in the Director's Cut are still dull, I did not have kill a single individual (which I really like). Exploration, things like finding hidden air vents to crawl through, hacking doors, and hacking into computers, are really satisfying and help set the atmospehere. I encountered a glitch late game that didn't let me progress, but other than that I found few bugs. Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut is a soild game. I highly recomend it, especially if you're a fan of steath. Gameplay: 9/10 (Focusing primarly on stealth, not gunplay)World Design: 7/10 (The ""hubs"" are made of many different levels, because of this it can sometimes be confusing on where exactly you're susposed to go.)Graphics: 7/10Voice-Acting: 7/10 (The main characters are voiced very well, but some of the minior characters are absolutly horrible.)Overall: 7.5/10			"

												!!! DEUS EX !!!Fortunately, the massive hype surrounding 2011’s “Deus Ex: Human Revolution” was matched by an equally outstanding game. With its beautifully-realized cyberpunk world; stealth gameplay that rivaled top-shelf espionage titles; enough conspiracy theories to shake a tin foil hat at; and, best of all, its return to the “play how you want” formula that made the first game so good, “Human Revolution” was a success.  Despite its brilliance, “Human Revolution” was far from perfect, bogged down by unfairly difficult boss battles that were skewed towards specific play styles, the occasional bland texture, and sometimes wonky enemy A.I. The Updated Version of this game ""Director's Cut"" has solved these problems and polished the game so much more.The main complaint of the game, to date, is its color choice while looking through Adam Jensen's augmented visor. A hew of yellow coats the screen. Acourse this can easily be solved with any one of the many many graphic mods for this game revealing it's true colors. The color choice, for me, was never an issue. With its flowing, open approach to mission structure, thoroughly engrossing story and gorgeous visuals, this is the kind of game that all others should strive to be. While there are some elements that don't feel quite as developed as they should have been, and augmentation is more Hobson's choice than true choice, Human Revolution provides a level of quality that only the most adamant cynic could fail to be impressed by. More importantly, it is everything a fan of Deus Ex could want in a game.I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves Si-fi worlds and rpg based games. A ""Must Play"" game for sure. - XeroSyphon			"

												It's 2027, and the world reaches new heights in technology with every day passing. New innovations arise, such as augmentation implants that allow people to achieve an higher level of body prowess such as thinking faster, move faster, and act faster.However, this apparently incredible technology is hiding a terrible flaw: in most of cases people bodies do not react well with their mechanical parts, causing excruciating pain and suffering to their owners. Many industries in the world are trying to obtain a new type of augmentation that can solve the issue, without the need for augmented people to take on drugs in order to relieve.Sarif Industries is very close to achieve this, however soon before the research is completed the structure is savagedly attacked by a team of mercenaries which seem to murder every scientist in cold blood. Adam Jensen, the playable character, head of security in Sarif Industries, is involved in the attack and suffers severe body trauma, almost dying from it. However he turns out to be still alive when medical aid comes, and the only way to save him is by implanting augmentations on his body.After six months spent recovering, he decides to take on himself the investigation about the slaughter:eventually he will find himself in something way bigger than he expected, involving governments and corporations worldwide.The game, which is a prequel of the first Deus Ex, is strictly loyal to the original, featuring many different ways to solve missions, which the player will discern based on his/her playstyle. Many easter eggs about the first game are present, which add a well thought touch from the developers.Worth noticing are the game's length and focus on the plot: the story results interesting and the characters' development is to be praised as well.

												I had a blast.---Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut is the first and only game yet, that I played from this series. As the original game came out in 2000, it wasn't the type of game I liked to play back then. And the sequel from 2003 seemed to be a disappointment. So I skipped these games...... and I got more than positively surprised, without knowing what I had to expect:The gameplay with all his diversity is awesome. It's always your decision how you play (upseen from the boss fights). You can be a stone cold killer, a tactician, hacker or a sissy. That's also depending on the cool assorment of augmentations (""skills"") from which you can choose. The atmosphere/graphic/audio is amazing. You get literally drawn into the world of cyberpunk. Only the textures and cutscenes could have a higher resolution for a game that was released in 2011.One thing I didn't liked was ""The Missing Link"" DLC which got added to the last third of the story mode. It just doesnt't fit in. Upseen from that... if you want to check out everything while playing the game.. hacking stuff and reading (all) ebooks can be a little bit bugging. But just a bit.I give it a 9/10			"

												One of a kind, cyberpunk RPG with astonishing storyline, 4 completely different endings, plenty of side quests and choices almost in every (side) quest. Full stealth entire walkthrough option make the game different and epic (i`ve been doing Foxiest of the Hounds /stealth achievement/ for a three walkthrough, so strict and challenging stealth requirements needed), heaven for stealth based gamers.Graphic is just,, idiomatic,, but cool sceneries (future hongkong), Adam`s mystery voice and good sounds/music makes up the atmosphere of high-tech future.DLC is worthy, well accurated between 2 chapters, pretty long and tough (unless u cleanin da house).Only thing i dont like on Director`s cut edition is really loud discussions of developers, sometimes interesting stories of creating a game, but most of the times, one would like to enjoy story, and that LOUD conversations just ruin it :)For achievement hunters i`d say prepare for at least 3 walkthrough even with good schedule. A lot of achievements based on choices, so reload save is also the way. With some achievements, study google hard, or die cryin and playin it a couple of times :)For me personally, this game is masterpiece and a jewel in my ""perfect games"" collection.			"

												Excellent game all around.  I'd recommend it just that much more for people who really like to explore and become immersed in a good story.THE UPSIDE:Great story that somehow manages to combine a frighteningly possible future with a slightly ridiculous one (IMHO).  There are numerous opportunities to really engross yourself in the 'blade runner esq' universe.  While there isn't anything super innovative in the cover mechanics it's very polished and smooth.  The different chooses in play style really let you decide how you want to advances through areas.  There are generally not one, not two, but three or more different ways to accomplish almost all the objectives in the game, using various augments, stealth, manipulation or even brute force.  There are many paths and alternative ways to go about virtually everything.THE DOWNSIDE:I have two major complaints about the game... the first.  I LOATH the way the game handles 'lethal' take downs.  Not being able to silently take down an opponent lethally is just comical.  Some of the take downs are SO over the top and just ridiculously unnecessary it makes no sense why you couldn't simply use your blades to quietly dispatch an opponent, but instead are forced to do this elaborate take down which could do nothing but draw attention.  Conversely the 'non lethal' take downs being no less over the top (most of the time) are silent despite the guy being thrown about and clearly verbalizing this 'discomfort'.  In a game that does such a great job with immersion i find this very irritating.The only other complaint i have is with the hacking. Great little mini-game the first 50 times... the next 100 are pretty damn irritating... after that you want to just cry.  The problem is if your like me and enjoy the enormous amount of back-story hidden behind the terminals found throughout the game you find it very hard to just skip them.THE LOWDOWN:  7.5/10It's good not great... the game was a good fit for me... but i can see people who arn't as concerned with immersion finding this game pretty tedious.

												I had a blast.---Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut is the first and only game yet, that I played from this series. As the original game came out in 2000, it wasn't the type of game I liked to play back then. And the sequel from 2003 seemed to be a disappointment. So I skipped these games...... and I got more than positively surprised, without knowing what I had to expect:The gameplay with all his diversity is awesome. It's always your decision how you play (upseen from the boss fights). You can be a stone cold killer, a tactician, hacker or a sissy. That's also depending on the cool assorment of augmentations (""skills"") from which you can choose. The atmosphere/graphic/audio is amazing. You get literally drawn into the world of cyberpunk. Only the textures and cutscenes could have a higher resolution for a game that was released in 2011.One thing I didn't liked was ""The Missing Link"" DLC which got added to the last third of the story mode. It just doesnt't fit in. Upseen from that... if you want to check out everything while playing the game.. hacking stuff and reading (all) ebooks can be a little bit bugging. But just a bit.I give it a 9/10			"

												Awesome! Flawless! Great replayability.It has a great story and setting, and it's a stealth game... or is it not? Depends. It all depends on your style of play.You can complete it all while moving like a shadow knocking out enemies without killing them (and there's an achievement for that) and complete your goals without the enemy knowing what's happening... OR you can bring justice the hard way and 'perforate' every foe with the various weapons/explosives available. There are lethal and non-lethal weapons.It also does have the same feel from the old legend: the first Deus Ex game.Truly a masterpiece.			"

												With the fixed boss fights and other small tweaks plus the integration of The Missing Link DLC in to the main game, this is easily the best version of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Biggest changes in DC is the fact that boss fights are doable pretty much by hacking. There is still no non-lethal way to beat the bosses like in Metal Gear games, but that's not such a big deal. Also new game+ and developer commentary are great added features. On lower difficulties than ""Give me Deus Ex"" the game is now slightly easier, because two energy bars get charged automatically. The energy system is still flawed, but at least it's now a bit more fun when you can combo stealth cloak in to double takedown in every situation.There aren't that many ""pure"" cyberpunk games around (there are some cyberpunk elements in a loooot of games), so the scenery is very refreshing. The world Eidos Montreal has created is very believable and the characters from their looks to dialog are great.That's on my short 2 cents on DE: HR Director's Cut.			"

												Love this game! The story is great, but also the controls which allow you to remap to whatever keys you are comfortable with.  I've been a fan of this series from the beginning... Deus Ex GOTY.You can be a cold hearted killer, or a total pacifist.... the choice is yours.This version includes all the DLCs but also alternative strategy to boss fights. It's nice they offer the discount to people who already bought the first version like I had.If you played the pre-director's cut then this won't be a spoiler.  This is one of those boss fights, this is from the director's cut and it shows an alternate way to take out the boss which wasn't available in the previous version.

												The good: I don't know what I can say about the amazing Deus Ex universe that hasn't already been said. Human Revolution is incredibly immersive; the enviroment is beautiful, the characters well rounded (even the side characters), and the story compelling (espeically if you take time to read the avaliable material and track down clues off the beaten path). The gameplay is fun, especially if you enjoy stealth games. The soundtrack is amazing; check out the cinematic trailer if you want a good example of this. If you're a stealth player, this game will really allow you to shine. The bad: Human Revolution encourages you to take a stealth approach, which runs a little contrary to the prior Deus Ex games, in which multiple paths were equally rewarding. You get more in-game rewards for stealth and non-lethal approaches. I'd have liked to see a more balanced approach. Also under bad, the boss fights were developed by a different company, so they really don't fit the feel of the rest of the game.Director's Cut specific notes: The Director's Cut attempted to fix the boss battles, and they are certainly much better than they were in prior versions; however, you still have to kill the bosses, which is jarring in the midst of a non-lethal run. Many people have experienced performance issues with the Director's Cut. Those with Nvidia graphics cards seem to experience more difficulty on the whole; however, a lot of it is down to your configuration. I'm running a Nvidia card in a laptop and I'm able to play the DC without any framerate or stuttering issues. However, your mileage may vary - something to be aware of.General info: All of the DLCs available with the original Human Revolution have been integrated into the Director's Cut (except for the 10,000 credit bonus). The extra weapons are now available in-game as opposed to being dropped into your inventory from the beginning, and the Tong mission and Missing Link are both part of the story line. Overall: This is my favorite game, to be honest, and I would strongly recommend it to absolutely anyone. The story is great, and if you care to spend any time seriously contemplating it, can raise some interesting questions about technology and humanity. If you haven't played the Deus Ex games, do yourself a favor and play them ASAP.System Specs Used: Intel Core i7-3610QM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 670M / 3GB GDDR5, DDRIII 12GB RAM, Windows 7			"

												Deus Ex Human Revolution is a immersive deep story involving conspiracy, international conflict, human dilemmas and choices in dialogues and most important, in actions, choices that affect gameplay and the outcome of your adventure presented in stealth FPS/RPG complemented by deep character progression, that open various options based on player style of play, tough, stealth is encourage by the game, not only bc of the experience gain but also feels more satisfying that blazing trought the levels.You have many tools at your disposal to avoid combat or you can simply blast your way trough to progress, the levels are big enough to give you various options, the graphics are good and voices actors did a awsome job, making the story believable enough to keep you attached to the game, Jensen narration kind of reminded me from Max Payne, its impossible not to enpathize with him and the gameplay is also satisfying going stealth or using guns, since the cover mechanics work very well, be it to avoid combat or to protect you from enemy bullets.My only concern about this game was the limited inventory space (like STALKER, many weapons but nowhere to carry them since this is game, not real life, but this is just personal opinion), but since there are mods that were released after the game, im not even considering that a bad thing bc it can please each person way of play the game.Now, i just wanted to give some personal toughts about this version and the original, there are many opinions about the vannilla and the DC, and every each one of them is just about preference, i personally loved to play both games, but finded the DC more balanced over the original, and the fact that TML was introduced in DC at the right point, made the story feel more sense that playing TML was standlone, but the HR Yellow UI had more impact in the cyberpunk feeling.Since i love to play Deus Ex, to me, any of the games is a must in my library, and the fact that each one was is strong points over the other, i never feel that im playing the same game, just the same story.

												Simply put one of the best stealth/infiltration games of 2011 and arguably one of the best cyberpunks games ever.As for the plus/minus of this game, here it goes:The good things * Story: It mainly revolves around the ethics of ""augmentations"", that is cyberntic extensions that can be attached to a human being to improve the body or/and the mind. You are Adam Jensen, one who was recently cybernetically augmented. Yes, you are the the main character but you'll quickly see that you are part of a very big story with multiple secondary characters having their own agendas. The ending is satisfactory as there is no loose plot, and everything falls nicely into one place.* Level design: There are many ways for you to complete an objective. There generally is the main way (rambo), and many other paths. There is always a secondary path that will allow anyone to get inside a building without requiring special augmentations, while other may require you to level up a cybernetic part of your body. Being curious is a good thing. Also, being a ""hacker"" is great: it's a bit difficult to invest on this from the start but it pays off quickly as you are able to get to places you couldn't reach easily otherwise.* Stealth: You can finish the game without killing anyone, except the bosses. I wish more games do that.The less good things* Boss battles: it's certainly the weakest point of the game. Yes, you can use the environment rather than weapons to kill them, but all boss battles (except the last one maybe) left me underwhelmed.* Difficulty: If you go the ""hacker"" way, you'll find that the game gets much easier. I had only one playthrough (too many games to play to do it a second time) so maybe it's true only for the hacking part.Other than that, except good graphics (for 2011), and 40 hours of solid gaming if you want to resolve secondary missions and/or plan to play to get all achievements.I suggest this game to anyone that likes stealth/infiltration, cyberpunk or good story. If you happen to like all three, like I do, then you'll have a blast.NOTE: It's also supposed to be an action game, as you can play it ""rambo"" style... But you would miss a lot by doing that. I suggest anyone wanting to get the best from this game to play it in stealth mode: also, try to avoid killing anyone (Pacifist achievement) and avoid starting off alarms. And, play in on max difficulty. This combination should arguably be the best way to play the game.			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut follows the story of Adam Jensen, an ex-SWAT and security specialist, handpicked to oversee the defense of one of America's most experimental biotechnology firms and forced to submit himself to the scientific advancements, also known as augmentations, after being severely injured while trying to save the scientists he was hired to protect.The game offers an open approach to mission structure, thoroughly engrossing story and gorgeous visuals combined with an simply amazing soundtrack and exceptional gameplay.The boss fights are very well-designed, the different choices and multiple approaches will have consequences later in the plot and the stealth mechanics are just great.I highly recommend Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut.

												A prequel of what many consider the best game ever made, and a spiritual descendant of System Shock, Deus Ex HR is old-fashioned and new at the same time. The FPS-RPG game style allows many and creative ways to procede in the action sequences, while well constructed and clever dialogues sustain a brilliant plot. Maps are rich of possibilities and often placed in open areas, giving a true sense of freedom and reality. Augmentations expand even more the gameplay variety, which never relies on scripts, and that's more unique than rare in modern games.93/100			"

												Human revolution is a worthy successor for one of the most awesome games of all time.+ Like in Deus Ex (2000) the game tells an excellent story of a technological vision of the human future, competing with the ethical aspect of humanity. Side quests, as well as the add-on, are well intergrated in the main story, offering many details and allusions that can be discovered talking to people or reading e-mails etc.   Each situation can be handeled in more than just one way including the possibility to finish the game without killing anyone (but bosses) or going on a bloody killing spree. Further, the directors cut offers the possibility to beat every boss without brute force by using skills like stealth and hacking. Most of the time, enemies behave realistic and intelligent (for example they take cover, advance carefully, reanimate unconscious comrades and react to their surroundings during patroles). I love the voice acting, the music and the visual appeal of the game. The rooms and locations are designed very esthetically, allways picking up the colors gold and black (thereby offering another philosophical level by demonstrating a dichotomy between an oppulent golden era and its breakdown... Deep♥♥♥♥♥♥.-I was a bit dissapointed because it takes only the klick of one button to trigger different endings. Though the choices the player makes during the dialoges impact the further course of the protagonist and his surroundings (more or less), they don't seem to have a big effect on these endings. Also (in contrast to the game of 2000) people don't seem to mind the protagonist lurking in the girls bathroom or stealing their chocolate bars.9/10 - would ""never ask for this"" again ;)  "

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is one of my favorite games. Through my time playing it, I never got bored and I never felt like I was forcing myself to play through it.  Gameplay   The gameplay is amazing. There is never one way to play through this game. If you are fond of running through each building with guns blazing, than there are weapons just for you and linear paths just for you. If you like to stealth you're way past guards and silently take out enemies, than there is a set of weapons, paths, and skills for that as well. On top of this, there are different ways to get into building and out of buildings, get around guards, and to get past doors. In one place, I remember that you could either break down the wall, go through the front door and secretly sneak into the place, or go the long way around and jump through a window and stealth your way through the level. On top of this is the dialogue tree. In some places, you are able to sweet talk your way past somebody and in others you were able to earn little side quests that may help you in some way. Like I said, this game is superb in the way that it lets you go through the levels and how it lets you play the game. All in all, I would say that you should get this game just for the gameplay itself. Graphics   The Graphics are decent for the time that it was released. They still hold up to today's standards and, in my opinion, look pretty good. Story   The story was only interesting enough to keep me interested, in my opinion. I won't tell you the story because like I said before, you should play this game for the gameplay itself. Rating    Taking everything into consideration, I would give this game a solid 8/10. "

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut is certainly a game that I would recommend to everyone, fans or not, as it simply an intuitive, perfectly done sequel for the Deus Ex series. Human Revolution by itself I believe must of been brilliant in its own aspect but I never played the original, the Director's Cut that I went through truly was incredible, whether it be the graphics, gameplay or its mind-boggling story it truly is a pleasure that I would give 9/10 simply because 10/10 doesn't exist.

												Right, this game i do recommend to any adventure-fps-rpg fans out there, lots of posibilities, good story, can do the non lethal ""♥♥♥♥♥ run"" if you want to(actually an achievement is tied to it), and so on, game is prettey long, so you can get out the most out of your buck. Allso it has really great replay value, as you can finish all tasks(most of them) in many ways (infiltration, speaking your way out, finind alternate routes or just plain shoot first ask questions never) and you are actually rewarded for exploration...           So yea, i would recommend this game... If you can tolerate playing as one of those douches, that walk around in night wearing sunglasses(CSI Miami guy looking at you)...			"

												In Deus ex: Human Revolution you dive in dystopic cyberpunk world ruled by technological advances that are controled by big corporations. Augmentations are not the advanced nanotechnological augmentation used by the two protagonists of the previous games, JC or Alex Denton, they are mechanical augmentation, the type of augmentation used by Gunther Hermann or Anna Navarre for example in Deus Ex. The philosophical subject of the game is like the epic cyberpunk movie ""Blade Runner"" how is meant to be human if you are completed by cybernetics and how dangerous is this power given by technology against the human freedom, as proven by history that can become abuse. Constantly harping on a moral-dilemma theme of humanity's troubling interface with technology Mary DeMarle(narrative director) wrote a well-written story, with reallistic and humanized dialogs. Due to the RPG element of the game the answering options of every conversations are really good and can also alterate and effect the storyline of the game. There also many moments that you are called to take ethical decisions making you uncomfortable, of course if you are sceptical-philosophical human being. The ending (no spoiler dont worry) is one of the best and well-written endings i ever seen-read and that is one negative in this, i just seen-read not played like the first Deus Ex. But for me it was so literature and well-written that satisfied my erge for playable ending like the first one. Generally is not good as the first Game of the franchise but is more phillosophical and close to our future dystopian world that comes faster and faster.The graphics are decent and the art-atmosphere of the game is JUST STUNNING. JONATHAN JACQUES-BELLETETE (Art Director) made an incredible world, merging the cyberpunk element of movies such as Blade Runner and Ghost in the shell and Renaissance. Is one of the best artistic styles i ever seen, the outcome of these two elements with a tone of sepia in the colors of the world is absolutelly mesmerizing, making a cyber-noir vision of our world. It also remarkable the architecture of EVERYTHING in this game. Every street in the cities, buildings, rooms, even furnitures, lamps, computers... are pieces of art. The gameplay of Deus ex: Human Revolution is like a classic FPS game added with the stealth element. It's much improved from the first game in many things but doesnt gives you the option to focus in one gameplay style. You can play as an FPS monkey type gamer shooting here and there everything in the game or  play stealthy along the missions giving you the oportunity to explore and discover a variaty of pathways that are hidden on the map of every place you are. Also you can combine these two gameplay styles. It has a kind of open world with a lot of stunning sceneries and hidden places for you to discover. The skilling system is interesting and gives you a lot of fun stuffs, options to unlock and upgrade, some of them can also enrich the dialog options and alterate the storyline. The hacking element also is present in this game like the first and ofcourse is different.  The inventory is pretty hardcore, cause every item you add in to it gets a certain amount of space and every same item cannot merge with the other. For an example if you have two magazines of any weapon, doesnt  take one space-slot. Finally i wanna notice about the BEST soundtrack i ever listen in a game. Michael McCann was thought to follow the main art idea, marying the future and the past and to add an acoustic side in a electronic based music, which took the form of vocals / acoustic instruments. He made a really good job on that and this thing is noticable because he actually was impresed by the very strong philosophical / religious / political themes that permeate the story.Summary+Great story+Stunning Art-Atmosphere+Mesmerising Soundtrack+Stealth element+Augmentation/hacking elements-Some silly voice acting (Lead character sounds like Batman)-Linear boss fights-Long load times			"

~ They're like ghosts. Always in the shadows, always hiding behind lies and proxy soldiers. ~I never asked for this. Quite literally, because when I played Deus Ex: Human Revolution for the first time in 2012, I had no idea what to expect. I saw a few minutes of gameplay on YouTube and I ended up buying it because it looked like a ""fun futuristic shooter"", not knowing what kind of game it really is. It's a cyberpunk action role-playing game that takes place in 2027 Detroit, where the protagonist Adam Jensen escapes death and gets augmented as a last lifesaving resort. After returning to the job, he sets out for answers that will take him all across the world and unravels a global conspiracy. I'm not going to tread into spoiler territory, but it's a game with a heavy narrative that never lets go. The atmosphere, the freedom of choice en the ever-growing story arch; everything is in great balance.+ Excellent level design. You can see its brilliance after subsequent playthroughs, because you rarely get to see or use them in one go. It really adds to the replay value.+ A futuristic and very convincing world of two faces, corruption and deceit. + Conspiracies, conspiracies, conspiracies.+ Absolutely great soundtrack and an even better cyberpunk atmosphere.+ Heavy focus on narrative, great story that keeps interesting until the very end. Good length as well (~40 hours with all side quests). + A few nods here and there to the original, fun to see.+ Good AI. Not fantastic by any means, but it made stealth (and probably combat as well?) not too easy.+ The gameplay encourages you to adapt and experiment with new things. A lot of different options for both stealth and combat.+ Oh yes, have I mentioned conspiracies?.+ Pacifist/no-alarm runs are very addictive to do.- Mediocre facial animations and NPC voice acting is questionable.- Could do with just a little less holding hands, compared to the original Deus Ex.- Choices don't seem to have a lot of big consequences, as opposed to the original Deus Ex. - Boss fights could be better (but still, it's a lot better than they were in the vanilla version).- The Missing Link DLC being integrated to the main story messes up the pacing greatly in those respective parts.It sounds weird, but if you can somehow get your hands on the vanilla Deus Ex: Human Revolution (the Steam codes in the physical game box), I'd suggest getting that instead of the Director's Cut. Sure, the vanilla had pretty terrible boss fights, but you could easily cheese yourself through them (for example spamming your Stun Darts), but at least the pacing was great. With the Director's Cut on the other hand, it pretty much forces you to replay an entire segment that has very little to do with the overarching story. And I'd much rather have a few minutes of bad boss fights (which were easily cheesed) than the pacing getting messed up for several hours.Despite that, since the Director's Cut is the only one available now on Steam, I still recommend it. The vanilla game is a great and more than worthy entry to the Deus Ex series and it's my personal game of the last generation. It's even one of my all-time favourites in general. Here's hoping Mankind Divided can be even better!9.5/10			"

												seems like less of a ""director's cut"" and more of a ""game of the year edition""bottom line, if you already own the game + missing link (which was very good imo), then not really worth your $5 (coming from someone to whom $5 is often a considerable amount) unless you're a diehard fan, which i consider myself to be. it has a new game plus mode (your augs carry over), missing link is integrated proper, and you can recharge 2 energy cells instead of just one now - worth noting that two of those points are easily fixed by the burger mod - and, yes, the boss fights are...sorta reworked, you still have to kill them to pass but they've made it easier to do that, now you don't have to plan ahead and have a big gun just for that fight. no killphrases or anything like that, sadly. Still, the changes are good. Not perfect, but pretty good.if you DON'T already own DX:HR, then this is a good upgrade and fixes a handful of really irritating problems, while including the DLC where it makes logical sense in the storyline. Or, if you don't own Missing Link and its been a while since you replayed the game, then I recommend going this route, playing ML by itself robs a lot of the impact it could/would have and again, this fixes a lot of quality of life issues; I plan on 100%ing the trophies on this one too, because I am a ♥♥♥♥♥ :> (and I really really liked this game, director's cut or not) "

												Excelent story with fun game mechanics that allow you to solve problems your way.Story (no spoilers)Many believable characters with their own views and agendas. Features the occational surprise that I didn't see coming, and the  ability to chose how adam(main character) solves problems strengthins the role playing aspect of the game. Most voice acting is good although adam's is to cliche of characters like snake and master chief. Game playAbility to play like a stealthy ninja, hacking computer geek or go in guns blazing gives you a lot of feedom and replayability. open world areas allow you to aventure and do some fun side quests but so often you are stuck in single mission areas with no shops or anything for a long time. Also do not upgrade the number of energy bars you have. only the last one or two will recharge depending on your difficulty. Graphicsoverall good graphics  although everything looks pixilated and when you talk to people they cant seem to stand still. There arms are constantly moving and while this sounds super petty, after playing for an hour that starts to be all you notice during conversations			"

												If there was any sequel to a thoroughly loved classic that surpassed the hype, it's Deus Ex: Human Revolution. It has an excellent blend of first-person shooter and roleplaying, good visuals, great optimization and most important is not a dumbed down port. The gameplay is fantastic, the story rich and the world is vibrant and incredibly fleshed out.This game is another instant classic in the Deus Ex world. Play it.			"

												Now that I've beaten it 25 hours of gameplay later, I feel I should review this great piece:First off, the game itself and the main storyline/plot is very solid. A great, immersive, rich story that constantly left me guessing and looking for more answers the deeper I got. In fact, the last couple of days I really spent a lot more time on it up until I finished it, as the story was becoming much deeper and secrets were flowing everywhere. I couldn't stop playing and didn't care to play any of my other favorites. On top of a great story, I love the decision-making in this game, and that your choices ACTUALLY affect what will happen and exactly how you will progress. Along with that feature, there is also several different ways to go about maps, from using hidden ventalation paths, or sneaking around multi-leveled rooms and buildings, to even eventually punching down certain walls and making your own path (while simutaneously taking out the baddie on the other side). There are so many ways you can go through this game and it's maps, and so many ways to take out bad guys or distract them or whatever.All in all, I'd give a 9/10 probably...8/10 at minimum. I know it's 2016, and that the graphics were a little dated, but it still looked really nice during gameplay...and with all the weapon choices, skills, decision-making, ect, it really sucks you into the game and story. It's a fantastic buy if you've yet to try it...where your choices in both dialogs and skill upgrading really make a difference on how the story will progress and what decisions you will have to face later. Will you be a stealthy pacifist, vowing to not kille as many as possible with non-lethal weapons, attacks, and gas? Or fill your inventory with the best equipent out there, taking out groups of elite soldiers? Or perhaps more of a hacker to get into any room or safe? Just make sure to build your skills right, and remember that a bit of exploring and snooping does not go unrewarded in this game...sometimes a decert look-around can reveal paths and options to get you into otherwise locked or well-guarded ares with ease.

												While playing this it felt tougher than the first game, Deus Ex, which you can get for the Play Station 2 and PC, early type game, will it work good on Windows 7 or 8 that one, maybe on compatibility mode.That one had a tutorial level you could get used to the controls, one on the PC and the PS2.With a green cursor for friendly people and red for enemies.Which is useful to know, when you want to holster your weapon.You could throw some thing at some one and they will not be bothered, but make a sharp remark.This newer one has good graphics, feels different to the original.Remember one thing though, don't even throw a box at a cop.They shoot back and ask no questions, which is bad.When talking to some one you can give emotions in reply, not in the original version.Warren spector got mad while playing, I wonder why.Is it because of the way the games are different.I think even I'm a bit confused by this game, it is good to play.Completing objectives is not easy.Where do you find codes for doors, how much exploring is there ?I recommend this to any one that can understand every thing after a few looks at the tutorial level.Also it's not a FPS type game, more of a RPG.

												So I've held off playing this game for about eight months, I had completed the original game when it first came out and couldn't really find myself getting into the story again when this version came out. This game is by no means short, your playtime can vary from 20 hours to 50 hours, my first playthrough I completed the game in about 22 hours mostly because I didn't care about all the extra side quests and stuff. However I felt in this playthrough I'd go through everything. As it turns out I missed a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of stuff, tons. In some places I didn't understand for ages untill I finally did, commentary provided by the devs also provides an interesting insight into how the game was made and stuff they tried to put in but couldn't reveals a lot more of the story.I really really enjoyed this game but when it comes to hacking stuff, it tends to get boring after a while since you're just doing the same thing over and over and there's not much of a challenge when you reach level 5 hacking.The ending part of the game felt rush but it's still good.I guess I'm not really writing a review buuuut this game is pretty good, give it a try if you haven't already.4/5 Dazzles			"

												Dues Ex: Human Revolution incorporates an absolutely rich in-depth narrative that delves into dark corporate bureaucracy and tactical espionage. The style of gameplay is your choice. Whether you wish to play a stealth infiltrator, augmented gun toter, or tactical hacker it’s up to you. With many choices for augmented abilities and brilliant level design to incorporate each rolls strengths, coupled with the freedom to choose your own approach to any given situation gives Deus Ex: Human Revolution a great deal of replayability. Will you accept your past and augmentations? Will you distain them? Or will you just be complacent and take things as they are?As a side note, if you've already played Deus Ex: Human Revolution and haven't tried the Director's Cut, you may want to give it a go! It includes improved graphics (no more pee hued filter lol) as well as level design. Many areas have been expanded and improved upon to take full advantage of your augmented abilities. Definatly worth a second look even if you've beaten the game prior. ""I never asked for this..."" Adam Jensen9.5/10			"

 Short Review	Deus Ex is a very polished FPS with RPG elemtns, boasting a moderate amount of replayability depending on your interests. The Director's Cut edition offers an extra set of missions in the middle of the original story.8/10PROS - Polished gameplay, very few bugs- Visuals are nice- Content-rich world- Fun storyline and side-missions- A wide range of useful and interesting character upgrades- Reasonably good AI- Well-designed environments and levelsCONS - A somewhat limited amount of weapons and weapon upgrades- Not quite a true open-world experience due to the storyline, which hurts the replayability a bit- The director's cut story can be frustrating to play as you temporarily lose your character's weaponry and hard-earned upgrades. Full Review	Deus Ex is a FPS with an RPG element where in you unlock and upgrade an array of built-in cyborg capabilities. You can even upgrade your weapons with modifications like laser sights, ammo capacity increases and explosive rounds just to name a few. This aspect stays somewhat true to the original.Gameplay is smooth, but may feel a little clumsy at times when aiming with guns. Sometimes in the heat of a shootout it can feel a bit sluggish trying to gun down enemies whilst strafing around. So keep in mind this is not a shooter like Halo or CoD where you can move around very quickly dodging fire. You need to pick your positions carefully to ensure a clear shot and safe cover.The way Deus Ex is meant to be played is taking cover behind objects in your environment, and either gunning down your enemies - or stealth. The stealth mechanics of the game are brilliant. Enemies are very aware of noise and are smart enough to check areas thoroughly if they suspect an intruder is there. If you accidentally alert enemies to your presence, you often have to back out of the whole area unnoticed if you want to remain hidden.Not only is stealth fun, but the game is highly rewarding of stealth tactics. Enemies are typically easier to kill if you can sneak up on them, you can slip through areas quickly if you plan your movement correctly, and you get bonus experience points for stealth kills and mission objectives. This allows for faster character levelling.If you prefer to empty your guns in each room, that's also very fun, but the enemies don't make it easy. Very rarely can you pull a rambo in this game and get away with it. Enemies shoot accurately and will quickly make easy work of you if you are not adequately positioned or equipped with sufficient firepower.The visuals are great and most elements in the game are nicely detailed. The environments are awesomely put together. The atmospheric places of America, China and the fictional Panchea create an immersive experience which feels exciting, disturbing, suspenseful and curious all at the same time. In addition to the graphical detail, the areas have many avenues for exploring which can reward you with hidden items, such as powerful weapons and bonus upgrades. Many areas are only accessible after acquiring certain upgrades to your character (e.g. jumping higher and withstandning electrical damage) which adds another entertaining level of complexity to the game.It is led by an in-depth storyline with many twists and turns. The main storyline involves hunting down several super-powered soldiers, using similar technology to yourself, in an attempt to find the protagonist's girlfriend (ex... sorta... you'll see) as well as following the suspicious orders of his boss. There are plenty of side-missions which are a good source for extra content and bonus experience and cash.Overall, Deus Ex: HR - DC is worth the current price of $20 as it does provide some good replayability. You can play through the game using different styles and upgrades and it provides a different experience with each way. If it goes on sale, it is definitely worth picking up to play through at least once.8/10			"

												This game is a really good game in the cyberpunk genre. It's is a stealth game, but you don't have to play the whole game stealh. You can go guns blazing (just don't kill civilians). It has some RPG elements like upgrading your character and weapons but not too dense compare to traditional RPGs.The goal of the game is simple, but the setting of the world can be hard to follow sometimes but that is the nature in cyberpunk genre. It's a constant debate on whether humans should be augmented or not and the game dives deep into that sometimes. Even I got lost a bit in the story and dialogue, which there is a lot but it's sometimes interactive as it provides you how to answer back at a person whether it be negative or positive. There is one section of the game that I did not like and it happens halfway through the game, but I did enjoy the rest of the game including the endings which sort of makes you think deeply. Music of this game is really great. Reminds me of Tron Legacy. Gameplay is fun and like I mentioned, you can tackle sections stealthfully, go guns blazing, or use your augmentation abilities ( 4 active ones) or use all three methods. A few cons: There was a stutter when aiming down sights but it is common for some players. There's a solution online which is here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/238010/discussions/0/684839199566034385/I did not do the first step which has you unistall the nvidia 3D drivers. I just did steps 2 and 3 and it worked for me. Another con was after beating the game, whenever I load the latest auto-save, my game crashes. I don't know the exact cause but I play on windows 10. Whether that means anything I don't know. My last major con is that you cannot get all of the augmentation upgrades or at least I didn't have enough when I beated the game.My overall score is a 8/10. It is a great cyberpunk game to pick up and it goes on sale pretty frequently. I picked it up when it was $4. I plan to pick up Mankind Divided but when that goes on sale.			"

												After playing through it a second time I realized this one does admittedly get a bit of a free pass because of the disaster that was Invisible War. That having been said, I feel as though there was heart, polish and lots of effort put into this project, so I can overlook that and still say it's good and worth a play. Deus Ex levels of great? No. Still good and worth experiencing? Absolutely.As for the Missing Link, it is standard fare as far as DLC go. Very short, it challenges you by limiting your resources and has (mostly) good rewards. Oh, and ends on a very ambiguous and vague note.Shame the endings are all still terrible. Oh well, can't win them all.			"

												Always fun to play a combination of Solid Snake, Batman and The Terminator.   Player actions affect the story, and the game world is visually intriguing and deeply fleshed out, with thousands of emails, books and PDA's to read.  I only wish the hubs had more/non static NPC's.  It's weird seeing roads that go nowhere with a few random parked cars on them.  The action level design is great though.  This is an awesome genre fusion of FPS, action RPG and stealth/sneak 'em up.			"

												Human Revolution is engrossing modern take on Deus Ex. Fantastic visual design coupled with a killer soundtrack; with superb tracks like Everybody Lies, creates both atmosphere and tension almost unparalleled, all of which correlates into a story of deceit and mystery. Comparatively to the original the story flows better at the cost of being more linear and the gameplay is easier. Imperfect for sure, yet managed to keep me enthralled in both narrative and world. Definitely worth picking up.			"

A sci-fi/cyberpunk mix of a first-person shooter and an RPG, with a dash of stealth. It's definitely something you wouldn't want to miss.Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a cyberpunk, action RPG that has a gritty take on the Digital Age and our technology. The world's path down the road of innovation has taken a wrong turn, as the population is gradually turning from humans to human-cyborgs, all thanks to breakthroughs in biotechnology. Naturally, society begins to divide and take sides, leaving the player at the cusp of a new global issue: what does it mean to be human?The game itself combines elements of an FPS, RPG, and a stealth game all into one. As a result, there are many ways to complete a mission, akin to other non-linear games such as Hitman. You can burst in, spraying and killing anyone you see, or you can sneak around and avoid combat altogether. It is also possible to complete the entire game without killing a soul. Eidos did a terrific job of providing replayability and allowing the player to be creative, which is not something a lot of developers are able to do. The combat is fluid, the stealth is tense, and the story is immersive.There are also old-school boss fights that you will encounter throughout the story. The fights themselves aren't impossible, but they aren't easy either. Depending on the difficulty you've set for your game, you will be met with a solid challenge at certain points in the storyline.Regardless of all of its' pros, the game has one feature that I believe you all should know. It is not an entirely massive, open-world game like I expected it to be. The world design works similarly to levels and maps: you are placed in an area that is decently large, and you are able to explore and complete objectives the same way you are able to in other RPG's, but once you've completed all you need to in that area, you move on to an entirely new one. Now, you will be revisiting some areas as the story progresses, but I suppose that I was expecting the game to be more like a cyberpunk version of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Although I was somewhat disappointed, the world design makes the game unique, and it's still a fun adventure nonetheless.With great stories, great gameplay, and a great premise, you have yourself a great game. I commend you Eidos. "

												I decided to give this game a try after seeing a lets play of it. I wanted to try being sneaky. On the first mission at the near start of it, I found a Silenced Sniper Rifle lying on the roof like mana from the Machine God. Btw for those who use a tranq rifle, I found that if you shoot someone with it and they're wakened by one of their friends, wait till they are no longer alarmed and the guy you shot should fall asleep again.From what I learned from this game, I really suck at sneaking. I recommend you check this game out. It has a very good story and really good gameplay.			"

												The only way to purchase Deus Ex Human Revolution on Steam currently.The Directors Cut removes the yellow filter, implements the expansion dlc to the main game, slightly improves boss fights, and updates the games engine.It however adds some more issues that didnt exist originally, and censors a small section in the game (it just removes a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.It also lacks the feature to hack terminals on an andorid device which is present in every console port. Still this is a passable way to play a great game, and I'd take it over the original, it just could have been so much more.			"

												Really, really, really damn fun. A stealth-FPS-RPG that's was well worth the two playthroughs (So far) I've given it. It's a little janky due to the fact it's age is showing a bit, but this game definitely lives up to the praise I've heard for the Deus Ex series.For your information, here's the changes the Director's Cut has. I firmly believe that the Director's Cut is definitely the version you should buy due to some of the reasons listed below:-Apparently, worse graphics. I don't really give much of a damn personally, but there it is. It's almost certainly solvable if you're willing to install mods.-Altered boss battle design. If you haven't heard, the original HR's bosses pretty much forced the player to go guns blazing. This meant that if you were a stealthy, hacker character, you still had to carry some lethal weapons in your pocket in preperation for the boss, or you'd die very, very quick. This has been fixed to an extent; The game still forces you into lethal (I'm pretty sure you can take the bosses down with nonlethals, but it's very ineffective and they die in terms of the narrative anyway, not to mention they're excluded from no killing achievements), buuut every boss has a few secret areas you can access if you're a smarter player that will defeat the boss easily without you having to really fight them yourself.-The Missing Link DLC has now been seamlessly integrated into the story. For those who don't know, The Missing Link actually takes place during the story of HR's plotline, not after or before it; So, in the Director's Cut not only is Missing Link included, but you start playing the DLC when it actually happens during the narrative rather than as a seperate experience.As far as I'm concerned the boss battle redesign and the Missing Link's integration offsets the graphics downgrade, though the downgrade isn't appreciated. If you're hankering for a nice first-person stealth game, this is a nice choice.			"

Deus Ex: Human Revolution is ranked 2 in my list of FPS games, where I don't have to kill anyone. Dishonored is ranked 1.

												Disclaimer: these are only my first impressions of the game and not really my final thoughts.Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a dense bomb that appears like a simple game with not much to offer to the player, but once you use it, you'll see that the explosion is that of a nuclear bomb. Essentially this game is a - mainly - story-driven game that mixes some story elements from the Crysis-series with Fallout 3/New Vegas.It's a new era where the ethical questions of mechanical implants in humans are top discussions, naturally, this leads to protests.. sometimes to the extreme. You're Adam Jensen and you work for Sarif Industries which is the leading research company for these implants (augmentations, in-game), however, there's a terrorist attack by the anti-augmentation group and you almost die, however, augmentations to the rescue, you live! However, as you're sent off to an investigation to find out what/who was *really* going on behind this terrorist attack, you find out some things that were never meant to be found out. Either way, story so-far is fantastic and really interesting!If you're the type of person who always prefers shooting and killing, well, you can do just that! You can also go stealthy through the entire game - marvelous. It does blend the two very well, and I find myself to prefer being stealthy because it's smoother and better implemented. Guns feel as if they're not really meant to be the primary choice of the player, and do feel somewhat dumbed-down, because aiming is a little difficult and the only real weapon with good accuracy is the standard pistol. Other than that, it does work quite well and it's different, so I won't complain. Ammo has to be bought and sold which adds some challenge to the game, so you can't really ""run-and-shoot"", you have to keep your strategies organised, which I definitely like, and the Fallout-aspects really shows off here.Animations are buttery smooth and they really do a cool thing here. Instead of making the speech-animations (body animations) generic and stale, they have several to fit in with the situation and feelings and loop them which gives it all quite a good variety and more natural than you'd expect. Not to mention the stellar voice-acting. Voice acting is seriously top-notch. Doesn't get much better!I really enjoy this game and feel as if more people HAVE TO own it, those who enjoy Fallout 3/New Vegas & Crysis 2, 3, in particular! I can't believe I've had it in my library for so long without giving it a glance.9,4/10.			"

Stunning visuals with a beautiful in game world to move around in.                  Story is well done and unique                 Voice acting is real and not over the top.I give this game a 9.8/10, because it was a flawless masterpiece. Easily top 5 games of all time for me and necessary addition to everyone's library of games.  ,The addition of the Missing Link DLC was a nice touch. It flows in with the story well, and doesn't cause a flaw or plot hole that sometimes occurs with added on DLC.~ Commentary I had to turn off, because I'd rather listen to the main story again for the 4th time, over them babble ~			"

												I love this game.  I completed the standard version 5 times.  So I bought the Directors Cut.  It has the 'Missing Link' DLC built into the storyline which makes sense, and adds a couple of hours extra gameplay, plus slightly revised boss battles.  I heartily recommend this game.			"

												For those looking to upgrade from the original:The advertised boss fight upgrades are good if you want to experiment, but if you've played the game before you'll probably have more praxsis points than you can handle and know the best way to take these bosses down.  It's mostly for the newcomers, not for you.  The integration with all the DLC is a bit better too.  You don't get all the DLC weapons straight away like before but they're still present in-game.For those newcomers:It is a GREAT way for those looking to get into Stealth games.  It is easy to pick up and challenging to master while still not making things EXCLUSIVELY stealth-oriented.  The dialogue battles are also pretty great and tense, and I was amazed to see how they weren't just ""do these options in this order"".  It does really well at giving you a variety of choices, whether they be diplomatic or aggressive.  The aesthetics are fantastic, the voicework is great (perhaps a few hiccups with the foreign characters), and the overall gameplay is really fun and not repetitive.A must-buy for all.			"

												Dont listen to the negetive reviews, this is a solid game with a an amazing storyline that keeps digging you deeper into the rabbit hole until you're like... WTH?!?! Holy Crap!! How freakin' big IS this thing?!It's not a short game so you have the potential of many, many hours of enjoyment and even some replayability due to the different ways you can 'spec' your char.Is it AAA, 2014, High end $700 Nvidia graphics card kind of eye candy? No but its damn good for a 2011 release and perfectly fine even today. Combat can be challenging (scope out the area first to check for strategic options) and sometimes, down right freakin HARD (which is good) on ""boss"" fights.Within the last few years I have to say that this is easily one of my (if not the) favorite top 3 games I've had the pleasure to play.

												The original release was one of the best games of 2011, hands down. It has a deep, rich storyline and setting that fans of cyberpunk--from Blade Runner to Ghost in the Shell--will greatly appreciate. The gameplay is smooth and challenging, and players of games such as Metal Gear Solid, Mass Effect, Thief, and the original Deus Ex will find themselves right at home with this fantastic title.With the Director's Cut, a few changes and additions have been made. The most notable of these are the inclusion of the DLC missions into the main campaign--the Missing Link is no longer a separate game--the improved boss fights, and the developer commentary. There were other minor changes, but many players may not notice these. The inclusion of the Missing Link chapter helps round out the storyline, as well as give the player the opportunity to redo his or her skill points, which was something missing from the original 2011 release.The improved boss fights were appreciated, though the additional avenues of defeating the bosses will still take some quick thinking, or trial and error, to truly take advantage. For fans that want a more balanced approach to the game, where any style of play is rewarded, this is the edition to purchase.Developer commentary in this version of the game is an interesting and valuable addition. It can be toggled on or off at the player's convenience, and many of the nodes offer intriguing insight into the minds of the game's creators. The only minor irritations with the commentary involve the nodes themselves. They are not always apparent in the game world, and once a node is playing it cannot be stopped without going into the main menu options and toggling the commentary off. Still, in spite of that minor oversight, the commentary is exciting to listen to and veteran players will appreciate it.I highly recommend that new and old fans of Deus Ex: Human Revolution grab a copy of the Director's Cut.

The story was riveting, and personal to my play-style. Watching my friends play it their way was incredibly interesting as well. Of course, the art direction of it has remained beautiful and one of the most striking ones in this genre. As for the director's cut, so far it has been quite interesting to find the additions to the first version I've played in PS3. It has given me a lot of pleasure to replay it again in this director's cut.			"

												I can recommend this game as it allows you to choose how you want to complete the various missions. You can play the whole game with stealth or just running in guns blazing. Personally, I feel the game is better from a stealth point of view. Just seems to me the game was designed largely around avoiding direct engagement.The storyline is very well developed, the graphics are very well done, and the combat mechanics are easy to get the hang of. The only real downside I had with the game was with the dialog. For me it just seemed like everyone in-game was twitching or having a minor seizure as they talked. Besides that I had no issues with the game other than a handful of game crashes that occurred namely when I alt-tabbed out of the game and back.Review comes from roughly 92 hours of gameplay, two playthroughs (first main one and second to wrap up two achievements I missed), and 100% achievement completion.~Armatuscrypta			"

												This game is amazing, it has to be the best game I have ever played, bar none.  The storyline is fantastic, the graphics are great, and Adam Jensen is a badass.  You play as Adam Jensen, who is ex-SWAT and was hired to work for a bioengineering company, where things quickly go south, and you are led across the world to investigate.  You learn of a special-hidden-secret society, that seems ridiculas at first, but it is well integrated into the game, and seems more plausible further along.  The game is built on how you play it, if you decide to go ""gun hoe"" and moe down all your enemies the ending will be impacted, versus a silent take-your-time approach that pays off in the end.  There are multiple endings with following cinematics, not only 2, or 3 endings, but 4 complete endings.  It is well worth the purchase, I strongly recommend this game to any sort of gamer.			"

												Highly addictive, if you are a fan of the first or Anachronox or into cyber punk themed worlds, this game won't dissapoint. It has good replay value as well as refined controls, RPG and game changing elements similar to Mass Effect and lots of side quests. Lighting and textures have changed slightly over the original version and the integration of The Missing Link DLC is now more streamlined. Only negative side would be a few bugs that aren't addressed for this version that the original has already addressed through patches which is an awkward move by the developers, but based on the recent patch in november 2013 and a few posts on Eidos' forums, the technical team are listening to the fans in hopes of getting this game bug free. Otherwise an A+ title for everyone to enjoy.			"

												I upgraded a pistol with a silencer and a laser pointer and used that as a sniper gun. 10/10Deus Ex: HR is a slightly older game (~2011) that tackles the question of makind's future and human augmentation. Set in 2027 across various locations including Detroit and Hengsha, it shows a possible future for humanity. Poverty, gangs, and protesters ranging from anti-augmentation ""purists"" to environmentalists all paint a sharp contrast to the scientific progress, the wealthy few who can affort augmentations, and corporations that have replaced governments.The main protagonist, an ex-SWAT chief security guard with a voice similar to the sound of sandpaper, feels a bit forced, as if he were only here to let the story develop. After mercenaries attack his workplace at Sarif Industries, his life is saved by augmentations, and he becomes a one-man army. His boss sends him on missions where he either sneaks by everyone to steal important information or shoots everyone down and steals important information. As you may have guessed, this is a mix between a stealth and an FPS game. Stealth as in the Thief series' 2014 reboot, entitled Thief, and FPS as in games where you gun everyone down.To make the gameplay work, you are given a choice on how you want to get to your objective -- the pewpewpew approach, the stealthy one-by-one takedown approach and the sneak by everyone through the vents approach are the main three ways of dealing with situations. Sometimes, an approach (especially the latter two) will require you to upgrade your character with augmentations. The upgrade system works, though some features are completely redundant, as your approaches may not require that augmentation (which is perfectly normal for this kind of upgrade system), or the character can already do what the upgrade enables him to do (such as some of the hacking-oriented augmentations).I can't really find anything to complain about. The story was interesting, though at times a bit forced, and the lack of a definitive antagonist just makes the game feel messy -- you are a single man fighting against the Illuminati. Pritchard and David Sarif are both c*nts in their own ways, and character movement during dialogues is glitchy, repetitive, and unnatural. But that's all that's wrong with the game, and those are minor details that don't take away from the experience.tl;dr: I liked the game and have played it twice (only once through Steam). I've often seen it on sale, and one playthrough is worth at least 20 hours if you don't rush everything, pick the more peaceful approaches, and complete a few side missions.			"

												Much like the humans in this world who augment their bodies and minds to gain an upper hand in society, Deus Ex: Human Revolution aspires to be greater than other videogames on the market, and it succeeds impeccably. You are Adam Jensen an augmented cyber security agent for the world’s leading augmented research corporation Sarif Industries. Your goal is to solve who is behind a serious of terror attacks on the company by any means necessary. However, just because you are given the tools of the gods does not mean you should necessarily utilize them. Deus Ex is a game about choice and unlike other games that advertise choice as a key aspect of the game and fail to deliver Deus Ex delivers it, and with a cyber fueled bang! You influence the story and you decide your play style whether it involves becoming a sneaky hacker or a near indestructible cyber death machine, there is no hand holding or hints of what the game wants you to do, make your choices and live with your consequences. Whether that means changing the course of a characters path into an ill-fated direction or not properly preparing for a mission and getting destroyed by your opponents it’s all up to you. The story takes an immense amount of shocking turns as it stacks the stakes with every second you play the game resulting in an ending where based on your perceptions of the world you decide what the best course of action for its survival, and boy is this world something. Resembling the light on shadow styles of renaissance paintings Deus Ex strongly resembles a crumbling Sci-fi dystopia somewhere along the lines of Blade Runner or Dredd with a mesmerizing soundtrack and a hypnotizing environment. Deus Ex: Human Revolution is truly fire stolen straight from the gods.			"

You can actually play through the game without killing anyone (except the bosses). 2. Michael McCann's awesome soundtrack, plus samples of the original Deus Ex music hidden throughout.3. Fantastic voice acting that turned me into a fan of Elias Toufexis. 4. Takedowns featuring futuristic blade-arms, pure cyborg badassery.5. The Missing Link: A fun detour towards the end of the game where you can experiment with the ""Factory Zero"" playstyle (see achievement description).6. Serious transhumanist theme that permeates the entire game, a breath of fresh air that tackles a serious topic in an interesting and enlightening way. If you never played the original Deus Ex, play this installment first, give the second one a wide berth.			"

												If you are wondering whether to buy this game or not, just do it. I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.And if you decide to buy it then keep playing it until you finish it. The first 2 hours of the game aren't that interesting, but it gets so much better. The reason why i like it so much is because you choose how you want to play. You can play lethal guns blazing or maybe some nonlethal stealth, maybe you want to play the whole game without hurting anyone. (With the exception of the bosses.) The choice is yours. The choices you make isn't just limited to the type of playstyle you have but also what you choose to say in the dialogue sections. Speaking of which, the moral choices you make are really tough decisions and they definetly have an impact on the storyline. I found myself thinking about what to do a lot, and I kept doing that until the end. I didn't know if I made the right decisions. Not many games will make me question my outlook on life and my morals, but this game opened my eyes to problems that might actually happen in the future. That is really cool.It does have it's problems though, for example; The boss fights are boring and unnecessary, the guns are a bit clunky (Barely used guns anyway but still), the lack of a fast travel system made side quests a bit of a chore (Even though the actual side quests where really interesting) and I personally didn't enjoy the the first couple hours of the game.I would rate this game: I never asked fo this/10Keep in my mind that these are my personal opinions and nobody else's.

												I am on my second playthrough right now. This is trully one of the best vdeo games I have ever played. And I, if being honest, cannot stand 1st person. But this game just made me forget about it. I really love the idea of being able to play however you want: either stealth or combat or a mix of both. It's always fun to find secret pathways and new ways to complete a task. The gameplay is really fun. The story of the game is interesting and at moments heartbreaking. You have to make choices that aren't always easy. The design of the game is just breathtaking. Same goes to the game's soundtrack.  Do yourself a favour and give this game a chance. It's really worth it!			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut is a better version of an already great original cut. It features revampt boss fights, but I still find it easier to just throw a few land mines on their feet and call it a day. It's a must play. Maybe not so if you've already digested the original cut, but I still enjoyed just as much.			"

I am not good at scores but this game to me was 9.5/10 because story was great, made me feel like I was in the game. With 2 upgrading systems in the game 1 for your character an 2 for your gun(s) which was very useful and hard to pick what I want. I reccomend this game to any Deus Ex fans who like the games			"

												In it's core Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a good game.I was pleased to see, that it can both run smooth and look good (surprisingly, at least for me, it runs better with Directx 11 enabled than with disabled), although it took some research and tweaking with game's settings.I don't have much negative things to say about sound either. Outside of fight music is more to the subtle side, after a while I started to not notice it much anymore and got used to it being there, it became inseparable part of the surroundings.Voice acting was mostly good too.The time you spend in the game will be divided into exploring the level, taking care of bad guys and talking to people.Levels are designed with different player's approaches in mind. There are many paths which you can take to get on better position or to get straight past the enemy, you just have to find them or have the augmentations to use them. There is of course always an option to go head on and shoot through the enemies.Every level has also many hidden items scattered around, which rewards exploration.There is also a lot of hacking to be had and hacking minigame here is one of the better you will see.Combat is cover based and stealth oriented.Sneaking around and taking down enemies one by one is the easiest way how to play the game. Sticking to cover will get you to 3d person mode, so you can look around corners, not to mention you have radar which shows position and facing of nearby enemies.When the enemies don't know where exactly you are, they behave really stupid. They walk on their paths, they never notice a missing buddy, when they briefly see you they will investigate but then they will quickly return to their path, sometimes they will play with their phones/tablets paying almost no attention to what is going on and they can be easily lured out of group with noise. It's the standart stealth AI we all know, nothing new but it still works.In direct combat their AI is sufficient. They will make use of cover, they remember your last location and will try to pin you down with fire, sometimes they throw grenades and may even divide and try to get closer to you.The story is the usual conspiracy, which you are uncovering bit by bit. For the most part it's focused on following the trail to find kidnapped scientists with sidestories on the way. There are choices to be made here and there but only a few has an impact on the game.There are some good characters with well written dialog, but unimportant characters can deliver few pretty terrible lines. Talking animations could use some work too, I don't talk about lips but body movement. Characters have tendency to repeat animations often and sometimes they look unsettled, almost shaking. For an RPG there is not that much talking here, but it's balanced out with persuasion minigames.Inventory system is a tetris on checkerboard with pieces of different sizes. Some might find it too small, but with upgrades it's more than enough. You won't fit all weapons there, but you will stick to few weapons which you upgrade anyway and you don't need to loot everything you find, because most things you need you will find, not buy. Unless you have a real problem with hording consumable items, you will get over it.Augmentations, you will unlock them using praxis kits, which you can find and also you will gains them for experience. There are just a few augmentations which I found useless, the others are usefull, more or less in dependence on your playstyle.Experience gain is problem though. You are rewarded with more experience for using non lethal methods and even more for non lethal takedowns (your close range attack consuming energy). It makes sense, unconscious enemy can be revived and for takedown you have to get close. But if you want to maximaze your experience, you are forced to certain playstale. It's either having fun or being effective. For me it would be better if there was just no set experience for every enemy, but it's more a nitpick.There are some things, which was bothering me though.First of all is lack of detail. Outside of main characters, there is little to no interactivity with other npcs in the levels. There are also numerous things which breaks immersion. Just to name a few, you can walk into a shop, go right past it's owner into back room, steal whatever you find there and the npc will not even take notice of your presence. Or in Alice Garden Pods during Belltower attack, you can still see closed pods with silhouettes of people just reading a book while civilian npcs are laying around dead. I guess Belltower soldiers are just kind enough to not disturb them and will settle for killing those who stand around.What makes it even worse is that developers had balls to put in pocket secretaries with unfinished text like the writer was interrupted by the attack.Also, if you will steal from offices in Sarif industries Headquaters, you will get emails from personel blaming each other for your thefts. This is a nice detail, which makes the overall lack of detail even more annoying.Also, if you have Direct's Cut version, there is dlc content integrated into the game. In practice it means, that when you get into cryopod to get yourself on a boat, which is near end of the game, you will be thrown into dlc, where they will take all your augmentations away at the beggining.I personally really hate when game takes all your benefits away without a possibility to avoid it. When you go trough most of the game exploring every inch of the level, taking down every enemy, going for the bonus experience for completing level unnoticed to get augmentations you want, and then when you have them and you finally don't have to care about experience and you can go trough level as you want, you just don't want to suddenly do that again, because game will take it away.That made me stop playing for few months. I'm glad I take a break, or else I would rush through that part just to get over with when actually it is a well made set of levels and dialogs with Quinn were great too.Just a few last things to mention - unskippable intro sequence and npcs interrupting you in persuasion minigame with ""You have nothing to say?"". Unnecessary.So, the game is good, just rough on the edges. It is definitely a worthy sequel, recommended.			"

Pros:+ Challenging, enjoyable gameplay+ Massively variant playstyles possible+ High replayability+ Good amount of content+ Stealth system is fantastic+ Open combat is also good+ Many different approaches to each challenge+ Compelling storyline+ Polished final productCons:- Slight railroading due to episodic content- Boss fights require you to kill (Deus Ex heresy)- Pacing problemsOverall: The third installment in the Deus Ex game series is a prequel to the first game.  The premise is that you're Adam Jensen, a bionic security guard given top of the line mechanical enhancements.  These enhancements function as your ""character growth"", allowing you to become a better hacker, gun slinger, stealth fighter, tank, or any other plethora of fun upgrades.  It's a cool system that's been refined across several Deus Ex games, and it works perfectly.  Graphically the game is very stylized, with the world having tints of gold to it everywhere, making the game immersive in its own way.The downsides are fairly minor.  In every previous Deus Ex game, it was possible to finish the game without ever taking a life.  In this game, there are a few boss fights, all of which require you to kill your opponent.  This takes away from the novelty of never killing anyone in a combat-oriented game.  The storyline stops in the middle to do a side story that was DLC for the original game, and which was released in a package deal for the Director's Cut.  In it, you're stripped of your biomodifications and forced to finish the side story before you can come back to the main tale.  This disrupts the pacing quite a bit, but the side story is still fun.  Finally, the game is fairly linear, with several side quests in addition to the main goal of each area.  However, you can't really go backwards or choose where the next area is.All in all, this does not take away from any of the game's charm, however.  It's still fun to play through it without setting off alarms, or without killing, or by killing absolutely everything.  It's a polished game that's fun to play several times through.Bottom Line: Definitely recommend.  This is one of those priceless games that I keep coming back to over and over again.			"

												Oh, where to begin?  Deux Ex is a decent game, blending concepts of stealth, shooting, and social engineering.  Unfortunately, it doesn't really excel in any area.  The stealth sequences are very old-fashioned, in that they work well enough if you choose to stay concealed but fall apart badly if you prefer to kill quietly.  The shooting mechanics are hindered by poor controls - left trigger dives for cover instead of aiming down sights, etc - and by guns that just don't feel good.  It's great that the weapons can be upgraded in all manner of ways, but it's all for naught if they don't feel good to shoot.  Case in point: the round from a sniper rifle shouldn't drop in flight by 18 inches during a 25 yard shot.  Also, a guy that gets hit in the head with a finger-long projectile traveling at roughly 700 mph shouldn't immediately snap to attention and try to figure out who shot him just because he's wearing a helmet.  Finally, the parts of the game that attempt to challenge players by way of dialogue choices feels like LA Noire - the clues and responses that you're given don't correspond very tightly to the desired outcomes; two players making the same choices won't necessarily get the same result - it's stupid.All that said, the game features an intriguing story and is good enough (barely) at what it does to be worth playing.  The director's cut (poorly) incorporates the Missing Link DLC into the main campaign and adds some optional DVD-style commentary.  Unfortunately, because the upgrade exists as a separate title in the Steam library no saved games or achievements carry over into the new game.  I'd say that it's worth grabbing, but only if you don't already own The Missing Link.			"

												(For those of you wondering whether this is a version of Human Revolution with Montreal and/or Upper Hengsha city hubs: sorry, this isn't it.  At this point, I doubt it'll ever come our way, at least barring a ""Super Director's Cut"" edition.  Don't be waiting for it.)The DE:HR Director's Cut integrates The Missing Link, a previously standalone story, into the original game, and adds in a New Game Plus mode which carries over all abilities (but no items, sadly) from a completed playthrough.  Some preorder-bonus missions are also added in, but the best addition here is a stellar commentary from the biggest names behind the game.  Seriously - give it a listen.  There's a ton of it (about 8 hours total), but quite a bit of it is insightful and interesting.  A new gold standard for commentary in video games (sorry Valve).Newcomers: this is an absolute steal for twenty bucks.  A playthrough of the Director's Cut will take you anywhere from 35-60 hours, depending on how much you see and do, and it's just a flat-out great game besides.  The art direction, soundtrack, and story are first-rate, as are the scenarios that accommodate a range of playstyles the Deus Ex universe is renowned for supporting.  Whether you try to sneak, hack, or shoot your way through this universe, it's a good time.			"

The world is interactive and it's a great buy. The story gets you involved immensely, with different ways of approaching  each situation, there is a degree of replayability.  You can go in like rambo, or go stealthy, or a combination of both. In the long run, your choices changes your gameplay experience.

												First, some reviewers on here did not recommend this title because they claimed it was buggy. I did not experience a single bug from my 30 hour playthrough so I am not quite sure as to what they were referring to. As far as the DLC that comes with this title: the DLC mission is integrated so seamlessly into the main story that I didn't even realize it was the DLC until after I had completed the game. I think the best part about Deus Ex: Human Revolution is it literally allows you to play the game however you wish. Do you enjoy complete stealth missions and sneaking around? You can do that and there are weapons designed specifically for stealth (tranquilizers and stun guns for example). Do you enjoy running in and blowing up everyone you see with a rocket launcher? You can do that too. You have special augmentations that you choose to unlock in order to play the game to your style. For example you can unlock short bursts of invisibility in order to avoid being seen; or if you choose to fight you can augment hand to hand combat and weapon abilities. The game is designed so that you, the player, are given the ability to choose exactly how you play the game.As far as the story goes, it was good/above average but not amazing. It felt extremely rabbit holey. The rabbit hole went down so far that I just kept thinking to myself ""welp, I guess I'll find the bottom around 50 hours in."" The story has a lot of twists and turns, but none of them are particularly interesting. It was just like, ok, you found out something new, better go check it out.. and down the rabbit hole you go. Rinse and repeat. But it was never an overly interesting rabbit hole. On the flipside, the ending is simply one of the best endings I have experienced. It reminds you of just how empowering, yet brutally dangerous technology can be to society. To quote Einstein: ""Technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological criminal.""Overall, the gameplay is one of the best I've experienced. The story mixes technology and the choices it forces on human morality. This title is close to perfection in both terms of gameplay and story, and I can't give the developers enough praise. Deus Ex: Human Revolution takes about 20 hours playtime to finish, and about 30 hours if you do all the side missions. 9.5/10Please upvote this review if you found it useful :)			"

												I have never been so immersed into a video game before, and enjoyed every minute of playing Deus Ex.Deux Ex has the coolest and most interesting universe and plots of any game I have played, portraying a very believable and frightening future of a world in moral conflict and on the brink of civil war. The combat revolves around the player taking either a stealth approach or an aggresive one. Either way being fun, leaving players wanting to redo a checkpoint to perfect a certain method to complete it. This kind of gameplay has innevitably resulted in AI being a bit stuipid and too oblivious at times. Additionally, some boss fights are bit over the top and unnesccary.However, the variety of skills the player has to choose from and the unique environments of each chapter/level overshadows these faults.Deus Ex has been an example and of why games should be taken more seriously, and have alot more potential than being viewed as violent shoot em ups' as seen in the past.- 9/10			"

												This is one of my favourite games.  But, what I will say is: The Missing Link forced DLC part of the game is really obvious insert into the game and basically messes with the pace of the whole thing. Sneaking becomes awful, because the gaps between checkpoints is too long. The immersion of this game is great. I really got into reading peoples emails and all the newspapers and such, and the world I inhabit.I enjoyed this. I played sneaking style. Luckily the boss fights are sorta fixed you can do some sneaky hacking things to win. Great experience. Highly recommended. New game plus is a good addition.			"

												Played the original version back in 2011 and loved it! One of the best games I played of last generation and a worthy follow up to the masterpiece that is Deus Ex!A really engaging story which had me interested from the get go, some really well designed environments that let you choose which approach you take to complete objectives. Personally I was more of a stealth until someone sees me then kill everyone in sight, but if you want to stealth the whole game you can. They have also fixed the messed up boss fights in this version, no longer will you be stuck with no ammo and forced to fight a boss. Also this version comes included with “The Missing Link” a 2-3 hour side mission which was originally released as DLC, it is not part of the main game and I really enjoyed it as I had not had the chance to play it!Graphics still hold up pretty well, and I must admit I like Jensen's voice actor a lot despite him coming across sometimes as very monotone.If you have never played Deus Ex and want to see what it's all about then pick up this little gem! And remember when you're backed into a corner with ♥♥♥♥ all ammo just remember that you never asked for this!			"

												Okay so I really liked this game and to make my review very short I want to mention that the game has a lot more good than bad.Pros-Amazing Graphics-Long and engaging story- Action/ stealth play-Power ups-Exploration- Difficult if you like that sort of thing.ConsThe game has only a few cons which are.-Weapons should be upgradable more often given you stronger weapons and not needing a dealer.-Not many unique sidequests (mostly just going into peoples apartmets and beating them up which is actually a lot of fun but not a lot of variety).-Shooting mechanics can be a little tighter and allow for controller adjustment (Played with an xbox 360 controller)-Exploration is limited to areas in a city that are not anywher near the vast expansion of Skyrim and other like games.Overal go ahead and get it its worth the money and you will have fun playing it. The Steam sale does allow you to get it for super cheap but its worth getting for 20 I originally bought it for xbox 360 for 70, Did not beat it until I re bought it for steam.			"

												I never finished the 'vanilla' version of DXHR as I lost patience by the second boss battle, despite a well crafted experience fitting of the first game.Glad to say that this 'directors cut' adequately fixes the jarring boss battles, as well as seamlessly adding all the DLC packs and additional 'Missing Link' content into the full game. This more than makes up for the orignal game's failings.My only annoyance, and this stands for the first game was the jarring completely different final section that puts you into a completely different stuation. All makes sense plotwise, but from a gameplay perspective, a bit of a jump.Still, this 'director's cut' is well worth a go, especially if you missed out back in 2011.			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a great single player game that really makes you feel for your choices (untill the ending) Human Revolution has a wide vareity of gameplay options for any play style, loud and proud? sure. Sneaky and lethal? sure. knock everybody in the world out wiht tranq darts and a tazer? more power to you. while the gameplay can be little clunky and the interface can be a tad bit buggy from time to time.  While the story is great, the ending does have a bit of a lack luster response, not making note of any of your acheivemnets, which is out of place from the rest of the game, for example when a plane crashes during the middle of the game it is very hard (yet possible) to save the pilot. If the pilot is saved then later that game they will make an apearance and change the plot of the game. The game follows through with a great story and gameplay accented with great AI and Unique mechanics, with a total of 26.8 hour campain for a partial stealth run. This is a product worthy of recogniton.			"

												One of the best games of the seventh generation, period. Actually the game provides many ways of approaching it's challenges, in my opinion if you want the full experience go for stealth, most of the perks acquired by the lv. up system will give you a boost regarding the stealth approach. Also this is one of those games that playing in the highest difficulty is actually fun rather than frustrating (again, with a stealth approach), it is all about patience and studying your enemies patterns. Now the story while based on science fiction is not that far off on what may occur in the future, it raises many philosophical dilemmas and shows the varios sides and opinions through different characters. I recommend this game to those that are fans of MGS or most stealh based games (that are well made), and to those who like to choose their own path in a deep and complex storyline.			"

												I am surprised this game did not win Game of The Year. It is so good.Director's Cut fixes the small problem with the original version (limited boss fights, seperate DLC)Never played any other deus ex but I am glad I started with this one. It is one of the best games I have ever played. It truly makes me want to play differently. Stealth, kill, pacifist, hacker, tank, CoD style. It has it all. It makes you think tactically to solve a problem.Unlike Skyrim, where you start an archer, stay an archer. It's hard to experiment (in my opinion) unlike this game where everything just works in it own beautiful ways. Hidden stashes, secret paths only available to certain skills. Everything just drags you in and makes you want to play more. You want to do the side quest. They are like mini-main quests. Very well made!10/10			"

												One of the best FPS games I've ever played, together with the original title (which is a sequel to the DX:HR's storyline, and that I highly recommend as well). Its plot is deep and intriguing, it will put you in front of many moral choices and you will have to face the consequences of those choices. You can tailor your characters to your preference -- either stealthy, tough and heavily armed or a mix of both. You can even finish the game without hurting a single person, if you exclude the bosses. If you like science fiction (and cyborgs in particular) and spy/action stories, this is the game for you.9/10			"

												The original release was one of the best games of 2011, hands down. It has a deep, rich storyline and setting that fans of cyberpunk--from Blade Runner to Ghost in the Shell--will greatly appreciate. The gameplay is smooth and challenging, and players of games such as Metal Gear Solid, Mass Effect, Thief, and the original Deus Ex will find themselves right at home with this fantastic title.With the Director's Cut, a few changes and additions have been made. The most notable of these are the inclusion of the DLC missions into the main campaign--the Missing Link is no longer a separate game--the improved boss fights, and the developer commentary. There were other minor changes, but many players may not notice these. The inclusion of the Missing Link chapter helps round out the storyline, as well as give the player the opportunity to redo his or her skill points, which was something missing from the original 2011 release.The improved boss fights were appreciated, though the additional avenues of defeating the bosses will still take some quick thinking, or trial and error, to truly take advantage. For fans that want a more balanced approach to the game, where any style of play is rewarded, this is the edition to purchase.Developer commentary in this version of the game is an interesting and valuable addition. It can be toggled on or off at the player's convenience, and many of the nodes offer intriguing insight into the minds of the game's creators. The only minor irritations with the commentary involve the nodes themselves. They are not always apparent in the game world, and once a node is playing it cannot be stopped without going into the main menu options and toggling the commentary off. Still, in spite of that minor oversight, the commentary is exciting to listen to and veteran players will appreciate it.I highly recommend that new and old fans of Deus Ex: Human Revolution grab a copy of the Director's Cut.

												This game is an absolute masterpiece. It meets all criteria that a game of it's genera should. To begin, it has a great story line. The way characters are introduced, said charaters' development as well as the development of the plot are all excellent. Not only that, but there are several options in game that can change the outcome of the whole story, and to top it off, the ending cutsences are very well orchastrated, and it makes you take a real look at human ideas, morals, and sacrafices. As far as the gameplay, I am also very impressed. The combat has some very nice mechanics such as the quick take down or the hiding behind cover mechanic. The leveling system that uses parixis kits to unlock augmentations is also very nice. Not only that, but the game presents a challenge that makes it fun and addicting.  As far as the graphics go, this game has beautiful, detailed textures. Unlike most first person shooters that focus more on actual combat and gameplay, rather than storyline, this game tackles both with staggering ability. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who not only wishes to play a fun shooter, but wants to be told an in depth interesting story of one man as well as all of humanity's countless trials and triumphs.

You have to make choices that aren't always easy. The design of the game is just breathtaking. Same goes to the game's soundtrack.  Do yourself a favour and give this game a chance.

												TL;DR at the endWell well, what can i say?I LOVE THIS GAME.It's probably one of the few games that I bought without knowing much about it and ended up being a real gem. I bought the original game on sale for 2€ more or less and played until the end, very good game, but I didn't enjoyed completely since I went for the pacifist achievement (not a single person should die by you hand) so i couldn't see the real awesomeness of Deus Ex HR, I also failed the achievement... so sad :( After a while the director's cut pops up, with HD textures, new weapons, reworked boss battles (that was much needed), a DLC, but I like to call it an expansion, since it's not the usual DLCrap and a developers commentary. The best thing about this new edition is that it really shows how much effort was put in by the devs, every aspect of the game shows enthusiasm and dedication to the creation and improvement of the game. Let's talk about specific stuff (I like this part)***Graphics*** 9/10 The graphics was already good from the beginning, but now, whith the improved textures, is even better. The pattern on Adam's coat is one of the first thing you will notice, that floral embroidery is simply amazing. Attention to the details is something that won't go unnoticed when you play the game, from the beginning to the end. When you are talking with someone you can see their facial expression changing, depending on the way you approach them, try not to make people angry or the might not share valuable information. The only thing i can say against this topic it that the graphic seems a bit beneath the level of other games that came out that year (2011), but it's nothing to be worried about, it's a 10 in my opinion, but I can't help myself comparing it to Arkham City (that one was a 10/10 that year).***Sound*** 10/10 Yep, ten, the music is perfect, no other words. It's impressive, the atmosphere of the environment and the music go arm in arm. For what concerns the sound effects, I have nothing to say except that everything feels right, especially when using your augmentation powers to punch through a concrete wall and break the neck of the poor guy on the other side. Wanna talk about voice acting? Absolutely fantastic, all of them, dubbers really made it big.***Story*** 10/10 This game is a movie, there is so much in the story that will keep you glued to your PC, so many secrets to uncover that you know people are keeping from you, but the game just won't give you ... yet. You need to reach the very end to know the truth and when the moment arrives the only thing you can say is ""OH...MY...GOD! How could I've been so blind this whole time?!""***Gameplay*** 11/10 Am I crazy ? Yes, ELEVEN. Depending on which skill you purchase you can complete missions in different ways, which sometimes drastically change the game itself. Each mission has a lot of different approaches, let's say you need to go from point A to point B, ok? You can go Rambo style, if you're a fan of slaughter, or you can buy the stealth upgrades to become invisible and silent, if you like to sneak past guards and catch them with their pants down, or you could look for a security terminal to hack and be granted the access to point B, or you could even enter a vent shaft and sneak inside metal tunnels all the way through, sometimes you can even take shortcuts by punching walls creating nice holes ... and a bit of a mess, but who cares. So yes there are at least 4 or 5 different approaches for every mission and this is the best thing about this game, freedom.***BONUS(ES) of the Director's cut edition***+ Replayable, with the option to keep the progress from the previous game+ HD textures+ If you already own the basic game you get a discount on the director's cut, even more discount if you own the dlc+ A DLC with an amazing story and some surprise for the fans of the original Deus EX+ New weapons+ 280, more or less, commentary from the develeopers that explains everything about the making of Deus Ex HR+++ Reworked boss battles. This need a little explanation, in the original game these battles were really bad, and with really bad I mean they were total crap. You sneaked past every guard with your ninja skills, but then you reached a boss that you could only take down with brute force. Finally, the devs realized the error and created new ways to kill these enemies, of course you can still nuke the **** out of them, but hacking the computer that controls sentry turrets or that release a powerful toxic gas... well, that is really praiseworthy. This shows how much a company that make games cares about players, for this improvement I say BRAVO! to the devs.TL;DR Game's kicks major asses, if you don't play it you're missing a milestone of the videogame industry.

												I did not know Deus Ex before i saw it on Steam. I purchased this game because it was on sale, cost only $4.99. I watch some trailers and reviews reckoned i could give it a shot. And gladly its worth the money. For starters, this game is somewhat like Mass effect + Dishonored hybrid, assuming you know both these games. You might not agree, anyways its just my opinion. But be warned, to me this isint quite a shooter game. It's an FPS, it has got a handful of guns and you can shoot things as shown in the trailer but most of the times you'll be doing lots of stealth, hiding behind covers trying to sneak past enemies. Sounds pretty familiar? (Hitman). Well if you dont like the stealth approach, you could go gun blazing, but i dont think this is the way this game is meant to be played, especially during the first half of the story which is after llike 10+ hours of gameplay (for me) mainly because you could be easily outgunned. Of course you could jump right infront of the enemies and shoot them in the face tough later in the game prior to sufficent upgrade of your carecter.So..... If you are looking for fast-paced shooter like COD, your wont get it. Its a slow-paced game involved lots of thinking as in how do i get past this, how do i access that, something like that. If you're in it for the story telling and RPG experience then i recommend you to grab it. The voice acting might not be fantastic but it works and it surely gave me a somewhat unique experience that not many games could offer.I'd love to give it a 9/10 but -1 for the graphics/visuals, so it's 8/10 ! Dont get me wrong, its graphics aren't crappy at all, is just that i adore better ones.			"

												PROS:- Great atmosphere, full of interesting characters and intense social commentary.- Playing stealth and non-lethal is rewarding, adds additional challenge to an otherwise standard FPS game.- New Game+ allows for repeat playthroughs with all of your previous upgrades allowing for different outcomes.CONS:- Random stuttering near tight areas and walls, even at high settings. It’s annoying, but bearable.- Boss fights can be laughably easy near the end, offering little challenge.- Heavy backtracking is required for several Side Missions, making the world feel grindy.Fans of the action-stealth genre will find plenty to enjoy in Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut. The boss fights have been reworked to include alternative ways to win. New Game+ can extend the life of the game for additional replayability. Other than some graphical hitches, buying this game on sale is one of the best value you can get.			"

												One of the best PC games made even better!The graphics have been slightly improved over the non-DC game, the ""Missing Link"" DLC is now part of the actual game instead of just a standalone, and the boss battles - the worst aspect of the original - are now at the standard of the rest of the game.Seriously, buy this!

												a very fun game, wether you like RPG's, stealth, action or first person shooters, this is a game that really ticks all the boxes. the combat is great, the leveling system is awesome and the story is just amazing, several plot twist will bend your mind back to front playing this game.the objectice is neve confusing like some games can, if you get stuck you just check the map and your fine. stealth is hard but rewarding a nd if playing on hard, its quite critical you master it.the only problem i had with this game is that some of the powers/upgrades can sometimes be very over powered, for instance, the is a small bit in a game where you need to cross a big room and get to the elevator and 50 guards come in toward you. jensen has the ability to turn invisible (once you buy the ability) and all i did was turn invisible and run past them. it feels like some of the hardest bits of the game wernt as chalanging as i would have like the to be.over all a perfect game for everyone     9.5/10  MUST BUY			"

												Excellent game. Great story, great combat, great mechanics, in depth augmentation system. In every objective there was always a path to sucess and you always feel equally rewarded in comparison to other paths. When its on it's game its style and execution set it apart. Although there are parts where it's a little iffy the animations can be rather robotic which could be poetic. This game is pretty good at establishing what the game allows and it rewards paths taken weren't intended. Unfortunately the method of dealing with bosses isn't as expansive. You can't show mercy or anything you kill them that's it. Overall brilliantly satisfying and in depth with few faults. Play it.			"

												One of the best games I have ever played. I haven't had an experience like this since Metal Gear Solid. I have played so many games in my life and lately have found myself jaded; so much so that at times I may go 5 or 6 Months with no desire to play any. This game restored my faith in the ability of modern games to tell a story and be unique. It made me realize that maybe I'm not getting ""to old"" to enjoy a video game.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this game, even if it's not on a Steam sale. The Developers and Producers deserve the capital.			"

												Deus Ex Human Revolution is a masterfull game, with great combat and stealth. the hacking minigame gets a little bit repetative and boring but a challenging adition. The endings were kind of dissapointing in my opinion, I kind of wanted some sort of interactive epiloge not just a voice over. The replayability is low because you can choose your ending at the last part of the game and it feels like your actions dont have that much consequence in the end. You can get the same endings as a ruthless murderer and a completely non lethal operative. The story is compeling and persuasion and dialoge feel so natural, It feels like you are in a scifi political drama with intense gunplay and stealth. The atmosphere really immersed me and its unique design never felt repeated or overused. The greatest strenght this game has is how you can play a level in so many different ways. You could run and gun or move a couple boxes and find a vent or knock out a guard and steal a password. This game gets a solid 9 out of 10 the only negative factors are the endings and somewhat choppy npc animations			"

												After owning it on the 360, and now on the PC, I have to say that this is a really good game. It's not only a decent game, but it is a great Deus Ex game. Especially considering the failure that was The Fall, and the controversial Invisible War, DEHR is a fantastic installment to the series.The graphics, the gameplay mechanics, the inventory, item construction and customization, the character upgrades, all of these are solid. Then we get into the story and dialogue. They are like nothing I have experienced before. Once you get the dialogue Praxis upgrade, it opens up a whole new gameplay feature, one that allows you to not only witness the effects of your choices during the dialogue sequence (not just after), but gives you a whole new way to play the game. It allows you to actually strategize during a conversation based on the individual person you're talking to and their personality, along with their emotional state at any given time, not just click one phrase and hope that the NPC has a favorable response to that particular selection.I am one of the few who actually like DE: Invisible War, but I have to admit that the inventory and (oh god) the dialogue and voice acting were bland and boring at best. Human Revolution doesn't fall victim to any of the failures of its older brother (and some would say a VERY distant relative). The voice acting is superb, the inventory is akin to The Conspiracy, item upgrades are more like the original, and the story and missions give you that sense of urgency that the original had.It's not just a good shooter, but it is a fantastic RPG. I've got to say that this is one (pre)sequel that I am proud to own and experience. Definitely recommended. A solid 9/10			"

												Highly addictive, if you are a fan of the first or Anachronox or into cyber punk themed worlds, this game won't dissapoint. It has good replay value as well as refined controls, RPG and game changing elements similar to Mass Effect and lots of side quests. Lighting and textures have changed slightly over the original version and the integration of The Missing Link DLC is now more streamlined. Only negative side would be a few bugs that aren't addressed for this version that the original has already addressed through patches which is an awkward move by the developers, but based on the recent patch in november 2013 and a few posts on Eidos' forums, the technical team are listening to the fans in hopes of getting this game bug free. Otherwise an A+ title for everyone to enjoy.			"

I don't spend time on games much these days but this is one of those games that you will for sure do so, without regrets. The replayability is great and gives you the chance to do some things differently or not at all. Also makes boss battles on the hardest difficulty a breeze when you know what to upgrade in which order (hint: Typhoon). Anytime this is on sale (or even not) this is a worthy title to house in your library. Game direction, music and control are fantastic. Run n' gun or stealth: your choice! Buy it!			"

												I am an avid single player game user and I am always on the lookout for games that show that the developers put alot of time and effort to create a great story that you enjoy playing from start to finish.  DE:HR is one of those games.I came across this game just before it released but learned enough about it that I bought it when it came out.  At first, I was concerned as it was a FPS (not one of my more favorite genres).  However, after playing through THE FIRST TIME (hint: there will be more than one playthrough, I guarntee it), I found this game a great mix of FPS, RPG, and tactical shooter along with a strong dose of puzzle solving and stealth.I highly recommend this game based on the storyline and its ability to keep you entertained enough that a second playthrough does not sound as crazy as you might think.

												This story driven FPS is one of the best ever.  The polished and compelling plot really drives you forward with a sense of purpose and curiosity.  The game also greatly rewards those who explore the rich environments that they took the time and effort to create (even the spoken Chinese in the game is one of the better attempts I have seen).  Also, the director's cut fixed the only issue I had with the game:  the boss fights.  They have now added alternatives to facing the bosses head on for the stealth and non-lethal approach.  It also integrates the additional downloadable content where it belongs in the context of the overall story.If you never played this masterpiece before, now is the time to do so.			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a much better game than I dared to hope for. As it is Eidos Montréal's first game, I was scared they couldn't pull a new Deus Ex off. I couldn't have been more wrong.The first thing you'll immediately notice is how the atmosphere of the world is just right. It is completely believeable, immersive and Deus Ex. The story pulls you in right away and won't let go until you're finished with it. The visuals of this game are amazing, nailing the futuristic look but with an original twist. The worldbuilding effort has been immense: there's so much to dive into.Next you'll notice how well the game plays. I've always loved stealth games and this one has that down so well. Unfortunately, the gameplay isn't balanced perfectly. Some of the augmentations are worthless, whereas some are highly useful in every encounter the game throws at you. Do some research beforehand if you don't want to waste your points. Many people have reported that combat playthroughs don't feel as rewarding as stealth runs, but I feel it's good that the game rewards carefulness and a strategic approach.Voice acting is well done. I initially thought Adam's voice actor sounded 'forced', but that's how his voice really sounds like, and now I couldn't imagine any other voice for him.A word of warning, though: don't chase the harder achievements like Pacifist or Foxiest of the Hounds on your first playthrough. It will distract you from the great storyline and take three times as long to finish the game. Finish the story first.In closing, this is one of those rare games I'm willing to play through more than once. I'm eagerly waiting for the sequel, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided.			"

												Deus Ex Human Revolution is certainly a game worth having, and while the directors cut took a graphical hit, it is still a high quality game. DXHR is a tactical first person stealth shooter with several RPG elements. Like the original, DXHR encourages player choice with many branching paths all of which lead you to your objective. You could blast your way through guards, hack into and shut down the security, or simply hop in an air duct and avoid everything. However, the choices arent balanced which leads to one of the only issues the game faces. There is no incentive to fighting the bad guys. While there is choice, the game does lead towards the stealth option which has you crawling through ducts and sneaking around the perimeter of the map. However, that doesn't make the game any less satisfying. Avoiding all guards and cameras is every bit as fun as gunning through a room full of guards.Another stregnth of the game is the preogression system. The augmentations are all useful and unique. Each one will give you a very useful tool against your enemies and as a result, the progression system is as rewarding as it could be.DXHR also benefits from a engaging and well written story which is aided by a superb soundtrack and top-notch voice acting. The story has you, Adam Jensen, traveling around the world in search of the people who led an attack on the Sarif Industries lab months earlier. The narrative never lets up and will keep you searching for the truth all the way through. All in all, DXHR is a worthing prequel the the original Deus Ex, and is worth having.			"

												After a long break since the release of the original Deus Ex, we now have a new Deus Ex but not a sequel. Improved graphics, better game mechanics and a more involved story than the orignal. This is a very engrossing game but due to the limited nature of the storyline the re-playability of Deus Ex is limited. Having said all of that; this is probably one of the finest cyberpunk videogames ever made. With a nod to Gibson and Cyberpunk 2020, the world of Deus Ex captures the dark gritty dystopia of The Sprawl. Trust no one, take what you can get and forget about being a hero; this is the cyberpunk way. The combat system takes a little geting used to, but other than that and a few performance bugs this is a very fine game. I give it a 8/10, probably one of the highest ratings I have ever given a modern game.			"

												Great game with a fantasticly rich and complex story. Certain events in the game and your decisions will impact your experience later on unexpectedly. Graphics and artwork are well done, albeit not the best graphics it has a cyberpunk/comic feel to it which really works well.I bought this even though I owned the ""vanilla"" game and DLC already and it might be just because it was a long time between playing the ""vanillas"" and the directors cut that I enjoyed it so much, I enjoyed it all over again. I felt like I forgotten how awesome the game was and the directors cut really ties in the vanilla and dlc nicely, as the dlc is basically an extra chunk of the story in the middle of the game. Since I played the vanilla then after played the DLC it didnt feel as though it was part of the story but they way it has been worked into the game as one big long flowing story is beautiful. If you are a newcommer to Human Revolution or your memory was a little shottier than mine you'd be forgiven for wondering which chapters in the game were the DLC. It works well.A work of unique art. 9/10			"

												A rock solid game on many levels. It is one of the best stealth games that I have come across in the last few years. Yet, it's not just a stealth game. It provides several playstyles in which you can utilize during the game. The replayability factor simply rises because of it, as you naturally are tempted into playthroughs targetted to specific goals and playstyles.The graphics are solid, yet don't tax mid-range systems. Even some low end systems should be able to run with this title and still look decent. It's very easy on the eyes and the gpu at the same time. The story line is a cut above for it's genre, in my opinion. It has depth, color, imagination, and well-thought out twists and turns. When it's time to decide your stance in the world, you really feel like you're a part of this world. My advice is to not rush this game; don't view it as stages to be completed. Go everywhere, do everything... explore and take your time at each stage of the game... get lost in the character you're playing instead of the goal you're trying to achieve.This game doesn't fall short many places, but that's not saying it's perfect. There's room for expansion and improvement. I, for one, am really looking forward to any news of a sequel worthy of to succeed this game and see where they go with this amazing creation. I say one that is worthy of this game, because this game is quite literally the best entry into this franchise and the other titles that bear it's Dues Ex mark can't even stand in the same arena as this entry in my opinion.All in all, I give this game a 9/10 overall and highly recommend this game to anyone!

												Phew - finally done with the replay of DX. While it is fun to knock out people again, it is just the same game with a sharper / clearer image plus the Missing Link DLC added into it  - IMO I didn't really see much differences. Never have issues with the boss fights previously so I don't really see much even if it is changed a bit in this Director's Cut.Pros: *Above average storyline (provided you haven't played it before)*Good gameplay with either fun stealth features or average shooting/weapons to rush through it all*Good music (at least good enough for me to go download some of them =D)Cons:*Chat options doesn't affect the main storyline much (there are multiple endings but it is not really related to chat options)*Not much replay value (one run to do it all and I am removing this after 100%)*So-so AI (turning up the difficulty doesn't do much to me except increasing damage by guards and longer detection cooldown time)*A little bit repetitive on the hacking/sneaking if you are trying to max out on the experience Summary:While I might stated a few cons, it is still a good game that deserves your time if you haven't played/gotten it yet - especially after how cheap it is now. However if I can choose again, I probably won't be bothered to buy the Director's Cut, the plain vanilla + Missing Link DLC is more than sufficient. If you have not gotten any of the vanilla etc before, wait till Director's Cut get discounted and get it straight.			"

												Even though I already own DXHR and the DLC, I bought this because they fixed a number of things.  First they combined the DLC into the game which makes sense as the DLC shows what happens to you after you leave Hengsha in the stasis tube.  Then (and this is the big one) they fixed the three boss fights.  If you set up Jensen as a brawler and killing isn't an issue, then these fights weren't a big deal.  But if you prefer an emphasis on stealth and electronic surveillance and prefer a more pacifistic approach, then you may have had some issues.Since I already had the game and the DLC, I only paid $5 which is about $5 more than I should have paid for a bugfix.

												Deus Ex: HR is one of the most beautiful games of its time, and often precedes the quality of many that follow it. I liken it to a premature GTA V, having many mechanics and unique quirks that make this game part of the leaders into the open-world charge that we now see in games. Featuring large, broad maps and storylines long enough to wrap around the earth (and again), DXHR is a great example of what games should be considered besides fun: works of art.(Disclaimer: I have played this game multiple times outside of Steam, the time above is just with this client.)

""IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD, BUT YOU CAN SEE IT FROM HERE""Deus Ex: Human Revolution (more especifically the Director's Cut) was one of my first games on Steam. A gift, I was actually a bit hesitant on accepting as I've never been a big fan of FPS. The RPG part made me go through the download size and didn't quite prepare me for the stealth. I believe it's more accurate to call DX:HR a stealth with FPS and RPG elements, as the first is the most proeminent trait.As Adam Jensen, you're tasked with security in Sarif Inustries, a top notch corporation specialized in augmentations. Not too long after you started, however, the matrix (located in a 2027 Detroit) is attacked by a mysterious black ops squad and a number of questions rise as you're basically resuscitated by your employer. Seems like your typical cyberpunk setting, except it feels more realistic, more relatable. The secrets you come to know during Adam's journey for answers and revenge easily get you involved while one question is answered and another one is made. And as any person asking the dangerous questions, Adam does so mostly in the shadows. Even though the game offers a large range of strategical approaches and paths, the stealth mechanic can be more rewarding and fulfilling, not to mention lore friendly. On higher difficulties keeping a low profile is actually necessary as augmentations aren't enough to withstand a bulletstorm. Fear not, though, as you can literally be a ghost by taking full advantage of the incredible level design!Not only the story is well written and filled with branches, but the artwork and soundtrack are some of the most relatable and beautiful in recent game history. The architecture feels unique and real, while the soundtrack tries to unite a feeling of old and new by mixing classic notes with electronic beats. It's easy to dive into Deus Ex's universe and get lost in its mature themes, such as transhumanism.Even though the experience is one worth having, it's still far from perfect. The Director's Cut came with a number of performance issues and bugs that -- after almost four years of the game's first release -- haven't yet been fixed by the developers. The game performers poorly on computers above its rcommended specifications and fixing it is no easy task. Still to this day there's no definitive method for AMD users to get completely rid of stuttering and small FPS drops, not to mention a proper (official or from the community) fix for the various bugs that lurk around the corners -- one of which got me frustrated and made me leave the game aside for more than a year. This might be one of those cases where you have to ignore the performance issues to fully enjoy the game, as DX:HR-DC is not a proper PC title/port.Pros:  Friendly to newcomers of the franchise  Very sharp stealth mechanics aligned with a decent AI  RPG elements with the augmentations upgrades  The player is not constantly forced to make use of the FPS mechanics  Large variety of paths and strategies within a single level  Intelligent hacking mechanic  Immersive cyberpunk setting with a deep story, mature context and complex, relatable characters  Beautiful design and soundtrack  Hard and meaningful choices that matter  Multiple endings  Adam's dark pastCons:  Performance issues  Bugs -- lots of them  AMD users might have more difficulty in fixing problems  No ""auto-sort"" in the inventory  Too many endings (a total of twelve)If you like cyberpunk themes and stealth games, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a safe bet. And even if you're not particularly interested in what the game has to offer, it might surprise you!			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a prequel to the original Deus Ex game and follows the story of Adam Jensen, a security chief at an augmentation (cybernetic implantation) industry, who finds himself augmented against his will and put against a myterious conspiracy he must discover and twhart in time.The story of Human Revolution keeps itself interesting for the whole game, with a very clever portrait of technology advancements debates, few cameos from characters of Deus Ex and a good bunch of original protagonists. As with every Deus Ex title there is a lot of reading and exploring to do for players who really want to dig further in the game's setting: doing so even awards you nice chunks of experience every time.Gameplay-wise, one must say that Human Revolution offers less freedom of action than its predecessor. While in the original Deus Ex you could go around destroying anyone and anything or decide to either incapacitate or plain evade both regular enemies without any consequence, truly allowing you to slowly build your own way to overcome the game's challenges, this sequel still gives you the same amount of freedom, but turns the table more in favor of an action-packed approach. Each boss encounter requires you to kill your enemy and every one of them are very durable augmented agents that will torn apart a player that relayed only on stealth and evasion up to that point. You can't run away either. There are also several instances in the game where going full killing mode against your enemies is required to achieve certain results.The Director's Cut DLC tried to fix such design choices by adding to the bosses arenas more way to eliminate them with indirect means. However, it's worth mentioning that you still HAVE to kill them and they have been severly buffed up from the first version of the game, to the point that even trying to off them with hacking or unconventional means is very hard without some protective or straight combat augs.The Missing Link DLC is a four hours worthy new content that was fully integrated in the main story of Human Revolution with the Director's Cut. The DLC takes place on a Belltower cargo ship, the Hei Zhen Zhu, and requires you to find and neutralize the local mercenary leader in order to continue your main story to Singapore. Whyle the ship features very crampy environments, the whole DLC still feels like a Deus Ex game, with plenty of alternative options to choose from. The final boss of the Missing Link is also much more Deus-Ex-esque than the ones from the vanilla game.I would totally reccomend Deus Ex: Human Revolution due to its outsanding story and gameplay united with a huge replay value that allows you to experience a different kind of game every time you decide how to deal with the enemies and the other NPCS your own special way differently			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is an amazing game, but... some of the game mechanics are just to frustrating for me so I am unable to enjoy this gem. Bodies get stuck in the doors so you cant move them so you get spotted and the alarm goes off, making a stealth/pacifist run damn near impossible, especially in  The Missing Link(DLC). The Directors Cut of this game promissed a full pacifist system, but they didnt deliver, so you have a pacifist achievement which excludes bosses that you HAVE to kill!!! Also it includes the forementioned DLC in which they strip you of all your praxis points and leave you with your pants down to be bent over  and ♥♥♥♥ed. I love this game, but prepare your F5 and F8 keys...			"

I've completed multiple playthroughs with a different style of play (stealth, guns blazing, and eveerything inbetween) and enjoyed each one. The atmosphere this game has is incredible. Honestly speaking, if you're into action-rpg and/or sci-fi or even philosophy, you'd most likely enjoy what this game has to offer. If you're unsure, wait for a sale. There is one going on now as I write this review. I find the $20 asking price is fair so if you have a chance to pick it up on sale, I highly recommend you do so.			"

												I've had it for what seems like forever and finally decided to play it as Mankind Divided was already out. Thus far I can say I am thoroughly enjoying it. There are quite a few augmemnts that I feel are quite useless though such as the radar, seeing through walls, & seeing my own noise. At least for me it is. Of course if you desire to play through it a second time, I recommend going with your play style in the way of augments and just getting the rest later to add a bit more variety and spice to you gameplay. I certainly intend to replay the game on the highest difficulty with all augments at my disposal. Though I am uncertain if I will be able to unlock them all before the end of the game.Below is the first part of my own starting experience with it. I definite recommend you all play this. I could go on about how good it looks, the sound, but its nothing you wouldn't have already heard about. If you don't have this title yet....buy it, breath it, live it.

Posted: September 13, 2015
												I'm writing this review from the perspective of someone who's never touched the first game. Deus Ex: Human Revolution, to me, is the pinnacle of modern RPG games. It has super satisfying gunplay and extremely tense stealth moments when playing on the hardest difficulty. The areas are incredibly detailed and you are rewarded greatly for not barging though every room. Around every corner there's some kind of secret, a piece of lore in the form of an eBook, Email, Newspaper, etc., and there's always multiple ways to attack any given situation (With some exception to scripted boss fights, which still can technically be taken down any way you please, I took out the first boss with sniper headshots instead of using the explosives in the room)The hub areas are massive and filled with unique stories and side quests to be done. The world is alive with police, gang members, and civilians, all able to share specifically two pieces of dialogue with you. The combat in this game is extremely satisfying, as is the stealth, as are the persuasion moments, as are the non-lethal takedowns, as are the lethal takedowns. This game lets you approach in any way you choose and you can have a good time doing it.That's being said, this game obviously is not without it's faults, and here's a quick pro/con list to help sort some of these things out.PROS:Stealth and Combat are equally satisfying:  Though one option is technically better, and I'll get to that in a moment, neither is more satisfying than the other. The stealth mechanics work really well, where if one enemy thinks he sees you the others aren't immediatly alerted. They'll question whether the guy who saw you is going crazy or drunk or something before searching for you, if they even do. Enemies don't just instantly drop what they're doing, they go through a few stages of detection. Oblivious, Suspicious, Alterted, and Hostile. At each stage it will take longer for them to ignore you, and they will be more and more alert. The gunplay is also extremely well put together, with the guns feeling satisfying and being extremely fun to use effectively. So in the event you're caught, you won't feel dissatisfied (Other than with your lack of ability to stay hidden)The areas are extremely detailed: There's something unique around every corner, and if you pay close enough attention you can find terminals to hack that lead to weapon mods, money, and ammo. This game rewards you for not rushing it, it rewards you for thinking, and it rewards exploration in a really nice way. These are really the two main pros, obviously there's the interesting story backed with gamey voice acting that we're all used to. Some of the voice acting is pretty good, but most of it is pretty corny and obviously read from a script, but that's okay. Now onto the con.Con:Stealth is clearly the superior way to play. Non-lethal takedowns and hacking reward extremely highly. Normal kills get you 10 whatever points, headshots get you 20, while non-lethal takedowns always get you 30 or more. Hacking also gives you points, so even if you know the code to a door or computer, you might as well just hack it for the extra points and upgrades. Using stealth you can easily unlock every augment in the game, which breaks a lot of replay value. The only reason not to use stealth would be to see how the story changes when you kill everyone, which is extremely difficult on the hardest setting. I wish that it wasn't such a clear choice to go for stealth if you're looking for all the money and upgrades, but it is. Anyways, this game is extremely fun, and very deep. There's tons of content and i've barely scratched the surface of the game 12 hours into it, because I can't stop finding new places to go and new areas to explore. This game does exploration and discovery in a uniquely satsisfying way and I highly recommend picking it up.			"

												Deus Ex - it is surprisingly bright mix of action, stealth, role-playing, simulation detective.Deus Ex - it is a deep gameplay, great atmosphere and great music, unbanal philosophical plot.Deus Ex - it's a dark, interesting world of the future in which to live and solve problems in an adult.

												a very fun game, wether you like RPG's, stealth, action or first person shooters, this is a game that really ticks all the boxes. the combat is great, the leveling system is awesome and the story is just amazing, several plot twist will bend your mind back to front playing this game.the objectice is neve confusing like some games can, if you get stuck you just check the map and your fine. stealth is hard but rewarding a nd if playing on hard, its quite critical you master it.the only problem i had with this game is that some of the powers/upgrades can sometimes be very over powered, for instance, the is a small bit in a game where you need to cross a big room and get to the elevator and 50 guards come in toward you. jensen has the ability to turn invisible (once you buy the ability) and all i did was turn invisible and run past them. it feels like some of the hardest bits of the game wernt as chalanging as i would have like the to be.over all a perfect game for everyone     9.5/10  MUST BUY			"

												In it's core Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a good game.I was pleased to see, that it can both run smooth and look good (surprisingly, at least for me, it runs better with Directx 11 enabled than with disabled), although it took some research and tweaking with game's settings.I don't have much negative things to say about sound either. Outside of fight music is more to the subtle side, after a while I started to not notice it much anymore and got used to it being there, it became inseparable part of the surroundings.Voice acting was mostly good too.The time you spend in the game will be divided into exploring the level, taking care of bad guys and talking to people.Levels are designed with different player's approaches in mind. There are many paths which you can take to get on better position or to get straight past the enemy, you just have to find them or have the augmentations to use them. There is of course always an option to go head on and shoot through the enemies.Every level has also many hidden items scattered around, which rewards exploration.There is also a lot of hacking to be had and hacking minigame here is one of the better you will see.Combat is cover based and stealth oriented.Sneaking around and taking down enemies one by one is the easiest way how to play the game. Sticking to cover will get you to 3d person mode, so you can look around corners, not to mention you have radar which shows position and facing of nearby enemies.When the enemies don't know where exactly you are, they behave really stupid. They walk on their paths, they never notice a missing buddy, when they briefly see you they will investigate but then they will quickly return to their path, sometimes they will play with their phones/tablets paying almost no attention to what is going on and they can be easily lured out of group with noise. It's the standart stealth AI we all know, nothing new but it still works.In direct combat their AI is sufficient. They will make use of cover, they remember your last location and will try to pin you down with fire, sometimes they throw grenades and may even divide and try to get closer to you.The story is the usual conspiracy, which you are uncovering bit by bit. For the most part it's focused on following the trail to find kidnapped scientists with sidestories on the way. There are choices to be made here and there but only a few has an impact on the game.There are some good characters with well written dialog, but unimportant characters can deliver few pretty terrible lines. Talking animations could use some work too, I don't talk about lips but body movement. Characters have tendency to repeat animations often and sometimes they look unsettled, almost shaking. For an RPG there is not that much talking here, but it's balanced out with persuasion minigames.Inventory system is a tetris on checkerboard with pieces of different sizes. Some might find it too small, but with upgrades it's more than enough. You won't fit all weapons there, but you will stick to few weapons which you upgrade anyway and you don't need to loot everything you find, because most things you need you will find, not buy. Unless you have a real problem with hording consumable items, you will get over it.Augmentations, you will unlock them using praxis kits, which you can find and also you will gains them for experience. There are just a few augmentations which I found useless, the others are usefull, more or less in dependence on your playstyle.Experience gain is problem though. You are rewarded with more experience for using non lethal methods and even more for non lethal takedowns (your close range attack consuming energy). It makes sense, unconscious enemy can be revived and for takedown you have to get close. But if you want to maximaze your experience, you are forced to certain playstale. It's either having fun or being effective. For me it would be better if there was just no set experience for every enemy, but it's more a nitpick.There are some things, which was bothering me though.First of all is lack of detail. Outside of main characters, there is little to no interactivity with other npcs in the levels. There are also numerous things which breaks immersion. Just to name a few, you can walk into a shop, go right past it's owner into back room, steal whatever you find there and the npc will not even take notice of your presence. Or in Alice Garden Pods during Belltower attack, you can still see closed pods with silhouettes of people just reading a book while civilian npcs are laying around dead. I guess Belltower soldiers are just kind enough to not disturb them and will settle for killing those who stand around.What makes it even worse is that developers had balls to put in pocket secretaries with unfinished text like the writer was interrupted by the attack.Also, if you will steal from offices in Sarif industries Headquaters, you will get emails from personel blaming each other for your thefts. This is a nice detail, which makes the overall lack of detail even more annoying.Also, if you have Direct's Cut version, there is dlc content integrated into the game. In practice it means, that when you get into cryopod to get yourself on a boat, which is near end of the game, you will be thrown into dlc, where they will take all your augmentations away at the beggining.I personally really hate when game takes all your benefits away without a possibility to avoid it. When you go trough most of the game exploring every inch of the level, taking down every enemy, going for the bonus experience for completing level unnoticed to get augmentations you want, and then when you have them and you finally don't have to care about experience and you can go trough level as you want, you just don't want to suddenly do that again, because game will take it away.That made me stop playing for few months. I'm glad I take a break, or else I would rush through that part just to get over with when actually it is a well made set of levels and dialogs with Quinn were great too.Just a few last things to mention - unskippable intro sequence and npcs interrupting you in persuasion minigame with ""You have nothing to say?"". Unnecessary.So, the game is good, just rough on the edges. It is definitely a worthy sequel, recommended.			"

												Deus Ex: HR is one of the most beautiful games of its time, and often precedes the quality of many that follow it. I liken it to a premature GTA V, having many mechanics and unique quirks that make this game part of the leaders into the open-world charge that we now see in games. Featuring large, broad maps and storylines long enough to wrap around the earth (and again), DXHR is a great example of what games should be considered besides fun: works of art.(Disclaimer: I have played this game multiple times outside of Steam, the time above is just with this client.)

												A better version of ""Invisible War"", but this time with actual stealth. Although stealth in this game can be very much broken, so the game might be leaning in the shooter genre very much so. Same flaws as in the previous game. Reusage of assets, animations e.t.c.. Even if you call level a ""HUB"" doesn't mean it's fine to play it again. Repetitiveness - basically you do the same thing the whole game, altering paths and choices help, but barely. There is still a lot of talking, but now you have an incentive to actually talk to the people, even though most of them are just to fill the space. There are a lot of weapons, but some of them are really bad for some reason. Crossbow and double-barrel are examples of that. Overall the game is playable, in the beginning it can be actually fun, but the real problem of this release is the DLC - ""The Missing Link"". It's placed in the middle of the game and boy is it awful. I considered dropping the game just not to have to play this DLC. They take all your weapons and skills you collected and loved through the game; that you are used to by now. Basically, you start all over. Not only that, DLC is not polished at all, its barely finished. And it crashes too. Main game haven't crashed once, but this mission kept crashing all throughout. And for that, i suggest if you want to play this, go with original release. For you would be able not to play this trash called ""The Missing Link"", because you will be missing not playing it "

												Background: Big fan of the original, love stealth games and the Bladerunner cyberpunk genre.The Good:* Interesting plot and missions* Real options for both stealth and assault * Interesting powers change gameplay* World looks great and lived in* Large, well planned sandbox type maps* Long and varied location campaign* Feels a lot like a solo Mass Effect missionThe Bad:* Bland character models and stiff animations* Stealth sections are far too easy with obvious routes and dumb cameras* Weapons and upgrades lack impact* Buggy quests make completion impossible* Hacking mechanic is boring & characters ignore you stealing from them* Sandbox play makes for nonsensical conversations* Map system is oddly weak in a technological future* NPCs speak as if you aren't standing there and totally ignore you doing awesome featsImpressions: I really liked the experience despite some terrible lack of refinement and  buggy gameplay. The stealth options are a blast even if the enemy is really easy to predict.Recommended for: sci-fi stealth fans.Conclusion.7/10. Despite it's flaws it's a lot of fun to play and not being too taxing always keep you moving forward. "

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is an amazing game, but... some of the game mechanics are just to frustrating for me so I am unable to enjoy this gem. Bodies get stuck in the doors so you cant move them so you get spotted and the alarm goes off, making a stealth/pacifist run damn near impossible, especially in  The Missing Link(DLC). The Directors Cut of this game promissed a full pacifist system, but they didnt deliver, so you have a pacifist achievement which excludes bosses that you HAVE to kill!!! Also it includes the forementioned DLC in which they strip you of all your praxis points and leave you with your pants down to be bent over  and ♥♥♥♥ed. I love this game, but prepare your F5 and F8 keys...			"

												I've promised myself muitiple times that the next playthrough was the last, but no, I had to play it several more times that I've lost count. In fact, I might even play it again several more times, even if I'll follow the same mindset/route(s). Hell, I might even discover a new route or two, or even a cache of items. With this in mind, each playthrough may or may not be similar depending on how you go on about it. In fact, certain paths might even trigger some dialogue, give you a better vantage point, lead to a shortcut, or even all three.So the Director's Cut adds the DLCs released for the game and some changes for the boss fights as well. The Missing Link story is implimented into the game instead of seperate from it entirly. This adds at least 3~5-ish hours to a somewhat long game. Though I haven't played the original version of the game, I can't really tell you the differences in glitches or visuals, so I'm leaving that out.Gameplay falls under the stealth and action genres, so You can go in guns blazing, stealth kill eveyone(or just a few), or go full pacifist, but you still have to kill the bosses to progress the story though. I find it easier to just kill off everyone as stealthily as possible before I get caught, or just use the cloak augment and book it for next area.Overall, the game is great. I look forward to my future playthroughs even though the experience might get stale but I don't mind. I'll give this game a 9/10, but why a 9? because it can feel a bit slow at times (obviously because its a stealth game of course). But don't let that deter you, that's just from my experience. If you are still on the fence with it, just think it through. Buy it when it's on sale if you're still not sure so it's not a waste of twenty bucks if you regrete it.			"

												Well where do i start!i was fortunate to be introduced to the Deus ex world back in the day when my old boss bought the game and after just 10 minuites of playing actually stood up and took the cd out of the drive and threw it at me saying 'you can have this load of ****! buzzing i took the game and ran home as soon as i could (i was 16!) and bypassed various security doors and traversed many vents (in my mind) and literly did not come up for air until my brain could not take any more FPS!Wow i was reboarn and my new fav game was deus ex. as the years passed i installed every mod you can imagine for the original game and i beleave i have completed the game over 20 time! next came invisible war, although not n where as solid as the original deus ex i enjoyed it.This brings me onto this gem of a game... when i heard the news of next installment of Deus ex human revolutions i promptly place all my family members on ebar so i could raise the money for the game!What followed was pure bliss..I was welcomed by a deep well thoughtout storyline with in my opinion impecable gameplay.From the hud to the small details you find during your journey through this inmense world.The praxis system and upgrading system was similar to the first titel but managed to up the ante just a little. The storyline is compelling and never in my opinion lets you down.The locations again match the storyline to a T and the options you are presented with regarding the aproach to every level or map in the game are what will keep this game everlasting and replayable over and over againto summerise if i could recommend any game out there to new players to the franchise or our old friends returning to this title i would highly recommend dues ex human revolutions. i would even go so far as to invent a machine to wipe my memory just so i can play it again from fresh!100/10 !!! stop waisting time reading more reviews and buy this game in all of its glory.ps - i only have 16.5 hours in game on steam but i have owned the game on original PC version for ages.PPs- i know this i a little naugthy but i just carnt help myself... After like the majority of the steam community waiting for 5 years for mankind devived i am sad to see and read the reviews. I have not played the game and unfortunately i have not bought the game due to the negative feedback it has been given. I activly return to the forum everyday hopeing for some positive reviews or for some kind of wonder patch to be applyed but sadly i now for over 2 weeks has been the same story...I am probley like stan in eminem regarding deus ex and as i will not be purchasing mankind divided until the issues are changed i cannot post a review on the manking divided forums.I have my 50e waiting for things to change or i will simply buy human revolutions for someone unfortunate to be able to afford it so i can bring a little happiness to someone and introduce them to heaven on earth.peaceShootme "

												(For those of you wondering whether this is a version of Human Revolution with Montreal and/or Upper Hengsha city hubs: sorry, this isn't it.  At this point, I doubt it'll ever come our way, at least barring a ""Super Director's Cut"" edition.  Don't be waiting for it.)The DE:HR Director's Cut integrates The Missing Link, a previously standalone story, into the original game, and adds in a New Game Plus mode which carries over all abilities (but no items, sadly) from a completed playthrough.  Some preorder-bonus missions are also added in, but the best addition here is a stellar commentary from the biggest names behind the game.  Seriously - give it a listen.  There's a ton of it (about 8 hours total), but quite a bit of it is insightful and interesting.  A new gold standard for commentary in video games (sorry Valve).Newcomers: this is an absolute steal for twenty bucks.  A playthrough of the Director's Cut will take you anywhere from 35-60 hours, depending on how much you see and do, and it's just a flat-out great game besides.  The art direction, soundtrack, and story are first-rate, as are the scenarios that accommodate a range of playstyles the Deus Ex universe is renowned for supporting.  Whether you try to sneak, hack, or shoot your way through this universe, it's a good time.			"

												It's everything the original game was and more. It's got all the DLC (Including Missing Link) preinstalled and neatly weaseled into the main story so it's really just one fluid playthrough of the entire game. I've played some 45 hours which got me two full playthroughs (one for fun and one for achievement-whoring) and an additional four playthroughs of the Missing Link-part because I'm an idiot and forgot that automatic unlocking devices count as grenades, when I was trying to get ""Factory Zero"".Anyways, I've read a lot of crap on the forums about people having absolutely TERRIBAD framerates with this version of the game, so if you do not want the commentary and don't really care about playing it all in a fluid playthrough, then you can get the original + DLC instead.Personally I find this version way superiour because of what is mentioned above, and for the fact that you now have options for fighting the bosses. You don't HAVE to invest in combat skills in order to beat them. Much appreciated!			"

												The Director's Cut offers some enhancements over the original version as well as Developers Commentary and Making of footage. Among the new features are the improvements in Boss Fight where you are not limited or forced to front armed combat, and the integration of The Missing Link DLC.Putting the Director's Cut tag to a side, and having played on Normal, I must admit I was faced with one of the dumbest AI. The story, cliched as it is, it's also interesting enough to get you hooked the whole game. Controls are awkward as shooting mechanics, but once you get used to them it becomes a much enjoyable experience.Graphics are very nice, and characters are coupled with good quality voice acting, but it's in the music department where this title really shines. Character leveling and the choices you make give replayability to the different stages and situations.In short, nothing too outstanding, but in spite of it's flaws I still recommend this game. After all, it's surely in the top 10 of AAA titles of the year.Edit: Added screenshots.			"

DISCLAIMER: Don't get fooled by many negative reviews, most of them compare Director's Cut to the original. Original, however, doesn't seem to be available on Steam anymore, so if you've never played it, this is your best (and only) chance!Now, let's get on with the review.Never played Human Revolution? - Get it!Already played HR, should I get Director's Cut? - Got money to spare? Want trading cards/badges? Missed DLC? Sure, go for it. Otherwise, not really. Pros- amazing story- dialogue and other choices have effects later on- you can choose stealth and not kill a single enemy or go on an all-out killing spree. You can also combine those two approaches- multiple solutions to various situations- custom select your abilities (augmentations) to fit your playstyle- a lot of playtime for purely single-player experience (first playthrough is likely going to take you 20-30 hours, how many single-player games offer that nowadays?)Cons- a lot of moving between objectives and your sprinting doesn't last all that long(Wow, that's all I could come up with. I may add some more later but right now, I can't seem to think of anything else that could bother someone. Note: See the Differences section below for potential cons)Differences between regular and Director's Cut [+/-]+ re-worked bossfights, making them less harsh on players who choose stealth + integrated DLC- colors seem washed out, can be fixed with ENB- may encounter some performance issues and/or bugs. Personally, I didn't notice any but maybe I'm just lucky.  "

The stealth sequences are very old-fashioned, in that they work well enough if you choose to stay concealed but fall apart badly if you prefer to kill quietly.  The shooting mechanics are hindered by poor controls - left trigger dives for cover instead of aiming down sights, etc - and by guns that just don't feel good.  It's great that the weapons can be upgraded in all manner of ways, but it's all for naught if they don't feel good to shoot.  Case in point: the round from a sniper rifle shouldn't drop in flight by 18 inches during a 25 yard shot.  Also, a guy that gets hit in the head with a finger-long projectile traveling at roughly 700 mph shouldn't immediately snap to attention and try to figure out who shot him just because he's wearing a helmet.  Finally, the parts of the game that attempt to challenge players by way of dialogue choices feels like LA Noire - the clues and responses that you're given don't correspond very tightly to the desired outcomes; two players making the same choices won't necessarily get the same result - it's stupid.All that said, the game features an intriguing story and is good enough (barely) at what it does to be worth playing.  The director's cut (poorly) incorporates the Missing Link DLC into the main campaign and adds some optional DVD-style commentary.  Unfortunately, because the upgrade exists as a separate title in the Steam library no saved games or achievements carry over into the new game.  I'd say that it's worth grabbing, but only if you don't already own The Missing Link.			"

												dope game. one of the longer single player games ive tried (took me 25hours to beat it on second difficulity). completed all the sidequests that i could find but found out after looking over the achievements that i missed some.pros:-augs are sick-character interaction is smooth-the different endings are interesting monologues-soundtrack is awesome-combat is fun (stealth, weapons (really liked the sniper rifle), etc) using weapons are a lot more enjoyable then the repetitive stealth takedowns)cons:-voice acting -boss fights are a bit meh (examaple: Namirs grenades and plasma rifle are a joke. i literally just took cover chucking grenades. on using my emp grenade i would pop out and do some shots then repeat. i wasnt able to be touched)-hacking is very easy			"

												This game was a love letter to the very first Deus Ex released way back in the year 2000 when The Matrix film was making waves in the science fiction community. HR follows almost the same plot as the first Deus Ex from the beginning, but thankfully HR has the benefit of modern gameplay.My favourite part of the game was using stealth to execute completely unnoticed ""instant takedowns"" (aka punching 1 or 2 dudes so hard that they were permanently knocked unconscious). The real challenge was hiding their sleeping bodies so that no other enemies would find and wake them.It was very easy to exploit this game's AI. I once lured 5 guards to the second floor just by running and jumping around. I laid them out unconscious side by side. You'd think they'd have radios for their commanding officer to check in! However, this is not a drawback. Rather, you can exploit the AI in many, many creative and funny ways, just like the first Deus Ex.Overall this game had the right balance of action, drama and humour. I recommend this game to anyone, not just Deus Ex fans.			"

												Absolutely stunner game that has elements of stealth, shooting, rpg and really intuitive gameplay. The story is amazing with mystery around every corner as you try to solve why your Sarif Industries is being targeted by an unknown group. On the way the game makes it feel like an RPG in the way that you can upgrade your character, your characters weapons pretty much everything. And during the whole game besides the in game guidance the game makes you feel very independant and makes you constantly question yourself ""am I doing the right thing"" ""should I sneak attack or go in guns blazing on everyone"". It also has alot of things to do on the wa,y such as looting bodies or hacking random computer just to get that little credit bonus or ammo that makes the game go for so, so much more longer.This combined with its amazing graphics and gameplay make for quite the game. In retrospect its just a futuristic assassins creed. And for $20 you cant go wrong ps. I got the bundle for $7 >:)			"

												Director's Cut is a big improvement on the original Deus Ex Human Revolution: better boss fights, developer commentary, the missing link dlc included, etc.I've played mostly the original version, so not the Director's Cut (that's why only 6 hours).- Perfect conspiracy storyline- Very satisfying gameplay- 3 ways to play: guns blazing, stealth assassin (lethal or non-lethal) or pacifist (avoid any combat by using cloaking, etc.)- Great visuals: graphics and art-style- Great music soundtracks and perfect voice acting overall- Rewards exploring within the open world city hubs and looking for alternative routes- Very smart leveling system to get praxis points that can be used to upgrade a wide variety of augmentations- Very satisfying hacking minigame that is also very useful against enemies and for resources- Bunch of side quests to find and also lots of npc to interact with- Wide variety of lethal and non-lethal weapons and gadgets for your weaponsI actually have no complains about it really.- Or no, there is 1 thing, the game could be even much better game if the developers had more time.Because during the developer commentary (turn it on or off in the option menu), the devs tell a lot about the stuff that was cut like sidequests, realtime translation augmentation, India city hub, etc.But overall, no complains. It is already a fantastic game without all the stuff that was cut from the game.And a great prequel for the original Deus Ex.I just love the art work in this game.10/10Worth buying for any price sale or not.One of the best singleplayer experiences, you'll have.

												Completely worth it, the game is passed on the future, where augmented people are starting to become more and more usual, causing a divide between augmented humans and normal humans, you are Adam Jensen, security chief of Sarif Industries and after an attack in sarif industries he gets completely augmented, and then you start molding your history. Will you kill or simply leave your enemies uncounscious before you? Are you superior because you are augmented, or is that a curse, or even not something to be superior about, but something that will help the lives of all human beings? Those are things you will choose throught the game, it's a great game. "

												Okay so I really liked this game and to make my review very short I want to mention that the game has a lot more good than bad.Pros-Amazing Graphics-Long and engaging story- Action/ stealth play-Power ups-Exploration- Difficult if you like that sort of thing.ConsThe game has only a few cons which are.-Weapons should be upgradable more often given you stronger weapons and not needing a dealer.-Not many unique sidequests (mostly just going into peoples apartmets and beating them up which is actually a lot of fun but not a lot of variety).-Shooting mechanics can be a little tighter and allow for controller adjustment (Played with an xbox 360 controller)-Exploration is limited to areas in a city that are not anywher near the vast expansion of Skyrim and other like games.Overal go ahead and get it its worth the money and you will have fun playing it. The Steam sale does allow you to get it for super cheap but its worth getting for 20 I originally bought it for xbox 360 for 70, Did not beat it until I re bought it for steam.			"

												I never finished the 'vanilla' version of DXHR as I lost patience by the second boss battle, despite a well crafted experience fitting of the first game.Glad to say that this 'directors cut' adequately fixes the jarring boss battles, as well as seamlessly adding all the DLC packs and additional 'Missing Link' content into the full game. This more than makes up for the orignal game's failings.My only annoyance, and this stands for the first game was the jarring completely different final section that puts you into a completely different stuation. All makes sense plotwise, but from a gameplay perspective, a bit of a jump.Still, this 'director's cut' is well worth a go, especially if you missed out back in 2011.			"

With a gamescape that is like walking into the world of Bladerunner, the mix of futuristic afluency, high-tech augs and the search for immortality, mixed with street thugs, filth ridden alleyway quests with insight into some criminal underworld, all works so well to create this dystopian future, where technology is loved and hated, needed and abused to be used as a weapon against it's own creators.

												I have played Deus ex Human Revolution on my Ps3 for a long time and in the summer sales of steam i saw this offer for just 5 euros and I just knew I had to buy this upgraded version of Deus ex Human Revolution, but the question for me is, is this upgraded version worth it or not. To start of with, Deus ex Human Revolution is a very good game that lets you play whatever way you want to play, if its stealth, more violent or a mix between both or even without killing anyone, you can play all those ways and lots more. This gives it a lot of replay value ( at least for me). The stealth system is pretty well done, i've seen better stealth games but it's still a great stealth game, the more violent way of playing isn't the great part of this game as its not really enjoyable at least if you play it on the hardest difficulty. The story is superb and I love how this is a openworld game but still linear. Oberall the normal version of this game is for me one of the best game of the last 3 years and i would highly suggest it.Now the question is, is this marveallous game worth it if you already own the normal version, firs of all if you havent played this game yet I highly recommend you buy this version and not the normal version because it also includes the dlc. This upgraded version comes with 3 mayor upgrades: first it includes the dlc, second it has the developers commentary which I find highly entertaining and it just gives you more depth in the game and thirt boss fights can be done stealthly. It also upgrades a bit the graphics and some game mechanics. I recommend this version if you dont own th dlc, but if you dont own it  recommend it because of the dlc and developers commentary because it gives your new playthrough more depth at the cost of just 5 euros. I find this version superior to the normal version and a must have on your gaming library			"

												This game is a monumental achievement, a unique singleplayer experience combining FPS elements with stealth, puzzles and a complex and engaging story.The atmosphere created by the impeccable graphic design, good voice acting and stunning soundtrack is truly memorable. The game world is crafted masterfully and in great detail: from the essential characters that are interesting and flawed to the futuristic settings for the intriguing tehcno thriller of a story, the player is treated with such quality and class that only a few games do. The game offers an astounding amount of information and small details for the player to consume (should they be so inclined).The levels and character customization provide the player with a number of options to achieve the goal in any given mission and indeed DX:HRDC is one of the very few first person games that actually offer the player multiple ways to finish the game. Moreover, depending on player choice the mission outcomes may vary significantly and the story unfold in a different manner. If you explore the world and finish side quests it will probably take around 25 - 35 hours to finish the game. The new Director's Cut edition integrates the Missing Link DLC seamlessly into the main game in addition to which it also comes with a ""making of"" documentary, commentary mode, a new game+ option and a host of other changes and tweaks. DX:HRDC is the best version of the game yet and a truly epic experience that should not be missed!			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution (DXHR) is the third installment in the Deus Ex series of games. This is a prequel previous to both Deus Ex and Deus Ex: Invisible War.The previous games were set in the distant future (2050's) where human augmentation is a reality, the United States is no longer a major global power, mega corporations have filled the power vacuum and conspiracies underpin all of it.DXHR is however set some twenty years earlier in 2027. You portray Adam Jensen, chief of security of Sarif Industries, a mid-sized manufacturer of human augmentations and contractor to the United States military. Along with Megan Reed your former flame and chief scientist of the same company. Along with her and CEO David Sarif, they are about to make a major announcement of a discovery that will potentially make human augmentation accessible to all and not just those who can afford the drug Neuropozyne, which is required to prevent the body from rejecting the augmentation. With the goal to enhance human lives, David Sarif sees this as the start of the next stage of human evolution.This is the initial premise of the game as shown during the introduction/tutorial of the game. Like the previous installments it is a first person shooter with stealth elements and ability to complete tasks using different paths. Deus Ex was a personal favourite of mine when I played it because you could play the game largely as you liked (main plot missions withstanding) and then experience the consequences of your actions play out accordingly. In most respects DXHR features the same gameplay elements.There are three styles of play: direct approach, indirect approach and avoiding contact altogether. For instance to open a door you can take out a guard then take the code from them, hack a computer terminal for the code or just bypass the door itself.Combat likewise has varied options with melee combat (called a takedown), an array of short to long range ballistic, energy and chemical weapons as well as the option to (depending on the weapon of choice) lethally and non-lethally taking out your opponent. Almost all weapons can be upgraded to suit your style of play as well.This of course leads to the element of the game. Augmentations can be aquired as the game progresses and allows you to essentially gain superhuman abilities over time. I won't go into specifics as this is what makes Deus Ex stand out from other FPS's. But they are well worth the wait as they help you to complete tasks in a variety of new ways.Pro's:A lot of work and attention to detail went into the in-game environments and characters to create a credible immersive experience.Excellent writing and voice work by all involved. A lot of work went into getting everything right.Amazing soundtrack by Michael McCann. Fits and enhances the atmosphere and immersion in game immensely.The game strikes the right balance between being giving you many options in-game and the tasks themselves not being too generic as is the case in other FPS sand box style games.Con's:It felt like the developers were running out of time during production as the story speeds up significantly towards the end of the game.Diehard players with feel the game helps you too much in completing a task, some visual aids can be however turned off.The animations (especially during conversations) are repeatedly used which ruins some of the work gone into the characters themselves.Overall the game comprises a healthy mix of a well structured story, game play, character development all set in a cyberpunk, distopian future. If you feel this is up your alley I do recommend giving this game a go.			"

												Deus Ex follows on from both a Genre defining classic, and a disappointing cash-in kludge.Fortunately, though Human Revolution began by following in the footsteps of ""Invisible War"" with bugs and design mis-steps, notably having two levels of the game and some of the usable items ripped out to be game-store exclusives, and the entire bridghing third act yanked out to be a DLC... Not to mention the Boss Fight Thing.Human Revolution has grown up into a a sucessor to the original game: The missing levels and game section, complete with it's story and tools has been re-integrated, the graphics tweaked, bugs removed, and crucially for feel of it, you're now allowed to do more than run into a room screaming and shooting the boss characters in the face.As in the previous games, you get the chance to evade these situations and use alternate methods.Also included are Making Of and Commentary options and a new system to allow you to play through from the start with all your hard won upgrades.Sadly the Intel Intelliscreen system that was to allow you to use your phone or tablet as a controller seem to be nowhere to be found apart from as a commet that there is such a thing.

												Still a great game.Lots of choice in how to approach situations, an interesting story and a very good non-lethal option.Graphically, it's distinctive, but texturing, both on characters and the environment, is spotty. While relatively high detail in most cases, it just feels a little amateurish sometimes. Character models also look a little odd, especially for characters that don't play a central part in the story.The orange/gold colour scheme can end up wearing you down too.I've never actually played the game focussing on weapons and combat, choosing the non-lethal route, so I can't comment on how gunplay feels, but stealth options are very satisfying.It is however a very long game, so doesn't lend itself to immediate replays. And this length is punishing if you're chasing achievements, particularly if you're going for one of the ones that relies on a perfect playthrough, such as Pacifist or Foxiest of the Hounds. There's no way of knowing you've failed these achievements until you've completed the game, and the systems can occasionally break beyond your control, potentially costing you the achievement.Still, the journey's a great one and the game deserves to be played			"

It's rewarding to look around to find hidden stuff. Playing at highest difficulty force you to be stealthy and it give a great rewarding feeling when you complete levels without being spotted once. The story has a great plot twist. Hacking minigame is fun but since there is so many things to hack it tends to get a little old at the end of the game.

												A friend recommended this game to me, but from the way it was described to me, I was skeptical that this game would be any good. I had not played the original game, nor did I realize until later that this game was a prequel. However, once I actually started playing the game, it took less than a half an hour for me to become completely immersed in the story and general gameplay. From a skeptic to a raging fan, I cannot praise this game highly enough. The quests are fun, the content is challanging, and the game gets extra points for the ""New Game+"" feature, which adds to the replay value. The only complaint I can really offer for this game - when I finally beat it, I felt a bit disappointed that it was over. I realize that I had logged 31 hours into the game already, but a part of me felt like I should only be about halfway through the game.  Yep. That's right. My complaint is that I beat it. Now I'm going into plotline withdrawls.  Seriously, I'd rate this game 12 out of 10.			"

												For fans of the original title from 2000, this game is everything you could want and more. Without spoilers, the storyline was engrossing, weaving all the characters together into a network of conspiracy and intrigue. The time I needed to play through the game first-time was about 50 hours, so you're getting your $$'s worth in gaming content. The characters you encounter are memorable and unique in their own ways. (The Chinese still have bad voice-acting, but thats no negative). Social persuasion was a part of the interaction with key characters as well as in the storyline. I'll admit, some of the conversations to convince somebody got pretty intense; hearing what they have to say in response to your own.The Combat is an interesting place to address. The mechanics are largely successful in allowing varied gameplay across the missions. If you want to stealth, there are ways to stealth. If you want to be Rambo, you can be Rambo (just expect a bit tougher experience). While going Rambo can get you through a mission, the game rewards the player for being ""ghostly"", or not detected by the enemy. The maps and locations gave many different approaches to get to an objective or in a firefight. Vents are sometimes seen in walls to allow the hiding of bodies or escaping from fight heat.The vast array of augmentations allows the player to shape Adam Jensen into the character you feel comfortable playing as. One of the things I liked about the augmentation system is that it didn't force any down your throat. When you collect Praxis Kits for augmentation upgrades, you have the choice to apply them or not. An interesting game playthrough worth considering is a No-Aug run, where you never upgrade (out of the thoughts of Jensen's aug-opinions).Overall, after completing the game myself, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys story-driven gameplay and well-executed stealth mechanics. Combining engrossing storyline with gameplay mechanics and player-choice, I rate this game a 9.5/10.			"

												I never asked for this.Rest in peace, big rizzle, etc.Something something augmented.This isn't a Deus Ex-tier game, but it's pretty fun regardless. The game is fairly linear by nature, but it does offer different playstyles (shoot people vs don't shoot people), and there doesn't seem to be much in the regards of ""gray area"" in moral development. Either you're an unrelenting murderous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and you're treated as such, or you're a saint (or ♥♥♥♥♥, according to others). Moreover, the game's regarding of your moral standing is fluid in the sense that people don't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about your past, only about what you just did 5-10 minutes ago. And, there's a lot of decisions that you make that you'd think would come back to bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥ but there's really only a select few that will serve to impede you in any way if you make the 'wrong' choice.The game is somewhat difficult if you're playing it for a stealth-based game, and pathetically easy if you're not. You can typhoon to victory, and you don't really need anything more than a 10mm pistol in the game if you're not a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (but the game is notorious for HAVING NO ♥♥♥♥ING PISTOL AMMO LATER IN THE GAME SERIOUSLY WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥)			"

												Deus Ex follows on from both a Genre defining classic, and a disappointing cash-in kludge.Fortunately, though Human Revolution began by following in the footsteps of ""Invisible War"" with bugs and design mis-steps, notably having two levels of the game and some of the usable items ripped out to be game-store exclusives, and the entire bridghing third act yanked out to be a DLC... Not to mention the Boss Fight Thing.Human Revolution has grown up into a a sucessor to the original game: The missing levels and game section, complete with it's story and tools has been re-integrated, the graphics tweaked, bugs removed, and crucially for feel of it, you're now allowed to do more than run into a room screaming and shooting the boss characters in the face.As in the previous games, you get the chance to evade these situations and use alternate methods.Also included are Making Of and Commentary options and a new system to allow you to play through from the start with all your hard won upgrades.Sadly the Intel Intelliscreen system that was to allow you to use your phone or tablet as a controller seem to be nowhere to be found apart from as a commet that there is such a thing.

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution (DXHR) is the third installment in the Deus Ex series of games. This is a prequel previous to both Deus Ex and Deus Ex: Invisible War.The previous games were set in the distant future (2050's) where human augmentation is a reality, the United States is no longer a major global power, mega corporations have filled the power vacuum and conspiracies underpin all of it.DXHR is however set some twenty years earlier in 2027. You portray Adam Jensen, chief of security of Sarif Industries, a mid-sized manufacturer of human augmentations and contractor to the United States military. Along with Megan Reed your former flame and chief scientist of the same company. Along with her and CEO David Sarif, they are about to make a major announcement of a discovery that will potentially make human augmentation accessible to all and not just those who can afford the drug Neuropozyne, which is required to prevent the body from rejecting the augmentation. With the goal to enhance human lives, David Sarif sees this as the start of the next stage of human evolution.This is the initial premise of the game as shown during the introduction/tutorial of the game. Like the previous installments it is a first person shooter with stealth elements and ability to complete tasks using different paths. Deus Ex was a personal favourite of mine when I played it because you could play the game largely as you liked (main plot missions withstanding) and then experience the consequences of your actions play out accordingly. In most respects DXHR features the same gameplay elements.There are three styles of play: direct approach, indirect approach and avoiding contact altogether. For instance to open a door you can take out a guard then take the code from them, hack a computer terminal for the code or just bypass the door itself.Combat likewise has varied options with melee combat (called a takedown), an array of short to long range ballistic, energy and chemical weapons as well as the option to (depending on the weapon of choice) lethally and non-lethally taking out your opponent. Almost all weapons can be upgraded to suit your style of play as well.This of course leads to the element of the game. Augmentations can be aquired as the game progresses and allows you to essentially gain superhuman abilities over time. I won't go into specifics as this is what makes Deus Ex stand out from other FPS's. But they are well worth the wait as they help you to complete tasks in a variety of new ways.Pro's:A lot of work and attention to detail went into the in-game environments and characters to create a credible immersive experience.Excellent writing and voice work by all involved. A lot of work went into getting everything right.Amazing soundtrack by Michael McCann. Fits and enhances the atmosphere and immersion in game immensely.The game strikes the right balance between being giving you many options in-game and the tasks themselves not being too generic as is the case in other FPS sand box style games.Con's:It felt like the developers were running out of time during production as the story speeds up significantly towards the end of the game.Diehard players with feel the game helps you too much in completing a task, some visual aids can be however turned off.The animations (especially during conversations) are repeatedly used which ruins some of the work gone into the characters themselves.Overall the game comprises a healthy mix of a well structured story, game play, character development all set in a cyberpunk, distopian future. If you feel this is up your alley I do recommend giving this game a go.			"

Although is true that Director's Cut contains some graphical bugs, it really feels how the game should have been released. The weapons fit on the game (let's ignore how OP is the laser rifle), The Missing Link explains a crucial part of the plot (and making more references to DX1), and the extras such as the making of and the commentary audio are very good. Also, if you had before Human Revolution or the DLCs, you will get a discount when you buy this game.			"

												I did not know Deus Ex before i saw it on Steam. I purchased this game because it was on sale, cost only $4.99. I watch some trailers and reviews reckoned i could give it a shot. And gladly its worth the money. For starters, this game is somewhat like Mass effect + Dishonored hybrid, assuming you know both these games. You might not agree, anyways its just my opinion. But be warned, to me this isint quite a shooter game. It's an FPS, it has got a handful of guns and you can shoot things as shown in the trailer but most of the times you'll be doing lots of stealth, hiding behind covers trying to sneak past enemies. Sounds pretty familiar? (Hitman). Well if you dont like the stealth approach, you could go gun blazing, but i dont think this is the way this game is meant to be played, especially during the first half of the story which is after llike 10+ hours of gameplay (for me) mainly because you could be easily outgunned. Of course you could jump right infront of the enemies and shoot them in the face tough later in the game prior to sufficent upgrade of your carecter.So..... If you are looking for fast-paced shooter like COD, your wont get it. Its a slow-paced game involved lots of thinking as in how do i get past this, how do i access that, something like that. If you're in it for the story telling and RPG experience then i recommend you to grab it. The voice acting might not be fantastic but it works and it surely gave me a somewhat unique experience that not many games could offer.I'd love to give it a 9/10 but -1 for the graphics/visuals, so it's 8/10 ! Dont get me wrong, its graphics aren't crappy at all, is just that i adore better ones.			"

												Still a great game.Lots of choice in how to approach situations, an interesting story and a very good non-lethal option.Graphically, it's distinctive, but texturing, both on characters and the environment, is spotty. While relatively high detail in most cases, it just feels a little amateurish sometimes. Character models also look a little odd, especially for characters that don't play a central part in the story.The orange/gold colour scheme can end up wearing you down too.I've never actually played the game focussing on weapons and combat, choosing the non-lethal route, so I can't comment on how gunplay feels, but stealth options are very satisfying.It is however a very long game, so doesn't lend itself to immediate replays. And this length is punishing if you're chasing achievements, particularly if you're going for one of the ones that relies on a perfect playthrough, such as Pacifist or Foxiest of the Hounds. There's no way of knowing you've failed these achievements until you've completed the game, and the systems can occasionally break beyond your control, potentially costing you the achievement.Still, the journey's a great one and the game deserves to be played			"

												I am an avid single player game user and I am always on the lookout for games that show that the developers put alot of time and effort to create a great story that you enjoy playing from start to finish.  DE:HR is one of those games.I came across this game just before it released but learned enough about it that I bought it when it came out.  At first, I was concerned as it was a FPS (not one of my more favorite genres).  However, after playing through THE FIRST TIME (hint: there will be more than one playthrough, I guarntee it), I found this game a great mix of FPS, RPG, and tactical shooter along with a strong dose of puzzle solving and stealth.I highly recommend this game based on the storyline and its ability to keep you entertained enough that a second playthrough does not sound as crazy as you might think.

												Deus Ex Human Revolution is the third chapter in a legendary series that innovated genres such as stealth and rpg, and gave great freedom to the player's choices.Unlike Invisible Wars, HR, imo, is a great continuation to the series and delivers an experience on par with the original Deus Ex.To begin with, all the mechanisms of the game, from shooting to stealth and interactions, works great.Stealth is particularly important in the game and such approach is greatly rewarded by the game (as in Deus Ex).Of course, shooting is still there and is viable too.The rpg elements are well done with things like exp bonuses ,upgrading and the many different choices beign well implemented.Augmentation in HR, imo, works the best in the whole series with, at last, passive augs and a few meaningful active.Story-wise the concept is of course...CONSPIRACIES! For a few hours the player will see a corporate warfare unfold but later the story begins to broaden and eventually getting the player to choose his road.Take note that HR is a prequel to the first DE but whoever played the first 2 will get a nice treat, through easter eggs.Graphics and sound are well done too (NOTHING beats DE main theme ofc).The characters are well-written and Adam Jensen comes VERY close behind JC (maybe more in-depth than JC).All in all, DE HR is worthy of the Deus Ex title, and succeeds to do all that which IW couldn't.So I recommend this great game, especially the Director's Cut version with the redesigned bosses, for all those people who want to taste a bit of gaming history and either remember the fond times of DE or get initiated in this great universe.

												Simply Amazing.I'm not gonig to go over any of the story, but i will talk about the game itself.If I could descibe this game in one word I would use the word Choices. This game is all about choices, you can do things stealthily, go in guns blazing, a mixture of both, explore, or dozens of other things. There is a nice variation of guns and abilities to allow you to do things in different ways. The game provides you with anything from  a tranqulizer rifle to a rocket launcher, even vents to avodi all combat possible.But a game never goes without flaws...Early on without a supressor going in any stealth way is very detrimental and very abnoxious until you get a suppressor or stealth abilities. The boss fights are also subpar and are basically bullet sponges which make them very difficult to fight if you went a non-combative route. In the end, i would definitley recommend this game, as it's an overall fun experience. Especially considering how streched the devs were.			"

												A fantastic Cyberpunk RPG. While your actions in a given quest don't have the biggest impact on the overall story, the freedom and possible resolutions available within any given quest is pretty impressive. Gameplay is pretty solid; it's slower and more tactical than your average shooter, but it's executed well and blends great with the tone of the game world.The Director's Cut has some great improvements over the original, the most notable being turning off the Jarate filter, redesigning the boss fights to allow for a variety of approaches instead of forcing you into cover-shooting regardless of what your playstyle thus far was, and including the expansion as an in-built portion of the story.

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a prequel to Deus Ex and is the third game in the series. The main features of the game are true to their expectations, allowing you multiple ways to handle missions, varied upgrade choices and enough side stories to keep you engaged in the world around you. An explorer is rewarded as are compleitionists for the multiple difficulty settings and achievements they can receive like no kills, no detection (ghosting) and no alarms. If you waited for the discounts and all dlc included be sure to pick this up if you like Thief style genres. My only critique would be remembering  the promise of additional cities during pre-release hype but it still has enough content to be worth your steam dollars.			"

												This is one of my favourite games.  But, what I will say is: The Missing Link forced DLC part of the game is really obvious insert into the game and basically messes with the pace of the whole thing. Sneaking becomes awful, because the gaps between checkpoints is too long. The immersion of this game is great. I really got into reading peoples emails and all the newspapers and such, and the world I inhabit.I enjoyed this. I played sneaking style. Luckily the boss fights are sorta fixed you can do some sneaky hacking things to win. Great experience. Highly recommended. New game plus is a good addition.			"

												Deus Ex HR is personally one of my favourite games of all time, top 10 at least. Like the original Deus Ex, it's very open world before open world games became all the rage. Although the game is still driven by quests, you are given alot of latitude in how you do them. You can be mega sneaky, or run and gun, or whatever.I thought that the story was particuarly well done. You are Adam Jenson, an ex-cop who was brought back to life with cybernetics (ever seen this plot before? =) and now works for the people who designed the augmentations that saved him.As with many games of this genre, your past comes back to haunt you and everything is not what it seems, etc.The story is very long, it took me about 38 hours on easy mode (almost certainly take longer on hard mode). however, I personally loved playing it. I've always been a big fan of the cyberpunk genre and Deus Ex HR delivers in spades, with tons of augmentations you can get (some of them rather useless imho, but I suppose it all depends on your playstyle.)The plot is long and involved and eventually winds up with you having to decide the future of humanity (something else common in games I have noticed.. =)I personally thought the graphics, and especially the cutscenes were great, if you have a powerful enough computer, playing it in full 1080 is beautiful.I really can't reccommend this game highly enough, especially now that they have incorperated the DLC. My only niggle was with the inventory, which is kind of limited, but then I suppose that is sort of realistic.There are lots of weapons in the game, some great, some useless without augs, but as I said above, because it's an open world game, you get the benefit of choice.The characters are well written and the voice acting is really good, although you may find that the fact that Jenson has only one kind of voice (deep and husky, sort of menacing, like some action movie stars.. =) gets a bit samey after a while.Still the only things I can fault in this game are very small things that are really just a matter of personal taste.Overall, if you like cyberpunk and you like FPS and stealth, then grab this game.99/100 Would doom the world again.

												While reading my review, please keep in mind that I never played the original Deus Ex games.I went into this game thinking it would be your every day shooter game with average story and decent game mechanics. What I got was something much more pleasing. Deus Ex: Human Revolution has got to be one of my most favorite games of all time. Every penny I spent on this game was well worth it and I will never forget the experience Human Revolution has given me.The game takes place in the future where robotic limbs and augmentation is possible. A lot of thought went into this concept as you've got the pro-life supporters stating that augmentation is wrong and that you shouldn't do anything to your body. On the other hand you've got those who support human augmentation stating that this is how the human race will evolve. You play as Adam Jensen- a security guard. You used to be ""fully human"" without any augmentations until a day came where you were attacked by an augmented human and left nearly for dead. Practically every limb in Jensen's body has been replaced due to the severity of the attack he barely lived through.6 months fly by and you are called in again to help stop those responsible for the attack on Serif Industries and get revenge on those that made you what you are. The story is rich and deep- and the characters are very memorable. Adam questions if he is still human, or something more. As mentioned- the developers put a lot of thought into the story of this game and it stands out. I haven't played the game in months and I still remember the story as if I played the game yesterday.The game mechanics are wonderful. It's more of stealth game or taking enemies out one by one than anything. Adam is not a Call of Duty soldier by any means and can't step into a middle of a room unprotected. The game requires strategy. You can tackle a level in several different way whether you try and go in fully stealthy or take out enemies every time they are encountered. You are rewarded in XP for exploring or not being seen at all or not killing enemies but rather, knocking them out. The more you level or find certain collectibles to upgrade your augments, the more you can do with them. For instance, you couldn't fall from a certain height without dying unless you got enough XP to purchase the Icarus upgrade which would allow you to fall from any height and not be hurt let alone die. Or you can't lift anything with the exception of like a remote unless you put XP into an upgrade that would allow you to move heavy things such as dumpsters. A great concept that makes the game challenging or sometimes making you wish you put your upgrade into some other augmentation based on the current situation you are in. The game has branching paths. You can choose certain dialogue options and some of these options do have an impact on how the mission progresses or ends. You'll have speech checks that if you fail- could be the death of a hostage or information being withheld from you. Speaking certain things or asking questions helps you understand the story more. I've never been more interest in doing side quests and reading emails and everything as I have with Human Revolution. This game makes you want to complete the side quests. This game makes you want to explore and find out every little secret that you can find out about. And if that wasn't enough, the soundtrack to this game is beautiful and well compose and fits Human Revolution perfectly.Don't go into this game thinking you are a super soldier who can soak up bullets. You might be a very augmented individual- but you are still human and can take damage like crazy if you are careless. The best strategy of this game is to go in stealthy or taking enemies out one by one when necessary. Strategy is going to be your best friend in this game. If this is not your play style or you aren't willing to play that kind of play style, don't get this game. However- if you are looking for a great story with lots of lore to get into along with great game mechanics, I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

The DLC was ""meh"" for me. The only part i disliked was when they took all my augments away. I was so sad but atleast you get them back at the end of the DLC. I wish there was an option to skip the DLC. I know this is just me running my mouth but honestly if you havent tried this game yet you must. Plus they took away that horrible orange tint you always had on your visor in the normal one. You still have the orange tint but only on objects and stuff.			"

												Much like the humans in this world who augment their bodies and minds to gain an upper hand in society, Deus Ex: Human Revolution aspires to be greater than other videogames on the market, and it succeeds impeccably. You are Adam Jensen an augmented cyber security agent for the world’s leading augmented research corporation Sarif Industries. Your goal is to solve who is behind a serious of terror attacks on the company by any means necessary. However, just because you are given the tools of the gods does not mean you should necessarily utilize them. Deus Ex is a game about choice and unlike other games that advertise choice as a key aspect of the game and fail to deliver Deus Ex delivers it, and with a cyber fueled bang! You influence the story and you decide your play style whether it involves becoming a sneaky hacker or a near indestructible cyber death machine, there is no hand holding or hints of what the game wants you to do, make your choices and live with your consequences. Whether that means changing the course of a characters path into an ill-fated direction or not properly preparing for a mission and getting destroyed by your opponents it’s all up to you. The story takes an immense amount of shocking turns as it stacks the stakes with every second you play the game resulting in an ending where based on your perceptions of the world you decide what the best course of action for its survival, and boy is this world something. Resembling the light on shadow styles of renaissance paintings Deus Ex strongly resembles a crumbling Sci-fi dystopia somewhere along the lines of Blade Runner or Dredd with a mesmerizing soundtrack and a hypnotizing environment. Deus Ex: Human Revolution is truly fire stolen straight from the gods.			"

												If you are wondering whether to buy this game or not, just do it. I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.And if you decide to buy it then keep playing it until you finish it. The first 2 hours of the game aren't that interesting, but it gets so much better. The reason why i like it so much is because you choose how you want to play. You can play lethal guns blazing or maybe some nonlethal stealth, maybe you want to play the whole game without hurting anyone. (With the exception of the bosses.) The choice is yours. The choices you make isn't just limited to the type of playstyle you have but also what you choose to say in the dialogue sections. Speaking of which, the moral choices you make are really tough decisions and they definetly have an impact on the storyline. I found myself thinking about what to do a lot, and I kept doing that until the end. I didn't know if I made the right decisions. Not many games will make me question my outlook on life and my morals, but this game opened my eyes to problems that might actually happen in the future. That is really cool.It does have it's problems though, for example; The boss fights are boring and unnecessary, the guns are a bit clunky (Barely used guns anyway but still), the lack of a fast travel system made side quests a bit of a chore (Even though the actual side quests where really interesting) and I personally didn't enjoy the the first couple hours of the game.I would rate this game: I never asked fo this/10Keep in my mind that these are my personal opinions and nobody else's.

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a prequel to the original Deus Ex game and follows the story of Adam Jensen, a security chief at an augmentation (cybernetic implantation) industry, who finds himself augmented against his will and put against a myterious conspiracy he must discover and twhart in time.The story of Human Revolution keeps itself interesting for the whole game, with a very clever portrait of technology advancements debates, few cameos from characters of Deus Ex and a good bunch of original protagonists. As with every Deus Ex title there is a lot of reading and exploring to do for players who really want to dig further in the game's setting: doing so even awards you nice chunks of experience every time.Gameplay-wise, one must say that Human Revolution offers less freedom of action than its predecessor. While in the original Deus Ex you could go around destroying anyone and anything or decide to either incapacitate or plain evade both regular enemies without any consequence, truly allowing you to slowly build your own way to overcome the game's challenges, this sequel still gives you the same amount of freedom, but turns the table more in favor of an action-packed approach. Each boss encounter requires you to kill your enemy and every one of them are very durable augmented agents that will torn apart a player that relayed only on stealth and evasion up to that point. You can't run away either. There are also several instances in the game where going full killing mode against your enemies is required to achieve certain results.The Director's Cut DLC tried to fix such design choices by adding to the bosses arenas more way to eliminate them with indirect means. However, it's worth mentioning that you still HAVE to kill them and they have been severly buffed up from the first version of the game, to the point that even trying to off them with hacking or unconventional means is very hard without some protective or straight combat augs.The Missing Link DLC is a four hours worthy new content that was fully integrated in the main story of Human Revolution with the Director's Cut. The DLC takes place on a Belltower cargo ship, the Hei Zhen Zhu, and requires you to find and neutralize the local mercenary leader in order to continue your main story to Singapore. Whyle the ship features very crampy environments, the whole DLC still feels like a Deus Ex game, with plenty of alternative options to choose from. The final boss of the Missing Link is also much more Deus-Ex-esque than the ones from the vanilla game.I would totally reccomend Deus Ex: Human Revolution due to its outsanding story and gameplay united with a huge replay value that allows you to experience a different kind of game every time you decide how to deal with the enemies and the other NPCS your own special way differently			"

												Even though I already own DXHR and the DLC, I bought this because they fixed a number of things.  First they combined the DLC into the game which makes sense as the DLC shows what happens to you after you leave Hengsha in the stasis tube.  Then (and this is the big one) they fixed the three boss fights.  If you set up Jensen as a brawler and killing isn't an issue, then these fights weren't a big deal.  But if you prefer an emphasis on stealth and electronic surveillance and prefer a more pacifistic approach, then you may have had some issues.Since I already had the game and the DLC, I only paid $5 which is about $5 more than I should have paid for a bugfix.

												I just finished Deus Ex for the first time. Even though I have never played any Deus Ex before, I enjoyed every second of the game. It truely is a great game and I had lots of fun with it. The story is simply amazing and you can easily comprehend it even if you - like me - don't know the other Deus Ex titles. I grabbed it in one of the Steam Sales and gotta say that I always feel like I robbed the creators... Spending that little money on such a great product is almost literally a steal...Now I'm looking forward to Mankind Divided :D.			"

Pros:+ Challenging, enjoyable gameplay+ Massively variant playstyles possible+ High replayability+ Good amount of content+ Stealth system is fantastic+ Open combat is also good+ Many different approaches to each challenge+ Compelling storyline+ Polished final productCons:- Slight railroading due to episodic content- Boss fights require you to kill (Deus Ex heresy)- Pacing problemsOverall: The third installment in the Deus Ex game series is a prequel to the first game.  The premise is that you're Adam Jensen, a bionic security guard given top of the line mechanical enhancements.  These enhancements function as your ""character growth"", allowing you to become a better hacker, gun slinger, stealth fighter, tank, or any other plethora of fun upgrades.  It's a cool system that's been refined across several Deus Ex games, and it works perfectly.  Graphically the game is very stylized, with the world having tints of gold to it everywhere, making the game immersive in its own way.The downsides are fairly minor.  In every previous Deus Ex game, it was possible to finish the game without ever taking a life.  In this game, there are a few boss fights, all of which require you to kill your opponent.  This takes away from the novelty of never killing anyone in a combat-oriented game.  The storyline stops in the middle to do a side story that was DLC for the original game, and which was released in a package deal for the Director's Cut.  In it, you're stripped of your biomodifications and forced to finish the side story before you can come back to the main tale.  This disrupts the pacing quite a bit, but the side story is still fun.  Finally, the game is fairly linear, with several side quests in addition to the main goal of each area.  However, you can't really go backwards or choose where the next area is.All in all, this does not take away from any of the game's charm, however.  It's still fun to play through it without setting off alarms, or without killing, or by killing absolutely everything.  It's a polished game that's fun to play several times through.Bottom Line: Definitely recommend.  This is one of those priceless games that I keep coming back to over and over again.			"

												Phew - finally done with the replay of DX. While it is fun to knock out people again, it is just the same game with a sharper / clearer image plus the Missing Link DLC added into it  - IMO I didn't really see much differences. Never have issues with the boss fights previously so I don't really see much even if it is changed a bit in this Director's Cut.Pros: *Above average storyline (provided you haven't played it before)*Good gameplay with either fun stealth features or average shooting/weapons to rush through it all*Good music (at least good enough for me to go download some of them =D)Cons:*Chat options doesn't affect the main storyline much (there are multiple endings but it is not really related to chat options)*Not much replay value (one run to do it all and I am removing this after 100%)*So-so AI (turning up the difficulty doesn't do much to me except increasing damage by guards and longer detection cooldown time)*A little bit repetitive on the hacking/sneaking if you are trying to max out on the experience Summary:While I might stated a few cons, it is still a good game that deserves your time if you haven't played/gotten it yet - especially after how cheap it is now. However if I can choose again, I probably won't be bothered to buy the Director's Cut, the plain vanilla + Missing Link DLC is more than sufficient. If you have not gotten any of the vanilla etc before, wait till Director's Cut get discounted and get it straight.			"

""IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD, BUT YOU CAN SEE IT FROM HERE""Deus Ex: Human Revolution (more especifically the Director's Cut) was one of my first games on Steam. A gift, I was actually a bit hesitant on accepting as I've never been a big fan of FPS. The RPG part made me go through the download size and didn't quite prepare me for the stealth. I believe it's more accurate to call DX:HR a stealth with FPS and RPG elements, as the first is the most proeminent trait.As Adam Jensen, you're tasked with security in Sarif Inustries, a top notch corporation specialized in augmentations. Not too long after you started, however, the matrix (located in a 2027 Detroit) is attacked by a mysterious black ops squad and a number of questions rise as you're basically resuscitated by your employer. Seems like your typical cyberpunk setting, except it feels more realistic, more relatable. The secrets you come to know during Adam's journey for answers and revenge easily get you involved while one question is answered and another one is made. And as any person asking the dangerous questions, Adam does so mostly in the shadows. Even though the game offers a large range of strategical approaches and paths, the stealth mechanic can be more rewarding and fulfilling, not to mention lore friendly. On higher difficulties keeping a low profile is actually necessary as augmentations aren't enough to withstand a bulletstorm. Fear not, though, as you can literally be a ghost by taking full advantage of the incredible level design!Not only the story is well written and filled with branches, but the artwork and soundtrack are some of the most relatable and beautiful in recent game history. The architecture feels unique and real, while the soundtrack tries to unite a feeling of old and new by mixing classic notes with electronic beats. It's easy to dive into Deus Ex's universe and get lost in its mature themes, such as transhumanism.Even though the experience is one worth having, it's still far from perfect. The Director's Cut came with a number of performance issues and bugs that -- after almost four years of the game's first release -- haven't yet been fixed by the developers. The game performers poorly on computers above its rcommended specifications and fixing it is no easy task. Still to this day there's no definitive method for AMD users to get completely rid of stuttering and small FPS drops, not to mention a proper (official or from the community) fix for the various bugs that lurk around the corners -- one of which got me frustrated and made me leave the game aside for more than a year. This might be one of those cases where you have to ignore the performance issues to fully enjoy the game, as DX:HR-DC is not a proper PC title/port.Pros:  Friendly to newcomers of the franchise  Very sharp stealth mechanics aligned with a decent AI  RPG elements with the augmentations upgrades  The player is not constantly forced to make use of the FPS mechanics  Large variety of paths and strategies within a single level  Intelligent hacking mechanic  Immersive cyberpunk setting with a deep story, mature context and complex, relatable characters  Beautiful design and soundtrack  Hard and meaningful choices that matter  Multiple endings  Adam's dark pastCons:  Performance issues  Bugs -- lots of them  AMD users might have more difficulty in fixing problems  No ""auto-sort"" in the inventory  Too many endings (a total of twelve)If you like cyberpunk themes and stealth games, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a safe bet. And even if you're not particularly interested in what the game has to offer, it might surprise you!			"

												Deus Ex is a very good franchise that people love (some hate) . This game is one of the best stealth games but this game doesn't provide you with the ""♥♥♥♥♥♥someone saw me im a dead man"" type of stealth . In here stealth is something that you can do but nobody forces you to only go stealth you can go rambo with augments and murder every enemy you see ( wich is very fun) . Variety of weapons you can choose , buy or pick up . Each one is unique , some provide you with very fast rates of fire , incredibly high amount of damage , or the good feeling of ""you didn't kill that person he is just uncouncious"" or the oposite. Augments are pretty key feature in this game and the augments are well made and they provide you with new ways to play the game wich ads more diversity . The inventory can be upgraded with augments and it is very much like the Resident Evil 4's inventory you will have to manage it to have space for weapons and gadgets . Verdic : This game is fun works well and provides many ways to play it and it doesn encourage you to be diverse so i suggest you check it out . Thanks for reading my rewiew and have a nice day :)			"

												Deus Ex: HR is one of the most beautiful games of its time, and often precedes the quality of many that follow it. I liken it to a premature GTA V, having many mechanics and unique quirks that make this game part of the leaders into the open-world charge that we now see in games. Featuring large, broad maps and storylines long enough to wrap around the earth (and again), DXHR is a great example of what games should be considered besides fun: works of art.(Disclaimer: I have played this game multiple times outside of Steam, the time above is just with this client.)

												Even though I already own DXHR and the DLC, I bought this because they fixed a number of things.  First they combined the DLC into the game which makes sense as the DLC shows what happens to you after you leave Hengsha in the stasis tube.  Then (and this is the big one) they fixed the three boss fights.  If you set up Jensen as a brawler and killing isn't an issue, then these fights weren't a big deal.  But if you prefer an emphasis on stealth and electronic surveillance and prefer a more pacifistic approach, then you may have had some issues.Since I already had the game and the DLC, I only paid $5 which is about $5 more than I should have paid for a bugfix.

												Background: Big fan of the original, love stealth games and the Bladerunner cyberpunk genre.The Good:* Interesting plot and missions* Real options for both stealth and assault * Interesting powers change gameplay* World looks great and lived in* Large, well planned sandbox type maps* Long and varied location campaign* Feels a lot like a solo Mass Effect missionThe Bad:* Bland character models and stiff animations* Stealth sections are far too easy with obvious routes and dumb cameras* Weapons and upgrades lack impact* Buggy quests make completion impossible* Hacking mechanic is boring & characters ignore you stealing from them* Sandbox play makes for nonsensical conversations* Map system is oddly weak in a technological future* NPCs speak as if you aren't standing there and totally ignore you doing awesome featsImpressions: I really liked the experience despite some terrible lack of refinement and  buggy gameplay. The stealth options are a blast even if the enemy is really easy to predict.Recommended for: sci-fi stealth fans.Conclusion.7/10. Despite it's flaws it's a lot of fun to play and not being too taxing always keep you moving forward. "

												If you're like me - old - you played the first Deus Ex and you found it amazing. So when you approached Deus Ex: HR you probably thought: ""This stinks, the first one is obviously better, they don't make good videogames anymore blah blah"".Well my friend you're wrong, because Deus Ex: HR is a pleasure. Gameplay wise it's ok, it's more hide-and-shoot than I hoped it to be, but it plays smooth and you quickly find yourself breezing through vents like solid snake. Graphics are good: not amazing, but the areas are full of details. Great care was used during the design - especially the city hubs. They are basically the same stuff, yet they FEEL so different.The story and the environment are legendary. I'm not gonna talk about it, because I haven't finished it yet and because everything is a major spoiler, but the environment is really, REALLY immersive.The conflict between people seeing augmentations as progress, and the ones seeing them as something that curses you to live under medications for the rest of your life is excellent. Whenever you feel you're doing something right, something else happens and you're all like: ""What if I was wrong all along...?""This, THIS is what Deus Ex: HR is all about for me. The struggle, the insecurity, the feeling you COULD do something for someone, but you're never sure if you SHOULD do it.A beautiful game so far. Feels just like the original. And the protagonist is quite likeable.			"

Originally posted by Adam Jensen:I never asked for this game...This game is just awesome and if you're reading this, you want to know why. So let's start with the story (Spoiler free and really short).Deus Ex: Human Revolution is playing in a cyberpunk setting (most underrated setting ever) and you play as Adam Jensen. Your goal is to find the guy(s) who stole your gf and find out why he/they did it.Now the reasons why you SHOULD buy DE:HRThe story. It's very deep and really interesting. If you like, you can get to know more about the background of characters etc. by doing quests and reading e-mails. But don't panic, those e-mails aren't as bad as the skyrim lore books. they're interesting and you get to know muuuuuch more about the background of the main characters.The stealth system. Learning the routes of hostile NPC's is very exciting and the augmentation give you much to play and try with.The action-bubbles. Basically every level is a action-bubble. You free to do in it whatever you want.The dialogues. GOD I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE'EM. Instead of COD breaching you can actually TALK with your enemies and try to convience them to stop what they're doing.Exploring. You get rewarded if you explore the action-bubbles.Augmentation. Watch the trailers and you know what I'm talking about :p2nd playthrough. If you play DE:HR second/third time, you start with the augmentation which you bought in the last playthrough. Best feature ever.Why you SHOULDN'T buy DE:HRThe boss fights. You have to kill 3 bosses through out the game.WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR. BUY IT!!			"

												Despite rather aging graphics, it is the aesthetic design that really makes me like the overall design of the game. Dark colors  often reflected by strong, vibrant lightning. Curiously, I found the main campaign to be boiler-plate AAA design, while the side missions were a little bit more interesting. Furthermore, while main character changes location from time-to-time, the areas look rather similar, but that can be personal thing. Gameplay is as good as it ever was; no complaints outside few bugs and some aiming problems that seem to appear when in small areas. Experience/Progression system is interesting, but player becomes pretty much master of everything in the end. Speaking of the ending, pretty awful cop out. I dont know what it is, but this may seem like a review that I'd recommend, but it really is. Its the atmosphere, combined with excellent combat mechanics and suitable graphical design that really makes this game very good indeed. Word of warning thou, if you appreciate graphical fidelity, this game may not be for you anymore.			"

												Very great game, this was the first Deus Ex game I have played, and so I have started playing the others. Although I have noticed how ""easy"" this game is compared to the others... but that can dealt with by going through the settings and disabling a few things here and there. It definitely has a great storyline and it is amazing compared to other video games I have played. They have created this universe so realistically well that it actually feel it could happen. In the DIrector's Cut edition of the game, it adds in The Missing Link DLC and another DLC-thingy with weapons and such. The Missing Link suprisingly was implemented well into the game, and I loved it. It delved farther into the discovery of the conspiracy behind the ""Tyrants"" and such. And, the art style for this game is truly magnificient. It has that ""cyberpunk noire"" with the gleaming yellow lights and the triangularly-shaped objects most commonly seen give off a deep sense of some sort of movement, or revolution as you will, from modern times into a new future. I was a bit dissapointed in the Director's Cut when they lowered down the yellowness in the game. But it sorta balanced out my mood with the added in weapons. This game has made me move on to read the book Deus Ex: Icarus Effect and also play Deus Ex 1! Very amazing game.			"

												If you've played the non-Director's Cut version, this is better. If you haven't played DE:HR, get this version. It's wonderful to have a non-Valve game with developer commentary while playing it. While I found the Missing Link DLC (included as part of this version) to be tedious back-and-forth over the same fairly boring maze of maps, although it has a decent story, the rest of the game is either as good or better than the original. The definitive version of an amazing game. I rarely if ever replay an entire game, but I don't regret at all replaying this one.			"

												The Deus Ex Series has had tremendous ups and downs over it's lifespan.  It began with the critically acclaimed Deus Ex, but that was followed by the widely panned Deus Ex: Invisible War.  A straight up FPS sequel was under development at the time of Invisible War's release named Deus Ex: Clan Wars, but was retooled and released as Project Snowblind.It wouldn't be until 2011 that Deus Ex would finally see a worthy sequel in Deus Ex: Human Revolution, well...actually it's a prequel, so the wait's still going on in that department.The Director's Cut isn't a tremendous upgrade over the original, the largest difference is the inclusion of ""The Missing Link"", a challenging DLC for the original game.  With or without The Missing Link however, this is still a tremendously fun game.			"

												Deus Ex is a game where you uncover a deep and mysterious, yet believable story behind a growing world of biotechnology.You play the role of a security specialist named Adam Jensen who works in a firm that develops augmentations to restore or enhance human capabilities. Jensen sees his life turn around for the worst when his company suffers from a terrorrist attack, leaving him in a coma for 6 months and forcing him to use that same biotechnology to prevent him from dying and take his revenge against the criminals.The best thing in Deus Ex is that your choices matter, the way the objectives are approached is rewarded differently as you complete both the main story and the side-missions. Use brute force or stealth, it's all up to you.27 hours of pure entertainment and gaming quality with plenty of replay value to easily double that amount.			"

												One of the most interesting games in recent years. Deus Ex: HR thrusts you into an immersive, highly detailed and interactive, deeply conflicted, and plausible future world that asks many questions about where technology will lead us, but doesn't give clear cut answers. Not only is it thought provoking, but the blend of stealth action and role-playing is second to none. Choices matter and you'll often find yourself in really intense scenarios, for which the outcome is ultimately decided by the player.This game thankfully avoids many game design pitfalls, and really shines because of it.  The plot is elievable the whole way and doesn't push your suspension of disbelief too much, which is rare for games... and movies and TV shows too.  The character development is noteworthy, the story is quite easy to relate to I find.  The stealth gameplay is a bit more rewarding and enjoyable than combat, but the player can choose either one or both whenever they feel like it.  It has much bigger, more content heavy hubs than the original, and overall far more detailed level design.  It has a bit less ""choice and consequence"" than the original though, along with a more serious and mature tonality.			"

												Haven't played a game this great in a while. Although some of the missions can be very difficult even at the medium difficulty, I still find the missions fun, and IMO this game gets the best of both worlds from the shooter genre and the RPG genre. The soundtrack is pretty good, too, and the story is even better.That being said, I do feel like this game lacks in the shooter part just a bit. One of the first things I noticed in the gunfights was how unnatural ADS felt. I also think the switching from first person to third person when taking cover could be a lot more smooth. Still, these complaints are very minor.9.5/10			"

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. It combines the best stealth mechanics of the metal gear solid games, the cover based shooting of any modern 3rd person shooter, and one of the best narratives since Bioshock. The mechanics are similar to the system shock series, with spending points to upgrade your augmentations and the same inventory system. The shooting and stealth provide enough of a challenge to make you not feel like a tank, and the behind-the-scenes stuff and extra missions are exemplary. Every decision you make influences the world around you, whether it be through rewards, subtly different endings, or dialogue. It makes you feel like you are a part of the world, and I would give this game a 9 out of 10 stars.			"

												The dev team thought of everything.Other reviews can praise this game's stealth, combat, upgrades, art, characters, and story, I just want to show my appreciation for the sheer amount of player choice in this game. Sometimes I was flabbergasted after a mission, going back through the level and realizing just how impressive its design was in terms of making sure that you can get through it ANY way you want to. Pacifict? Check. Terminator? Check. Hacker? Scavenger? Little-of-everything? All of the above. I loved it.And more than just the amount of choice was the implementation. I've said in other reviews that what I want in a game is one where the challenge comes from fighting the bad guys, not from fighting the controls. 99% of everything I tried in this game was a fair challenge. No shoddy, sloppy work. I push the button; thing happens the way it's supposed to. And there were plenty of times when I had a nutty idea and thought, 'Can I do that?' Yes I could. Punch civilians in the head! Throw turrets into the sea! Make modern art with piles of unconscious enemies! Steal EVERYTHING!My only real complaint was with the implanted DLC. While I did grow to enjoy it by the end, (especially Quinn), at times it felt uneccesary and shoehorned in, and there were parts when the writing was bizarrely sexist. Oh well. Once I got off the boat it was back to the main game and everything was fine again.Overall, DXHR is going in my favorites list. I look forward to New Game+. The D-Row Ballers won't know what hit 'em.P.S. Major congrats to Adam Jensen's voice actor. The Neo-esque gravelly growl could have easily been monotone and emotionless, but he managed to put a ton of subtle personality into the performance. Often through taking the lines as read, and knowing exactly which words to punch emphasis into. Kudos!			"

												The game it's simply awesome, we need more games like this one, I mean this amazing story is one of the most interesting and creative I've ever played in a long time, I know the game is not new I've played it a few years ago but that didn't stop me from playing it again, it's difficult to ignore the way they take care of every detail, I mean you have a lot of information about the Deus-Ex universe (conspiracy theories, apocalyptic news, technology taking control of everything, futuristic cities, police uniforms and their robotic equipment, etc) This game keeps you interested all the time, the idea of this augmentations on human beans it's not far away from what I expect in the next coming years I think that makes this game feels fresh and realistic, physics and graphics are frickin nice, weapon upgrades are really cool, I love the way you can choose from like five different pads every time you want to get into some building or objective I belive they create some nice characters here and the acting voices feet them well, the music is powerful and dreamy all the way through making you feel you are really living in the future, I totally recommend this game if you like to get deep in to a nice and interesting story. Best cyberpunk game ever made plus I think Jensen own a big place in stealth games just like Snake from Metal Gear and Sam Fischer from Splinter Cell did!

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a surprisingly good game.I'd been told it was a good game previously, but never had a chance to try it out. By the time I remembered about the game, it was a few years after release and the graphics looked somewhat dated and I was foolish enough to give the game a skip based on that.Then a friend of mine offered me a spare copy of the game going free, so I thought 'Ack, why the heck not!' and installed with haste. I played it straight over the following three days, putting 25.8 hours into the game, completing it on the hardest difficulty (or at least, the hardest available. I think there might be an even harder level now available after completing the game).Oh boy, it was good.Problem was, I went through the entire game without killing anyone. Or so I thought. Then I remembered I shot someone in the tutorial. Whoops. Oh well, just an achievement.The game was rather easy to play, especially if you play non-lethal ghost. I've not tried out going loud - I suspect it'd be much harder, considering the amount of damage they deal on harder difficulties. So one might want to take that into mind. Gameplay wise the game is above average - it's not exactly a great shooter, but the stealth is decent enough. It could be improved and I hope in the new game they make the combat a little more intuitive and/or realistic. But there will always be more one can want.Yet what makes it great is the world and the story, and how people react to your actions. It feels nice when people comment about your lack of lethal use throughout the game - and, without spoiling anything, saving certain characters also happens to have a significant impact on the game too.Obviously in my review, however basic it may be, I'm biased to a degree because I didn't actually purchase the game - but having played it, I would've bought it (at sale price, because I'm stingy) had I know what the game was actually like to player.P.S.

												This may very well be one of the longest reviews I will ever write...First off, I'll admit it. When I first played Deus Ex: Human Revolution, I didn't like it at all. I found the game to be boring and difficult. It may also have something to do with the fact that I first played this on the Playstation 3, but I digress. The fact is, this game is probably unlike any other game I've ever played in my life.You play as Adam Jensen, an ex-cop now working for Sarif Industries, a massive company that is pretty much the poster-boy for cyberpunk mega-conglomerates. When the company is about to move to a new location, it gets hit by a terrorist attack, leaving Jensen near-death while he watches his lover, Megan Reed, get killed. In typical Robocop fashion, he is rebuilt using  AUGMENTATIONS™  . Six months later, he is back at the company, and is now on a quest to discover the truth of what really happened that fateful night.As far as presentation goes, I've heard a lot of people give this game a hard time for having a consistently yellow/orange aesthetic to it. Personally, I didn't mind this that much, and thought the game looked fine. Actually, I'd say that in a lot of areas, the game looks fantastic, especially on some of the later levels. (I personally thought that the penthouse level was absolutely gorgeous) There's so many fine details in every nook and cranny in this game, that it really makes the game look and feel like it's own universe. Of course, looking at the Final Fantasy games, this is to be expected from Square Enix. If I really have any complaints, I thought that the characters sometimes felt a bit robotic, and the lip-syncing can kinda get screwy at times. However, this is a pretty small problem that can be overlooked.I say that because, for the most part, the voice actors really do a good job; putting a lot of effort forth for some pretty riveting dialogue at times. I personally thought that the voice actor of Jensen, Elias Toufexis, did an amazing job potraying his role. As a matter of fact, the sound design in most of the game is actually really good; the guns sound like they have a punch to them, and of course, a bunch of little details here and there that, again, make this game truly come to life. Now, when it comes to the music, it ranges from ""pretty good"" to ""♥♥♥♥ing incredible"". Some of the tracks on here are an audible feast. I just hope that Mankind Divided has just as good of a soundtrack, if not better.In typical Deus Ex fashion, you are given a wide array of choices and methods of getting past levels. You can go in guns blazing, sneak around Metal Gear style and take out enemies quickly and quietly, you can hack turrets, turn off security cameras, and you can even go through levels quietly without killing anybody, if you'd like. And that's not even all you can do. Throughout the game, you get Praxis points which you can use to level up your augmentations. You can spend these on new abilities, such as seeing through walls, being able to hack harder terminals, to fall any height without taking damage, lift heavy objects such as vending machines and dumpsters, and much more. Jensen controls pretty solidly, so you won't have too much trouble pulling off any play style you wish to go in with. Out of all of these, I'd say that Hacking is probably an essential skill to level up, as the game is extremely difficult without it. There's actually a hacking minigame this time around instead of waiting for the ICE Breaker bar to deplete. It's not incredibly hard, and it does add tension to the game at times, because the world around you doesn't freeze when you're in hacking, so keep an eye on your surroundings before you hack something.Personally, I don't think you need to play the first Deus Ex in order to appreciate this one, as it is a prequel to the first one. Even if you aren't familiar with the first game at all, I think this game is well-crafted enough for a large number of people to enjoy.If I have any other complaints, is that there are some sections of this game that do get extremely frustrating. This may have been a foul-up on my part, but still, some parts of this game had me FURIOUS. I personally think this is one of the best games of the 2010's. It's action-packed, it's smart, and it's a pretty lengthy game if you're into that sort of thing. I finally clocked in at about 16 hours when I did my first playthrough of this game. It's one hell of a ride.10 augmented, cyberpunk, haXX0r McLovin's out of 10.			"

												Ultimate badassery, beautiful soundtrack, amazing graphics, interesting and intriguing story... This game is a must-have for everyone, who isn't allergic to cyberpunk and renaissance.The best thing for me is stealth. You have so many ways of solving one situation and they all depend on the augs at the moment and your own imagination and the ability to observe the moment. You want to be merciful? Takedown a guard with your hands, take down a guard with the shocker, take down a guard with a tranq-sniper-rifle or just spit on everything and go through the airvent carefully disguised with some boxes. Or just go invisible. Poof! You hate stealth? Non problemo. Pick up a rocket launcher or laser rifle and have fun, brother. Maybe more close combat? Pick someone's back and kill him with the blades, coming from your arms. It's up for you to decide...The boss fights are also improved. Now you can kill them without shooting - hack the turret, hack the gas tubes, hack the robots and use them for your advantage. Adam Jensen is badass <3			"

												This was the first Deus Ex game I have ever played and I was surprised that I liked it. I was expecting a huge mess of everything in one RPG game, but what I got was a good combination of many different things from multiple different games. I think this is the game that takes a lot of time to get boring and repetitive. I guess the review was bad, but I actually want to sleep, so don't judge me plz			"

												Short Version:Everything is orange. Everything can kill you quickly with well-placed headshots, so get in cover. The cover system is clunky. The lethal guns are fun. Not enough explosions or destruction for me. The story is meh and hte game feels a little short... But still nice.7/10 would reccomend to buy on sale, but is still great either way.Long version:Everything is clunky, but ok in it's own odd way, and every gun in the game is useful (at least the lethal ones, I didn't bother with silly concepts like ""restraint"" or ""stealth and subtlty"" or ""mercy"" or ""doing the right thing."" :P) I blasted my way through the game and had fun getting yelled at by every character who had a problem with it (I only wish you could flip them off more often.)I found myself dying and reloading saves often, and my advice is to use the weapons you have now, and not bother with sparing ammunition. You'll almost always have the resources to spare, especially near the end of the game where you're an expert at placing one-hit-kill headshots on your enemies like no tomorrow. So seriously! Hurl that grenade, don't stash it! You'll miss out on all the fun if you're just using the pistol all the time or saving your superpower energy!I kind of wish the game's story was a little clearer. I still don't know what Adam's initial mission was- something about figuring out who's behind a terrorist attack at the Sans Serif Font Building or something. The relationship between Adam and the girlfriend was shoehorned into the plot, and Adam Jensen's voice actor doesn't emote half the time, and needs a throat lozenge (seriously, it's really bad. I reflexively cringe half the time that he talks.)All three endings to the game (without spoiling anything) are just essentially slideshows, like Fallout.Unsorted thoughts on the game:-Alcohol blurrs the screen really badly, and it's unreasonable. It's also hard to use items in your inventory. You would think that sorting your inventory by clicking and dragging would be easy, but somehow it's not. Using items that aren't on your hotbar requres the use of a dropdown menu, like you're in windows Explorer. Even dropping items.-Your inventory gets pretty small, even when you can upgrade it. It would be kind of fun to not have to worry about inventory space, like in Half Life, but meh.-Everything is orange. I suggest downloading a mod to remove the silly orange filter, because it gets kind of annoying, especially when you get to the China area.The city hubs are a little... Dull. Not a lot of things going on, just lots of people standing around in the street. There are two city hubs: Detroit, and Generic China Future City with bad stereotypical accents. I hate ""China City Who's Name I've Already Forgotten."" It's layout is like a maze, and you get lost easily, even with a map and a compass. A simple task of getting from objective to objective turns into a game of wandering until you find the right path.Mine templates are useless. It's hard to gauge how far a thrown weapon will go, and sometimes you'll have to throw a second grenade because you missed. Stores don't sell enough ammo. There's not enough superpowers, but the ones you have are awesome.The cover system is really poorly implemented, and sometimes it doesn't even work right in firefights- jerking your gun around suddenly or in directions that you didn't expect.Even with full armor upgrades, a pointblank shotgun blast will still almost always kill you in a single hit. This makes the game unforgivingly hard.One last note: I -HATE- the sprint function. You run for literally three seconds at maybe 10% faster speed, then have to wait three seconds to recharge it. Sure, you can spend valuable exp on expanding that sprint by two increments of 2.5 seconds each, but it doesn't do much of anything.All in all, a flawed gem.			"

												Although heavily plagued with game-breaking bugs, this combined role-playing cloak-and-carbine first person shooter really revives, revamps, and reconstructs every single criterion that defined the timeless Deus Ex series. Well-designed stealth system, choice of non-lethal pacifism or brutal kill-everyone gameplay, extreme dark dystopian Gattaca+Bladerunner style speculative fiction setting, easy-to-control COD style weapon aiming, cyborg-level customisable character leveling, and most importantly the power to manipulate the entire plot, storyline, boss-fight conditions and final outcome implicitly and cumulatively via emotionally-intensive multiple-choice dialogues throughout each mission. As the title indicates, this game really tests the limits of what it means to be ""human"" philosophically. +1337 points for  actually calling the antagonists The Illuminati. ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED.

												Very great game, this was the first Deus Ex game I have played, and so I have started playing the others. Although I have noticed how ""easy"" this game is compared to the others... but that can dealt with by going through the settings and disabling a few things here and there. It definitely has a great storyline and it is amazing compared to other video games I have played. They have created this universe so realistically well that it actually feel it could happen. In the DIrector's Cut edition of the game, it adds in The Missing Link DLC and another DLC-thingy with weapons and such. The Missing Link suprisingly was implemented well into the game, and I loved it. It delved farther into the discovery of the conspiracy behind the ""Tyrants"" and such. And, the art style for this game is truly magnificient. It has that ""cyberpunk noire"" with the gleaming yellow lights and the triangularly-shaped objects most commonly seen give off a deep sense of some sort of movement, or revolution as you will, from modern times into a new future. I was a bit dissapointed in the Director's Cut when they lowered down the yellowness in the game. But it sorta balanced out my mood with the added in weapons. This game has made me move on to read the book Deus Ex: Icarus Effect and also play Deus Ex 1! Very amazing game.			"

												This game is my favorite so far in the franchise.  One thing that makes this game so great is that you can choose how to take out enemies.  If you want to complete a mission using only stealth, go right ahead.  If you want to run in guns blazing, you can do that too.  If you want to mix it up, feel free.  Basically, you aren't restricted to a certain type of combat.  I remember a particular mission that was obviously built for stealth, but i ran it guns blazing and murdered everyone in seconds.  I have also stealthed a section that was obviously supposed to be a high-combat area.  No matter what the game throws at you, you get to choose your style of play, and that makes this game awesome.

Many have conflicting views on it's quality, but I believe truly that, having played the original game, its faults can be treated as homages to DX1, for instance, the poor sight range of npc AI. The overall art style is fantastic, and one I am still reeling at years after it's creation. I solidly believe that this game is a must-play for any who are a fan of RPGs or Sci-Fi action games.			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut (Spoiler Free Review)I own both base Deus Ex: Human Revolution (DE:HR) and the Director's Cut version.  It was a game I enjoyed so much that I bought it twice.  I am reviewing the Director's Cut version since it appears to be the only version you can get anymore on steam.  Please read my full review but to cut to the chase, DE:HR was really the better game.  The only reason I am recommending the Director's Cut is the experience the game provides.     (Story)""They say they saved me, but I'm not sure saved is the right word"".  In the not too distant future, mankind has pushed the limits of human existence.  Prosthetics and biomedical engineering have reached unprecedented levels.  People can even freely choose to be ""augmented"", or have technology put into their body to give them some kind of edge or replace a lost limb.  Unfortunately, Adam Jensen (the character you embody) does not get to choose and is instead augmented in an effort to save his life.  As Chief of Security for a large biomedical firm, you are caught in between your allegiance to your business colleagues and the opposition who view your augs as unnatural.  Adam rubs elbows with politicians, gangsters, and everyone in between to uncover the culprit behind a violent act of espionage conducted against his employer.  Adam also investigates the death of his girlfriend all the while coming to terms with his new condition.  The Director's Cut version includes the Missing Link DLC, except it is inserted into the story in its logical place and you have to play thorugh it to beat the game.  While Missing Link does allow you to unlock and upgrade nearly every augmentation Adam has, it adds little to the main story and you only get the big reward once you finish it (and finishing it is a little tedious).  (Gameplay)The game is first person with a third person cover mechanic.  Stealth, hacking, or a guns-blazing approach are all valid for combat and all are just as fun due to the variety when it comes to weapons and augmentations.  As you play, Adam gains XP which is used to upgrade his augmentations so there are RPG like elements, including an inventory.  You can literally play this game through without killing anyone, choosing to focus on exploration, social, and hacking type augs.  At various times, you will have to engage in dialogue and choose responses.  This is what makes the DE:HR experience: living with the decisions you make during a conversation, especially if you cost someone their life.  Players will face many a dilemma and that is what makes this game great.  Many side missions are optional but all feel relevant and some provide hefty rewards for the dedicated player.  The DLC will strip you of most your augmentations in an attempt to make you vulnerable and force stealth.  Director's Cut also adds several new weapons and different ways to defeat the game's bosses.   (Design)As other reviewers mention, DE:HR had a unique look about it.  A golden haze shoruded certain environments and textures looked more detailed.  The game features several unique locales, all of which are industrial, futuristic, cosmopolitan, corporate type environments with their own flavor.  Attention was paid to each one and it is nice to just listen to NPC's converse with one another.  From the clothes to the interior design, the game oozes cyber punk.  Director's Cut by comparison looks noticeably different and not in a good way.  Textures were muddier in my experience and faces looked waxy.  I never had sound issues with either version of the game, though you may have to tweak the video settings.  The DLC has an interesting part where you are on a ship in a storm but this was my favorite part of it since the remainder is spent in closed quarters that feel gray.  The DLC has very little in the way of new dialogue and its characters are not as memorable as the main game's.(Final Comments)DE:HR is an excellent Deus Ex game with interesting characters and great design.  Gameplay can be clunky at times but is fun for the most part.  DE:HR is a contender for my favorite game of all time and I enjoyed every minute of it.  It's too bad you cannot buy the base DE:HR anymore through steam otherwise I'd recommend it.  Though it lacks the appearance of its predecessor, do not miss out on this extremely smart and highly relevant game.			"

												At first I thought it would be another Square Enix failed attempt in making an old style game come back to life, but then after playing it for awhile it became not fully repetitive (unless you have to do take downs 50 times, hacking 50 times or knock outs 100 times...).  I give this game a 4.2 out of 5 because like I said some repetitiveness in certain things, but also the random frame drops that could occur which could glitch out the whole game making you fall out of the universe in some fashion like Assassin Creed Unity. Other then that the story has its ups and down, but the action of stealth can keep you on your toes trying to keep you running or else you could die from a stray turret round.			"

There aren't many downsides besides it being really hard if you're going for some of the achievements. I highly suggest it, now go buy this and join the group of people that would want to play this game in heaven because it is that great.			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Directors Cut is a breath of fresh air, especially after the disappointing sequel to one of my favourite games of all time, Deus Ex. Invisible War was a mess. BUT, Human Revolution rejuvenated the franchise after returning to the core roots and pillars of gameplay which were founded in the original. Stealth, action, meaningful choice and consequence events, and of course many other role playing elements. Adam Jensen, ex-SWAT and military, is an awesome protagonist, and is easily one of the franchises best characters, just as JC Denton was in the first game. Augmentations are back, and are as awesome as ever. These give Adam a slick feel, especially as time progresses, and allows endless possibilities with character development. Augmentations give the player new avenues into approaching objectives which allows the game to feel more open ended and replayable.BE WARNED, not all augmentations can be purchased in one playthrough so choose wisely depending on your playstyle.5th time playing it myself (1st time on PC), and I was still discovering new and rewarding approaches to tackle my objectives. The dialogue system, which is very similar to Mass Effect, works extremely well in giving the player more choice and is intricately designed, much like the new hacking system. As far as the story goes, it absolutely works with the themes of the game. Conspiracies, secret organisations and of course...the Illuminati. And not to mention, the writing in the game is impeccable. One of the best scripts I've seen in a video game.The ""Directors Cut"" tag has added quite a few benefits over the original, the most noticeable being the New Game+ mode which was widely requested by fans for a long time. It's here and it absolutely works. Being able to continue on from where the game ended and keeping all augmentations just makes the game more enjoyable and also a little bit easier, allowing the ""Give me Deus Ex"" difficulty to be quite manageable, as it is very tough (1 or 2 hits and its ""See ya later, Frank""). Only weapons and other inventory items will have been discarded if New Game+ is activated, which is not a very big hassle as it would have made the game way too easy, and that is not at all good for a game like this. The new ""Directors Cut"" also adds developer commentary which is quite insightful as it delves deeper into how different aspects of the game were considered and made.In conclusion, Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Directors Cut is one of last generation’s best games, in MY OPINION. The rewarding gameplay, multiple approaches to objectives, and just the sheer amount of replayability along with the engaging and well written 20+ hour storyline makes for an extremely enjoyable and immersive experience, especially for fans of the franchise, like myself. The only downsides, which I haven't yet mentioned have to be that the game only rewards one approach of gameplay, stealth and non-lethal, which is actually fine because ultimately this is how Deus Ex should be played, and it’s the way I played it. The other disappointment is in the boss fights. Although the ""Directors Cut"" added more flexibility to these encounters, they still lacked in the multiple approach department, especially taking these bosses down non-lethally, which isn't very much like Deus Ex. Lastly, the inclusion of the ""Missing Link"" DLC, adds to the games total play time, but nothing more as it is quite a disappointment. The ""Missing Link"" should not have been embedded into the main game, as it seems rather forced due to the tedious objectives that need to be completed in a constricted hub, which ultimately results in rather stale and boring gameplay. All in all, I wish I could go over everything, but this was a short review. Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Directors Cut is one hell of a game and can easily be respected as one of the series' best. Hardcore fan or newcomer, this game should be played by anyone who enjoys lasting and rewarding RPG's. Having played the PC and console version, the PC version is far superior.9.3/10Note: I managed to do everything in the game, including most achievements and the DLC, in around 17 hours (speedrun, kinda). If it is your FIRST time playing the game, expect to put in at least 30-35 hours to finish the story and do some of the side quests. I just memorised MOST of the games layout and approaches, and also knew where the main interest locations were.			"

												Enjoyable FPS stealth infiltration game with light RPG elements. Gameplay reminded me of Splinter Cell but with robotic enhancements.  Credible lead character nicely voiced in a Clint Eastwood style clenched teeth drawl.  Essentially you play as this maverick  Cyber-Dirty Harry  ex-cop trying to get to the truth behind the attack on the Biotech company that employs you as the head of security.  OK story, light RPG, main mission focused, limited number of side missions.  Oh and one more thing, it's good to play as a character you actually like and who isn't  a complete !?£$.  Bought it on sale 80% off, good value, worth it.			"

												This game is one of the best games I have played. I really like cyberpunk stuff and this game really hit it off with how good it represents the genre as a whole IE mega corporations, conspiracy theories, and all the futuristic technology that we all know and love. Now I only have 1 playthrough and that is because I really dont want to play it a second time because this game made me think diffrently about a lot of fundementals and I dont want to ruin that. Anyways onto the gameplay The gameplay is a tps-fps stealth hybrid. Its a hybrid in a sense that you can go into every level or map guns blazing or you can sneak in take-out a few guards silently and complete the objectives wihout tripping the alarm. Each playstyle has its +s and -s but it really only suits to the player's choice.The story in the game is by far one of the best played because it all makes sense but leaves you guessing like a really good mystery movie mixed with blade runner. It can keep you on the edge of the seat while making you feel for the main characters and how ♥♥♥♥ed up the world is. all in all I really really really enjoy this game and I would recomend it to anyone looking for a fun experience!

Be a cyber-cop. check. stab rappers with duel swords. check. Instakill a main character. check. Drive a car. Not check. Attract cops to a bomb. check. Sneak up on anybody and kill them. check.'nuff said. 9/10.			"

												I did like Deus Ex, but I found the game frustrating at times. For example, I played through the game using only weapons described by the game as ""non-lethal"", and only using non-lethal takedowns. Despite this, the game did not give me the achievement for beating the game without killing anyone. Looking on the wiki, two of the three weapons labeled ""non-lethal"" still have a chance to kill people, which means someone may have died due to random bad luck. The wiki also says people can die if you move their unconcious body, which the game tells you to do so that other people won't find them.I also never set off any alarms, but I failed to get the achievement for doing so, because the game apparently respawned enemies behind me after I had cleared out the level, who then found the other knocked out guards and set off an alarm that I could never hear because I had already completed that area of the level.The boss ""fights"" are also terrible. I was doing a non-lethal run, so I didn't have any weapons. But it still forced me to do a boss fight, which ended up being half an hour of me hiding in a vent shooting the boss with a pistol over and over until he died.The game also had a cutscene where a character remarked that I had killed quite a few people off camera during a level transition, despite me (attempting to) only use non-lethal methods to disable guards.I also found the The Missing Link DLC annoying, because it resets out back to level 8 two thirds of the way through the game. (I did not know that it was DLC, because I got the game as a gift) and so I lost all of my abilities and no longer could open locked doors or hold my entire inventory because it takes 7 levels for lockpicking and another 3 for a full inventory...

												Very great game, this was the first Deus Ex game I have played, and so I have started playing the others. Although I have noticed how ""easy"" this game is compared to the others... but that can dealt with by going through the settings and disabling a few things here and there. It definitely has a great storyline and it is amazing compared to other video games I have played. They have created this universe so realistically well that it actually feel it could happen. In the DIrector's Cut edition of the game, it adds in The Missing Link DLC and another DLC-thingy with weapons and such. The Missing Link suprisingly was implemented well into the game, and I loved it. It delved farther into the discovery of the conspiracy behind the ""Tyrants"" and such. And, the art style for this game is truly magnificient. It has that ""cyberpunk noire"" with the gleaming yellow lights and the triangularly-shaped objects most commonly seen give off a deep sense of some sort of movement, or revolution as you will, from modern times into a new future. I was a bit dissapointed in the Director's Cut when they lowered down the yellowness in the game. But it sorta balanced out my mood with the added in weapons. This game has made me move on to read the book Deus Ex: Icarus Effect and also play Deus Ex 1! Very amazing game.			"

												The Deus Ex Series has had tremendous ups and downs over it's lifespan.  It began with the critically acclaimed Deus Ex, but that was followed by the widely panned Deus Ex: Invisible War.  A straight up FPS sequel was under development at the time of Invisible War's release named Deus Ex: Clan Wars, but was retooled and released as Project Snowblind.It wouldn't be until 2011 that Deus Ex would finally see a worthy sequel in Deus Ex: Human Revolution, well...actually it's a prequel, so the wait's still going on in that department.The Director's Cut isn't a tremendous upgrade over the original, the largest difference is the inclusion of ""The Missing Link"", a challenging DLC for the original game.  With or without The Missing Link however, this is still a tremendously fun game.			"

												Despite rather aging graphics, it is the aesthetic design that really makes me like the overall design of the game. Dark colors  often reflected by strong, vibrant lightning. Curiously, I found the main campaign to be boiler-plate AAA design, while the side missions were a little bit more interesting. Furthermore, while main character changes location from time-to-time, the areas look rather similar, but that can be personal thing. Gameplay is as good as it ever was; no complaints outside few bugs and some aiming problems that seem to appear when in small areas. Experience/Progression system is interesting, but player becomes pretty much master of everything in the end. Speaking of the ending, pretty awful cop out. I dont know what it is, but this may seem like a review that I'd recommend, but it really is. Its the atmosphere, combined with excellent combat mechanics and suitable graphical design that really makes this game very good indeed. Word of warning thou, if you appreciate graphical fidelity, this game may not be for you anymore.			"

												Enjoyable FPS stealth infiltration game with light RPG elements. Gameplay reminded me of Splinter Cell but with robotic enhancements.  Credible lead character nicely voiced in a Clint Eastwood style clenched teeth drawl.  Essentially you play as this maverick  Cyber-Dirty Harry  ex-cop trying to get to the truth behind the attack on the Biotech company that employs you as the head of security.  OK story, light RPG, main mission focused, limited number of side missions.  Oh and one more thing, it's good to play as a character you actually like and who isn't  a complete !?£$.  Bought it on sale 80% off, good value, worth it.			"

												This game is my favorite so far in the franchise.  One thing that makes this game so great is that you can choose how to take out enemies.  If you want to complete a mission using only stealth, go right ahead.  If you want to run in guns blazing, you can do that too.  If you want to mix it up, feel free.  Basically, you aren't restricted to a certain type of combat.  I remember a particular mission that was obviously built for stealth, but i ran it guns blazing and murdered everyone in seconds.  I have also stealthed a section that was obviously supposed to be a high-combat area.  No matter what the game throws at you, you get to choose your style of play, and that makes this game awesome.

There aren't many downsides besides it being really hard if you're going for some of the achievements. I highly suggest it, now go buy this and join the group of people that would want to play this game in heaven because it is that great.			"

TL;DRHolds up marvelously for a (at the time of writing) 5 year old game, Deus Ex: Human Revolution (DXHR) is a game that strives to let each player enjoy the experience in his or her way.Meeghan!!!How do you revive a game series more than a decade old? DX:HR should be a shining example of such an accomplishment. It took a story-line with potential, mixed it with a bag full of modern tricks and we end up with a fun to play game and a solid adventure to boot. Perhaps the most exemplary of it's traits is that this is a game that offers a stealth option, and then actually rewards the player for playing stealthily. This is a true adventure-stealth game, as evidenced by the fact that one can go through the game without killing a single enemy (save for the bosses). BreakdownPros You Can't See Me: No need to go into every situation guns blazing. Play it Again: Even though the storyline is linear, there's no reason the gameplay is. The game is choc ful of shortcuts and hidden secrets that you'll definitely want to replay it again. Decisions decisions: How you play, what paths you choose, and choices you make create noticable differences in the gameplay. Checkpoint: Thank the devs for creating a lenient save system that allows quick-saving, quick-reloading, and more than a dozen save slots, so every failure doesn't equate to half and hour or more of lost progress.Cons Two Minutes to Finish Test: Unfortunately, the fantastic game ends with a lackluster performance as the ending of the game leaves much to be desired. A Word From Our Sponsors: Even though cutscenes for exposition is unavoidable, there are quite a few long and unskippable cutscenes (especially the one right at the beginning). Achievement Unlocked? If you're an achievement hunter like me, there are quite a few achievements in this game that you can fail with no warning whatsoever. They can happen offscreen in areas you left minutes ago, and there's no way to really anticipate or prevent them.Score: 9.4/10			"

												Up to this day this game is my favorite. Honestly, I have never fully understood why do I like this game so much. Bash me if you want to, but I can't say it's perfect in every possible detail. The thing is, it's not about the details themselves, it's about them being being knit together so good you're getting absorbed by the game as it's going, making it one of the most immersive games in the world. Everything -  story, gameplay, lore, characters, world around you, even the damn yellow filter functions so well together you get a feeling it's not even a made up story but something that WILL happen at some point, that's how good this game is. You're seriosly starting to question yourself about the events that did not happen, but they FEEL like they did. You feel like you're in control of your character, it's you making it happening. It's applaudable on how Eidos Montreal made a protagonist with a personality, yet completely relatable in the things he's (or you're) doing. This is what Deus Ex: Human Revolution is for me, and I totally recommend you playing it.			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Directors Cut is a breath of fresh air, especially after the disappointing sequel to one of my favourite games of all time, Deus Ex. Invisible War was a mess. BUT, Human Revolution rejuvenated the franchise after returning to the core roots and pillars of gameplay which were founded in the original. Stealth, action, meaningful choice and consequence events, and of course many other role playing elements. Adam Jensen, ex-SWAT and military, is an awesome protagonist, and is easily one of the franchises best characters, just as JC Denton was in the first game. Augmentations are back, and are as awesome as ever. These give Adam a slick feel, especially as time progresses, and allows endless possibilities with character development. Augmentations give the player new avenues into approaching objectives which allows the game to feel more open ended and replayable.BE WARNED, not all augmentations can be purchased in one playthrough so choose wisely depending on your playstyle.5th time playing it myself (1st time on PC), and I was still discovering new and rewarding approaches to tackle my objectives. The dialogue system, which is very similar to Mass Effect, works extremely well in giving the player more choice and is intricately designed, much like the new hacking system. As far as the story goes, it absolutely works with the themes of the game. Conspiracies, secret organisations and of course...the Illuminati. And not to mention, the writing in the game is impeccable. One of the best scripts I've seen in a video game.The ""Directors Cut"" tag has added quite a few benefits over the original, the most noticeable being the New Game+ mode which was widely requested by fans for a long time. It's here and it absolutely works. Being able to continue on from where the game ended and keeping all augmentations just makes the game more enjoyable and also a little bit easier, allowing the ""Give me Deus Ex"" difficulty to be quite manageable, as it is very tough (1 or 2 hits and its ""See ya later, Frank""). Only weapons and other inventory items will have been discarded if New Game+ is activated, which is not a very big hassle as it would have made the game way too easy, and that is not at all good for a game like this. The new ""Directors Cut"" also adds developer commentary which is quite insightful as it delves deeper into how different aspects of the game were considered and made.In conclusion, Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Directors Cut is one of last generation’s best games, in MY OPINION. The rewarding gameplay, multiple approaches to objectives, and just the sheer amount of replayability along with the engaging and well written 20+ hour storyline makes for an extremely enjoyable and immersive experience, especially for fans of the franchise, like myself. The only downsides, which I haven't yet mentioned have to be that the game only rewards one approach of gameplay, stealth and non-lethal, which is actually fine because ultimately this is how Deus Ex should be played, and it’s the way I played it. The other disappointment is in the boss fights. Although the ""Directors Cut"" added more flexibility to these encounters, they still lacked in the multiple approach department, especially taking these bosses down non-lethally, which isn't very much like Deus Ex. Lastly, the inclusion of the ""Missing Link"" DLC, adds to the games total play time, but nothing more as it is quite a disappointment. The ""Missing Link"" should not have been embedded into the main game, as it seems rather forced due to the tedious objectives that need to be completed in a constricted hub, which ultimately results in rather stale and boring gameplay. All in all, I wish I could go over everything, but this was a short review. Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Directors Cut is one hell of a game and can easily be respected as one of the series' best. Hardcore fan or newcomer, this game should be played by anyone who enjoys lasting and rewarding RPG's. Having played the PC and console version, the PC version is far superior.9.3/10Note: I managed to do everything in the game, including most achievements and the DLC, in around 17 hours (speedrun, kinda). If it is your FIRST time playing the game, expect to put in at least 30-35 hours to finish the story and do some of the side quests. I just memorised MOST of the games layout and approaches, and also knew where the main interest locations were.			"

												If you've played the non-Director's Cut version, this is better. If you haven't played DE:HR, get this version. It's wonderful to have a non-Valve game with developer commentary while playing it. While I found the Missing Link DLC (included as part of this version) to be tedious back-and-forth over the same fairly boring maze of maps, although it has a decent story, the rest of the game is either as good or better than the original. The definitive version of an amazing game. I rarely if ever replay an entire game, but I don't regret at all replaying this one.			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a worthy successor to the original Deus Ex and an amazing game in it's own right. Although DX:HR does cater to multiple play styles, it is an excellent stealth game at heart. There are many solutions to every problem and it is up to you to decide how to proceed.DX:HR features a rich story line, interesting characters, optional yet worthwhile side-quests, meaningful character choice, weapon and character upgrade paths, and plenty of non-linear scenarios to give almost any player enough to explore and discover.DX:HR is frequently 75% off ($5) but it has more than enough gameplay and replayability to justify the normal $20 price. The Director's Cut includes The Missing Link DLC where it chronologically exists in the storyline, some new weapons, several new items, and 3 improved boss fight locations.			"

												This game is very good.  I thoroughly enjoyed everything, and was left wanting for more when I finished the game.  The locations and levels are well designed.  The gameplay is very good, with multiple options available for you to complete your objectives.  I played through the game as stealthily as possible, and the stealth gameplay is very satisfying.  As my first Deus Ex game, it has completely engrossed me and made me look forward to future titles.			"

TL;DRHolds up marvelously for a (at the time of writing) 5 year old game, Deus Ex: Human Revolution (DXHR) is a game that strives to let each player enjoy the experience in his or her way.Meeghan!!!How do you revive a game series more than a decade old? DX:HR should be a shining example of such an accomplishment. It took a story-line with potential, mixed it with a bag full of modern tricks and we end up with a fun to play game and a solid adventure to boot. Perhaps the most exemplary of it's traits is that this is a game that offers a stealth option, and then actually rewards the player for playing stealthily. This is a true adventure-stealth game, as evidenced by the fact that one can go through the game without killing a single enemy (save for the bosses). BreakdownPros You Can't See Me: No need to go into every situation guns blazing. Play it Again: Even though the storyline is linear, there's no reason the gameplay is. The game is choc ful of shortcuts and hidden secrets that you'll definitely want to replay it again. Decisions decisions: How you play, what paths you choose, and choices you make create noticable differences in the gameplay. Checkpoint: Thank the devs for creating a lenient save system that allows quick-saving, quick-reloading, and more than a dozen save slots, so every failure doesn't equate to half and hour or more of lost progress.Cons Two Minutes to Finish Test: Unfortunately, the fantastic game ends with a lackluster performance as the ending of the game leaves much to be desired. A Word From Our Sponsors: Even though cutscenes for exposition is unavoidable, there are quite a few long and unskippable cutscenes (especially the one right at the beginning). Achievement Unlocked? If you're an achievement hunter like me, there are quite a few achievements in this game that you can fail with no warning whatsoever. They can happen offscreen in areas you left minutes ago, and there's no way to really anticipate or prevent them.Score: 9.4/10			"

												[SPOILER FREE]I'm not too sure about recommending the later version of the franchise (Mankind Divided) but Human Revolution is a must buy, eventhough I bought this on a sale, I would say buying the game at full price is worth it.Pros:- Unique artstyle and theme, (yes the yellow filter makes it look like someone took a♥♥♥♥♥♥over the screen) but still, compared to other cyberpunk titles that I've seen, this one has a more warmer and elegant theme to it (warm theme of yellow, black and gold instead of cold and tech-savy color mixtures like blue and such)...- There are no good or bad sides or characters in this game, only shades of grey...- The gameplay, possibilities and decision making for going through a mission are vast and impressive...- The story and character development are well thought and put together...- Most important of all, the endings are phenomenal and convincing...- Amazing ambiance and soundtrack, mostly chilling at times. Great OST overall...- Game difficulty is challenging and fair at the same time. I would recommend medium difficulty (give me a challenge) for an adequate experience of the difficulty.Cons:-Mechanics and enemy behaviour and detection would rarely be buggy at times.- The only game breaking glitch I've found so far is that you might encounter the HUD dissappearance glitch, but if you return to an earlier save file, the problem would be fixed.- You have to go through some places over and over again especially in city hub areas where you can do side missions, the whole game becomes mundane for a while and you just have to be a bit patient about it; but don't worry the good parts are yet to come...Overall rating: 8/10A great game to experience			"

												It's been a good 13 years or so since first I played the (amazing) Deus Ex and attempted to go back to back with the Deus Ex sequel, Invisble War. Yeah, that didn't go so well. Deus Ex featured open ended, globe trotting goodness  while IW felt like a crappy console port. Thankfully the third game in the series, Human Revolution, has rediscovered the original's roots and paves it's own way into excellence. I'm not going to go into the story of DE: HR becuase frankly the story is lengthy, complicated and is ever changing depending on your decisions. But don't let that scare you off because it is absolutely engrossing. I'd refer to DE: HR more as a ""First Person RPG"". Gameplay is at it's best when you're sneaking around, diagnosing, and using your brain to find ways around situations. It's especially satisfying when you have robot or turret domination. Press the button to get them on your side and listen to chaos ensue. However, if you're looking to gun your way through this game I'd say you'll be disappointed. The shooting is extremely ""eh"" and even with your armor maxed, the enemies will be able to take more damage than you.  Also kind of on the eh side is everything really looks the same. You'll be inside most of the time crawling through corridors, sewers and air vents. WAY more to like though. The soundtrack is great and overall the voice acting is as well. There are so many solutions to the problems in this game, even if you're underpowered you'll get through it. The campaign is incredibly lengthy and there are tons of side missions for you to do. I wholeheartedly recommend DE: HR but I can see why this game wouldn't be for everyone.  As long as you aren't expecting a CoD one man army style of shooter it's hard to imagine you'd be disappointed. 9/10 from me.			"

												The dev team thought of everything.Other reviews can praise this game's stealth, combat, upgrades, art, characters, and story, I just want to show my appreciation for the sheer amount of player choice in this game. Sometimes I was flabbergasted after a mission, going back through the level and realizing just how impressive its design was in terms of making sure that you can get through it ANY way you want to. Pacifict? Check. Terminator? Check. Hacker? Scavenger? Little-of-everything? All of the above. I loved it.And more than just the amount of choice was the implementation. I've said in other reviews that what I want in a game is one where the challenge comes from fighting the bad guys, not from fighting the controls. 99% of everything I tried in this game was a fair challenge. No shoddy, sloppy work. I push the button; thing happens the way it's supposed to. And there were plenty of times when I had a nutty idea and thought, 'Can I do that?' Yes I could. Punch civilians in the head! Throw turrets into the sea! Make modern art with piles of unconscious enemies! Steal EVERYTHING!My only real complaint was with the implanted DLC. While I did grow to enjoy it by the end, (especially Quinn), at times it felt uneccesary and shoehorned in, and there were parts when the writing was bizarrely sexist. Oh well. Once I got off the boat it was back to the main game and everything was fine again.Overall, DXHR is going in my favorites list. I look forward to New Game+. The D-Row Ballers won't know what hit 'em.P.S. Major congrats to Adam Jensen's voice actor. The Neo-esque gravelly growl could have easily been monotone and emotionless, but he managed to put a ton of subtle personality into the performance. Often through taking the lines as read, and knowing exactly which words to punch emphasis into. Kudos!			"

												Haven't played a game this great in a while. Although some of the missions can be very difficult even at the medium difficulty, I still find the missions fun, and IMO this game gets the best of both worlds from the shooter genre and the RPG genre. The soundtrack is pretty good, too, and the story is even better.That being said, I do feel like this game lacks in the shooter part just a bit. One of the first things I noticed in the gunfights was how unnatural ADS felt. I also think the switching from first person to third person when taking cover could be a lot more smooth. Still, these complaints are very minor.9.5/10			"

												This game is greatly flawed. A little glitchy, sometimes the auto save system can be obnoxiously spaced, but it's still fun. I still wish you could track your progress with specific achievements, or even skip the incredibly long tutorial (which you have to go through every time you want to start a new run through) or even something as simple as choosing not to play through the DLC to make a play through a little faster and less time consuming. Regardless, an excellent and very entertaining game, rich on story and gameplay (even if you get 10x the options for a lethal playthrough but are rewarded for a pacifist and stealth based run. A little more variety would be greatly appreciated)			"

Product received for free
 Does it have a premise? In the near future, you're a guy named Adam Jensen, working security for Sarif Industries, one of the leaders in the biotech business. One day, however, before a presentation in Washington, an attack occurs. The key staff is presumed dead and you're mortally wounded, however, with the help of advanced augmentation technology, you're brought back from death and are back on the job a mere six months later. What is this game? It's a successor to the original Deus Ex, and a worthy one, at that. It is not an RPG in the traditional sense. Your aim is not impaired if you're untrained in a weapon. There's no locational damage. There are no skills to upgrade, besides your augmentations. It's far more an action/RPG hybrid than the original Deus Ex, while keeping the spirit with large, sprawling, living environments, fleshed out sidequests and a fantastic atmosphere. Does this game have music?  Yes, yes it does. And it is fantastic, one of the core contributing factors towards the atmosphere. It gets more energetic when it needs to, and keeps slow, fades out to the background when you're making your way down town, asthmatically jogging to your next point of interest. How does it play? This is one of the main gripes to be had with the game. The stealth is half-baked. No light levels. At all. You can be up in the rafters concealed in darkness, the AI does not give a damn. It's all line of sight. Some people find this acceptable, but as an officianado of the original Splinter Cell titles and the Thief series, I think it's inexcusable. The shooting is not great, either. The cover mechanics serve the firefights well, but unless you upgrade your weapons, a lot, you're going to be fairly useless by the end of the game. Oh and also, the close combat takedowns take energy and are cutscenes. Oh and also, you can't sprint for longer than 10 seconds, even if you're upgraded to the maximum possible for both your rebreather and legs. Does it have a story? Yes, and a very good one, in fact. The story is a complicated mix of higher powers controlling everyone, corporate warfare, street crime, news spinning and human evolution. Going into any detail would be an injustice towards the game. Who should buy this? To be truthful, everyone. It is by far better than Invisible War, the previous title in the series, and it has enough elements to bring new players in to the classic Deus Ex formula, keeping people hooked with the immersive environments and fantastic story.

												Although heavily plagued with game-breaking bugs, this combined role-playing cloak-and-carbine first person shooter really revives, revamps, and reconstructs every single criterion that defined the timeless Deus Ex series. Well-designed stealth system, choice of non-lethal pacifism or brutal kill-everyone gameplay, extreme dark dystopian Gattaca+Bladerunner style speculative fiction setting, easy-to-control COD style weapon aiming, cyborg-level customisable character leveling, and most importantly the power to manipulate the entire plot, storyline, boss-fight conditions and final outcome implicitly and cumulatively via emotionally-intensive multiple-choice dialogues throughout each mission. As the title indicates, this game really tests the limits of what it means to be ""human"" philosophically. +1337 points for  actually calling the antagonists The Illuminati. ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED.

												Seems like i  forgot to do a Positiv Review for it.Sadly i don´t recall any deep Detail about it anymore.I had both Version a none Director´s Cut and now this re-bought because it is a amazing game.Years ago it did make me happy that one of my beloved Serie´s would have such a great Title i could play.Can´t wait to play next Game in 2016!Game takes Place in Various Places Mission are somewhat always the same but it does somehow want you to keep going because of the Story. Sometimes either my Computer or the AI/Game was messing with me. The game is more Tactical than Brute Force (like Spec Obs - The Line) i loved the Situations where i could choose fight? run? from behind? and than there is a sudden civilist and making emeny´s getting alert..that was proably most sucking part of the game because you can´t be silent with that. In my Opinion i was a invisible Harbinger of Death..before they were alarmed i had them already gave them...a Knockout XDThe Story should be carefully watched as it is a little bit confusing and the ending even more than getting all parts thogether ^^Also watch the Direct´s Cut it contains a lot stuff that was interesting like Making off/behind the scenes and extra´s.Now all we need is to wait for Mankind Divided right?HAYAKU 2016!!!

												In retrospect the original DX is, without doubt, an unforgetable but flawed masterpiece which pushed the technology of the day to, and sometimes beyond, the limit. The Hell's Kitchen level is still a design classic, the overall story is still as strong as it ever was but graphics, AI, and shooter mechanic are showing their age. In comparison, HR has improved with age and now seems more topical than ever. HR is more cinematic and sure-footed than DX. The story is deep,  immaculately scripted and there is a sense that the characters are real people. There is also an overall artistic vision missing from the original DX. However, all is not perfect with HR; it was pushed out of the workshop with rough edges and annoying game balance problems. DX:HR Director's Cut includes all of the DLC and a gameplay rebalance. At the moment I am in the basement of the Picus building and playing a ghost/no-kill game on maximum difficulty. It's a worthy challenge. The annoyances involved with  ghosting through the original HR are gone. I had to kill Barret at Highland Park by turning the sentry guns against him, but he deserved it. Coming back to  HR is like meeting a trusted friend after many years; I see things I missed before and have a new appreciation of just how good this game is. Maybe it's a design masterpiece?---the final emergence of the video game as a fully formed story telling artform. It could be the video game equivalent of Casablanca or Citizen Kane. Maybe. Time will tell.			"

Your goal is to find the guy(s) who stole your gf and find out why he/they did it.Now the reasons why you SHOULD buy DE:HRThe story. It's very deep and really interesting. If you like, you can get to know more about the background of characters etc. by doing quests and reading e-mails. But don't panic, those e-mails aren't as bad as the skyrim lore books. they're interesting and you get to know muuuuuch more about the background of the main characters.The stealth system. Learning the routes of hostile NPC's is very exciting and the augmentation give you much to play and try with.The action-bubbles. Basically every level is a action-bubble. You free to do in it whatever you want.The dialogues. GOD I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE'EM. Instead of COD breaching you can actually TALK with your enemies and try to convience them to stop what they're doing.Exploring. You get rewarded if you explore the action-bubbles.Augmentation. Watch the trailers and you know what I'm talking about :p2nd playthrough. If you play DE:HR second/third time, you start with the augmentation which you bought in the last playthrough. Best feature ever.Why you SHOULDN'T buy DE:HRThe boss fights. You have to kill 3 bosses through out the game.WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR. BUY IT!!			"

												Half Skyrim, half Crysis, situated in a troubled future, of the year 2027 (although the game feels like 2127).As long as you don't skip the cutscenes and dialogues and actually listen to what people have to say, this might just make for the best Detective-Spy, TVShow-Like game, you've ever experienced.Genre: Single Player, First-Person, Sci-Fi, Action Role Playing Game (RPG)Pros:Visuals: GoodVoice acting: GreatGameplay: AwesomeStory: AwesomeBugs, glitches: None (Win 8 Pro 64b)Replayability: HighCons:Enemy AI feels stupid while you're sneaking.Unessential NPC's voice acting is limited.Unessential NPC's design is repetitive.Grinding with hacking and finding passcodes in notes or books.The game can be very punishing if you're not careful, resulting in fast deaths.The semi-open world could have used more depth.Overall mark: 8.5Is it worth buying? Definitely YES			"

												I like how I put nearly 40 hours into this game and only have 64% of the achievements. I love exploration, decisions matter, supports multiple playstyles- type games, and this is a solid one. I had no problem at all running it on my computer.The only thing I really didn't like is that in an RPG, I should care about the characters. They should have personalities and stories and their lives and deaths should matter to me. I didn't get that here. I didn't care what happened to any of them- not Megan, Sarif, Malik, Pritchard, or even Jensen. So, after a while, all I wanted to do was kill everyone and get the game over with.Also, the integration of the DLC was very jarring to me.So, while it's not an experience I will cherish forever after its end like some other games, the combat and the plot are just engaging enough that the ride is worth it.

												Great game. Things I Like > > Things I Don't Like. I tend to be reminded of a game called Splinter Cell. If you could combine Spinter Cell, Deus Ex : Human Revolution, Dishonored, WarFrame, Hitman etc... You could make a very difficult stealth game that requires you to utilize all your superhuman powers to complete the stage. Crawling or duck-walking everywhere is very funny. It's an amazing story and game. $8.98 SGDPROS1. Multi-choiceThere are many ways to play this game. Stealth, Combat, Exploration. Stealth and Combat are self-explainatory but Exploration is something different. E.g. You can get a Hive Membership that allows you to enter a night club (The Hive) as a member instead of sneaking around or shooting everyone up.2. Non-Playable CharactersSemi-interesting. The NPCs respond to you and give you useful information, most of them don't function as ""lamp posts"". While asking them repeatedly still gets a botted response, it is more interesting compared to other games. It is still far off from an interesting character.3. Wall Hack Vision (F3)Very cool. Very useful.4. HackingFun to hack everything. From doors, safes, security locks and computers. The mini-game isn't so fun though. It's basically ""Find-the-shortest-route-to-the-green-balls"". You can't hack cameras or turrets directly, only through their control station. You need an upgrade to turn them on their enemies though.5. Tranquilizer GunBeing able to use a non-lethal form of taking out an opponent is most fun. It's difficult to shoot through bars but doable.6. Box bots / Guard RobotsIt's a big giant mecha-walker. Very cool. I thought they would incorporate more of these things. I'm not sure if you can hack into them, yet.7. CASIEDating Sim Simulator. Funny and useful. Going to unlock it soon.8. Boss BattlesIt's not a slug-fest unless you want it to be. There are so many ways to kill the bosses.CONS1. Piraxis PointsYour skill points in the game. Given very rarely and you have to allocate them properly. While the abilities are enjoyable, perhaps I felt that the rate of skill point gain was a bit slow?2. Take-downsSo flashy and so loud. It's a wonder why no one can hear a take-down. Most of all, the target gets to have a look at your face.3. RollingIf you hug the wall and try to stealth roll to the next wall, you will see a ""kung fu"" barrel roll that makes absolutely no sense.4. KO'ed BodiesThey are there like forever. A tranquilizer dart keeps them on the ground permanently. You can leave and return and the bodies will still be there. Also, the rag doll dragging looks funny and weird, like a bug suddenly occurred.5. Guard RoutesStandard repeats. I don't know how to explain it, but knowing that a guard moves back and forth in a straight line, kind of makes it boring. It doesn't make the guard feel alive. 6. TriggersSome guard routes are only triggered when you enter within range of some guards. This makes alternative routes less viable because they don't move.7. BoxesYour inventory keeps ammunition in a 2 space box. 1 additional bullet requires a 2 space box? Inventory Tetris is not a fun mini-game.8. Bugsa. The female boss after Eliza Chan got bugged after I used both the Typhon and PEPS to kill her. She became permanently invisible and unable to move. I just shot her to death.b. Batter rechargers only 1 level of energy cellc. Dual takedown does not work on sitting opponents.9. Cut-scenesOnce is enough, no need to keep giving cut-scenes for every take-down,kill, Icarus landing or Typhoon firing.10. KeysGrenades and Holster weapon are next to each other on the keyboard (G & H). Imagine if you want to holster and you throw a grenade instead.Cloak and Typhoon are next to each. Imagine if you want to cloak and a Typhoon explosion happened instead.SUGGESTION1. Floor Cleaners Robots / Roombas?I noticed that the game had a lot of Floor Cleaner Robots that don't move around. Make them something that are moving around in the game. Then you hack them and use their cameras to spy on rooms.2. Vending MachinesI have to eat energy bars to replace my electric batteries that powers my robotic arm. While I suspect that it is most illogical, perhaps the vending machines could dispense energy drinks/food?3. Energy / HealthPerhaps, charging through a power point might be better than a energy bar? The power to move a prosthetic limb that can bash through walls comes from an energy bar? Painkillers gets you more health? Perhaps energy shields?4. Hack CommunicationsHack their radio signal and you can jam them, isolate one group, give them false orders, reduce alert status or anything else you can think of. Group link them, so they check on those missing.5. DisguisesSpeaks for itself. Add illusions too?			"

												I consider Deus Ex: Human Revolution a decent game with some very strong pros but also some alarming cons. Overall I recommend this game because it brings something on the table that's unique and well executed. However, I can't say that I was left completely satisfied or that my positive emotions skyrocketed through the roof.Pros:+ Idea of the so called 'augmentations' highly original.+ Different paths to complete the missions.+ Wonderful stealth takedown.+ Nice character build.+ Memorable protagonist.+ Useful weapons and nice weapon upgrades.+ Cool little hacking minigame.+ Getting shot gets you killed FAST.Cons:- The environment is a maze which really brings down the game tempo. On top of that there's a lot of backtracking which replaces the fun of sneaking past guards with frustration. I found myself over and over again getting impatient about how the game artificially tried to slow me down. - Not the most helpful minimap.- Not that great of a level design.- Poor inventory.- Black and white backstory with a very predictable plot. - Badly written readable material and poor dialogues.- Frustrating boss battles in small contained areas (cage-battles basically).

												Buckle up because this is my favourite game of all time.Barring World of Warcraft, Vanilla, which must take the top title on account of the ungodly number of days I spent playing the thing, I have never enjoyed a gaming experience as totally as I did with this game.You must know that this was an important game for me because it accessed my interests in a way that few games in the past five or six years had managed to. Prior to DE:HR I am quite sure I had not completed a narrative-driven game for half a decade. Many great titles had come and gone but none of them had gotten through to me, distracted as I was by University studies, to such an extent that I was motivated to put in the time to complete them.Deus Ex: HR held no such difficulties.Maybe it was the formula, the open ended nature of the levels, perhaps the story. Maybe it was the challenge, certainly a huge part had to do with the stylish presentation - everything from the menu and HUD design to the soundtrack and of course the graphics oozed classy cyberpunk immersion.Really though, it was simply everything. I have never played through this game on any difficult level less than the maximum setting, and I have never played it as a run-and-gun shooter. I urge you to follow suit, because the stealth controls for this title are fantastic. Beyond simple stealth movement, consider the natural extension of that - exploration. The idea of multiple routes to an objective has been adopted in this game to such an extent - in almost all cases - that linearity has departed completely. Even the famous bugaboos of the original build of the game didn't bother me. The boss fights that forced you to engage in combat didn't phase me one iota: here I was, someone who had basically completed entire zones without killing a soul, reloading save after save, refining my game plan and whittling down the boss with horrendously unskilled weapon talents. Quicksaving every time I ran across open ground, got a few rounds into the hulking fellow and found cover again without going splat!. I may be a bit oldfashioned in the way I cosider this kind of difficulty appealing - indeed, I often say that I very much preferred Vanilla WoW to later iterations precisely because it took whole weeks of your life to net anything worthwhile - and those of you reading this review will be pleased to know that the Director's Cut edition no longer contains these bottleneck boss fights - they now all feature multiple routes towards completion, as with the rest of the content. (the boss fights had been outsourced to a separate company who had failed to grasp what DE was all about)The attention to detail, atmosphere, challenge, great variation in gameplay and excellent replayability all go in to making Deus Ex: HR my favourite FPS, favourite RPG, and pretty much my favourite game period, of all time.The downsides are few and far between. Somewhat like the GTA and Elder Scrolls games one finds oneself wishing the non-questgiving NPCs walking around town could contribute even vaguely to the atmosphere the rest of the game has so carefully constructed, and an act set in a futuristic Chinese city has a vaguely disappointing resolution (at least part of that dissapointment comes simply from the fact that the zone ends and you must stop exploring it) The graphics have aged slightly - the character models for one are really previous-gen by now. One would expect bump mapping, skin pores - the kinda things you marveled at on the face of Prophet in Crysis - but instead the faces are dissapointingly smooth, as if cut from clay. That said, and this is applicable to all of the qualms one might have about this game, there is another side: The facial graphics might be a bit tedious by now, but on the same coin the combat, movement, environmental and explosion graphics among many others are all fantastic.Play this game, if you have any respect at all for your human right to enjoy the art of computer gaming then play this game on max difficulty and try to avoid the run-and-gun approach if it is at all possible. That is all.			"

												Rating: 8/10Replayability: LowBudget: Fairly old game by now, still pricy due to quality - Worth it. Length: Takes a few days to beat. Pros: Great story, decent engine, good graphics (even by today's standards, the game is decent enough to play), the game has a sequel coming up soon, choices and consequences - The game actively makes you reap what you sow, great dialogue system on par with other RPGs from that time, and even some today - fully voice acted, great story. Cons: Human Revolution is optimized for console, which can seem like a big minus, unless you own a controller for your PC, which seriously smoothens the experience. Somewhat confusing inventory system. Very harsh gameplay where you get severely punished for missing minor details early in the game. Very confusing endings (to the point where beating the game actually seems pointless compared to simply playing it). Whether you're new to the Deus Ex series, or this is your first attempt, this game is a good place to start. The older games certainly hold good memories for those who played them when they came out, but due to possitively ancient gameplay - many people simply will not consider them playable anymore. Story-wise, there doesn't seem to be anything you explicitly have to know from the previous games, in order to enjoy Human Revolution, so it's not really a sequel, but just another game in the series.

												A better version of ""Invisible War"", but this time with actual stealth. Although stealth in this game can be very much broken, so the game might be leaning in the shooter genre very much so. Same flaws as in the previous game. Reusage of assets, animations e.t.c.. Even if you call level a ""HUB"" doesn't mean it's fine to play it again. Repetitiveness - basically you do the same thing the whole game, altering paths and choices help, but barely. There is still a lot of talking, but now you have an incentive to actually talk to the people, even though most of them are just to fill the space. There are a lot of weapons, but some of them are really bad for some reason. Crossbow and double-barrel are examples of that. Overall the game is playable, in the beginning it can be actually fun, but the real problem of this release is the DLC - ""The Missing Link"". It's placed in the middle of the game and boy is it awful. I considered dropping the game just not to have to play this DLC. They take all your weapons and skills you collected and loved through the game; that you are used to by now. Basically, you start all over. Not only that, DLC is not polished at all, its barely finished. And it crashes too. Main game haven't crashed once, but this mission kept crashing all throughout. And for that, i suggest if you want to play this, go with original release. For you would be able not to play this trash called ""The Missing Link"", because you will be missing not playing it "

												I personally love this game ; the games follows the story of an ex-S.W.A.T. called Adam Jensen that becomes the victim of a terrorist attack at Sarif Industries HQ and needs to become augmented in order to survive; the rest of the story is up to you to discover and believe me ; you won't regret it Ummm overall gameplay 10\10 Storyline 8\10 Characters 10\10			"

												I quit on this game about 1.5 hours in and didn't think I'd come back to it.  But I ended up giving it another shot and I'm happy that I did.  After getting more into the stealthy/non-lethal mindset, I started to enjoy the different options that the game provides to achieve objectives.  I didn't think I'd enjoy the story/atmosphere since futuristic games usually aren't my thing, but it was immersive.Took around 25 hours to complete on ""normal"" difficulty, sneaking around and hacking most things.  The graphics aren't bad; they still hold up in late 2016.  I only experienced one random desktop crash.  Well worth the purchase when this game goes on sale.			"

												This was my first Deus Ex game from the series, and it didn't disappoint. I bought it at 75-80% off, but I would gladly have paid full price.Human Revolution is a ridiculously fun title which offers tons of replayability due to the different combat approaches and paths available. Personally I usually opted for 'stealthy lethal' tactic in most situations, but it was definitely fun to switch things up a little here and there. I loved the hub worlds; they were so immersive and I always had fun talking to the random NPCs (who would then proceed to insult me in Mandarin but HAHA joke's on them because I understand Mandarin). I had a love-hate relationship with the limited inventory space mechanic, and always found myself hoarding grenades, painkillers, and energy bars I never used. The augmentations were so cool that I just had to attempt the game for a second time (in + mode) so I could get more upgrades and try them all out.If I had one complaint, it would be with the map system. Maybe it's just me being bad at reading maps, but the maps weren't very helpful in my attempt at navigating the hub worlds.			"

												Look, I'm just gonna keep this review clear and make it something most people can understand. Pros:- The name has Director's Cut in it, that's a plus, right?- Fantastic controls - Decent story (I was actually immersed the first time i played through, without DLC)- Decent graphics even at low - Many ways to achieve objectives- Side quests and objectives feel great- If this is your first time playing with the DLC, it's great. - Wonderfully fleshed-out characters, yes, even the main characterCons:- There is no skip option for the DLC. If you're playing New Game+, this will irritate a LOT of people.- Ragdoll glitches may get in the way of stealth (one of my screenshots illustrates this problem)- Sometimes, things float when you grab other things underneath them. That's A-OK in my book, though.- Game rewards stealth too muchI haven't seen the bugs people are apparently complaining about, unless it's the ones I mentioned above.Overall: It's great the first time through, but the third (possibly second) time through will tire you out a bit. Story is compelling enough, at some times immersive.			"

Man, I love this game.I found myself saying this a lot throughout the corporate espionage and invisible wars in Deus Ex HR. I’ve never actually played the first two Deus Exes (Exs? Ex’s?), so to say it’s the best in the series is not something I’m at liberty to say. But, since I’m a young’n, I’m not playing those games. Screw the classics.I’m kidding, of course.A Very Brief, Not Spoiler-y Synopsis.In Deus Ex: Human Revolution, you play as Adam Jenson, a 30-something ex-SWAT member who works as the chief of security at Sarif Industries. Sarif, being a biotechnology company, is one of the many companies under fire for the work that they do. On one metal hand, augmentation is pretty sweet. Amputees can walk again, the blind can see again, the deaf can hear again, all because of augmentation. On the other pure flesh hand, augmentation can be dangerous. Why? Because normal human beings have to complain about the physically and mentally impaired being on their level again, for some reason.If that sounds familiar, it’s because this game kind of does what X-Men does.Anyway, Sarif Industries gets attacked, Adam nearly dies and then gets RoboCopped. He comes back six months later and then kicks a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥ And the Illuminati get’s involved. The only reason I won’t get into the storyline is because A; This game is actually enjoyable, and y’all should experience it first hand and B; read the wiki, dude, I’m reading it as I type this half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥synopsis.Stealth, Augmentation, and Chocolate Bars.Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a FPS RPG, with stealth elements. Sounds simple, and for the most part, it is.The game’s biggest strength — and the reason I love it so much– is the augmentation tree. You start off the game with pennies; two pips of energy (which you need for most useful actions in this game), a small Resident Evil-esque cache case inventory, and a hacking level of one. By the end of my playthrough, I maxed out everything and felt like a god. This is something that I love about games like these. It’s so satisfying to have every option available to you after a lot of hard work. However, even without invisibility upgrades and SmartVision (x-ray vision, basically), the game has a lot of ways you can tackle it.If stealth isn’t your thing, there are upgrades to improve your takedown abilities. Attacking ain’t your thing? Hack your way around by levelling up your Capture and Hack Stealth augments. Wanna talk it out? The CASIE Conversation mod can actually help you convince significant characters to do what you want. Through the augmentation tree, the game gives you multiple ways to tackle most situations, which is something I appreciate. I’d argue that some augmentations, like extra battery power and a bigger inventory page is necessary for the game to be fun, but the game is totally beatable without it. Hell, with the exception of all the boss battles, you can go through the game without killing anyone.Have fun trying to get the Pacifist achievement. Enemies straight up die for no reason sometimes. It’s great. I love it. I don’t, actually.The year is 2027, and it's pretty rad. Mostly.The setting of the game is something I really like too. Detroit is the first city hub you visit, and even in the future it still looks like trash. It’s nice to know that the developers did their research. Hengsha, for all it’s worth, is the coolest area in the game. It’s a city hub with a floof. A floor roof. The city has two levels. That♥♥♥♥♥♥is cool as hell. Other minor areas, like Montreal and Singapore are in there too, and for the most part they’re pretty well made. They’re really only there in name, though, ’cause you only stay in one place for each. With the Missing Link DLC, you’re out in the middle of the ocean, so if that’s your thing, that’s nice too. Overall, DE:HR’s future is an interesting one. The game takes place in 2027, and it takes on a cyberpunk vibe. The fashion ranges from basic clothing that you’d see any day to some kind of Neo-Victorian future clothing. Everything’s got triangles on ’em too. DE:HR really likes triangles. Overall, the setting does enough to keep the player intrigued and doesn’t lose anything if the player doesn’t care for it. It’s just there to be there, IMHO.The music is pretty great too. I listen to the main theme of the game on a weekly basis because hearing synths and an orchestra together makes me super happy. The whole game has a pretty serious tone, though, so the soundtrack matches that. That’s not a complaint, so much as a general observation. I mean, the world gets lied to on a constant basis through out the game so the soundtrack is pretty fitting.I adore most of the cast, with the exception of David Sarif. He acts like a teen who might have done something wrong and doesn’t want to tell you about it. One could argue that that’s the whole point of his character; to redirect the player and make the player lose focus on the actual problem. But screw that, he got straight up annoying sometimes. That’s just me though.The story kind of makes sense, but with DE:HR being a prequel, it was bound to have SOMETHING wrong with the story line. It gets convoluted in some places, and depending on certain actions you take, characters will straight up act WAY out of character. For example, I was going to talk down a doctor from committing suicide. Instead, he just ended up shooting me. All in all, it’s a respectable storyline but it can get lost pretty fast if you don’t follow it closely.At the end it all, DE:HR is a pretty awesome game with some pretty awesome moments. It’s definitely one of my personal favourites and I’d HIGHLY recommend it if you want to get into the stealth genre. You’re missing out if you don’t play this game, seriously.			"

												Worth it on sale. This game excells in a few areasGraphics - Not really amazing tech-wise, and I don't beleive there are modders getting wet over the thought of it, but the sets are really nice and the art style is really great, at least during most parts. From what i've seen it's great up until picus and then it goes downhill. Gameplay- The stealth mechanics in this game are really good. You can throw grenades to distract, fire silenced weapons to distract, and a whole bunch of other mechanics. The rpg mechanics are really underwhelming however. Only a handful of the perks are useful. Some have things tacked onto the map, such as a place that can only be reached with a certain perk, and you would be rewarded with something like a machine pistol or sometimes nothing. The action also becomes a lot less fun, after the FEMA camp when nearly all the mobs get helmets and the lighter weapons become almost entirely useless.OST- Soundtrack is really good, but it feels underused.Story- Absolutly great. Tons of story related objects everywhere. Should give wiki editors a hard on.So tl;dr, it's a really good stealth game with a nice story and art style, but it has low replay value outside of the story since the rpg and action elements kinda suck.

												If you like Cyberpunk, FPS-RPG meshes, and a really fun gameplay experience, Deus Ex is the game for you.Even if you have Human Revolution and The Missing Link, it's worth owning the Director's Cut.  Absolutely makes the game even better.There are new features, such as New Game + and having an extra energy cell on normal mode.It also throws the Missing Link DLC story into the main game, leaving no gaps.  It's completely seemless, and a blast of fun.The only down-side, if you can even call it one, is the fact that with New Game + you will completely unlock every perk with Praxis. (I have 4 points and nothing to spend them on.)  Though this happens at later times depending on how dilligently you collect and explore.			"

												Whether you haven't bought Deus Ex: Human Revolution, or you already have it, you must have this if you're willing to play it. Director's Cut combines the base game with the preorder DLC mission ""You Scratch My Back, I'll Scratch Yours"" and the what-if DLC chapter ""The Missing Link"". With the entire game put into one, the DC also has improved boss fights and AI. Because of the fans' response to Eidos Montreal for mediocre boss fights, they went ahead and made them the way they should've been to begin with by adding decisions to make on how you want to kill the bosses. This will benefit the people who go for extremely stealthy and non-violent playthroughs, mainly the ones where people use their praxis kits to upgrade abilities like hacking and breathing. Like my previous review, this game has a truely, remarkable, dark plot where the outcomes of the game are based on the choices you make, resulting in one of 12 different endings. You choose how you want to play in this masterpiece of a stealth, action-shooting, RPG. Seek the truth and find out more about the worldwide conspiracies to decide how you want it all to end. Become one with the machine!			"

												SUMMARY:FeatureRating (out of 5)Stealth4Combat4Skill Tree4.5Storyline5World and Level4Graphics4Sounds3Balance2Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a game that is overall worth it and a good memorable time, but has a few burning issues that I feel I need to bring to the table. First off; lets' start off with the good and the ""why you should"" THE GOOD Stealth - The game's stealth aspect seems to be relatively fluid and fun. It urges you to explore more than anything in order to find pathways that can lead you to properly traverse the environment. Combat - If stealth is not your style or you choose to go whichever way you feel, getting into combat is just an fun. The gunplay is smooth and the action is quality. Plus, it isn't always what you would expect. You can choose your method of approach and use the environment to your advantage. Whether it be hacking a turret and picking it up around with you so it doubles as a weapon and as a shield or just firing your weapons, the combat is polished.Progression and Skills - Advancing through the game is definitely the biggest aspect. As you unlock various augmentations, you gain advantages in your surroundings. Higher jumping, better hacking, arm strength, all of it feeds into becoming stronger, faster, and more durable.Storyline - Possibly the most solid and immersive story I have seen in a while. The supporters and opposers of augmentations have both well thought out proponents and ignoramous on each side. Similar to most issues. The characters are believable and the story fully immerses you. Powerful underlying lore will keep you curious enough to want to see more.World and Level Design - The world and the levels are very detailed and filled with accent. The objects, the environment, the scenery, all of it is well done.Graphics - The graphics are good, I have to say the scenery and effects are nice.Sound - The sound quality is polished but definitely could be better. More of a not-good not-bad. However, because the sfx are not bad, that's a good in my book.It's not all perfection and greatness; however, there are some things I feel like I need to list. THE BAD Artificial Difficulty - When I ask you what difficulty is in a game, you would say 'challenge', yes? Although this game does have challenge, it has a lot of artifical frill as far as difficulty goes and that artificial frill is known as...Ammo Scavenging - Unimmersive, and doesn't add anything to the challenge. I find myself needing to scrounge the ground for bullets. I have spent a large amount of time in this game trying to tediously keep my inventory managed because I need a large arsenal of weapons to fit any type of ammo I run across. I would much rather play the game than comb the floor for bullets. Whether stealth or loud, it's a complete pain. It isn't 'challenging'. 'Challenging' would be smarter enemies, more enemies, a more trying environment. 'Challenging' is not being forced to vulture every square inch of the ground.All in all, the game is very high quality and other than having to vulture for scraps rather than actually play the game, the game was challenging, fun, entertaining, *mostly immersive, pretty, and well polished.

												Pretty good, but fails to capture the original's charm.If you are a fan of the original, play it. If you are not, play the original first or you won't get a ton of references to characters of the first game; Trust me you'll like Deus Ex: Human Revolution a lot more (or hate it) if you play Deus Ex first.

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a game that takes you deeper and deeper into a story that seems to get larger and more epic  in scale, similar to JRPG's.The game, while heavily emphasizing stealth and discretion, allows the player to play the way they want. If you want to be a gun-crazed nut who prefers full-frontal assaults, the game will let you do so! The fact that this game let's one try to achieve their goals in multiple ways is what makes this game (much like the first Deus Ex) special.Sometimes, it feels a bit unpolished as far as visuals and interface are concerned.The game is defintely a high-quality journey of discovering a larger world that is full of intrigue and deception.7.5/10 ""Good"" to ""Great""			"

												Awesome game! Beautiful graphics. Good plot. I care about Jensen's mission and was glued to this game all the way to the finish.  I like the stealth aspect of the game even though I'm not into taking the stealth route in games, but most of the time i did for this game. Although the boss fights were kinda weird and boring. Basically facing a person with augments who is annoying and can run around or hide. It's funny how Jensen is augmented but still has a limit on how fast he can run and how far he can run and so on. It was annoying how limited the inventory was because i wanted to keep all the weapons and stuff I found xD I enjoyed this game very much and plan on playing a new game + with the augments from my previous game and to check out the other 2 endings. 9/10			"

												While I have not played the earlier Deus Ex game, I really enjoyed this game but it is not without it's flaws. I'll start with the flaws to get them out of the way since they are few. My only real problem with this game is the boss fights. Everytime I arrive at a boss I allwas find myself scrambling around the level for leathal weapons to use against the boss. Since I played entirely stealth and non-lethal, and my augmentatiosn reflect that, I end up woefully illequiped to fight bosses. Luckly weapons are readily availble but I still have to juggle my inventory to fight the boss. With that out of the way the rest of the game is very well put together. As I said before I played it almost entirely with steath and non-leathal combat. I really enjoyed the ammount of options you are given to get between areas of the levels, with more options opening up with the right augments. If you like stealth games and si-fi you'll love this game.As far as story goes, I won't attempt to review it, but I enjoyed it.			"

												A solid game and a worthy successor to the Deus Ex franchise. The only issue I find with the directors cut is that I honestly can't tell the difference between it and the original. The original Human Revolution suffered terribly in reviews, mainly because of the Godawful boss fights. The Directors cut merged a few peices of DLC into the one cohesive game, and apparently improved the boss fights, however I honestly couldn't tell the difference in the Barrett fight. A good game a definitely worth the purchase, however if you already own Human Revolution and The Missing Link DLC then it's probably worth just playing them again as you are basically playing the same thing.

												I loved this game. Human Revolution has many different paths to take, whether that's going loud or creeping around knocking people out. The hacking minigame is ridiculously fun to me, and the stealth is decent, including cover into the mix to help you hide from both guards and gunfire. You can augment yourself with different powers, like cloaking, eliminating recoil, becoming better at hacking, etc. Gunplay is decent enough, but all you really need is an upgraded 10mm pistol for lethal takedowns. Boss battles were slightly reworked for this version, but they still force you into lethally taking bosses down instead of an option to talk them down. The cyberpunk setting and atmosphere is incredible. The game deals a lot with the ethics of transhumanism and if we should make technological advances just because we can. Of course, being a Deus Ex title the game is full of conspiracies and corporate espionage. There's also a concept of social boss battles; talking someone into doing something you want, etc. Arguing with people is one of the strong points of the game. It's also very lengthy (my first playthrough, mixing lethal and nonlethal took 37 hours with all sidequests plus the fact that I savescummed) and packed with content. The DLC (Missing Link) is also excellent, one of the best parts of the whole game for me. Some say the Director's Cut is incredibly buggy. I got lucky, I had very few bugs with this version. Overall, this is one of the best games I've ever played. It is one of the 5 or 6 games I've ever played that deserve a 10. Please buy this, even at full price. It's that good. Scroll up and buy it now.			"

Posted: January 5, 2016
												TL;DR: This is an *excellent* game that I highly recommend - but the presence of a few bugs dents its otherwise gleaming presentation.  They are hardly dealbreakers and shouldn't stop you from giving this game a shot - but you should know about them before you dive in so you won't get surprised or disappointed.  Pick it up on sale and enjoy many hours of stylized clandestine cyberpunk fun.  I think you'll be glad you did.  PSA WARNING:  Do not install the laser sight on the silenced sniper rifle!  You'll have a bad time. Details:While I DO highly recommend this game, I can only really recommend it on sale - as it has a few fairly annoying little bugs.  The game itself is worth full price - but given that the game has run its course in terms of sales and given those bugs never saw a final patch, you'll get more satisfaction picking this one up at a discount.  This Director's Cut version is made from an older, unpatched version of the game (apparently the orignal source code was lost - ouch) and while it improves some graphics like textures and tesselation, adds a couple (really cool) weapons, and improves the boss fights, it leaves out some pretty important fixes - and NO - they will never be patched.  These bugs are by no means dealbreakers for me, but they are enough that I still wish they would have just patched them.  Let's talk about the two that bug me the most:Stutter:  Any modern rig should be able to run this game smooth as butter all day, but many users including myself experience some pretty annoying lag / jitter /stutter.  Nvidia users seem to be able to fix this with a regedit tweak (multiple guides here on steam about that) - but most AMD users like myself seem out of luck here.  I've seen a few that have managed to solve the issue, but so far none of the fixes have solved the stuttering for me and my R9 280 3gb.  It isn't terrible - the game is totally playable - but a game this old just shouldn't have it.  (The game runs pretty consistently at 60 fps, but every couple seconds there are often micro-stutters / jitters in the flow of time that can be a little distracting.  It's minor, but noticable enough to irk me at times.)  The older (non directors cut) version patched this out - but for some reason, no patch ever came along for what is now the only version available on Steam.Sniper Rifle Aiming Bug:  Find that super awesome silenced sniper rifle?  Read the item description that says a laser sight dramatically improves accuracy?  NOPE!  Installing the laser sight will essentially break the weapon - and you can't take it off.  (Luckily, there are a few opportunities to pick up another if you mess up your first one like I did.)  It offsets the scoped aiming reticule - the bullet will hit somewhere below the crosshair.  I have found no fix for this.  There's a warning about this on the Wiki, but I don't think most players will think to check there first.There's also a small bug with the revolver in that the ironsights aren't aligned quite right - but in this case, a laser sight is actually very helpful: having the red dot negates the need for ironsights, and makes the weapon accurate from the hip.  Fully upgraded, it's a supremely fun weapon for causing chaos.  (EXPLODING BULLETS - AW YEA)  Shooty-boom-boom.Okay.  Ranting aside, this is a *fantastic* game that I have thoroughly enjoyed - and even with the one broken weapon and the fairly annoying stutter, I completely recommend playing through it - especially if you're the type of player that likes to investigate the details.  Taking the time to find / read everything really fleshes out the exeprience, and makes for a satisfyingly meaty game experience.  All the little emails, pda's, etc. really flesh-out the world they've created here, and it's fascinating.  The game was much longer, and with much more content than I expected from a 2010's first person game - and that was a refreshing surprise.  The gunplay is competent enough, and the weapons are super cool.  Most of those are upgradable in multiple ways - just like the original Deus Ex.  While dated nowadays, the graphics are good enough - certainly lightyears ahead of the orignal - and I really dig the art style.  The moody main character is a little angsty at times, but that's part of who he is.  Some games let you make your own character - but in this one, you step into the shoes of a person with a particular past who has been affected by it in a particular way - but you get to chose what happens from here.The game allows for a varied approach to almost any situation, and provides multiple paths to get there - allowing the player to take advantage of various skills or upgrades.  You can hack, sneak, cloak, move through the sewers or across the rooftops - or just waltz right in the front door with machine guns and rocket launchers blazing.  Bosses aside, you can even go through the whole game without killing a soul (and get a hefty xp bonus in the process).  There are four possible endings - don't worry no spoilers here - and you essentially get to chose which one right at the end.  None of them are particularly awesome in their own right - pretty typical these days - but the game itself is so good, I ain't even mad.  (In my personal opinion, only one of the four sits well with me - but I guess that's the point of chosing!)  Now - I will say - this is one of those times where it's worth it to sit through the credits.  What would have been a slightly disappointing conclusion turns into one that sets up the next game (chronologically) and left me hyped for Deus Ex in general - and really tied the whole thing together - at least for me.  Personally, I think replay value is excellent - I just beat the game, and I'm jumping right back into New Game + on hard mode - and so far, am loving it even more the second time through.  (It's amazing what a lack of magical crosshair in the middle of the screen does for immersion.)  The variety of weapons and approaches the game offers really keeps things interesting.  While the endings themselves are multiple-choice at the end, there are various times in the game where choice / performance / path taken has an effect on the future - story and gameplay - which makes me want to go through again and try things different ways.  Lots of fun to be had here.The people who made this game did so with a lot of passion, and it shows.  It's just a real shame that Eidos somehow lost the original source code leading to this slightly crippled final version of the game.  The Director's Cut does an otherwise great job of integrating the DLC content in a cohesive way, and I actually prefer the way it is integrated here vs having the orignal game plus the DLC.All in all, this has become one of my favorites - flaws and all.

												Having only played the original old Deus Ex for a short bit,and remembering it like it was ""just another fps game"",i opened up Deus Ex: Human Revolution with low expectations.I was positively surprised to say the least. The story of the gameis very well written, mixing in a lot of twists here and there, a lotof them clearly very inspired by real world conspiracy theories.Unlike most other games, even ones with well written stories,this game doesn't just offer you a linear path from point A to B,telling you a story a long the way. This game features optionalside quests, rewards and more. You can choose a lot of differentways to complete everything as well. You can choose to go fullRambo mode and just rush in shooting everything, or you can gosneaky, even complete most of the game without ""killing"", by usingclose combat, gas grenades, stun and tranquilizer guns and more.What you choose will also have impact on how the game will continueoffering several different endings and twists in the story a long the way.If i have to say something negative about this game there is a fewthings to mention. Using stealth to complete the game is hard, very veryhard sometimes, which if you don't mind killing, will make you want togo for the easier way and just shoot your way through, be aware of yourammo though, as you will quickly run out and need to check every singlecorpse, room etc, to keep gathering ammo. Also choose yours ""augs""wisely as some offer a lot of advantages over others. There is one veryannoying thing about the game in my opinion, the controls could bebetter in certain areas. Like the game NOT having a option to switchbetween hold/toggle crouch, was annoying me like crazy in the beginning.I will highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a single playerFPS game with a deep and well written story. Especially if you also arethe type of person that likes conspiracy theories or is a critic of science.			"

												Deus Ex Human Revolution's story around a futuristic cyberpunk environment incorporates deep subjects like transhumanism, impact of scientific breakthroughs & technological advancements on society, corporate espionage, conspiracies, secret human experimentation and shows us at what cost all this is achieved, how it divides society while creating moral dilemmas and choices for our player.  +story, voice acting, environment, music, stealth-a few bugs9.5/10 Loved it			"

												I should have written a review for this years ago. Storyline is fantastic. Gameplay is fun. Voice acting is top notch. This is AAA title from start to finish.I won't bother going into too much detail. But this game takes all of the past Deus Ex games and improves on them. Whether you want to play stealth or go in guns blazing you can customize your approach as you see fit.This is easily 100+ hours of entertainment.			"

												Having only played the original old Deus Ex for a short bit,and remembering it like it was ""just another fps game"",i opened up Deus Ex: Human Revolution with low expectations.I was positively surprised to say the least. The story of the gameis very well written, mixing in a lot of twists here and there, a lotof them clearly very inspired by real world conspiracy theories.Unlike most other games, even ones with well written stories,this game doesn't just offer you a linear path from point A to B,telling you a story a long the way. This game features optionalside quests, rewards and more. You can choose a lot of differentways to complete everything as well. You can choose to go fullRambo mode and just rush in shooting everything, or you can gosneaky, even complete most of the game without ""killing"", by usingclose combat, gas grenades, stun and tranquilizer guns and more.What you choose will also have impact on how the game will continueoffering several different endings and twists in the story a long the way.If i have to say something negative about this game there is a fewthings to mention. Using stealth to complete the game is hard, very veryhard sometimes, which if you don't mind killing, will make you want togo for the easier way and just shoot your way through, be aware of yourammo though, as you will quickly run out and need to check every singlecorpse, room etc, to keep gathering ammo. Also choose yours ""augs""wisely as some offer a lot of advantages over others. There is one veryannoying thing about the game in my opinion, the controls could bebetter in certain areas. Like the game NOT having a option to switchbetween hold/toggle crouch, was annoying me like crazy in the beginning.I will highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a single playerFPS game with a deep and well written story. Especially if you also arethe type of person that likes conspiracy theories or is a critic of science.			"

												TL;DR: This is an *excellent* game that I highly recommend - but the presence of a few bugs dents its otherwise gleaming presentation.  They are hardly dealbreakers and shouldn't stop you from giving this game a shot - but you should know about them before you dive in so you won't get surprised or disappointed.  Pick it up on sale and enjoy many hours of stylized clandestine cyberpunk fun.  I think you'll be glad you did.  PSA WARNING:  Do not install the laser sight on the silenced sniper rifle!  You'll have a bad time. Details:While I DO highly recommend this game, I can only really recommend it on sale - as it has a few fairly annoying little bugs.  The game itself is worth full price - but given that the game has run its course in terms of sales and given those bugs never saw a final patch, you'll get more satisfaction picking this one up at a discount.  This Director's Cut version is made from an older, unpatched version of the game (apparently the orignal source code was lost - ouch) and while it improves some graphics like textures and tesselation, adds a couple (really cool) weapons, and improves the boss fights, it leaves out some pretty important fixes - and NO - they will never be patched.  These bugs are by no means dealbreakers for me, but they are enough that I still wish they would have just patched them.  Let's talk about the two that bug me the most:Stutter:  Any modern rig should be able to run this game smooth as butter all day, but many users including myself experience some pretty annoying lag / jitter /stutter.  Nvidia users seem to be able to fix this with a regedit tweak (multiple guides here on steam about that) - but most AMD users like myself seem out of luck here.  I've seen a few that have managed to solve the issue, but so far none of the fixes have solved the stuttering for me and my R9 280 3gb.  It isn't terrible - the game is totally playable - but a game this old just shouldn't have it.  (The game runs pretty consistently at 60 fps, but every couple seconds there are often micro-stutters / jitters in the flow of time that can be a little distracting.  It's minor, but noticable enough to irk me at times.)  The older (non directors cut) version patched this out - but for some reason, no patch ever came along for what is now the only version available on Steam.Sniper Rifle Aiming Bug:  Find that super awesome silenced sniper rifle?  Read the item description that says a laser sight dramatically improves accuracy?  NOPE!  Installing the laser sight will essentially break the weapon - and you can't take it off.  (Luckily, there are a few opportunities to pick up another if you mess up your first one like I did.)  It offsets the scoped aiming reticule - the bullet will hit somewhere below the crosshair.  I have found no fix for this.  There's a warning about this on the Wiki, but I don't think most players will think to check there first.There's also a small bug with the revolver in that the ironsights aren't aligned quite right - but in this case, a laser sight is actually very helpful: having the red dot negates the need for ironsights, and makes the weapon accurate from the hip.  Fully upgraded, it's a supremely fun weapon for causing chaos.  (EXPLODING BULLETS - AW YEA)  Shooty-boom-boom.Okay.  Ranting aside, this is a *fantastic* game that I have thoroughly enjoyed - and even with the one broken weapon and the fairly annoying stutter, I completely recommend playing through it - especially if you're the type of player that likes to investigate the details.  Taking the time to find / read everything really fleshes out the exeprience, and makes for a satisfyingly meaty game experience.  All the little emails, pda's, etc. really flesh-out the world they've created here, and it's fascinating.  The game was much longer, and with much more content than I expected from a 2010's first person game - and that was a refreshing surprise.  The gunplay is competent enough, and the weapons are super cool.  Most of those are upgradable in multiple ways - just like the original Deus Ex.  While dated nowadays, the graphics are good enough - certainly lightyears ahead of the orignal - and I really dig the art style.  The moody main character is a little angsty at times, but that's part of who he is.  Some games let you make your own character - but in this one, you step into the shoes of a person with a particular past who has been affected by it in a particular way - but you get to chose what happens from here.The game allows for a varied approach to almost any situation, and provides multiple paths to get there - allowing the player to take advantage of various skills or upgrades.  You can hack, sneak, cloak, move through the sewers or across the rooftops - or just waltz right in the front door with machine guns and rocket launchers blazing.  Bosses aside, you can even go through the whole game without killing a soul (and get a hefty xp bonus in the process).  There are four possible endings - don't worry no spoilers here - and you essentially get to chose which one right at the end.  None of them are particularly awesome in their own right - pretty typical these days - but the game itself is so good, I ain't even mad.  (In my personal opinion, only one of the four sits well with me - but I guess that's the point of chosing!)  Now - I will say - this is one of those times where it's worth it to sit through the credits.  What would have been a slightly disappointing conclusion turns into one that sets up the next game (chronologically) and left me hyped for Deus Ex in general - and really tied the whole thing together - at least for me.  Personally, I think replay value is excellent - I just beat the game, and I'm jumping right back into New Game + on hard mode - and so far, am loving it even more the second time through.  (It's amazing what a lack of magical crosshair in the middle of the screen does for immersion.)  The variety of weapons and approaches the game offers really keeps things interesting.  While the endings themselves are multiple-choice at the end, there are various times in the game where choice / performance / path taken has an effect on the future - story and gameplay - which makes me want to go through again and try things different ways.  Lots of fun to be had here.The people who made this game did so with a lot of passion, and it shows.  It's just a real shame that Eidos somehow lost the original source code leading to this slightly crippled final version of the game.  The Director's Cut does an otherwise great job of integrating the DLC content in a cohesive way, and I actually prefer the way it is integrated here vs having the orignal game plus the DLC.All in all, this has become one of my favorites - flaws and all.

Your choices will matter, your play style will matter. This is by far one of the best action/stealth games I've ever played, on par with Dishonored and the Thief games. Buy it, play it, thank me later.			"

												61 Hours to finish the game (I did take my time) and it left me hungering for more. Without spoiling, the Deus Ex story is compelling and deep and during the game I enjoyed taking the effort to find every piece of information so to form a vivid image of what the hell was going on. Honestly, it is completely worth it because it will blow your mind!Gameplay has some room for improvement, for example the hacking (which is quite common) becomes tedious after a while, and the game pretty much forces you to hack instead of inserting the code since it provides more experience/money that way. If you have read the negative reviews you will frequently stumble upon the issue of bugs. Now I have never played the original version so I can't compare, but I must say that I did not encounter ANY noteworthy bugs. Story: 10/10. Overall: 9/10.			"

												I don't want to make this review long, so if you want details, you might want to check it my Deus Ex review. All I am going to say here is that this game does pretty much everything the first game did right, and adds a lot of new features that are all cool/good. This game is as good (and many people would say it's better) as the original, and if you enjoy ""a thinking man's shooting/rpg game"" this is a must buy for you!P.S. not everything in my old review fits with this game, for example about that there are no quest markers. I still think this game executed it very well			"

												The first Deus Ex was brilliant. The second one, not so much. Human Revolution lives up the standards set by the orignial, including some of the same sound effects (and tid bits of the awesome opening theme). While there is less freedom in Human Revolution, it does not distract from the immersion. If you are in the mood for an excellent game - this one comes highly recommended. In fact, even the science in the game is corret, from the neuroscience to the physics - adding substantial depth. Play this game!			"

												Very very fun, actually makes you think about how things are going in the world today as well as having a lot to do. There is ALWAYS more than one way to usually do something depending on how you tried to play (stealth, hacker, charge in etc) it gave a feeling of being open. The game took me on many journeys and actually had me REALLY wanting more and to keep going. The RPG elements are very nice and I'm rather sad I didnt get into everything at first, as well as the many routes I could have gone after I did the entire mission my way or seeing it online. This game lets you really play how you want and doesnt feel like it restricts you. It also challenges you, you're not a bullet sponge, you're a modified human that still dies like a human. This game is really nice thing that has come in a while for me and after I finally finished it, it felt amazing and I loved it.			"

Great game  8.75/10One second stealth hacking, spy simulator with a pinch of illuminati then the next CoD Zombies and everyone in site is attacking youNow onto the real ReviewI played the origional Deus Ex Human Revoloution on Xbox 360 on games with gold however could not get past the Namir fight and was a bit stuck on the other boss fights. The Boss fights in Directors cut however are not quite easyer however balanced so there are more options etc, and that is what this game is about options you can go in guns blazing or ""sneaky beaky like"" as I did and I liked how there were many options to situations for example on my Non Directors cut playthough I snuck in the top of the police station through a vent, however  in my directors cut playthough on pc i talked my way though it which was just as finding another route. My point is one of the pros of this game is many playthoughs can be vary different similarly to Dishonred, in multiple playthoughs you find the little details of the levels that help you. Another feature similar to Dishonred is multiple endings which I like in game because it encourages replays. I will certainly be playing this again as a pacifist. Overall this is a great game, amazing story with twists and turns, and questions many moral questions which makes a game even more interesting, should humans become gods and modify themselves, how much power can one person hold, how much freedom everyone should have and should people in the dark monitor sociaty. If you have the origional Deus Ex HR definately get this because it just perfects a perfect game.If you loved Dishonred and want more (as I did) pick this game up imediately. Great stealth and endings.Deus Ex HR did not need a full remaster however Directors cut just perfected it Pros +  stealth+  options+ Good genre that should have more games about+ Good story+ Relateable charactors+ Brings up good moral points+ Replay Value+ Rewards you for not killing Cons - Needs a bit of smoothing controlls and resonsiveness- Takedowns, enemies freeze when you do a takedown- AI are quite stupid- Mssing link makes you lose your weapons because you lose all your praxisMostly a great game, get it if you have Non Directors Cut eddition or want more of Dishonred or just like stealth games "

												The definitive version of Deus Ex Human Revolution, this implements the dlc into the main story and bring some reworked boss fights and some other improvements. Now how's the game? An absolute amazing prequel to the first Deus Ex. The game takes place in a futuristic cyberpunk world where corporations hold the power and human augmentation are a matter of debate. The game has a profound and very good story that lets you make decisions and live with the consequences either good or bad. The side quests are one of the best aspects of the game. You can choose how you play that game be stealth or shoot and kill everybody with your augmentations. The A.I. is the ""worst"" aspect of the game, not well programmed but still, not that big of a problem. The conversation between characters and the morality choices of the game are another good aspect, not to mention the good VA of the main character played by Elias Toufexis. Deus Ex Human Revolution is one of the few FPS games that doesn't feel like a straight shoot/run/kill game.			"

												While leagues behind DX1 in terms of storytelling and ambiguity, the gameplay has never felt better than it does here, with some of the tightest stealth ever seen and a cover mechanic that doesn't completely suck. This is probably my most replayed game of the last five years, even with a pace that was clearly butchered by some behind the scenes politicking and company deadlines. Indeed, the Director's Cut commentary is mostly filled with musings about the limitations of their schedule and of the game's engine, which is a shame because I stand by this game warts and all.The Missing Link is inserted badly, though.

												Haven't played this all the way through yet.  Theme is a little too slickly metrosexual cyberpunk for me, and the main character looks too much like a severe alcoholic bipolar psychotic I know; but other than that, this game is pretty entertaining.   Sort of like Ghost in the Shell, except you don't get to be some naked japanese military cyborg chick who goes rogue once she attains self awareness, instead you're an American/Canadian? cyborg dude who I'm pretty sure is going to do the same thing.  On a side note, a 3d anime border rendered graphics game of ghost in the Shell would be sweet.  Especially if it had first and third person and you could be some naked japanese anime cyborg chick tanking out tanks and hackers in an open world environment.  One major criticism of this game--killing a guy versus knocking them out in stealth mode outta have the same volume level.  Killing a guy in stealth automatically alerts everyone around you within earshot, sometimes in separate rooms altogether.  Seriously, as far as stealth FPS games go, this one seems very well done, though even the graphics are a little too slickly metrosexual cyberpunk.			"

												An amazing stealth game with an immersive game enviroment with one of the greatest sci-fi conspiracy stories ever written. It will grab you and suck you into the technologically advanced era with shady corporations, terrorist cells, and the illuminati all while slowly taking your enemies out how you want to as the augmented supersoldier you are becoming. 10/10			"

												Buy this game. It is one of the best RPGs you will ever play. Multiple ways to progress through the levels, you can kill everyone or avoid the enemies altogether. Very good story, good combat, and a good exploration game. This game has many playstyles so it is good for many different people. There is a way this game makes you feel that no other game makes you.			"

												If you are a fan of games where decisions matter, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a fantastic choice! I like the thought of having an augmented main character which leads to the RPG factor of the game. It favors stealth gameplay, however it can be played aggressively if chosen. Pros:- Absolutely amazing graphics- Decision making is important- Variety of abilities/skills- Detailed objectives- Can be played stealth or aggressive (whatever fits your playstyle)- Fantastic soundtrack- Interesting side missions - Boss fights aren't too challenging (assuming you play 100% stealth)- Some missions will keep you on the edge of your seat, a lot of intense actionCons: - If you are doing a 100% stealth run, sometimes you can accidentally kill an enemy by shooting them (tranq darts) in the leg? (always do a double check and save often)- *No spoilers* regardless of how you play, you can choose your ending. (there are multiple endings)Overall i'd rate this game a 9/10 - definitely worth checking out! For $20 you will definitely get your moneys worth in game time and theres always the opportunity to replay it (100%)____________________________________________________________________________I remember playing this game on console back in 2011 on release day and love that it came to PC.Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut - it took awhile for the Directors Cut to release on Steam but it is well worth it.  (Personally I would prefer to play this with a controller than KB+M, but atleast we have either option!)If you are still on the edge of purchasing this game, this is my absolute favorite game of all. (feel free to check out my YouTube channel, I have been creating ""Let's Plays"", playthroughs/walkthroughs since 2011, but gaming for manyyyyyyyy years since I was a kid.

												This is an incredibly misleading game. By looking at the title, Deus Shrex, I thought it was going to be a sequel, or a reboot of the famous game of 1958 called Shrek Simulator 1958. It was quite okay and you had to defend your swamp from a guy called ""Player 1"" and always lost despite him not doing anything. This new game doesn't deliver expectations, but still turns out pretty awesome.So naturally you start off playing a guy called Adam Jensen, who doesn't seem like an ogre at all. All of your beloved characters are gone in favour of other non-ogre looking non-beloved characters. You also start somewhere that could have been your swamp if not for all of these towers, industrial buildings and cars and cops and I guess it could have never been your swamp in fact.Next thing you know you're forced to defend your non-swamp base or home or whatever from evil non-beloved non-ogre characters using highly violent ways like pressing a trigger on an automatic combat rifle to make bullets go rocketing towards your enemies destroying their vital internal organs. Now I know why they abandoned the Shrek concept.And that sets off a chain of events and sends your non-Shrek character on a globe-trotting adventure, where you continue to defeat enemies using loud and powerful weapons, beat-ups or by bypassing them entirely. This is sure not something I'd want in a Shrek game.And to add to all of that you can upgrade your non-ogre non-layered character in lots of different ways giving him abilities that all ogres have natively, so he might as well have been an ogre.Uh so I guess you should not come here for a Shrek Simulator, but rather for a sequel of the game Deus Ex which is a totally different thing, I  don't know why they didn't call it that.

												DXHR is a classic case of a game having such a strong and enthralling narrative that it forces you to ignore the clunky gameplay mechanics, console-quality graphics, and the fact that a huge amount of great content was cut from the final release. The Director's Cut could've been a chance for Eidos to correct a lot of mistakes, but they decided on simply re-releasing the same game with the Missing Link story integrated. Only consider it if you haven't played DXHR yet (and because Steam took down the original release).			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a first-person/rpg style story-heavy game set in a world where cybernetic enhancements, also known as augmentations, are taking over and quickly redefining  what it means to be human.  These augmentations serve to improve and build upon the human condition by providing its hosts with superior physical and mental characteristics that surpass what an unenhanced body is capable of.  For some people, augmentations can be used in defense of the greater good such as ridding the streets of dangerous criminals.  Not everyone believes augmentations should be so widely accepted though. As you will find progressing through the story, there are those who seek the abolishment of augmentations due to the threats they pose against ordinary folk - those threats being an establishment of dominance, control and overall superiority.  The evolution of the human species is brought into question and whether it is okay to interfere with its progress by introducing unnatural enhancements into the fold. Corporate greed plays a major role in the midst of this revolution as well - groups with a lot of money seek to use augmentations for their own malicious purposes. Deus Ex: Human Revolution has a deeper and significantly more profound narrative than most games you will ever play.  Throughout the game you will be forced to make some questionable choices that raise philosophical and ethical concerns relative to real life.  The gameplay is an amalgamation of stealth similar to Splinter Cell where you must take down opponents without being seen or avoiding them altogther, and guns-blazing action just like a traditional first person shooter except you have unique augmentations and abilities at your disposal. In closing I should mention that from my own experience the game is not without its STRICTLY technical hiccups.  A good bit into the game the hotkey tab where all your equipment/food/drinks are no longer appeared on the screen - it completely vanished and not only that the hotkeys themselves stopped working.  I had to manually go into my inventory to equip weapons, use items, etc.  Additionally, the hotkey tab would occasionally randomly decide to appear in the middle of the screen on the far left while I was playing.  Other issues I had included the reticle of all my weapons disappearing entirely.  I arrived at a point in the game where I could no longer properly aim with my weapons, making long range combat so frustrating I gave up on doing it.  I should also note that there is a setting to turn the reticle off but I did NOT tamper with this whatsoever.  The last but rarest issue I came across was the inability to use cover. It happened a few times so it was not a huge hindrance. Despite some of the technical mishap I encountered, that apparently nobody else I have talked to has, the game is a masterpiece. The handful of inconveniences, at the end of the day are negligible all because of the satisfying experience it had to offer.9/10			"

What I ment way back, that the game is great, but this ""Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut"" I have not played it fully, this version. So if it bugs for some, might be better to lower the stats for it. The so called original, is and was, great for me.I will try to play this Director's Cut with and without comments through, to see how it is. It is still sometimes fun to play through a game you have done already - but not always knowing if the ""new versions"" are good.And now it gives me only 2 options, would I recommend _this_ version, yes or no.. damn.Cheers...

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution has one of the most interesting and involved plotlines I have seen in a game for a long time. It keeps throwing new things at you every twist and turn, but it doesn't feel like it's just pulling things out of its♥♥♥♥♥ For once in a game, I felt legitimately motivated to seek out and perform sidequests, just to see how they would be presented as a story. The journey was fantastic, but the destination was rather lacking. I'm dissapointed that this game, which always pointed out the difference between lethal and non-lethal means of taking enemies down, only had 4 standard endings. All of which literally involved a choice of one of three buttons or saying f*ck it and destroying everything around you. There are no differences for playing incredibly lethally or sneaking around and not killing anyone.Speaking of sneaking, it is one of the hardest things to do in this game during later levels. It became less about ""avoiding detection until you reach you goal"", and instead became ""Try and stealthily take out as many enemies as possible before it turns into another gigantic shootout."" Enemies are positioned a bit too perfectly, making it impossible to take somebody down witout being seen immediately. Also, unlike other stealth games, instead of just having one person notice you, upon being spotted the entire building suddenly knows exactly which crate you hid behind and proceed to light the place up with gunfire. I do appreciate the fact that enemy bullets do massive damage just like they would in real life, but I despise how the armor upgrades barely change it. I want my damage negations to be effective, especially considering how much I am being shot at. Ignoring the stealth for a minute however, the actual shooting isn't half bad. Hiding behind a wall and shooting down a hallway always has a certain charm to it, and there aren't cliche'd chest-high walls everywhere. At least they did the decency of making it a potted plant, desk, or other random object getting between you and the bullets. However, the difficulty of the game decreases almost to zero if you invest into the default pistol. With a silencer and armor piercing rounds, a single headshot becomes a lethal, untracable death bringer that can clear out entire maps without being noticed. More often than not I found myself in a high area sniping people with the pistol until nothing moved. It also becomes incredibly effective against robots, which are a gigantic threat in the game reduced to just a heavily armored gun.Another kinda notable feature is the ""Talking Parts"". Basically you have to strategically talk to somebody to convince them to give you something. It's a pretty interesting mechanic, but personally all it did was remind me how bad I am at talking to people. I can't give a clear like or dislike to that mechanic.All in all, while it has its notable downsides, I felt the upsides, like the story and not having too much or too little ammo, in addition to fun combat made it a worthwhile purchase.

												As someone who has never played the original Deus Ex games I have taken a leap of faith playing this game. Well what drove me to purchase this was the steam summer sale, back before the Director's Cut existed and they do give you a good discount which allows existing owners of Human Revolution to upgrade to the Director's Cut. This is very nice.Human Revolution is set in a dystopian future - the year 2027, with Human augmentation & enhancement being the big topic. You play as Adam Jensen, the chief of security for one of America's top Bio-Corporations: Sarif Industries, which is on the break of a new discovery which can change the scales when it comes to availability of augmentation for everyone, without touching into the lore of the game to much; not all augmentations are available to everyone as the human body naturally rejects these cybernetic limbs as intruders and tries to attack, harming the host. Adam progressive through the story as he has to be drastically augmented after a tragic accident which leaves him in a near death state.Touching on the augmentations in this game, they act as a levelling system which allows you to upgrade Adam which in turn allows you to tackle different problems. For example you can equip Adam with the ability to fall from any height and remain unharmed; allowing you to take different routes that may avoid guards. One problem that I find with the skill tree is the fact that Adam does not have that much power to fuel these new features. If you are not too careful you could find yourself out of power and defenceless. When it comes to gameplay, this game is immaculate. The game presents you with an objective that is fixed but the way you arrive at that objective is completely up to your own discretion. There are a many of Half-Life, human sized vents that you can crawl through which allow you to reach your objective or you can come up with ridiculous ways of travelling without being detected such as carrying a wood box around that shields the enemy’s line of sight. You will also be awarded with exploring the area in the means of XP which in turn helps you receive new Praxis kits which allow you to upgrade Adam even further. The enemy AI in this game is also very good as they will adapt to a situation that you create. In Human Revolution there are two ""City Hubs"" these consist of the American city of Detroit which is a mixture of middle class and lower class establishments (where Sarif Industries is located and Jensen's apartment) and the Chinese City of Hengsha which is a highly industrialised city. These city hubs are massive areas which will take some time to explore, with unique areas and characters such as in Detroit there is the Detroit convention centre and in Hengsha you have the Hive night club. Each city also contains a set of buildings that are common; these include many apartments, a bio-tech firm, and a LIMB clinic (which allows you to upgrade you augmentations).In these city hubs you will undergo many main quest missions. The main storyline for this game is of medium length but there are many Easter eggs that will point back to the original games. The main quest takes you to these city hubs twice and some other locations such as Montreal. Every time you travel to one of these city hubs you are always presented with new side quests which are optional but they expand on the lore that is the Deus Ex universe.The one flaw that annoyed much of the original Human Revolution fan base was the boss fights; these are mandatory and cannot be skipped in the main quest line. The main problem was that there was no freedom that is available in the rest of the game thus making it harder and more linear to combat these enemies. In the director’s cut this issue has been addressed and there are now multiple ways in which you can tackle these enemies. For a 2011 game the graphics are still quite appealing and the game has a wonderful setting, especially due to it being set in the future and this rendition of the future has a very vibrant night life and the overall architecture is very nice.One of the very memorable things about this game for me was the soundtrack, most places in the game have the own distinct score which is easily recognisable. If you enter combat in one of these areas, the score for that area will transition very smoothly to a combat rendition. The score has a very synthetic feel which reflects the setting and theme of the overall game. As someone who does not know music in-depth I cannot explain why it is good but trust me it is!The DLC that is included in this game for free is also very good; the DLC activates late game and expands on a massive time gap that occurs without the DLC. Missing Link (the title for said DLC) expands on an event that happens towards the end of the game and gives you unseen background knowledge on that event. The DLC will also strip you of augmentations, allowing you to rebuild Jensen again.Overall Deus Ex Human Revolution is an excellent game and a brilliant RPG. The game has a memorable story and is a brilliant introduction to the main Deus Ex game.			"

												It's the greatest game i have ever played . The story has a very good meaning for humanity . I mostly played it for the story , i have tried to make the right choiches , but in the end it's worth playing this game . The next game i will play after this , it's probably going to be 'Mankind Devided' .			"

												This is an incredibly misleading game. By looking at the title, Deus Shrex, I thought it was going to be a sequel, or a reboot of the famous game of 1958 called Shrek Simulator 1958. It was quite okay and you had to defend your swamp from a guy called ""Player 1"" and always lost despite him not doing anything. This new game doesn't deliver expectations, but still turns out pretty awesome.So naturally you start off playing a guy called Adam Jensen, who doesn't seem like an ogre at all. All of your beloved characters are gone in favour of other non-ogre looking non-beloved characters. You also start somewhere that could have been your swamp if not for all of these towers, industrial buildings and cars and cops and I guess it could have never been your swamp in fact.Next thing you know you're forced to defend your non-swamp base or home or whatever from evil non-beloved non-ogre characters using highly violent ways like pressing a trigger on an automatic combat rifle to make bullets go rocketing towards your enemies destroying their vital internal organs. Now I know why they abandoned the Shrek concept.And that sets off a chain of events and sends your non-Shrek character on a globe-trotting adventure, where you continue to defeat enemies using loud and powerful weapons, beat-ups or by bypassing them entirely. This is sure not something I'd want in a Shrek game.And to add to all of that you can upgrade your non-ogre non-layered character in lots of different ways giving him abilities that all ogres have natively, so he might as well have been an ogre.Uh so I guess you should not come here for a Shrek Simulator, but rather for a sequel of the game Deus Ex which is a totally different thing, I  don't know why they didn't call it that.

Needless to say more about the operations and graphic, just go though it, what touches me deeply is its storyline. The world is often asked what does human truely need. Now, it's for you to deside.

												The Director's Cut edition fixes the few minor issues that were in the regular edition. There's now a stealthy approach to every boss battle, the yellow filter can be removed, and the DLC is included seamlessly within the story.Now, onto the gameplay.In this game, you can play however you want. You can be a stealth pro who uses tranquilizers, invisibility and other methods to remain undetected. But you can also be an edgy augmented guy who uses augmentations and big guns to kill everyone. That's fun too. Or you can be a mix of both. For example, you can kill people while remaining completely undetected, using silenced pistols and silenced sniper rifles.A bunch of cool features: You can choose your augmentations. You can hack terminals to disable cameras and use enemy turrets and robots to your advantage. You can read NPC e-mails on every computer in the game (which makes the world even more believable). You can persuade NPCs through dialogue options.All of this stuff is put together in a way that always feels wonderfully fluid and intuitive. You play the game the way you want, at your own pace, and no one will tell you how you should be playing. The flow is great.The music isn't particularly ""catchy"", but it really adds a lot to the game's atmosphere, as it fits the vibe of the universe at all times.The story is incredibly thought-provoking and touches many actual, real subjects, like human evolution, the media, freedom, power, society, etc. It really makes you think about what it means to be human, and makes you wonder how far technology can go before we lose our identity. Where do we draw the line between human and machine? It puts you in a position where you feel like your opinion actually matters. It's always interesting and it really pulls you in. Not to mention, the voice acting is excellent and every important character is memorable.I'd give this game a very solid 9 out of 10.			"

												Absolutely incredible game. People told me for years to play this, but I always put it on the backlog and now I honestly regret I did. The story, gameplay, and characters are amazing, especailly the protagonist Adam Jensen. The game starts off pretty slow and you really don't feel all that powerful. But once you get over that hump, you literally become a badass, especailly if you invest heavily in Hack. I racked up so much EXP from hacking. And the mini game that is tied to it is really fun, especially when you get to level 5 and have like 6 secs to get it done. The game lets you play quiet or loud, though it basically encourages you to play stealthy either way. Running into the middle of a group of enemies is most likely gonna result in your death. Luckily the stealth in this game is done very well, so it makes it fun to sneak around air ducts or find those hidden paths around enemies. And the game gives you EXP for doing that as well, so you don't lose much by skipping large battles. The only major cons I have with the game are that the cutscenes don't really scale with the game. The game on max settings looks pretty good, but the cutscenes are lower quality no matter what you play on. Its not a big deal, but it would have been nice to see sharper scenes. Another con is the use of batteries to do pretty much anything. For using camo or armor, yeah, it makes sense to have to use battery life. But to knock enemies out? That just seemed like a pointless feature. I really hope in DX4 they remove that. Overall, this game is a solid 10 in my books. Everything about this game is amazing. And the freedom it gives you to handle a situation however you like is rare in games nowadays.			"

												I removed my last post and sorry if I made it wrong. The thing is, I am not good with ""older"" games reviews (if ever) and I might have said it wrong. What I ment way back, that the game is great, but this ""Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut"" I have not played it fully, this version. So if it bugs for some, might be better to lower the stats for it. The so called original, is and was, great for me.I will try to play this Director's Cut with and without comments through, to see how it is. It is still sometimes fun to play through a game you have done already - but not always knowing if the ""new versions"" are good.And now it gives me only 2 options, would I recommend _this_ version, yes or no.. damn.Cheers...

												What a fantastic experience!I never gave this game a shot, dissmissing it as a linear first person shooter. 2011 was a very crowded year for games, seeing some of the most iconic titles to date, though it was swept aside ths is no exception for Deus Ex: Human Revolution.I am delighted to find that this game successfully blends FPS, RPG, stealth, tactical gameplay and some open world elements into one story driven package that I highly recommend picking up. At its current sale price, the game is a a steal for customers with 20 hours of main game content with side missions here and there to flesh out some of the hub city levels.I intitally thought this game to be like any other shooter, but with my first glimpse of this experience, I realised that this was more than the game I thought it to be.To generalise my opinion:  8.9/10 An absolute must try.

Ok date in this  game is 2025 and you are Adam jensen employe of Sarif Industries on of the biggest companies in the world. The day Your girlfriend Megan Reed has presentation what boss will call something that will change and define what beings human, Terrorists attack Sarif Industries killing Megan and leaving Adam half killed. Adam will be augmented and will start investigation of this case, soon he will find out that was not ordinary attack. Pros: Uncover the mysterie of htat day and explore sci-fi world of 2025. Experience best stealth experience you can get after Dishonored, learn, hear, use people problems and secrets use your mind as a weapon and assure people in you objectives. Hear arguments of both sides, do random activities,  develop yourself, use  shadows, hacking (still better than Watch Dogs) and become Deus Ex (translation: God made out of human by machine) and beware do not burn wings ( I used it because there some refrences to that greek Legend in this game)Verdict 10/10 maybe the gameplay is not that perfect but game does main, gives you a quetion to answer which is up to you to decide in not too far future!

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution has one of the most interesting and involved plotlines I have seen in a game for a long time. It keeps throwing new things at you every twist and turn, but it doesn't feel like it's just pulling things out of its♥♥♥♥♥ For once in a game, I felt legitimately motivated to seek out and perform sidequests, just to see how they would be presented as a story. The journey was fantastic, but the destination was rather lacking. I'm dissapointed that this game, which always pointed out the difference between lethal and non-lethal means of taking enemies down, only had 4 standard endings. All of which literally involved a choice of one of three buttons or saying f*ck it and destroying everything around you. There are no differences for playing incredibly lethally or sneaking around and not killing anyone.Speaking of sneaking, it is one of the hardest things to do in this game during later levels. It became less about ""avoiding detection until you reach you goal"", and instead became ""Try and stealthily take out as many enemies as possible before it turns into another gigantic shootout."" Enemies are positioned a bit too perfectly, making it impossible to take somebody down witout being seen immediately. Also, unlike other stealth games, instead of just having one person notice you, upon being spotted the entire building suddenly knows exactly which crate you hid behind and proceed to light the place up with gunfire. I do appreciate the fact that enemy bullets do massive damage just like they would in real life, but I despise how the armor upgrades barely change it. I want my damage negations to be effective, especially considering how much I am being shot at. Ignoring the stealth for a minute however, the actual shooting isn't half bad. Hiding behind a wall and shooting down a hallway always has a certain charm to it, and there aren't cliche'd chest-high walls everywhere. At least they did the decency of making it a potted plant, desk, or other random object getting between you and the bullets. However, the difficulty of the game decreases almost to zero if you invest into the default pistol. With a silencer and armor piercing rounds, a single headshot becomes a lethal, untracable death bringer that can clear out entire maps without being noticed. More often than not I found myself in a high area sniping people with the pistol until nothing moved. It also becomes incredibly effective against robots, which are a gigantic threat in the game reduced to just a heavily armored gun.Another kinda notable feature is the ""Talking Parts"". Basically you have to strategically talk to somebody to convince them to give you something. It's a pretty interesting mechanic, but personally all it did was remind me how bad I am at talking to people. I can't give a clear like or dislike to that mechanic.All in all, while it has its notable downsides, I felt the upsides, like the story and not having too much or too little ammo, in addition to fun combat made it a worthwhile purchase.

												A great cyberpunk action/RPG. My favorite in the series (Sorry guys, but we've got to stop listening to the nostalgia at some point.). Plenty of different ways to tackle each mission; and while the story is fairly linear come the end, the game does a great job of keeping you from realizing it until later reflection. Director's cut does have some technical issues, and the graphics are aging pretty quickly; but all in all, one of my favorite Science Fiction games.9/10 - It was better before Director's Cut.			"

												As someone who has never played the original Deus Ex games I have taken a leap of faith playing this game. Well what drove me to purchase this was the steam summer sale, back before the Director's Cut existed and they do give you a good discount which allows existing owners of Human Revolution to upgrade to the Director's Cut. This is very nice.Human Revolution is set in a dystopian future - the year 2027, with Human augmentation & enhancement being the big topic. You play as Adam Jensen, the chief of security for one of America's top Bio-Corporations: Sarif Industries, which is on the break of a new discovery which can change the scales when it comes to availability of augmentation for everyone, without touching into the lore of the game to much; not all augmentations are available to everyone as the human body naturally rejects these cybernetic limbs as intruders and tries to attack, harming the host. Adam progressive through the story as he has to be drastically augmented after a tragic accident which leaves him in a near death state.Touching on the augmentations in this game, they act as a levelling system which allows you to upgrade Adam which in turn allows you to tackle different problems. For example you can equip Adam with the ability to fall from any height and remain unharmed; allowing you to take different routes that may avoid guards. One problem that I find with the skill tree is the fact that Adam does not have that much power to fuel these new features. If you are not too careful you could find yourself out of power and defenceless. When it comes to gameplay, this game is immaculate. The game presents you with an objective that is fixed but the way you arrive at that objective is completely up to your own discretion. There are a many of Half-Life, human sized vents that you can crawl through which allow you to reach your objective or you can come up with ridiculous ways of travelling without being detected such as carrying a wood box around that shields the enemy’s line of sight. You will also be awarded with exploring the area in the means of XP which in turn helps you receive new Praxis kits which allow you to upgrade Adam even further. The enemy AI in this game is also very good as they will adapt to a situation that you create. In Human Revolution there are two ""City Hubs"" these consist of the American city of Detroit which is a mixture of middle class and lower class establishments (where Sarif Industries is located and Jensen's apartment) and the Chinese City of Hengsha which is a highly industrialised city. These city hubs are massive areas which will take some time to explore, with unique areas and characters such as in Detroit there is the Detroit convention centre and in Hengsha you have the Hive night club. Each city also contains a set of buildings that are common; these include many apartments, a bio-tech firm, and a LIMB clinic (which allows you to upgrade you augmentations).In these city hubs you will undergo many main quest missions. The main storyline for this game is of medium length but there are many Easter eggs that will point back to the original games. The main quest takes you to these city hubs twice and some other locations such as Montreal. Every time you travel to one of these city hubs you are always presented with new side quests which are optional but they expand on the lore that is the Deus Ex universe.The one flaw that annoyed much of the original Human Revolution fan base was the boss fights; these are mandatory and cannot be skipped in the main quest line. The main problem was that there was no freedom that is available in the rest of the game thus making it harder and more linear to combat these enemies. In the director’s cut this issue has been addressed and there are now multiple ways in which you can tackle these enemies. For a 2011 game the graphics are still quite appealing and the game has a wonderful setting, especially due to it being set in the future and this rendition of the future has a very vibrant night life and the overall architecture is very nice.One of the very memorable things about this game for me was the soundtrack, most places in the game have the own distinct score which is easily recognisable. If you enter combat in one of these areas, the score for that area will transition very smoothly to a combat rendition. The score has a very synthetic feel which reflects the setting and theme of the overall game. As someone who does not know music in-depth I cannot explain why it is good but trust me it is!The DLC that is included in this game for free is also very good; the DLC activates late game and expands on a massive time gap that occurs without the DLC. Missing Link (the title for said DLC) expands on an event that happens towards the end of the game and gives you unseen background knowledge on that event. The DLC will also strip you of augmentations, allowing you to rebuild Jensen again.Overall Deus Ex Human Revolution is an excellent game and a brilliant RPG. The game has a memorable story and is a brilliant introduction to the main Deus Ex game.			"

												If you're a DX vet, expect a lot of Squarification, e.g. the omission of characters and plot elements integral to the franchise, except in maybe a token capacity (a la ""wot they done did to Dungeon Siege III""), so it's not exactly the same atmosphere as the original. But get it anyway. If you're new to DX, this is a great place to start.The music is great, the plot is rich with thematic elements of conspiracy theories, the visuals are...well they're shiny and yellow, and each area map sprawls -just- enough to trick you into believing the game is longer than it is. Pay no attention to the 70+ hours I have on record. I...I had to pee a lot.Couple of things that bug me about a 2011 game that was re-released on 2013. First, the body and mouth movements during dialogue. It looks all stuttery, like the characters are those mannequins you see in Kraftwerk videos. All puppety and the like. Second, lots of little flickery pixels, like there's a film grain filter happening. But nevermind. It's a good game, the price has been reduced by $40 or so since release, and the sequel is soon upon us.			"

												I haven't finished it yet.  I'm fairly close to the end.  I've gone from loving this game, to hating it, pretty much.  I just played through the terrible DLC which did very little for the story and slowed the whole game right down.  I have no idea whose idea that was.Edit:I finished it a few hours later.  A complete let down to be honest, plus, even though I'd played pacifist all the way through I never got the achievement.  There was no point during the game that I recall actually killing anyone (outside of boss fights), and so I'm quite cheesed off with it to be honest.But here're a few things that let this game down:After a while praxis points and xp become irrelevent as there are a lot of filler perks.The game pretends to let you play it your way, but it really wants you to stealth and hack your way through, I am guessing that if you run and gun your way through it you'll miss out.It's far too long.  I didn't care about the plot by the time that I got to the end of it.I'm going to wait a long time before I attempt the next game in the series.			"

												Deus Ex:Human Revolution is a God damn masterpiece! It's a very well desighed game which tells us a very decent story and raises so many questions like human progress,human morality and so on. Moreover to say that the gameplay approach is good means to say nothing (There are so many ways to complete the game).The shooter mechanics is perfectly compactible with RPG elements,you can even complete the game without making a single shot(except for some boss fights) or upgrading any skills.In general,if you are a fan of computer games and want to see a good story and be a part of it,this game must be the first in your wishlist.I only regret,that i couldn't play it when it was released(I played a Director's Cut).

If you choose stealth style of play I recommend you a controller and next to you keyboard for F5(quick save) and F8(quick load)Cons:Difficult mode on game + is not really difficultI had enjoyed reaching 100% completion of the game.I would recommend this game to everyone who likes Story Rich/action packed/stealth games.

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is an incredible game. The bulk of the game is highly enjoyable stealth sequences, in which you use your Inspector Gadjet Robocop Powers to achieve all your goals. Cloak your way past any encounters, launch explosives out of your shoulder rockets, or shishkebab any enemies that get too close with your arm shankers. Alternatively, you can go full on hippie mode and play the entire game without shanking/neck-snapping/shooting/exploding/throwing photocopiers at anyone! Except the boss fights. They are pretty trash. Other than that, this game is incredible for those who love stealth, and still quite viable for those who prefer cover based shooting. Not that I ever asked for this.			"

												What a fantastic experience!I never gave this game a shot, dissmissing it as a linear first person shooter. 2011 was a very crowded year for games, seeing some of the most iconic titles to date, though it was swept aside ths is no exception for Deus Ex: Human Revolution.I am delighted to find that this game successfully blends FPS, RPG, stealth, tactical gameplay and some open world elements into one story driven package that I highly recommend picking up. At its current sale price, the game is a a steal for customers with 20 hours of main game content with side missions here and there to flesh out some of the hub city levels.I intitally thought this game to be like any other shooter, but with my first glimpse of this experience, I realised that this was more than the game I thought it to be.To generalise my opinion:  8.9/10 An absolute must try.

												This game has a compelling atmosphere. From the very beginning, the music played when we launch the game makes us feel flung into its world. As a result however, it does make any disappointment a very frustrating experience.It is an excellent game nonetheless. For the reason I just mentioned: the atmosphere is so compelling it reminds me of the first time I played Half-Life 1. We really feel like we are Adam Jensen and we have responsabilities. When I failed to save someone in some parts of the game, I really felt it was my fault. Talking about the music, the intro music is even so good I suffer pain quitting the game or loading a save. Characters are endearing. Jensen's personality isn't extremely original, but still is extremely convicing, as for all the other characters in the game : Sarif, Malik…But this game as awesome also because it has a broad gameplay well made in every aspect. Hacking, stealth, combat, debate, exploration, side quests, deciding your ameliorations and weapons : it's impressive a game can have so many different gameplay aspect yet excels at each one. It is fun and really simple to handle.Now, as I said, this game isn't perfect. I encountered a few bugs : sometimes, a 2 second part of a music was looping, the game has frequently lags, it has also minor bugs with shadows and water effects, it also happened rarely though that the game simply stopped working. The radgoll is also rarely very buggy. Once, I tried to hide a body, but for unknown reasons he got stuck in the floor, so I couldn't move it, and the other guards noticed it. Or another time, a body I was hiding as well just roused itself from me and landed just before a guard. That was annoyng :p But bugs did not alter the overall game's experience. The same can't really be said for the other big problems of this game. Because it feels so real, any disapointment is extremely frustrating.Let's talk about side quests : There is one character, not linked with the game's plot at all, who has a very endealling personality. You can help her getting out of an extremely bad situation. However, as soon as you do, you won't see her anymore. She disappears without explanation. Side quest is done. As if you only saved her because you're completionist and have to do all side quests. There's that other character who has a very big problem as well. When you finished helping, and if you come back to speak to her, she just talks like a decoration NPC, saying ""thanks"" while looking at her Iphone or whatever. Such aspects of the game should have been more worked. I do as many side quests as I can and I feel really flung into them, for that reason it really makes me feel those aspects of the game are botched.Now the ending : I found it weak. I'm not talking about the story, but how they made the ending. Adam Jensen has a choice to make. I only tested two choices, and they're dispaointing. For two reasons. The first it that it only gets us to see a video made of real videos (which doesn't fit at all with the game and seems to be botched) where Adam Jensen is reading a pupil's dissertation, quoting Albert Einstein like any dumbass do (I'm sorry if you do, but let's admit it, it's as stupid as mentioning the nazis in a debate, as I just did in some ways :/ ).The second reason is going to spoil :  we can choose to tell the truth about the augmentations problem. I made this choice at first because I thought making up accusations against the humanity front without any proves could be uncovered and because there would be no ways any augmentation incident could result in the world definitely rejecting the augmentation technology. Nothing could lead to that in my opinion. It's also the opinion of the scientist who worked with the Deus Ex team. Yet, in this game, if you decide to tell the truth, Adam speaks as if you made this choice because technology is bad and that the choice you made will prevent humans from making the error of using augmentations and  technology again. First, I don't think there could be any benefits rejecting technology. Lastly, it's impossible. Humans will never reject technology. "

												Having never played another game of the Deus Ex franchise so far, I can't get into detail about how this game is different than the original HR one, or how better/worse it is compared to the first ones.BUT!!If you are looking for an amazing stealth based game, with a nice plot, well developed characters, extensivelly thought out backstory and general badassness, search no more. I would definitely recommend this game, but keep in mind these thhings:-if you are  the kind of person that prefers storming into bases while riding an elephant and waving a bazooka around , you might have some trouble here 3:) The game does give you deadly takedown options, and has a variety of weapons -not too extensive but overall sufficient- used to kill, but firing a single bullet can cause troops of enemies to sudenly appear, and let me tell you, they are highly accurate, and your reloading takes a while, so you're better off silently stunning them or looking around for other possible ways. This game rewards you overall for being stealthy, with XP, bonuses, etc, but I for some people it can be really frustrating, sneaking away without killing that one annoying soldier xDBoss fights on the other hand require ""open-field"" fighting...Hacking and stealthing around could get you somewhere but you need to actively fight them to proceed.-The replayability factor is imo about average, but with the new game+ option you can keep your augmentations (aka skills) in the new game. Especially helpful if aiming for achievements. The game took me around 55 hours to finish.-If you're more of the ""I'm here for the story"" type, you might find the ending kinda disappointing. I enjoyed the game overall so I didnt mind it THAT much, but, well...Other than that the game is perfect, and since I got it on sale I can easily say this was the best 5$ I ever spent!!			"

												This fixes the issues that kept Deus Ex: HR from truly shining. AI is vastly improved, and those stupid boss battles, while not eliminated, are changed entirely to accompany any number of tactics. No longer are you screwed over by rolling for stealth or rolling for a cunning linquist. My only issue with this has to be the implementation of the Missing Link DLC, which feels very poorly-implemented and proves to be frustrating, as you lose all your♥♥♥♥♥♥during the campaign and have your skills reset. The Missing Link DLC is a bit of a downer in this game, but by all means buy this version of the game. It fixes the dealbreakers that the original Human Revolution had.			"

												I hope you like hacking, lots of hacking...seriously this game is 50% hacking sh*t. Now you can actually approach objectives differently and avoid hacking mostly, but if you augment (upgrade) your abilities to hack robots and sentry guns you have to hack into every single pc you come across to find out which ones have access to them so you can shut down or turn them on your enemies. The actual hacking is funish to start off with but once you've upgraded your hacking abilities fully it's way too easy to hack in successfully and so it becomes tedious.The shooting and combat is erh...well it leaves a lot to be desired, it's not terrible but you can tell the devs made the stealth gameplay a higher priority than gunplay. When i first played this i would go up to unsuspecting prost*tutes (damn steam, what words don't you filter?) and knock them out in one punch. Now don't call me a mysognist or nuthin cos 90% of the Detroit population  seem to be ladies of the night. They were the only people out at night, i blame Eidos  for not having more NPC variety, actually there was variety in the hookers, they did have different models.....just not much variety in other NPC'S.The ending has 4 different endings you can choose, i chose all of them because why not, i went and just reloaded my last save and got the achievement for having seen all the endings. I bring this up mainly because at the time or writing the next Deus Ex: Mankind Divided has just been announced and apparently none of the choices you chose are canon...or they all are canon? i read the new game is set 2 years after the end of this one and all the choices will be merged in the new game which means you really never had a choice. The ""choice"" i made to watch all the endings seems to have actually been the only RIGHT one.Game companies what's the point of putting choices into games when you are all too lazy to impliment them properly in your games sequels. The Metro games had the same problem where you could have a bad or good ending at the end of the first one. The good ending was harder to get and they used the bad ending as the canon ending for the start of Metro Last Light. I'm guessing they will do the same thing for the third Metro game.Eidos if you are going to choose for us then don't bother giving me the illusion of choice, it only leads to dissapointment from your player base that you could have easily avoided if you just stuck to one awesome ending instead of splitting it up to make the game seem smarter or more creative.The game is good though, not that many games try to combine rpg elements with FPS and also stealth, i think there is something for everyone with this title.

												One of the best games ever! Gameplay feels good, controls are just right, no glitches and bugs, but you should change cover settings to toggle, or was it hold, i don't remember :D Anyway, this game has awesome story, it's like, more you progress you get deeper and deeper to things you aren't supposed to know and in the end... THERE'S THE FREAKING ILLUMINATI (Not kidding, it's THE ILLUMINATI).Pros:- Awesome story- Good gameplay- Not much glitches and bugsCons:- Most levels too easy, bosses too hard.- How can i turn the Missing Link DLC levels of?!- In the end when you talk to that one guy in the (spoiler spoiler spoiler, spoiler) you cannot agree to what he says, when i actually do.Neutral:-You run out of ammo easily and gunstores are hard to find and have low amounts of ammo. Good because it brings sense of danger and froces you to do missions because you get ammo from killing enemies. Bad because running out of ammo is annoying.			"

												What a thrilling experience this has been! Amazing game at all levels. I haven't played many RPG's before mainly because some of them tend to get boring over time or you get stuck very often. DEHR makes it very easy for you. Doesn't matter how you play, using stealth or direct combat, you can always get through. Same goes for passage ways, there are always atleast 2 different routes you can take, so you don't get stuck or read a WT or anything. Whatever choice you make, will have consequences and will definitely affect the story and the ending. A great game overall, 11/10			"

												I just finished the game after 29 hours and all I can say is that this game is unbelievable. First of all the story is just amazing. You will try to learn everything in every place and its done so beautifully that you don't even get bored or you just don't want to continue without wondering around. Different endings and being able to somewhat change the story is a huge plus.Soundtrack is pretty good too, it really makes you feel the game. I still listen the soundtrack in youtube, what else can I say? If you play the game you will understand it, it just suits perfectly. Brilliantly created. You will not be upset if you care about the soundtrack.Gameplay is also good. Skill system and inventory was well done, it made me think carefully before I change anything or pick a new item or skill. Upgrades to weapons are also very good, they change the game dramatically. Combat was challanging too and I loved the finishing moves. The game can be played by either stealth or pure combat styles. I loved the stealth action but sometimes the finishers were not good. For example when your character kills a guy silently, it should drag his body back but instead it sometimes just throws it away and it results in a bad situation. Overall if you enjoy stealth or fps games, I believe you will enjoy the gameplay. Being able to focus on pure combat instead of stealth makes the game also good for players who wants action. It is good that game gives you a choice depending on your style. There are a lot of, I mean a LOT of places to wander around and tons of hidden places to discover. I didn't expect that when I started playing but you really feel the freedom while playing. Game doesnt just force you to play it linearly, it gives you many options. Lots of side quests, places and things to find and play styles to choose will definitely keep you excited about the game. 29 hours felt like 9 hours. If you are like me and want to explore every corner, you will not be disappointed. Unfortunately there are some things that I dont like about the game. Sometimes game just makes you feel like it's wasting your time. For example waiting in elevators, waiting for a system check, waiting for things to move or running back to the place where you were before and things like that. And as I said there are many places to investigate, you want to explore every corner but it makes you exhausted.This game is 9/10 in my opinion. It was a great adventure I feel like I just finished an amazing movie. It really made me feel like that. I realy hope that we will see another game from these great guys, they really know how to make a great game.			"

												If you're a DX vet, expect a lot of Squarification, e.g. the omission of characters and plot elements integral to the franchise, except in maybe a token capacity (a la ""wot they done did to Dungeon Siege III""), so it's not exactly the same atmosphere as the original. But get it anyway. If you're new to DX, this is a great place to start.The music is great, the plot is rich with thematic elements of conspiracy theories, the visuals are...well they're shiny and yellow, and each area map sprawls -just- enough to trick you into believing the game is longer than it is. Pay no attention to the 70+ hours I have on record. I...I had to pee a lot.Couple of things that bug me about a 2011 game that was re-released on 2013. First, the body and mouth movements during dialogue. It looks all stuttery, like the characters are those mannequins you see in Kraftwerk videos. All puppety and the like. Second, lots of little flickery pixels, like there's a film grain filter happening. But nevermind. It's a good game, the price has been reduced by $40 or so since release, and the sequel is soon upon us.			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is an incredible game. The bulk of the game is highly enjoyable stealth sequences, in which you use your Inspector Gadjet Robocop Powers to achieve all your goals. Cloak your way past any encounters, launch explosives out of your shoulder rockets, or shishkebab any enemies that get too close with your arm shankers. Alternatively, you can go full on hippie mode and play the entire game without shanking/neck-snapping/shooting/exploding/throwing photocopiers at anyone! Except the boss fights. They are pretty trash. Other than that, this game is incredible for those who love stealth, and still quite viable for those who prefer cover based shooting. Not that I ever asked for this.			"

												This game is basically what all stealth based FPS games should be modeled after. Amazing scenery, atmosphere, AI (in the higher difficulties), dialog, character development, and lore make this game so much fun and interesting. I have to give praise to the combat system in this game. It is absolutely awesome. True you can go about killing everyone, but scarce ammo placement (again in higher difficulties), and harder enemies make stealth sometimes not just an option but a necessity. True, it can be a bit cumbersome trying to sneak around 8 guards without having them see or hear you, but that's what this game is all about - The challenge of remaining undetected. The lack of Open world maps rather than separate parts that require loading (Eg. Hengsha) is my only complaint about this game.In conclusion - 9.5 / 10. Definitely a worthy game to buy and not just when it's on sale given you like these type of games.			"

												This is, without a doubt, one of the greatest games in existence.  Now, I don't know what's up with my playing time counter up there, but I assure you it's wrong.  While I've only played through the Director's Cut version of the game once on PC (also once on PS3), I played through the original at least half a dozen times.  It really IS that good.  The only con I have against it it is that, as good as it is, it's not as good as the original Deus Ex, surpassing it only in graphics.Deus Ex: HR is a first person stealth/action RPG.  The key word here is choice.  Pretty much every choice you make has a consequence that changes how the story plays out (save for the endings, which are chosen at the last stage) and how your character develops.  The game pretty much allows you to play it how you prefer.  Whether you want to go guns blazing, move like a ghost where no one can see you or just knock out everyone you run into, you can.  Though there's no denying the game rewards slightly better a stealthy approach, anything is possible.The cyberpunk sci-fi futuristic setting is gorgeous.  You play as Adam Jensen, an ex-cop whose body is brutalized in a terrorist attack and ends up having to be turned into a cyborg to survive.  Augmentations, as the game calls them, are both popular and hated among the populace, but Adam's are bleeding-edge tech that allows him to do stuff normal people can't, like punch through walls, turn momentarily invisible or be inmune to toxic gas.  I really can't say much without ruining the experience, so I won't.If you've only played the regular version and want to know what the Director's Cut does, is this: it makes the previously terribly snuck-in boss battles being able to be won without the use of guns, it integrates all DLC right into the story and it corrects a few bugs, while very slightly improving the graphics.  It's the perfect DE:HR experience.			"

												Having never played another game of the Deus Ex franchise so far, I can't get into detail about how this game is different than the original HR one, or how better/worse it is compared to the first ones.BUT!!If you are looking for an amazing stealth based game, with a nice plot, well developed characters, extensivelly thought out backstory and general badassness, search no more. I would definitely recommend this game, but keep in mind these thhings:-if you are  the kind of person that prefers storming into bases while riding an elephant and waving a bazooka around , you might have some trouble here 3:) The game does give you deadly takedown options, and has a variety of weapons -not too extensive but overall sufficient- used to kill, but firing a single bullet can cause troops of enemies to sudenly appear, and let me tell you, they are highly accurate, and your reloading takes a while, so you're better off silently stunning them or looking around for other possible ways. This game rewards you overall for being stealthy, with XP, bonuses, etc, but I for some people it can be really frustrating, sneaking away without killing that one annoying soldier xDBoss fights on the other hand require ""open-field"" fighting...Hacking and stealthing around could get you somewhere but you need to actively fight them to proceed.-The replayability factor is imo about average, but with the new game+ option you can keep your augmentations (aka skills) in the new game. Especially helpful if aiming for achievements. The game took me around 55 hours to finish.-If you're more of the ""I'm here for the story"" type, you might find the ending kinda disappointing. I enjoyed the game overall so I didnt mind it THAT much, but, well...Other than that the game is perfect, and since I got it on sale I can easily say this was the best 5$ I ever spent!!			"

												I'm gonna start off with a bit of background. Deus Ex was a franchise originally started in 2000. It was quite revolutionary for games at that time (no pun intended.) Mainly because, at that time there were mainly linear games. Then along came Deus Ex, introducing stealth mechanics that many games didn't have. Such as enemies able to hear you drop items and such.                                                                                                                                                                                             Anyways, than along came Deus Ex: Invisible War. Which was quite a terrible game. (Hardly any choices, basically a shadow of it's former self.) It was released in 2003. So it was likely rushed.                                                                       In 2007 Deus Ex: Human Revolution was announced under the title ""Deus Ex 3."" After years of anticipation, there was finally news about it and it was named ""Deus Ex: Human Revolution."" Now when it first came out it was praised for it's choices, however there was a slight controversy over the ending. Because at the end you just push a button and watch an ending. However I found it rather thought provoking. Anyways, Directors Cut fixes many problems the orignial base game had. (Linear boss fights and such)                                                                                                                            8.5/10.			"

												I've played this game before a few years ago when it came out. For those who are looking forward to buying it, go ahead, the game is amazing. It's kind of a mix between Hitman and Splinter Cell. You can choose to go stealth or guns blazing, of course it depends on how you want to play it. The story is good, and the takedowns on enemies make the game worth your time. It's just a shame that after all this time, support for 21/9 monitors is still not available. I've tried to make this game run on 21/9 but it gives me black bars on the sides, which kinda ruins the experience.			"

												This game is what a sequel to one of the best games ever made is done right. The story is great and staying true to Deus Ex, Gameplay while not as open as the original is still good, the music is beautiful, characters are memorable and fun, dialouge is well written and interesting. It's sad the followup to this was Mankind Divided but I always have this and the original to remember and love.			"

												I've played original Deus Ex few times since it's release. This is really great game, almost like Mass Effect although it's an stealth-FPS. It's worth every penny spent on it although the durectors cut should be released as a patch not another game to earn money. There is no way not to enjoy this game! Still I'm glad they've released improved game with improved graphics and gave huge discounts for those who own the game with all dlc's.			"

												It's got a lot going for it ... but sadly, it just doesn't cut it for me.While the graphics are great, and the game is deep with interesting concepts ... I couldn't bring myself to enjoy it. First off, it takes WAY to long to earn XP points. I could only upgrade my perks once after playing for 4 hours. Despite not killing a soul, I didn't get much out of it apart from a few 'good jobs' and it was soon forgotten.The story itself, despite filled with detail ... doesn't have my full interest. The mechanics are a bit sloppy and the NPCs are dumb as bricks during stealth missions. They remind me of the ones in Skyrim that easily forget about you and lose sight of you all to quickly which broke the immersion for me. The maps themselves are annoying to explore and I just again.. wasn't having to much fun. So I will give this game a pass. Up to you if you'd like to try it out.			"

												The Deus Ex games are among my all time favorites!  The original Deus Ex: Human Revolution was awesome, so I can't wait to see what they've done with the director's cut -- just started playing it and so far, so good!The most obvious change is that they changed the maps to the boss fights.  I won't go into specifics because I don't want to be a spoiler.  But it plays well so far.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Deus Ex: Human Revolution and its directors cut counterpart is a game developed by Eidos Montreal and published by Square Enix and is a reboot to the classic stealth franchise of the same nameThe main character is Adam Jensen, head of security in the company Sarif Industries, which during the attack is badly wounded and is rescued thanks to the numerous operations and body modifications.Deus Ex: Human Revolution is an immersive if somewhat deep in gameplay and open-ended FPS RPG involving conspiracy, international conflict, human dilemmas, spying people's emails, choice and dialogue makingIt is truly an amazing game. The level of detail, the graphics, the storyline and hardly and bugs/glitches throughout the whole gameThe only ""big"" problem with the directors cut version is the integrated DLC. While it's a well made and lengthy expansion that tries to innovate, it feels like it's measnt to be played after the main story and the way it's just tacked in there will cause a substantial difficulty-spike first time throughThe gameplay is great and you can finish the game while killing everyone or completely anybody while passing near them. This production is brilliant, it offers a great story, a lot of nice and diffrent locations, incredible soundtrack and interesting charactersThe game is definitely set to silent approach. Shooting using a guns is ok but it is not so cool. According to me, this is a brilliant title that offers a lot and is pretty well made stealth game. This title is a definitely worth of our timeThat said, you can't get much more polished and enjoyable AAA stealth gameplay this cheap! RECOMMENDED :)  "

												A revolutionary (no pun intended) hybrid of FPS and RPG. Also, and more interestingly, it's a cyberpunk, technologically-focused future story driven by themes of transhumanism and memory implantation. This is a great game that not only challenges players in a variety of FPS goals and objectives, but also invites players to consider the human soul, its worth, and the good and bad actions of man's Way.

												This game has a compelling atmosphere. From the very beginning, the music played when we launch the game makes us feel flung into its world. As a result however, it does make any disappointment a very frustrating experience.It is an excellent game nonetheless. For the reason I just mentioned: the atmosphere is so compelling it reminds me of the first time I played Half-Life 1. We really feel like we are Adam Jensen and we have responsabilities. When I failed to save someone in some parts of the game, I really felt it was my fault. Talking about the music, the intro music is even so good I suffer pain quitting the game or loading a save. Characters are endearing. Jensen's personality isn't extremely original, but still is extremely convicing, as for all the other characters in the game : Sarif, Malik…But this game as awesome also because it has a broad gameplay well made in every aspect. Hacking, stealth, combat, debate, exploration, side quests, deciding your ameliorations and weapons : it's impressive a game can have so many different gameplay aspect yet excels at each one. It is fun and really simple to handle.Now, as I said, this game isn't perfect. I encountered a few bugs : sometimes, a 2 second part of a music was looping, the game has frequently lags, it has also minor bugs with shadows and water effects, it also happened rarely though that the game simply stopped working. The radgoll is also rarely very buggy. Once, I tried to hide a body, but for unknown reasons he got stuck in the floor, so I couldn't move it, and the other guards noticed it. Or another time, a body I was hiding as well just roused itself from me and landed just before a guard. That was annoyng :p But bugs did not alter the overall game's experience. The same can't really be said for the other big problems of this game. Because it feels so real, any disapointment is extremely frustrating.Let's talk about side quests : There is one character, not linked with the game's plot at all, who has a very endealling personality. You can help her getting out of an extremely bad situation. However, as soon as you do, you won't see her anymore. She disappears without explanation. Side quest is done. As if you only saved her because you're completionist and have to do all side quests. There's that other character who has a very big problem as well. When you finished helping, and if you come back to speak to her, she just talks like a decoration NPC, saying ""thanks"" while looking at her Iphone or whatever. Such aspects of the game should have been more worked. I do as many side quests as I can and I feel really flung into them, for that reason it really makes me feel those aspects of the game are botched.Now the ending : I found it weak. I'm not talking about the story, but how they made the ending. Adam Jensen has a choice to make. I only tested two choices, and they're dispaointing. For two reasons. The first it that it only gets us to see a video made of real videos (which doesn't fit at all with the game and seems to be botched) where Adam Jensen is reading a pupil's dissertation, quoting Albert Einstein like any dumbass do (I'm sorry if you do, but let's admit it, it's as stupid as mentioning the nazis in a debate, as I just did in some ways :/ ).The second reason is going to spoil :  we can choose to tell the truth about the augmentations problem. I made this choice at first because I thought making up accusations against the humanity front without any proves could be uncovered and because there would be no ways any augmentation incident could result in the world definitely rejecting the augmentation technology. Nothing could lead to that in my opinion. It's also the opinion of the scientist who worked with the Deus Ex team. Yet, in this game, if you decide to tell the truth, Adam speaks as if you made this choice because technology is bad and that the choice you made will prevent humans from making the error of using augmentations and  technology again. First, I don't think there could be any benefits rejecting technology. Lastly, it's impossible. Humans will never reject technology. "

« Get that♥♥♥♥♥♥outta my face, 'fore I shove it up yo'♥♥♥♥♥.»- Random pedestrian in Detroit, sharing his valuable opinionDeus Ex: Human Revolution is the long-anticipated prequel to the legendary game from 2000 and kind of an attempt to please both newcomers to series and connoisseurs of the first Deus Ex.I played the first Deus Ex before and while I don't think it's the greatest PC game ever made (like many proclaimed before me), I still do find it excellent. It was an innovative mix of stealth, FPS action, hacking and conspiracy theories, garnished with a great level design and a memorable electronic soundtrack. Then Invisible War hit the market in 2003 - more or less well received by players who were new to series, but not really appreciated by fans of the first game (to put it mildly).A few years passed, and meanwhile Eidos Interactive was taken over by Square Enix. The new studio in Montreal planned to make good use of the strong IP that the old Eidos left behind, so soon later a new Deus Ex was already in the making.Human Revolution takes place 20 years before the events of the original Deus Ex, in a world where mechanical augmentation of the human body is in great demand; but also highly debated. You play as Adam Jensen, a former SWAT-cop who now works as the security chief of Sarif, one of the world's biggest biotech corporations. After a mysterious terrorist attack on the company Adam Jensen gets fatally wounded and some villains seem to have kidnapped his ex-girlfriend. His life is saved though by his own employer, who installs state-of-the-art augmentations into his body. It's now up to the player to find out more about the motives of the mysterious attackers and the whereabouts of his ex-girlfriend. It's needless to say that things get pretty hairy during his journey around the world...So did Eidos Montreal manage at the end to satisfy both newcomers and fans of the series? I think yes, hell yeah. Many features from the first game were gracefully re-imagined in Human Revolution, even if some of them are missing (like the legendary Spy Drone). Like in the first game you can choose to take either the peaceful way of handling the story or instead being the trigger-happy FPS fella. You don't like finding secret entrances through air vents? Then simply punch a hole into the weak wall. You feel mercy for your enemies and you want to spare their lives? Simply calm them down with your tranquilizer rifle or sneak around them. Like in the first game you can look out for main and side quests, and how you solve them it's completely up to you. Big time amount of replay value.The different augmentations can turn out pretty useful, at some points of the game they are even badly needed. Especially if you intend to take the stealth path or to reach secret areas you almost depend on them. Looking through walls, jumping from enormous hights or being able to see through the intentions of your conversation partners can come in quite handy.Of course not every aspect of Human Revolution is spotless. The level design, while still solid in its base, isn't as widespread and complex as in Deus Ex 1. Especially the sewers in Detroit and Hengsha look pretty repetitive and bland. Also the many hacking sections can get pretty annoying, especially if all what you get are some trivial emails for the umpteenth time. You'll hack a lot in this game, if not too much. Also the last sections of the game aren't as challenging and spectacular as I've expected - Ion Storm did definitely a better job in 2000.But apart from these points I really enjoyed this title and you can easily spend some 40 hours into it. Originally I haven't expected the game to be that good, despite its minor flaws. Explore the dark corners of the Mega-Metropolis Hengsha, discover many references and hints to the first game or try to beat the game in different ways. There's a lot to do and see in Human Revolution.The Good:+ Flawless presentation+ Atmospheric soundtrack+ Interesting stealth and combat+ Augmentations+ Solid story+ Overall a worthy prequel to the originalThe Bad:- Level design sometimes bland- Repetitive hacking- Final section of the game not so spectacularEither way, for the most rewarding and authentic experience I suggest to play Human Revolution with the most difficult settings and without any ingame help features as well. Also remember that there's always still another option for solving a problem in this fantastic game - consider all scenarios.9/10«Oh, and by the way, Jensen? I know you have gone through a lot of physical changes as of late, but you didn't become a woman. Stay out of the ladies restroom.»- Frank Pritchard			"

 Dues Ex:HRDC  is a solid 9.5.DEHRDC offers amazing gameplay with a story filled with amazing cinematics,difficult choices,and top notch voice acting.It's an awesome FPS and RPG at the same damn time.The game follows former SWAT member Adam Jensen, who's now equipped with cybernetic limbs.You can upgrade his various tools in order to gain advantages through out the game.The game itself is split into different areas.Sneaking is crucial in order to survive.Just 'cause you play a robocop,doesn't mean you're invincible.The story will be decided by various choices and side quests you finish.The only problem I could find is that the framerate drops from time to time. TL;DR: Buy this game right now 9.5/10  "

												It's not a bad game, and I did enjoy it while I was playing... But after I beat the game, I felt like it was a bit unfinished.The story revolves around you being nearly killed then being turned into a cyborg.What I remember the story was supposed to be about was the tension between cyborgs and normal people, what I got was a revenge story about you hunting your girlfriend's killers... Then ends with cyborg vs normal people.The game is supposed to be a mixture of FPS, RPG, and stealth... but they all feel unfinished.---FPS:The camera switched between first and third person, based on if you're leaned against a wall. This is disorienting at first, but you get used to it.The shooting mechanics feel off. You can enter iron sights, only if you're in first person view. So, if you're using cover you have to use the reticle to aim.There is a small variety of weapons, giving you free choice on how to approach a situation, but I started the game with a pistol and that's what I used throughout the entire game.I carried a silenced sniper rifle with me throughout, and used it maybe 5 times. The combat is very in your face.There is a nice ability to beat down an enemy when they get too close, and it does have very nice animations associated with it.The controls for PC were awkward. Iron sights, crouching, and sprinting are all toggle with no option to change this, and I often fumbled with switching between cover.---Stealth:I can't help but compare this to Metal Gear Solid. I loved the stealth mechanics in MGS, not so much in Deus Ex.You can hide behind walls or inside vents... but that's pretty much the extent of stealth.There is a cloaking ability that you can learn, but it only lasts long enough to rush through a small room, or perhaps across a hallway.There isn't an easy way to distract guards. The only way I found to make noise was to shoot a silenced weapon at a wall.There are no places to hide and there are no items that help with stealth. (noise making grenades, traps, etc)Enemies stay unconscious forever, which is nice, and will be woken up if found by another guard. So hiding bodies is recommended.The guards themselves have simple patrol paths, but there is usually so many guards that it makes it near impossible to get around them all without the cloaking ability.Most of my stealth encounters ended up in a gun fight.---RPG:Deus Ex talks itself up a lot for giving you a choice in how to approach the game. ""Play your way.""The issue with this is that the abilities are very much FPS based.Everyone needs it:Hacking allows you to unlock security locks and computers, which gives you lore and access codes to make it easier to get through the missions.But hacking is either completely necessary or completely unnecessary... You will run into security locks throughout the entire game. If you don't research hacking, you will miss out on weapons, ammo, money, experience, etc.But, since they want to offer you a choice in everything, you never need to be a strong hacker to finish the storyline. There is always an alternative route.Stealth players:There is the cloaking ability and silent moving for stealth players.Cloaking doesn't last very long, and you still make a lot of noise when moving, so you must have both cloaking and silent moving to be effective.There is also the ability to see the enemies' vision cones and see how far sound is travelling (though I never found that one useful)You can learn to see through walls, but I never put any points into this, as the radar is perfectly fine for telling where the enemy is and where they're looking.Action players:Most of the other abilities.Take more damage, better recoil handling, prevent status effectsThe rest of the abilities are more about exploring, which falls back into more... weapons, ammo, money, experience, etc.So from an RPG aspect, there is a very minor class archetype, then everything else is pretty much, if you don't learn it, you miss out.---Deus Ex also talks up the choice between killing and not killing. This doesn't effect the story, though people will use different dialog when speaking to you.The problem I have with this system is how it's divided on abilities and weapons. There are very few non-lethal weapons, and they don't make it easy to use them.There is a short range taser, a sniper rifle that shoots tranquilizer darts (single shot, very long reload time and most enemies are near each other so timing is very important), very few grenades, and a air gun of sorts for crowds (that I never used)The only other options would be to outright avoid combat (less exp) or stick with ""takedowns"" which are essentially stealth kills. When using a takedown, you can choose lethal or non-lethal.Lethal is louder, alerting other enemies, offers less exp, and uses the same button, but you must hold the button down instead of just tapping it. (making it a bit more cumbersome to use)So, there is no point in using a lethal takedown.My choice was to use non-lethal takedowns when convenient, and if I got into a fight, shoot everyone dead.--------------So, overall... I enjoyed the game while I was playing it. It took up a few days of my time. But I didn't feel like it was very good.The story lacked depth, the combat was ok, and the promise of choose your own style fell short.			"

												Base game is solid but the Directors Cut doesn't warrant enough changes to play it because of the way it shoves in the dlc/Missing Link, it tries to fix up the boss battles a bit but with the way the game is designed they'd have to retool the whole system to fix them. Just play the base version, the pacing is much better and doesn't have The Missing Link. But if you weren't lucky enough to get the base version then I guess just play this cause it's still a great game. Enjoy Missing Link when you get to it :^) "

The level of detail, the graphics, the storyline and hardly and bugs/glitches throughout the whole gameThe only ""big"" problem with the directors cut version is the integrated DLC.

												An absolute masterpiece, honestly one of the best games I've ever played, hands down, I can't possibly recommend this game anymore. The story is amazing, it always keeps you on your toes with twists and turns, and choices DO matter, not as much as they may matter in other games, but they still matter enough to be remotely satisfying. The stealth is brilliantly crafted, and very fun, and I don't even like stealth games. The combat is great as well. There are so many different weapons, and there is so much freedom with how you want to tackle your enemies, whether they live, or die. I'm sad the game is over, but I'm excited to pick it up again soon, with New Game+. 9/10			"

												I'm lucky I only paid $5 for this craptastic game.  Other than the graphics, there's nothing great about this game. Mediocre plot mixed with terrible controls and physics.  The last straw that made me write this review was that I just died after blowing a full 5 rounds with a magnum dead center on an enemy and it was as if I was shooting blanks.  The aiming is god awful and back in my day head shots actually did damage. As for the ""stealth"" killing aspect, it has been done and was even better in the Metal Gears which were like 10+ years before this game.  This game would be like Tenchu: Stealth Assasins but you get ranged weapons that miss like 90% of the time regardless of where you aim.  It is so bad that you can have an enemy walk into a doorway and you can blast your shot gun point blank and still miss.  It is so bad that this is the only game on Steam I have ever written a review for in hopes that no one ever buys this game again.			"

												A revolutionary (no pun intended) hybrid of FPS and RPG. Also, and more interestingly, it's a cyberpunk, technologically-focused future story driven by themes of transhumanism and memory implantation.

												Even after years, this game remained one of my alltime favorites. Deus Ex: Human Revolution in the director's cut brings the base game and the DLC ""the missing link"" together in one game and delivers a good connection between the two content packages.With 3 different difficulties and even a new game + mode, this game also offers different ways to progress through the story with a lethal and also a pacifist playstyle. I just finished my pacifist run and was surprised in a positive way how the game supports my choice to finish the game, in being not too difficult and still holding my tension through choosing the right augmentations and the right time to activate them to continue unseen. Sometimes direct combat is still necessary so keep watching for ammo for the stun gun!Only thing I dislike is that there is no option to not kill the bosses in this game, but with the new director's cut  there are some more possibilites than just pure combat.Other than that, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is after all a great game, bringing up big questions about augmentations and the human nature, without being too pretentious.

												More game, better bosses, and less yellow. It's still amazing that this game somehow escaped being just another classic IP completely ruined by foolish publishers.One solid look at this game will show it was made by fans for fans who actually meant what they said about loving everything that made the original great, it also manages to marry common console gimmicks like cover and regenerating health into an enjoyable experience. Every obstacle can be over come in so many different ways and the xp/praxis system is an ideal compromise of the original Deus Ex's skill system and Invisible War's over simplification of augmentations. Callbacks, shout outs, and little details that refer to the original help cement this game's ties to Deus Ex while maintaining its own plotline dealing with transhumanisim and the ethics behind augmentation, this game wasn't just an excuse by Eidos to try to grab cash, it's a worthy prequel to one of the best games ever designed and it's been made that much better by dealing with the problems the original release had while integrating The Missing Link into one large seamless experience.

It also includes all of the DLC for the original version in one seamless package. If you are going to buy any version of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, you'd be a fool not to buy this version.My original review of Deus Ex: Human Revolution:This is seriously one of the most immersive games I've ever played. Take away the incredible stealth and shooting mechanics and what do you have? You're still left with a fantastic story, an extremely interesting world of technology and controversy to fully immerse yourself in, and some pretty damn sleek visuals.			"

												This game was a huge disappointment for me. A Deus Ex game should have delivered a great story with nefarious conspiracies, and game objectives that could be completed in multiple ways. In this game the story makes absolutely no sense, the biggest ""conspiracy"" is that television lies, you barely discover anything about the organizations and the people behind the events, the whole augmentation debate is discussed on kindergarten-level, and the ending is mind-meltingly stupid. I could write an entire book about how badly written this game is. It's true that multiple playstyles are supported, but there is an optimal one that is heavily favored by the game rules: stay undetected, use only nonlethal melee takedowns (yes, this game is not a shooter), and hack everything. If you follow the optimal style, all weapons, ammo, and weapon mods are useless (take the laser rifle to the last boss though), all health-restoring items are useless, and there is no difference between the difficulty levels either, because every enemy goes down with a single button press. The only difficulty is finding the correct order of taking down the guards without alerting the remaining ones, but thanks to the rtarded patrol routes it's usually quite easy. I could list the flaws in the game mechanics for pages, but it's tl;dr anyway. The boss fights are often criticized for being out-of-place, but the real issue is that the boss characters have no part in the story other than appearing as an obstacle at a certain point. Overall, this game is not completely awful, for example, the dialog challenges are interesting, the hacking minigame is nice, the visual design is impressive, and I liked some of the side-quests. My biggest grief is that for lots of people this is The Deus Ex Game, while in reality both its predecessors were vastly superior in almost every way. Oh, and why does the DC version occupy twice the disk space as the original release?Edit: I watched the developer commentaries on youtube, and it's mind-numbing how incompetent and clueless they are (except for the sound designer guy).Edit 2: I watched some steam broadcasts, and it turns out most people play this game like CoD. Disappointing.			"

												I'm a big fan of the Deus Ex series. Human Revolution was a really worthy return to the Cyberpunk series. However I can't recommend this release at all. It's nothing more than an outsourced poorly realized package. Design choices in terms of the lighting were completely thrown out as just one example, another is just how incredibly buggy it is.The lighting that I refer to was a ""gold"" tint of perhaps Jensen's augmentations in first person and even indicative perhaps of a ""new renaissance"" thematically. This was in promotional footage, cases etc. There are other visual differences but this is the biggest. They completely ignored the original teams aesthetics and choices.If you were an unlucky soul that happened to have a PC which had both a dedicated and integrated video card the game wouldn't even launch. Nvidia users that the game actually worked for also reported unplayable performance on a wide variety of GPUs.The ""Director's Cut"" label is nothing more than a marketing con. It was outsourced and it shows with design choices of the original team ignored to the quality of the release altogether. I will treasure my original PS3 copy even more now due to the original release no longer being available on steam as this is not a definitive Deus Ex release, not even close.Edit/ This AWESOME person has made a small mod using Sweetfx making it possible to return HR a little to what it was. http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/719090-deus-ex-human-revolution-directors-cut/67658785 Doesn't fix everything but it is very welcome as I'm sure it is by a lot of other people.

												Not as clever as it thinks it is.  Story, graphics and world building are superb, but it just takes *forever* for anything to happen.  Play-any-way-you-like as long as it's stealth is also kind of off-putting.  Also, it's actually pretty linear.  Probably would've worked better as a series of discreet levels.

												To save his life, the fundamental choice of whether or not to become augmented with cybernetics has been removed from Adam Jensen's life. Driven by the conviction of never having a choice taken from him again and using his newfound power, his need for answers will unravel the truth behind a conspiracy rooted in the foundation of the world around him as it incites a new revolution.Deus Ex: Human Revolution follows up on the critically acclaimed Deus EX and Deus Ex: Invisible War as the the third game in the strategic sci-fi action series. When a black ops team breaks in and kills the scientists Adam were hired to protect as a guard of one of America's most experimental biotechnology firms, everything you thought you knew about your job changes. At a time when scientific advancements are routinely turning athletes, soldiers and spies into super-enhanced beings, someone is working very hard to ensure mankind's evolution follows a particular path. You need to discover why -- because the decisions you take and the choices you make will be the only things that can determine mankind's future.			"

												This is one of the best games i've ever played, thankfully one of my friends convinced me to get all the other deus ex games when i got mankind divided, anyways...The shooter aspect in this game is better then any other fps game i've seen. The cover system is pretty wonky using mouse and keyboard but thats fine, i've had worse. The use of the cover system when trying to be stealthy is also amazing. I always try to be stealthy in this game even though i really suck at it. It feels so good to get that Ghost pop up when you finish a mission. The hacking part in this game is pretty cool too, thought later in the game it just gets too easy and tedious in my opinion. The story with the choices you make during it with certain people is phenomenal, I haven't seen such unique facial expressions either, this game nails it in to you for what the person you're talking too feels. Another factor that I love is the inventory system, I haven't played a game in a long time that uses that type of system and it is my favorite out of any. Makes it seeem at least somewhat realistic in my sense. The only problem i've had so far is some audio glitches when you hold your gun up to someone and try to talk to them. This game earned a full 100% or whatever out of me.			"

												Astonishing cyberpunk experience with rather distinct vibes from movies like Blade Runner and Robocop. Easily one of my favorite games of all time. Gameplay is enjoyable and unique and the story isn't bad either, in fact it has a quite deep meaning. The game deals with fairly heavy themes like what it means to be a human, is self controlled evolution right, is controlling and manipulating masses necessarily evil and does our advancement in technology allow the discrimination of those who can't afford the newest conveniences. Human Revolution leans heavily on stealth, which can be frustrating for those who are used to more action packed approach, as the game practically punishes the player if he decides to go guns blazing into the action. All in all I would recommend this game for those who enjoy stealth games and the cyberpunk setting. Also someone who finds enjoyment in conspiracy theories might find this game interesting, but then again I'm not going to spoil anything! Just see it for youself.			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a masterpiece of a game. The AI may not be very good, but the theme, story, and lore that is vibrant throughout the streets of Detroit and other areas you visit in the year 2027 is great to take in. You play as Adam Jensen, an ex-cop working security for Sarif Industries, a human augmentation company. After you are attacked, you recieve augmentations that make you almost super human, and it's accompanied by RPG style leveling and upgrades that make you stonger, carry more, hack easier, jump higher etc... The gameplay is fun, and you have the choice of dealing with your enemies lethally or non-lethally. Both of which are satisfying. The gunplay works, the stealth is sorta strange, as it's a little too easy because of somewhat dumb AI. But all in all, if you like games like this, you will love this game and probably replay it at least once. Not to mention the directors cut, featuring a standalone DLC tie in to the actual game, which is an improvement. The developer logs are also a nice touch, as well as the reworked bosses. I highly recommend this game.			"

												Some ridiculous bugs owing to this being based on the unpatched version of the original game, support has since been abandoned and it's a damn shame.I will not be recommending this as despite the much-improved boss fights and the inclusion of the DLC, buggy games and lazy devs should not under any circumstances be encouraged in my opinion.If you can't get a hold of the original though, this'll do, there's a reason HR succeeded in reviving the series and if you're a Deus Ex virgin then it's never too late to get started.Get the first game and play it through first though.

												Until EM fixes the game-breaking bugs towards the end of the game, I can't recommend a purchase. That's a shame, because this is an otherwise solid game.After completing 95% of the game with no issues, I experienced endless CTDs at various parts throughout the last level. After save-scumming my way to the VERY LAST ROOM (after beating the last boss) at the end of a week-long Pacifist playthrough, I find I can't enter the room and actually complete the game. No matter what options I try or features I disable, the game reliably crashes every time I step into it. From what I can see, there is no known fix to this problem outside of restoring to an earlier save, and the problem has been known since at least 2013.			"

												Deus Ex Human Revolution is a great game - a great game with an awful last act, one that brings down the rest of the game with it.  The DLC was ""okay"", but not essential by any stretch of the imagination.The Director's Cut is a mess.First of all, the performance. In the original, standalone game, there were initially some performance issues - periodic frame hiccups when the game streams area data if you were lucky, low framerate across the board if you weren't.  They fixed this, and the standalone game runs beautifully now.  The Directors Cut is not based on the most recent version, like you would expect.  The awful framerate and obnoxious frame hiccups are back, and it doesn't look like Squeenix has any intention of fixing this.There are some registry settings you can change to make the performance ""better"", but if you've already got the original version (which is, sadly, no longer sold), there's virtually no reason to bother with the Director's Cut.  All the Director's Cut does is cram the game, the pre-order garbage, and the DLC together haphazardly, and gives you a few more options against the bosses.  The latter addition is very much welcome, as you can actually focus on a non-combat build if you'd like now, but the former makes the concept of a ""build"" even more laughably irrelevant.  The original game had this problem where, after a certain point, you're so stocked with abilities that there is nothing off limits to you.  A bad fighter isn't forced to hack - because you're a killing machine.  And a bad hacker isn't forced to fight - because you're a hax0r par excellence.  Plus you can jump around and throw dumpsters and go invisible.  It defeats the purpose of the game's open-ended design, where your ability choices will be helpful in some situations and a liability in others, so that you try and find a way to avoid those disadvantageous situations.  Since they duct taped the DLC on, this problem is even worse.  Yes, you still lose all your equipment and abilities at the start of the DLC, but at the end you get all your equipment back and a load of praxis equalling the amount you entered the DLC area with, meaning by the end of the game you're completely maxed out.  It makes the Singapore area a joke, and it makes the final area...  well, the final area is completely worthless any way you slice it.Deus Ex Human Revolution is one of the better big budget AAA games of the last several years - it has its issues, but it's definitely worth playing.  The Director's Cut is not.  Avoid.			"

												Technology is a double-edged sword. While it provides us with many benefits, in a way it also causes mankind to become divided. Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a game which questions mature themes such at this, and delivers an amazing story complemented by satisfying and fun gameplay, providing players with choices that determine the how the game plays out, giving us control over the game world that other game rarely provide. Let me go into detail below.  As hinted a while ago, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is set in the future, 2027 to be exact. In this age, technology has advanced to the stage where humans can implement technology into their own bodies, to change and supposedly ""improve"" one's capabilities. These are called augmentations, and usually replace parts of our body. The discovery and invention of augmentations by celebrated scientist Hugh Darrow has caused much conflict among mankind: some think that augmentations are very useful for humans, as augmentations such as retinal augs and neural augmentations can make life very convenient for us; others, however, think that augmentations take away our humanity, and binding of flesh and metal is against our very own human nature. In the game, you play as Adam Jensen, an ex-Swat with a troubled past, who gets hired by Sarif Industries, one of the leading developers of augmentations, as a security guard. However, a mysterious group of augmented mercenaries attack Sarif Industries headquarters, killing many scientists and badly injuring Jensen. Against his will, Jensen is subjected to extensive augmentation to rebuild his body, giving him new and powerful abilities, but causing him a certain extent of mental scarring. Back on his feet with the new augmentations, he is tasked with investigating the attack and finding the people behind it, eventually uncovering a conspiracy that is not only against Sarif Industries, but the whole world. The game has a very strong premise, and it takes many twists and turns which I cannot divulge here, as it would ruin the experience. The best way to experience the story is if you have almost no clue about the plot, since the surprises had a much bigger impact on me that way. The story is able to surprise the player many times, and it is able to explore themes such as whether progress is truly for the greater good. Characters and dialogue are all very well-done and thought-out, and the game contains many memorable characters that each have motives that are neither black or white.  A big part of this game is choice: you have a choice on many aspects of the game, which all influence the outcomes of situations and the ending of the game, as well as the attitude NPCs in the game will have towards you. Your playstyle is one of the major choices you have to make; the game supports both loud and stealthy playstyles, and you can also incorporate a bit of both, like I did for most playthroughs. The stealth in this game is pretty basic, and you cannot lure enemies with noise or anything like a lot of stealth game; as long as you stay out of enemies’ line of sight, and stay away from cameras and sentry guns, you can remain undetected. For a loud playstyle, the game becomes pretty much Call of Duty and every other first person action shooter ever. The game, however, seems to encourage stealthy approaches more, as seen from NPC reactions and overall outcomes, as well as giving more XP for stealthy approaches. Despite this slight bias, I think that the game is very open and allows the player a lot of freedom. Through a few playthroughs of different scenarios, I found that many missions can have lots of different approaches, and countless different outcomes depending on how you play.  And that brings me to the skill tree in this game, known in-game as augmentations. XP is earned by doing actions such as discovering secret areas, performing takedowns, killing enemies, completing quests and being able to persuade someone in a conversation. Once you have enough XP, you are rewarded with Praxis points (which are basically just skill points), which you can use to buy augmentations. These skills are all generally useful and fun to use, but many are evidently meant to be used in certain playstyles. For example, the hacking skills are best used in stealth playthroughs, since by hacking, you can deactivate cameras and sentry guns, and also gain access codes or even gain entry to alternate paths. Alternatively, armor strengthening skills are more ideal for loud playthroughs, as they allow you to hold on longer in firefights. Since you have limited points, you must choose wisely, and forces players to use critical thinking and tactics during gameplay. I like this type of style, since you won't be blindly blundering into an area and firing at everything, but instead thinking about approaches and planning strategies. Because it is impossible to just enter a room and kill everything. Like I said, the game seems to support stealth more, as enemies can have a ton of health and even at medium difficulty, Jensen may only be able to survive a couple of shots. The game forces you to think, which is a good point in my opinion. However, while for the most part, the game seems to be stealth-oriented, you are forced into combat in several unnecessary boss fights. Boss fights are really one of the biggest negative points of this game, as they are unavoidable. Sure, the Director's cut allows you to use stealth to an extent during the bosses, but you are ultimately forced into direct combat with these bosses, who are all underdeveloped and just cartoonish, with only Namir seeming to have some sort of backstory.  Choices also extend to dialogue choices. In the game, you will interact with several NPCs, who will have information you need or are in a situation you must defuse. Such examples include an NPCs holding a hostage, an NPC threatening to commit suicide and so on. In these situations, your choices will affect the fates to the NPCs, and requires quick thinking and intuition to succeed. Augmentations can also be used to ease this process. Overall, it is a great mechanic in the game and it is interesting to see the various incomes of different attitudes towards them.  The game, while having beautiful architecture and some downright stunning backdrops, as well as atmospheric lighting, the game's graphics are hardly its strong point. Water effects and many character models look dated, and seem as though they walked straight out of a decade-old game. Adam Jensen and a few important NPC character models look amazing at certain angles, but it seems the developers focused on the quality of story and gameplay more. Luckily, the graphics don't detract much from the overall experience, and the game is optimized well enough, maintaining 100 fps or above on my rig.  The Director's Cut Edition includes the DLC, the Missing Link, which is a mandatory part of the game, and feels like a standalone section of its own, detailing a little adventure that Adam has while stowing away on a boat towards the final section. The story is alright, with several plots twists, but it ultimately suffers from a cliched villain and an overall feeling of unnecessity. Backtracking several areas, as well as mostly being forced into stealth, is among the reasons this DLC is overshadowed by the main game. Also, all of your skills and weapons are removed, which takes a lot from the enjoyment. However, it is not as bad as many people say, and is a cool little mission of its own that takes one to two hours to complete, adding a new stunning environment for Jensen to explore, although without the memorable characters of the main game.  Deus Ex: Human Revolution may not be a genre-defining game, but it takes all the great things from modern-day RPGs, combined with a great story, to deliver an amazing and engrossing game, and you owe it to yourself to try it out.

												Hi,Wow, what a game! The beginning seemed as nothing special and I did not have any bigger expectations but what came after totally blew me away. I need to mention that this is my first approach to Deus Ex game.Pros:-	The story has really got my attention – we will see how it develops-	Shooting •	properly difficult – you are out after one head-shot and you do the same to your foes•	very responsive-	Hacking – love the idea-	Dialogue•	feels very natural and the voice acting is really good•	I really like NPCs comments on what you have done (Example: How you are being told off by Pritchard for strolling into ladies rest room  or if you kill too many people your co-workers will judge you.•	Choices given to you during dialogue are straight to the point and I have a feeling they matter-	Inventory -	Levelling up – quite innovative for me at least-	You can shoot and kill friendly npcs/civilians (at least some of them)-	World feels alive with all the talking around and a lot f NPCIn the middle-	Graphics are a bit dated but that isn’t really con for me; this game is dated 2013 on steam but I have a feeling it is a bit older than thatCons:-	The beginning of the game does not impress – feels like just another shooter in which you just go forward and cannot collect almost anything-	Rewards for being stealthy and not killing anyone – Where are the rewards for killing every one of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ alive?-	Save/load every-time-you-like system – this is a bit outdated now, they should have come up with something better like even checkpoints. I do really appreciate save systems like in Diablo, Dark Souls or Lords of the Fallen.-	Sprint does not really feel like a proper sprint at all – protagonist is out of steam after 2 seconds or so. Shouldn’t android be in a better shape?-	Where are the driving cars in the city?My rating: 9/10 so far but I will update the review later onUPDATE:-	After hours of gameplay I must admit that the game starts to disappoints. It all gets repetitive and boring… Levels are very similar with nothing really interesting about them. Now I just changed from “Exploring-every-centimetre-of-the-game” to “rushing-towards-end”. It all  can be displayed on the following diagram:  _/`````\----- (beginning poo, then the middle great and the end not as bad as beginning but really boring) -	Same enemies all over again… -	They give me way more exp for not killing hostiles, so I kill everyone – go with a bang every time-	Perks has got nothing interesting to offer after a while and I almost level up by random-	Side mission as much as they were interesting in first and second chapter from the riots they are really boring-	Enemies are really stupid – I find this issue with every stealth or/and FPS + Great main story – I still play the game to see where is Megan + Hacking is still fun+ Combat is still fast and responsive+ Great cut scenesALL IN ALL: After like 20 hours gameplay I will still recommend the game but I do not longer thing it stands out that much. It has some nice things to offer and is easily enjoyable but my rating drops down quite heavily from 9/10 to 6+/10.			"

												Technology is a double-edged sword. While it provides us with many benefits, in a way it also causes mankind to become divided. Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a game which questions mature themes such at this, and delivers an amazing story complemented by satisfying and fun gameplay, providing players with choices that determine the how the game plays out, giving us control over the game world that other game rarely provide. Let me go into detail below.  As hinted a while ago, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is set in the future, 2027 to be exact. In this age, technology has advanced to the stage where humans can implement technology into their own bodies, to change and supposedly ""improve"" one's capabilities. These are called augmentations, and usually replace parts of our body. The discovery and invention of augmentations by celebrated scientist Hugh Darrow has caused much conflict among mankind: some think that augmentations are very useful for humans, as augmentations such as retinal augs and neural augmentations can make life very convenient for us; others, however, think that augmentations take away our humanity, and binding of flesh and metal is against our very own human nature. In the game, you play as Adam Jensen, an ex-Swat with a troubled past, who gets hired by Sarif Industries, one of the leading developers of augmentations, as a security guard. However, a mysterious group of augmented mercenaries attack Sarif Industries headquarters, killing many scientists and badly injuring Jensen. Against his will, Jensen is subjected to extensive augmentation to rebuild his body, giving him new and powerful abilities, but causing him a certain extent of mental scarring. Back on his feet with the new augmentations, he is tasked with investigating the attack and finding the people behind it, eventually uncovering a conspiracy that is not only against Sarif Industries, but the whole world. The game has a very strong premise, and it takes many twists and turns which I cannot divulge here, as it would ruin the experience. The best way to experience the story is if you have almost no clue about the plot, since the surprises had a much bigger impact on me that way. The story is able to surprise the player many times, and it is able to explore themes such as whether progress is truly for the greater good. Characters and dialogue are all very well-done and thought-out, and the game contains many memorable characters that each have motives that are neither black or white.  A big part of this game is choice: you have a choice on many aspects of the game, which all influence the outcomes of situations and the ending of the game, as well as the attitude NPCs in the game will have towards you. Your playstyle is one of the major choices you have to make; the game supports both loud and stealthy playstyles, and you can also incorporate a bit of both, like I did for most playthroughs. The stealth in this game is pretty basic, and you cannot lure enemies with noise or anything like a lot of stealth game; as long as you stay out of enemies’ line of sight, and stay away from cameras and sentry guns, you can remain undetected. For a loud playstyle, the game becomes pretty much Call of Duty and every other first person action shooter ever. The game, however, seems to encourage stealthy approaches more, as seen from NPC reactions and overall outcomes, as well as giving more XP for stealthy approaches. Despite this slight bias, I think that the game is very open and allows the player a lot of freedom. Through a few playthroughs of different scenarios, I found that many missions can have lots of different approaches, and countless different outcomes depending on how you play.  And that brings me to the skill tree in this game, known in-game as augmentations. XP is earned by doing actions such as discovering secret areas, performing takedowns, killing enemies, completing quests and being able to persuade someone in a conversation. Once you have enough XP, you are rewarded with Praxis points (which are basically just skill points), which you can use to buy augmentations. These skills are all generally useful and fun to use, but many are evidently meant to be used in certain playstyles. For example, the hacking skills are best used in stealth playthroughs, since by hacking, you can deactivate cameras and sentry guns, and also gain access codes or even gain entry to alternate paths. Alternatively, armor strengthening skills are more ideal for loud playthroughs, as they allow you to hold on longer in firefights. Since you have limited points, you must choose wisely, and forces players to use critical thinking and tactics during gameplay. I like this type of style, since you won't be blindly blundering into an area and firing at everything, but instead thinking about approaches and planning strategies. Because it is impossible to just enter a room and kill everything. Like I said, the game seems to support stealth more, as enemies can have a ton of health and even at medium difficulty, Jensen may only be able to survive a couple of shots. The game forces you to think, which is a good point in my opinion. However, while for the most part, the game seems to be stealth-oriented, you are forced into combat in several unnecessary boss fights. Boss fights are really one of the biggest negative points of this game, as they are unavoidable. Sure, the Director's cut allows you to use stealth to an extent during the bosses, but you are ultimately forced into direct combat with these bosses, who are all underdeveloped and just cartoonish, with only Namir seeming to have some sort of backstory.  Choices also extend to dialogue choices. In the game, you will interact with several NPCs, who will have information you need or are in a situation you must defuse. Such examples include an NPCs holding a hostage, an NPC threatening to commit suicide and so on. In these situations, your choices will affect the fates to the NPCs, and requires quick thinking and intuition to succeed. Augmentations can also be used to ease this process. Overall, it is a great mechanic in the game and it is interesting to see the various incomes of different attitudes towards them.  The game, while having beautiful architecture and some downright stunning backdrops, as well as atmospheric lighting, the game's graphics are hardly its strong point. Water effects and many character models look dated, and seem as though they walked straight out of a decade-old game. Adam Jensen and a few important NPC character models look amazing at certain angles, but it seems the developers focused on the quality of story and gameplay more. Luckily, the graphics don't detract much from the overall experience, and the game is optimized well enough, maintaining 100 fps or above on my rig.  The Director's Cut Edition includes the DLC, the Missing Link, which is a mandatory part of the game, and feels like a standalone section of its own, detailing a little adventure that Adam has while stowing away on a boat towards the final section. The story is alright, with several plots twists, but it ultimately suffers from a cliched villain and an overall feeling of unnecessity. Backtracking several areas, as well as mostly being forced into stealth, is among the reasons this DLC is overshadowed by the main game. Also, all of your skills and weapons are removed, which takes a lot from the enjoyment. However, it is not as bad as many people say, and is a cool little mission of its own that takes one to two hours to complete, adding a new stunning environment for Jensen to explore, although without the memorable characters of the main game.  Deus Ex: Human Revolution may not be a genre-defining game, but it takes all the great things from modern-day RPGs, combined with a great story, to deliver an amazing and engrossing game, and you owe it to yourself to try it out.

												Hi,Wow, what a game! The beginning seemed as nothing special and I did not have any bigger expectations but what came after totally blew me away. I need to mention that this is my first approach to Deus Ex game.Pros:-	The story has really got my attention – we will see how it develops-	Shooting •	properly difficult – you are out after one head-shot and you do the same to your foes•	very responsive-	Hacking – love the idea-	Dialogue•	feels very natural and the voice acting is really good•	I really like NPCs comments on what you have done (Example: How you are being told off by Pritchard for strolling into ladies rest room  or if you kill too many people your co-workers will judge you.•	Choices given to you during dialogue are straight to the point and I have a feeling they matter-	Inventory -	Levelling up – quite innovative for me at least-	You can shoot and kill friendly npcs/civilians (at least some of them)-	World feels alive with all the talking around and a lot f NPCIn the middle-	Graphics are a bit dated but that isn’t really con for me; this game is dated 2013 on steam but I have a feeling it is a bit older than thatCons:-	The beginning of the game does not impress – feels like just another shooter in which you just go forward and cannot collect almost anything-	Rewards for being stealthy and not killing anyone – Where are the rewards for killing every one of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ alive?-	Save/load every-time-you-like system – this is a bit outdated now, they should have come up with something better like even checkpoints. I do really appreciate save systems like in Diablo, Dark Souls or Lords of the Fallen.-	Sprint does not really feel like a proper sprint at all – protagonist is out of steam after 2 seconds or so. Shouldn’t android be in a better shape?-	Where are the driving cars in the city?My rating: 9/10 so far but I will update the review later onUPDATE:-	After hours of gameplay I must admit that the game starts to disappoints. It all gets repetitive and boring… Levels are very similar with nothing really interesting about them. Now I just changed from “Exploring-every-centimetre-of-the-game” to “rushing-towards-end”. It all  can be displayed on the following diagram:  _/`````\----- (beginning poo, then the middle great and the end not as bad as beginning but really boring) -	Same enemies all over again… -	They give me way more exp for not killing hostiles, so I kill everyone – go with a bang every time-	Perks has got nothing interesting to offer after a while and I almost level up by random-	Side mission as much as they were interesting in first and second chapter from the riots they are really boring-	Enemies are really stupid – I find this issue with every stealth or/and FPS + Great main story – I still play the game to see where is Megan + Hacking is still fun+ Combat is still fast and responsive+ Great cut scenesALL IN ALL: After like 20 hours gameplay I will still recommend the game but I do not longer thing it stands out that much. It has some nice things to offer and is easily enjoyable but my rating drops down quite heavily from 9/10 to 6+/10.			"

												Never played the original Deus Ex unfortunately because the steam version is all jacked up, but I had a ton of fun with it's prequel... Arguably one of the best games of the decade. Does it have it's flaws? Yes. Does it get repetitive at times? Yes. Do I hate how my choices didn't matter? Yes. Do I still love this game? Yes.Quite a solid game that stood out in 2011, probably would have been game of the year if not for Red Dead Redemption.			"

												TL;DR: Buy this game if you like stealth but not as much stealth as Dishonored or Thief.PROS:-fun and lots of augmentations-feels like a rpg-many ways of beating the game and the levels-side quests-choices matter-the director's cut improves the graphics quite a bit CONS:-not that great of a story-extremely limited areas to explore (Detroit/Shanghai)-slowly turns into an ""I cannot wait for this to be over"" type of game			"

												I love the Deus Ex franchise. The very first game is one of my all time favorite games. And this game is on the same pantheon. I've played through it now four times (3 times on Xbox 360 and currently on the PC) and I still enjoy it immensely. I have never been more immersed in an universe. I could spend the whole game reading just emails to get a glimpse into the life of people I will never meet or see. The gameplay for stealth players is very rewarding and satisifying. For people going the action route might not enjoy the controls and the game doesn't really lend itself to the shooter norm. I can not wait for the Mankind Divided.			"

												This is a great sequel to one of the best games ever (lets pretend invisible war is.....invisible). The augmentation system, voice acting, PC performance and optimization are all delightful. However, the game isn't perfect and definitely has its flaws. The story feels very detached and unimpactful compared to the story of the original. The ending is also nowhere near as exciting as the endings in the previous game. However, I still recommend that you give this game a try.8.5/10			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a really great game with good gameplay and an amazing story. The ""Director's Cut"" additions add the Missing Link DLC and commentary, along with a couple other things. These aren't as great as they could be. The integration and quality of the commentary is a little poor to be honest, and could be better. The commentary is pretty insightful though, but leaves you a little disappointed because a lot of it is talking about how they cut stuff from the game such as Upper Hengsha, a Bangalore city hub, more missions, and lots of other bits and pieces. If you have DX:HR already, you should buy this because it's 5 or 10 dollars (depending if you have Missing Link or not) and why not. If you don't have DX:HR, you should ABSOLUTELY buy this for an amazing game that is still one of my favorites years later.Also, newgame+ is probably going to be one of my favorite features, but I haven't had a chance to try it yet. When you start a new game, you keep your augs from a previous playthrough. Great idea.			"

												From my experiences, this game contains no more bugs than it's original version. Stability is good, but I've experienced a few crashes, but not many (I think 5 or less during my 26 hours of game time).The additional DLC content that comes along with the Directors Cut gave me three more hours of content and tied directly into the campaign (occuring at about the 3/4th point). Human Revolution is an RPG FPS that gives the option of non lethal and stealthy means to complete objectives. There are quite a sidequests, and they all reward well.A great game, just like the original version. If you want more details, reading reviews of the non-Director's Cut edition of the game, or by looking at more reviews for this game. I've seen other people complain of major instability with this version, but I've yet to experience any major concerns.			"

												Ok doing this version was my second time through the game, and well, it was still a fun run.  Getting the ""missing link"" in order does help the story some, as a DLC it was a bit disconnected if you had already gotten past that point in normal game play.  Boss fights were defintily a much easier, but still ""tougher"" fight.  It was kind of fun and nice to be able to employ ""other"" tricks on them instead of just DPS via weapons and granades.Seemed graphics were pumped up for todays machines as well, but could just be me.  If you didn't get through the first once.. or want an excues to play a releativly cheap but fun game.  I definitly give this a thumbs up.			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution is everything that you want from Deus Ex i.e. atmospheric, consequential gameplay, interesting side quests, fantastic soundtrack etc. You chose your path. Every mission can be completed in multiple ways. Exploring your surrounding would also bring joy to you, especially when you find things you haven't seen before. Boss fights, as many have eluded to already, aren't what you expected from a Deus Ex title. If you have played the first game, you know what I am talking about. Director's cut did try and rectify it, but still... The DLC, however, does a good job of showing what the Boss Fights could have been. The RPG elements are well done, but I didn't absolutely like the new melee system (because there is no real hand-to-hand combat). Still, it's a very satisfying experience, and with more Deus Ex coming out in near future, this is one franchise to look forward to.			"

												This game is really for those who think outside the box. If you want some quick run-and-gun cowboy massacre of a game, then this probably isn't for you. If you're interested in looking at the situation, finding a few alternative paths, and deciding which is for you (i.e. stealth, negotiation tactics, straight up violence, etc.) then this is for you. There are a few glitches and stealth problems though, because the enemies have a one-see-you-and-all-see-you system, and the gunfights in this game, aren't bad, in any sense, but they ARE difficult. It's not like CoD, where you can take 2 deagle rounds to the chest and just walk it off, ya know.			"

												Over all a yes...It's no original but its good. Especially for people who havent played the original but enjoy fps/rpgs... youll probably think this is the best one. It kinda sucks though just because of the xp system... it rewards you for things that become tedious chances to farm xp... Now this DC version has one real good thing going for it; a new game plus system which lets you play through a second time with all the augs you gained on your first playthrough. I beat the game before it was director's cut (I guess they were ""expecting"" a game of the year edition... I'm really sick of Canadian game companies at this point... anyways... yeah the new game plus would be sweet....BUT... they included the DLC from the original release... in which you lose all your augs... I'm still playing through the DLC part but I'm pretty sure its not giving me back ALL the augs I had... so more lame xp farming on the play through Im doing... the boss fights are a little better I guess... they just added a few extra paths to the ones I've seen and they still are kinda lame...anyways the game is pretty good tho... good music... cool combat and skills... multiple paths... endings in the original version of the game were kinda lame... but idk if this DC revamped them... at 5 bucks on sale tho... get it			"

												The definitive form of DXHR. Incorporates all of the previously released DLC into the timeline of the original game.The weapons that you normally get by purchasing them through DLC (Silenced Sniper Rifle, Double Barrel Shotgun) are found in various locations throughout the game, instead of you starting the game with them (removes the ""pay to win"" aspect). The Grenade Launcher is still a mission reward after you rescue Tracer Tong, and you can still purchase Remote-Detonated Explosives and Automatic Unlocking Devices at any shop.Notes on the way the Missing Link DLC is integrated: Basically, you lose all of the stuff you've acquired throughout the entire game when you begin The Missing Link. After completing The Missing Link, an extra moment has been spliced into the game, where you are left standing next to the exit (which takes you back to the main storyline of the game), and there is a weapons container next to you as well. Upon opening this box, you recieve all of your original Praxis points and items back (you also get to keep anything you got while playing The Missing Link).The improved boss battles are just that - a huge improvement. Remember in the original Deus Ex, when you could kill Walton Simons just by electrocuting him on the rails of a minecart track? You can do things like that in the revised version of DXHR, as well. You're able to dispatch bosses by means of turrets, poison gas, and patrolling sentry robots, in addition to the good old-fashioned ""shoot them in the face"" strategy. Sadly, you can't just flat-out ignore the bosses like you could in the original DX; you have to kill them for ""story purposes"".All in all, if you haven't played Deus Ex: Human Revolution yet, first, what is wrong with your brain, and second, the Director's Cut is the only version you should purchase.

												A little background on where my viewpoint comes from: I have not played Deus Ex Original nor Invisible War, and before this was a complete newbie to these sort of 'fps-stealth-rpg games'. Not a huge deal of experience in shooting games and almost none in stealth games (I find most rather frustrating). However, I found the theme rather intriguing. Without further ado:A game I reccomend to the end of the earth, if you have any intrest in the issues presented by it (transhumansim). Picked this up for $5 on a Steam Sale, easily the best buy I've made in a long while. Very suitably atmospehric and well themed and it godamm manages to make those specs and a trenchcoat look cool.The gameplay is also rather good, with a great mix of both shooting and stealth. The shooting is cover-based and stealth also involves hacking, etc. However, I don't think for somebody that has invested a lot of time into stealth or shooting games that they will find these aspects of the game incredible. Games like Dishunoured would outcompete it in stealth and many games would outcompete it in shooting. However, if you are someone with little experince in either like me, you will find both immensely satisfying and I'm sure even a stealth/shooting veteran could find some good elements. The stealth/shooting is by no means bad, it is actually very good, it just doesn't compete with games dedicated to these apects.Deus Ex: Human Reveloution - A game with an amazing and immersive story, great world building and good stealth and shooting mechanics. My favourite ""one time play"" (i.e. not a MOBA of online FPS or the replayability of the like) to this date. No doubt.			"

												Well im kind of speechless after beating the game. First i saw the reviews and then sayd myself sure why not give it a try. I bought it and installed it and then i was like ""what is so good on this game?"" looked terrible. In fact it is. The gameplay is horribly bad and was boring to me. When starting the game its really hard to navigate. The map and inventory system is terrible. Also they dont even tell youi how hacking mechanism works. But then started going deeper and deeper in the story and despite the horrible gameplay it was somehow good. Then reached the end. Really deep and phylosophic. So all in all: Gameplay not really good (5/10) graphics: ok (7/10) and then story: amazing and deep and makes you think (17/10)			"

												Save yourself a little money and purchase the normal version.  The Missing Link DLC is a weak storyline that is sort of hamfistedly inserted into the overal story. Without spoilers, I'll just say that it is painfully obvious just where they decide to insert the story.  Both the lead in and the lead out back to the main storyline are inexpertly handled and the DLC story itself has at least one story-choice moment that is very clearly forced.Purchase the normal game, play the normal story.

												Having beat the original, Non-Director's Cut (the better one anyway), it is insane to me how simple and complicated this game can be; all good factors. Simple in the sense of navigation throughout the cities in Hong-Kong and Detroit and complicated in how you can approach a mission in stealth or balls to the wall action. I also need to add that I get a HUGE feel of Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines from this. I cant help but feel like they were influenced when you roam about in these cities and choose side quests and dialogue options. There is even a persuasion option which is really handy and actually feels like you are cutting through butter in terms of personality and behavior.The combat includes gunplay with hiding behind cover in third person. Shooting outside of cover is definitely an option but I would not recommend on higher difficulties. The stealth mechanic is really nice and I love the takedowns with just the tap of a button. Multiple upgrades on your character from immunity to falling from great heights to hacking terminals faster, gives you a greater sense in how you approach missions by finding shortcuts that are supplemental to your upgrade choices. I LOVE THIS!All in all, the game is great and if you can, get the original somewhere. If not, The Director's Cut is decent enough.It's one of those games that you will not realize time passes you by.			"

												Deus Ex: Human Revolution puts the player in the scientific future of 2027. Adam Jensen is the head of security at Sarif Industries, a biotech corporation specializing in human augmentation. Six months after an attack left many scientests dead, Adam wakes up with a large ammount of augemtations implanted to save his live. Adam must travel around the world in search of clues to find out about the attackers at Sarif. The gameplay is truly exelent. It is a stealth game where you can choose to kill or pacify your foes, take many different routes, and use Adam's augmentations to give yourself an advantage. The game is about 25 hours long, so it is definetly worth the price that comes with it. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is just months away, and nobody can wait for more stealthy, multi-route action.			"

												This is a fantastic game and i highly reccomend it to anyone who enjoys stealth,fps action,or rpg experiences. There is an extreme level of choice avaliable in the game which is made better with the games excellent level design. The story is not the best ever or anything, but the world the game sets up is incredible and executed in a way that few games are able to achieve. The gameplay is fantastic and varied. Every side quest has more depth than the main quests and other games and has multiple possible outcomes. Depending on how you level up your character you will play the game in entirly different ways. So much so that if you roleplay a different way and choose a different combat style it will feel like a completely different game. The only negativevis the game(particlarly character faces other than the main characters) look fairly bad and graphics do not look fantastic. Despite that the aesthetic is great and there is a high level of detail in the areas. Plus graphics are often the least important part of the experience. Overall you should definently buy this game.        On sale it is 5 dollars which is an absolute steal. It is worth the price even when not on sale.			"

												Played the original back on the Xbox 360 and wanted to run through it again before Mankind Divided came out. Human Revolution still holds up after all these years. The graphics and gunplay are a little dated, but everything else still works well.Haven't experienced any bugs or glitches. The game runs smooth. The Director's Cut additions aren't as noticable as I thought they would be. Just minor tweaks here and there.The Missing Link DLC - Didn't enjoy it at all. It adds some interesting plot points near the end of the story, but you're constantly backtracking through the same areas for hours, going through mandatory ""bio scans"" to move from one area to another and back again. Worst part about it is you lose most of your inventory unless you reupgrade your carrying capacity instead of respec'ing into useful augmentations. Explaining any further is a spoiler, so I won't go into detail. When you continue on with the regular story after the DLC is over, you get ALL of your praxis upgrades back, but you're stuck with whatever weapons you finished the DLC with. It sucks, but I can live with that. I couldn't live with the backtracking though.			"

												Be warned, The ""Missing Link"" DLC Is embedded into the game where you can not skip it or turn it off in any way. Missing Link takes away your praxis points (both used and stored points) and removes your ammo but does give you your equipment back after about 10 minutes (all praxis points are given back at the end)The actuel Improvements to the game are a welcome sight, such as the New Game+ feature, it's awesome, allowing you to screw around and speed through other playthroughs with ease, however, the F***ing Missing Link DLC will ruin all that speed and fun.Again, buy the game it's good but just be aware of the Grafted in DLC, buy the original game to remove the issue (but you will not have new game+)			"

												It is one of the best RPGs and also shooters, so consider this, I will tell 5 reasons why you should try it out.1. Least important, but still important. CYBER-♥♥♥♥♥♥-PUNK! It's set in a futuristic world which is just gorgeous.2. It is a shooter, and is still staying realistic. A shotgun to da face kills you, man. Remember that.3. Featuring RPG elements, you can make the story lengthy with scavenging and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bloody hell, you even get to choose dialogue options in almost every convo.4. Augmentations. They make you feel like you are playing another class or something. Like you have convo augs with which you can make a man have sense in convo so you don't have to beat him senseless. :D5. The best thing... It has 12 ♥♥♥♥ing endings, man. I love the word man, man! The endings stand on the facts that you have talked to **** or **** or that you did **** but mostly on this: You have played through it with a rampage, murdering and putting everyone to the long sleep, or you sticked to the shadows, and avoided blood sticking to your hands.Convinced yet? :D			"

												So, I played DXHR a first time, and my review was just ""I DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS""I replayed it just to review the upgrade to Director's Cut, and I suppose I should say more than that. So, here goes:The upgrade doesn't fix DXHR's plot, which is an absolute trainwreck. In the CYBERPUNK FUTURE, nobody has heard of drugs, and augmentations are used basically as a word filter for drugs, to an extent that doesn't even make sense. Instead of getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s addicted to crack, evil pimps get them implanted with cybernetic enhancements... for better sex, I guess? And anyway it means they get to control them, even though that's not how that works ingame.The gameplay is almost identical to the way it was in default DXHR, and so some really annoying flaws never got fixed.The main addition to this mode is The Missing Link DLC, which is a self-contained mission on a prison ship. It's some really excellent content, implemented in a really hamfisted way.Despite all that, despite how much I hate this game for how dumb it is, I can't beat the appeal of cybershades and vibrosword arms. They really are the winning quality that makes this game worth coming back to. If you want to replay DXHR, buy this version of it. And then look up some good mods, it needs them. This game about augmentations needs some augmentation.			"

I'm a definite Senior and some of the gameplay in other games requires speed I just don't have  any longer.  But this game requires a certain amount of stealth and figuring out the best way to get through an area.  I highly recommend it.  I've played it several times and intend to play it again just before they release Mankind Divided on August 23rd.  Buy it, you'll love it.  And the price is so much better than when I purchased it at full price.  But I just couldn't wait...			"

												POLITICS TIME!Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a good game.Okay, you can go home now.Just kidding, but in all seriousness, Deus Ex: Hoomin Breadvolution is a game about politics and CYBORGS!STORY:You play as Adam Press X to Jensen, a super fighting cy-borg working for Sarif Industries, a company run by some guy who was also called Sarif who has a robit arm as well as a very geometric vest which is secretly feeding Sheriff Sarif McJaggedyvest nobel prizes.So anyway, Adam Jamestown has to go do stuff or something I don't care go read some other review that goes more in-depth to the story why are you reading this piece of garbage review congratulations for making it this far.GAMEPLAY:Gears of Hoomins I mean Deus Ex War Revolution is a cover based stealth shooter game with realistic air vent hiding action.OVERALL RATING( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/3 do not recommend for those with ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) disorder.

												A bit tough to review this since SquEnix is messing up Eidos Montreal's plans. This tiny review is done, whilst trying to ignore SquEnix's meddling. Eidos Montreal is a great dev studio, besides, most of the meddling was done to the newer title Mankind Divided and not as much with this one.I'll keep it simple:+ The commentary is excellent. Funny devs and great insight. + The reduction in the gold filter is not too bad. Still has that characteristic look the game is known for.- Seems buggier than the vanilla version. - Sometimes, the HUD goes off the bottom of the screen. - NPCs you knock unconcious with a Tranq Rifle or Stun Gun, die mysteriously. - Some of the difficult achievements do not get unlocked sometimes and are not yet fixed. - Adjusting FOV still looks weird, where the weapons get squeezed into a corner of the screen.Other than those technical issues, the game's still as great as the vanilla version. A modern stealth-FPS classic with RPG elements and great voice acting. Please buy it.Score:0451/10 would spill my drink again*edit 25-11-16 : updated review*			"

												This is a great sequel to one of the best games ever (lets pretend invisible war is.....invisible). The augmentation system, voice acting, PC performance and optimization are all delightful. However, the game isn't perfect and definitely has its flaws. The story feels very detached and unimpactful compared to the story of the original. The ending is also nowhere near as exciting as the endings in the previous game. However, I still recommend that you give this game a try.8.5/10			"

												Its ok to pass some time, but it feels very dated, I found the story quite bland, and not enough good stuff to out way the bad stuff, to bring me back to the game.It’s one of those mediocre games not exciting games, where sometimes you just feel as you are going through the motions.

												Loved every second my favourite single player game ever. An Amazing world, great mechanics, a lot of hiding in vents like an unwanted raccoon for me. At the same time remaining challenging and thought on how you approach situations. The story is well thought out.Connor alywood lives in Bognair Regeis and will be often seen Helping out at local Bingo and cleaning the toilets			"

												This game is a blast and a ton of fun to play but I cannot in all good concious recommend this to someone. I have Windows 10 on my laptop and an Intel processor and because it has Integrated Graphics the game simply will not start. After 12 hours of gameplay this popped up after I restarted my laptop. Oh believe me I spent a good 3 hours trying to troubleshoot but to no avail, so don't waste your money and if you really want this game then just put aside your pride and buy it on console. I usually say PC is superior but in this case the PC port has some issues.			"

												I've just finished it and I'm left feeling it was decent, but nothing that special. I've always wanted to try the series and now that I have I'm not blown away by it, but I will pick up Mankind Divided once it's heavily discounted in the hope that some small improvements will bump my overall score up a notch.I'll start by saying the story itself was great, it was engaging and interesting throughout and the voice acting was really on point as well which helped sell it, the story was what kept me playing until the end. It's just a shame the lip syncing often fell out of sync during cutscenes.The gameplay just didn't match quality of the story for me, though, the AI was often quite brain-dead and just clunky, with obvious hard leashes which made tougher encounters easier as you could just run out the door, regain health and go in again. Swapping through weapons and items was clunky and slow, I would have happily spent an augment point on upgrading the speed I could switch weapons but I didn't see one (please tell me I didn't miss it), the cover system was quite awkward and often I'd try to lean out to shoot and the game just wouldn't let me for no apparent reason. One of my biggest complaints has to be the inventory though, I maxed it out but was still constantly full and unable to loot items, if items stacked, or stacked in higher quantities it would have eliminated this major annoyance. I get that they don't want you to carry around everything at once, but I felt it was overly restrictive to the point it hurt the gameplay.Technically the game fell somewhat as well, I mentioned earlier the lip sync issues, there was also a weird bug where the combat rifle had slight delay on its audio after pulling the trigger, apparently it's a common issue with Asus cards which I happen to have. I also suffered with a lot of stuttering, especially outside in open cities and once again the Steam forums are filled with complaints regarding this issue, which apparently was fixed in the non DC version, but not the DC which is bizarre to me. I will say I GREATLY reduced this by forcing the new Fast Sync technology using Nvidia Inspector, it eliminated almost all of the stuttering and removed all tearing all while having VSync off so the mouse didn't feel heavy, Fast Sync is incredible and I highly suggest you guys try it in place of VSync as you get all the benefits without the negatives.Overall it was a fantastic story let down by the core gameplay and mechanics which felt clunky and often became frustrating. I will say I'm not a massive fan of stealth games so I was probably playing it ""wrong"", often picking my silenced pistol over simply hiding and dodging enemies which often made the game harder (and it was surprisingly hard even on normal, you die so fast) but that didn't negatively impact my enjoyment of the game, other than some fairly large progress losses because the autosave system is quite stingy, I used F5 a lot more towards the end.6/10Nvidia users: Force the new Fast Sync technology, it makes the game much smoother. Download Nvidia Inspector and force the VSync bits to ""0x18888888"". You need the latest version of Nvidia Inspector and the latest Nvidia drivers for this to work. Fast Sync gives you all the benefits of VSync without the negatives like input delay and mouse heaviness, it's really great and made the game much more enjoyable for me.			"
