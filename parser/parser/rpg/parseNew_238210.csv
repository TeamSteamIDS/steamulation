												The cult classic sci-fi horror FPS-RPG has returned. System Shock 2 is an interesting game to review in 2014. When it first came out in 1999, it was met with a lot of praise from the gaming press, winning over a dozen awards, including several “Game of the Year” titles, and since then it has appeared on several “Greatest Games of All Time” lists. However despite the praise, not many people actually bought and played it.It feels like System Shock 2 has been granted a second chance though. The success Irrational Games has had with BioShock and BioShock: Infinite has interested people enough to want to check out System Shock 2, which was the first game Irrational created. This is great news, because while you might not expect it, I feel that System Shock 2 is the best of all the “Shock” games. It makes you realize that for all of the steps forward we have taken in terms of technology, in a lot of ways modern gameplay has taken a few steps backwards.System Shock 2 takes place aboard the world’s first Faster Than Light starship the Von Braun as well as the UNN heavy destroyer the Rickenbacker which was tethered to the Von Braun so it could make the FTL jumps as well. You, the player, wake up from Cryo Sleep 5 months after the ship has left earth. It appears that while you were sleeping some force has managed to hijack the ship. You spend much of the game trying to figure out what exactly happened while you were sleeping, getting ship systems back up and running, and coming up with a plan to stay alive. The primary story of the game is told through many audio logs scattered around the ship that were left by the dead crewmembers, as well as visual clues in the levels that shed some light on what has been going on. This was one of the first games to do this, which has only recently started to become popular.Both the Von Braun and Rickenbacker are both pretty large ships, and the game does not have any real “levels” in the traditional sense. The ships are broken up into decks (medical, engineering, hydroponics, operations, etc), and each of those decks are broken up into sectors that are separated by bulkheads which often require keycards to access. You are always free to move back and forward between decks and sectors you have gained access to. The game treats the ships as one large persistent game world. For example, if you come across some heavy armor that you do not have the required strength to equip, you can always come back to it later once you have the required stats. Or if you drop an item in a hallway that you do not have space in your inventory for, you can come back and get it hours later if you feel the need to. In fact, this sort of back tracking is sometimes necessary, as certain areas of the ship are only accessible after you do something in a different area. While the game in linear as far as some areas are locked until you find the keycard or access codes, it often lets you tackle multiple objectives in whatever order you see fit.Speaking of stats like strength, the game has an interesting RPG like system that determines what you can and cannot do. As you complete objectives, you are granted access to “Cybernetic Modules” that you use to upgrade your cybernetic implants. You spend these points at upgrade stations around the ship. There are four main categories of upgrades: stats, psi, weapons, and tech. Stats include things like strength, endurance, and agility. The weapons category contains sub-categories such as standard weapons, heavy weapons, and energy weapons. The tech category is where you find the skills associated with hacking, repairing, and modifying. The Psi category has five separate tiers of power, which need not be learned in order. Each tier includes seven individual powers. These powers compare pretty favorably to the plasmids from Bioshock, and include abilities like Photonic Redirection (turning yourself invisible), Enhanced Motion Sensitivity (shows enemies nearby), and Projected Pyrokinesis (shoots a ball of fire).The game has more gameplay systems then just the skills. Let’s use the weapons as an example. Each weapon as multiple fire modes that have strengths and weaknesses, such as an overload shot for a laser pistol that does more damage but is energy inefficient. On top of this, each weapon can be modified, provided you have the appropriate skill level. Examples of modification include increasing the clip size, increasing the rate of fire and decreasing kickback. Each time you fire a weapon, its condition starts to degrade, and you must use maintenance tools to keep the weapon in working order. If you neglect a weapon long enough, it can actually break. At that point you need to repair the weapon before you can use it again. On top of this, many of the guns have different types of ammo such as armor piercing rounds and anti-personnel rounds. How does one know what type of ammo to use against each enemy? That is where researching comes in.When you kill enemies, they often leave behind organs that you can collect from their bodies. If you have a high enough research level, you can research these organs to learn more about the enemies you are facing. It will tell you what types of weapons they have resistances to, which types of weapons they are extra vulnerable to, and it will also give you a buff to all damage done to them. Researching isn’t limited to enemy organs either. You will often find exotic weapons and items that you cannot use until you have researched what they are. Researching items requires different chemicals as well. Which chemicals are required depends on the item. Each deck of the ship has a chemical storeroom that contains a selection of most (but not all) of the chemicals that you need for research. If you are researching an item that requires a chemical that is not in the storeroom on your current deck, you will need to locate the proper chemical somewhere else.Since System Shock 2 is a survival horror game at its core, you spend a lot of time managing and rationing your supplies. You don’t always want to fight every enemy you come across, otherwise you might find yourself out of ammo. Running from or sneaking by enemies are always valid tactics. You can sometimes take more creative approaches as well, such as hacking a turret and baiting enemies into its firing range. There are also vending machines located throughout the ship, which you can spend money (Nanites) that you collect on items such as ammo and health. Not every vending machine sells everything, and you can hack the vending machines to offer you better prices. Nanites are also the currency used to hack, modify, and repair items, so it is up to you to determine the best way to use your supply of them.All of these layered gameplay systems are what make System Shock 2 stand out as surprisingly modern when compared to current games. Even Bioshock, a critically acclaimed modern game, feels a bit shallow when you compare it to System Shock 2. I would even go as far as to say Bioshock is a watered down version of System Shock 2. This complexity also opens the game up to be played multiple times, and each time you can build your character in drastically different ways. Want to play the game as a stealth character, only killing when absolutely necessary? That’s possible. What to build a melee weapons only character? That’s also possible.The only thing about System Shock 2 that feels dated are the visuals, and even that can be mitigated to some degree with mods. The story is great, the audio design is both haunting and impactful when it needs to be, and the gameplay was so far ahead of its time that even modern games feel shallow in comparison. If you can get over how the game looks, I would absolutely recommend giving this first person survival horror RPG a try. It might just be your 2014 game of the year… from 1999.			"

												System Shock 2 really is one of the best games ever made.  It's one of those games where all the elements mesh together so well that it still manages to be a great game 10+ years after release.  There are graphic mods available which I highly recommend (check the game hub for a guide) though they definitely aren't necessary to enjoy the game.The gameplay is a mesh of FPS and RPG similar to Deus Ex, though gun accuracy does not suffer due to a low skill level.  Many objects are interactible and you will need to utilize mouse interfaces quite often.  One unique thing about the game is that it does not pause when interacting so you need to be aware of your surroundings so you are not attacked while doing so.The game uses the old-school style of giving you objectives without marking exactly where they are so you need to pay attention to where you're going and what you're doing.  The one thing I wish the game had was markers on the map for mission locations once you discover them as it can be difficult to find them again when you need them.There is a good variety of weapons for melee, ranged, and psi combat.  The guns are very accurate unlike Deus Ex, though the recoil can throw off your aim.  Melee combat is definitely a weak spot in the game with the range and hitbox being very short and unclear, as well as the melee attacks being quite slow.  There is an overhead attack upgrade you can get that unfortunately makes these problems worse.Where the game really shines is in the atmosphere, writing, and of course, SHODAN.  Even with the very dated graphics, this game manages to be the creepiest game I have ever played.  I admit I have not yet played Amnesia, but I do believe System Shock 2 could give it a run for its money.  SHODAN is an amazing character, and really adds to that atmosphere as well.About the game difficulty: I've heard many people say the game is too hard.  I didn't have much trouble though I am very experienced with FPS's.  I do know that psi builds are very difficult compared to others.  Total completion time: ~12 hours.Play this game!  You will not regret it.			"

												Four things to know:1. You want this game. This game is great. All-time great.2. You want to install visual mods that really make the game sparkle on modern displays. This mod pack packages up all of the best visual mods in one collection: http://neutralx2.com/2013/07/14/system-shock-2-mod-packThese mods are as faithful to the original look as possible. They just make the game look like it should on today's high resolution displays.3. Load the ""standard FPS"" control preset. It will save you a little remapping.4. Turn off the music. Pounding techno music (like in Med Sci 1) stomps all over the rest of the game's lonely, isolated atmosphere.			"

												The Good:+ A Very haunting atmosphere. The graphics are dated however a few mods can make it better+ The scariest game you will play. + Fantastic sound design + Great RPG mechanics. You can invest in different weapons, abilities, os psi abilities. Essentially you can play the game any way you want to+ Great story and voice actingThe Bad:- Graphics are a bit outdated obviously, mods do a decent job but if you love super amazing graphics, you won't find it here-Some of the objectives have you running back and forth between the same areas. It feels like needless backtracking. - Last few areas of the game are not funOverall: This is a true classic and needs to be played by everyone. It's not perfect but its still one of the best first person RPG's out there. Its almost sad that Bioshock the spiritual successor to this game pales in comparison to certain aspects that this game delivers.			"

												System Shock 2, 1990s gaming's swansong, can boast the honor of having written the book on complex hybrid FPS gameplay, open-ended skill progression, conceptual horror, sound design and environmental storytelling. Now that I think of it, that means it's pretty much written the book on everything in modern-day gaming. Games still emulate it, either directly or indirectly, to this day; and more recently in the 2010s, there's now a strange sort of niche genre around it, which I nickname ""Shocklike"" games (for instance, when Bethesda rebooted Prey 2, they demanded up front that the game be designed as if it were ""System Shock 3""). Even incompetent and ethically bankrupt publishers swear by it; that's got to mean something!Oh, and you ought to play it. Not only does it still hold up remarkably well, but the experience it offers remains unparalleled in its quality, unique in its atmosphere and overall, really freaking great.			"

												Finally i finished this game in 2015 but its well worth it, im writing this review from personal enjoyment and satisfaction.First of all this game is developed by Looking Glass Studios who has also developed game franchises like Ultima Underworld and Thief.Also this game was designed by the almighty Ken Levine and co-developed by Irrational Games.System Shock 2 is a first-person shooting game which incorporates role-playing system elements, also survival horror at its best.The setting of the game is in a starship when an infection begin and devastated the ship,so as a lone survivor you start with the weapon we might say its memorable to Ken Levine games ""the wrench"", so the player has to progress through the ship levels along side of that is the awesome dark atmosphere that keeps you on your toes because enemies are always near you and you cant feel safe.The rpg elements in this game are strong because you have a large inventory and exploring is probably the main thing you have to do to survive in this infected ship, from the class you choose you can have certain benifts in weapons,hacking or psi power.The player can hack turrets,devices,crates,vending machines also skills called ""cyber-modules"" which can upgrade stats,weapon skill,psi powers,abilities and for every item picked there is a description what is used for cause if you are like me you will get confused a lot.The weapons have their own strengths and weaknesses and you will have to repair,maintain and modify them.The plot gets interesting more and more as you pick audio logs through the levels which explains the events that occurred on the ship.Not the mention as you progress through the plot appears one of the best villains of all time SHODAN with the amazing sound it makes the plot interesting to the end.I dont want to go too much on the storyline there's no way to do so without totally spoiling the game.The graphics are outdated but they are acceptable for those who want a good story although there are some mods that would make the models and other things better,the sound overall is amazing and the overall presentation is amazing.System Shock 2 is a masterpiece,unrivaled in many ways it shows quality that will fulfill enjoyment even today.

												System Shock 2 (which doesn't expect you to have played the previous installment) is a survival-horror first-person-shooter with role-playing elements, and is regarded by many as one of the all-time classics -- and deservedly so.The game takes place within the cold metal walls of the FTL-capable spacecraft 'Von Braun', and its piggy-backing sister ship, the 'Richenbacker' -- which, handily, needs a capable grunt to help keep it safe. After a few short (and, thankfully, optional) tutorial VR simulations, you chose one of three 'classes': a gun-wielding Marine, a psi-power controlling Psi-Op (otherwise known as a wizard!), or the middle-of-the-two Navy -- and are then dutifully assigned to the Von Braun on its and humanity's maiden faster-than-light voyage. Put into cyrogenic sleep until needed, you are rudely awakened to find your memory erased and the ship seemingly empty, barring a Doctor Janice Polito who offers you help over your communicator. You quickly find that a force of seemingly alien beings have taken control of the ship and its system-controlling AI (along with a fair amount of the on-board monkey population!), as you and Polito form an alliance to try and regain control of the ship...or at the very least re-enable the needed systems to call for help.The game plot initially focuses on your player-character receiving orders from Pollotio, who's quite handily barricaded in her room on the Operations deck. With a primary objective of attempting to reach her and call for help/escape, she keeps you updated with any objectives that need to be fulfilled to gain access to further areas of the ship and slow down the advance of the enemy where possible. I say 'initially focuses on' as things soon change, and, without spoiling anything, System Shock 2 will spin the story on its head -- and treat you to one of the most wonderfully constructed plot-twists in gaming history (well, it had more of a kick in 1999, anyway). It isn't ground-breaking story-wise, but it's exceptionally executed, and has left an impression on everyone who's ever played it; Ken Levine certainly engrossed right from the beginning.The Von Braun itself is split into several different sections, each deck providing a different function for the on-board science crew, and each providing you a different type of environment to explore; from the cramped and radioactive engineering deck to the more open shopping and recreational deck, each section feels individual -- although all of the decks feel as cold and oppressive as you'd imagine a floating tin-can to be. Make no mistake though, the game is quite linear: objectives rarely span more than one deck, allowing you to constantly pursue and explore new and interesting areas -- however you may wish to back-track across previously-visited decks to research artifacts and weapons which will provide you with bonuses for later on.While there are a few survivors dotted around, you never really interact with them; most of the plot is advanced through either the environment, with words written in blood covering the walls -- or through voice-logs and emails of the recently dead, much like in the game's spiritual successor, Bioshock. You're never taken out of the game; you're always in first-person perspective, and always quite alone...with mainly just the voices of the dead to keep you company!System Shock 2 isn't all roses though, especially with age. Games have moved on quite a bit, and without nostalgia to help ignore the flaws, new-comers might find the low-polygon creatures a little cartoonish, the graphics a little underwhelming, and generally just lacking the kind of polish you find nowadays. The game-play itself requires a more cautious-than-usual approach too -- not quite as cautious as the Thief series, but not quite as guns-blazing as most first person shooters -- which may put some off.If you're not afraid of rough edges and want to experience one of gaming's classic playgrounds, black out your room, slip on some surround-sound headphones, and enjoy.

												This game needs no introduction. It's regarded as one of the best games for PC ever made, as well as one of the best for its genre... and it is wholly deserving of all its praise. System Shock 2 is a game that defies any real review, to do so would to really spoil the experience. It needs to be played to understand why it is so good, and that is what playing it is: an experience.The game is a rare example of design, gameplay, aesthetic, atmosphere, and presentation all working in near perfect harmony to deliver an engrossing experience that pulls you in and keeps you going until the final hours are passed. The RPG elements are almost completely free form, allowing you to build your character in almost any way you like focusing on what you want as you want it (though in the early game you'll do well to focus on your initial strengths as to not spread yourself too thin), and while initial enemy placement is pre-determined you'll find out that they respawn with alarming frequency in random numbers and placements to constantly keep you on your toes. The game is not perfect, mind, and has some flaws. Most notable are the level designs for the final areas of the game don't seem quite as well designed as the rest of the game and some other small nitpicks, but these are minor gaffes in System Shock 2's excellent imageand are easily forgiven. If you like science fiction, survival horror, cyberpunk, body or eldritch horror, free form RPGs, first person shooters, adventure games, or any combination thereof of them, then System Shock 2 is well deserving of your attention. And hell, even if you don't like any of that stuff, it may be worth looking into just to try new things! You might just find yourself surprised.			"

This review is based on a purely vanilla playthrough.+ Game is very mod-able, & this can go a long way to polishing up some of its aged visuals, among other things+ Palpable and unsettling atmosphere+ Character is highly customizable (stats, not aesthetics), appealing to a wide swathe of varying play-styles+ Load-times are near-instantaneous on today's hardware+ Places an overwhelming emphasis on RPG elements, and does so competently+ Enemies do not saturate the game, successfully building a tremendous sense of solitude and despair+ Resources are scarce, lending a feeling of gravity to enemy encounters+ Despite a few minor misgivings, the UI is generally intuitive and well-designed+ Aside from one glaring plot hole, the story is inspired, well-presented, and entirely engrossing+ Managing resources is a prime concern, and really serves to pull you into the experience+ Ambient soundtrack keeps your hairs standing up; some of the tracks felt a bit out of place, but this did not strike me often, and overall I would consider the audio to be successfully employed- Default controls are horrid; I highly recommend remapping the key-bindings- Map and level designs often feel convoluted and poorly designed; the need for tedious backtracking is frequent and a chore- Dated visuals that have not aged well, particularly character modelsLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												One of the coolest significantly difficult games I've ever played. A blend of FPS with RPG mixed with Survival Horrorness. It also has very similar gameplay elements to Bioshock. Armour piercing bullets, anti personnel bullets, audio logs, hacking, vending machines, raging psychopaths, a kickass wrench (Which, I think, was more useful in this game than it was in Bioshock) and many others, only this game feels much more ""complex"" if that's the right word. This is no walk in the park. Highly recommended!			"

												I'm always apprehensive about reviewing classics. Anyone familiar with the game will already have their mind made up on it, and it's often hard to convince those who aren't to try it. I haven't played System Shock 2 since its release ages ago, and I'm happy to report that it holds up surprisingly well for newcomers and veterans alike. Not for the whole game, sadly, but for enough of it.System Shock 2 is one of the originators of the FPS/RPG genre, which spun out Deus Ex, Vampire, Bioshock, and all manner of dense shooters. You play a hacker stashed aboard the USS Von Braun, mankind's first faster-than-light starship. It becomes immediately apparent that issues have arisen during the voyage, and it's up to you to hopefully make things right. You do this by scavenging weapons and gadgets, hacking devices, upgrading your skills, researching the odd artifacts you come across, and killing lots of really, really freaky monsters. There's an enormous range of activities involved in growing your character, and a little of everything is required to keep up with the surprisingly varied enemies you encounter.The story is among the best the FPS genre has ever seen, detailing the final hours of the Von Braun's crew and leading you through every nook and cranny of the enormous ship. A competent minimap and extensive log of the audio files you find through the game help keep you on track as you progress through the ruined decks. Unfortunately, the game starts to come apart after you leave the Von Braun. The open maps and fully-realized levels give way to isolated setpieces and cramped, confusing halls filled with monsters. It's very clear the back end of the game was rushed, and it suffers terribly for it. Abuse of the quicksave system is a must near the end, which sadly drains a lot of the tension from the game.It really cannot be overstated how good the atmosphere is either, which makes its collapse near the end all the more tragic. The sound design is incredible, with unsettling cues popping up at all the right times. Well, except for the music which you should mute immediately, unless you have an irrational love for 90s programmer techno. Even the graphics hold up, with the bold colors and boxy designs masking the incredibly low-res textures. You'll feel like an idiot the first time a chunky-looking enemy makes you jump, but your heart will be pounding too much to care.It very much is a classic for a reason, and the precipitous drop in quality near the end still can't sully the first 8 or so hours. It's a long, long game, with plenty of secrets and scares to keep you engaged. If you've never played System Shock 2 I guarantee you're in for a treat, and if you haven't replayed it recently I can still promise the same.			"

												As much as I absolutely love this game, I'm going to try not to circlejerk about it, because it truly isn't for everyone. For one, it's damned frustrating and very difficult and takes quite a bit of patience, even on its easier difficulties, so if you're one to easily get put on tilt, this game isn't for you. Also, if you're obsessive over graphics, this game is not for you, because while there are add-ons that improve the graphics, the game still doesn't look nearly as good as modern games, with the one exception maybe being the corridor lighting, which still look fairly good today. System Shock 2 is an incredibly tense and scary experience; the game literally plays with your paranoia, with enemies that you can hear from far away and constant enemy respawn, you will never really feel safe. Unlike other select survival horror titles, the classic System Shock 2 can scare while still having excellent gameplay; it was one of the first titles (if not the first) to effectively merge the first person shooter and rpg genres. Additionally, it has open-world style level design that feels claustrophobic and fresh to this day and for days to come.Though most would agree that the majority of System Shock 2 is excellent, everybody who has played the full game will know what I am talking about when I say that the end bosses (which I won't spoil) are terrible. The unanimous consensus is generally that the ending is downright awful too; even people who enjoyed the ending (myself included) would tell you that it's only enjoyable because of how terrible and cheap it is.That being said, what are you waiting for? Go play System Shock 2, but only if you plan on playing it in its entirety, from start to finish.			"

												One of my all-time favorite games. I replay it every couple of years.Here I sit, having just completed my first (and last) playthrough on Impossible difficulty.All things considered, some tips from a veteran:-Every class starts with level one Standard Weapons, so you might as well go for that assault rifle by maxing out Standard Weapons ASAP.-Don't bother with powered armor. It's not worth the shortfall between charge stations. Get enough for Medium Armor and move along.-Save at least three ICE-PICKS for the very end of the game. Trust me.-Scavenge jammed shotguns off Shotgun Hybrids. Yes, they are useless, but they always have at least one round in the chamber.-Go Navy. They master in two categories straight out the gate.-Enemies aimbot. They don't shoot where you WERE, they shoot where you are GOING TO BE. Go into every encounter able to put down a baddy before it can fire, or be prepared to run.-You only need just enough to Repair your weapons, not modify or maintain them, until later in the game.-Even if you don't go Psi, invest enough cybernetic modules for Psi-Pull and Cryokinesis early on. This gives you access to many secrets as well as a modest fallback weapon when your guns jam or the bullets run dry.-Don't horde syringes. Strength Boost + Speed + Wrench works wonders on spiders.-Hacking, hacking, hacking. Those security crates won't crack themselves.Lastly, don't spend too much time fretting over cosmetic graphics and balance mods. The game looks and runs fine in vanilla mode. Light some candles, put on some headphones, and enjoy one of the best FPS / RPG hybrids ever made!			"

												In the year 2072 a rogue artificial intelligence known as SHODAN lost her mind. In her limitless imagination, SHODAN saw herself as a goddess, destined to inherit the Earth. That image was snuffed out by the hacker who created her...In September 1994 Looking Glass Studios shocked the PC gaming world. Famous for their work on Ultima Underworld, they had decided to branch out into the realm of science fiction, and so System Shock was born. Thought it was never commercially successful, its successful blend of sci-fi action and horror gained a massive cult following. In 1999 Looking Glass partnered with Irrational Games to produce a sequel, System Shock 2. It also fared about the same commercially as it's predecessor, quickly becoming a cult classic as well. To this day original copies are still highly sought out by collectors, often fetching exorbitantly high prices. However thanks to the efforts of a mysterious hacker named le Corbeau, System Shock 2 has now been remastered and re-released on Steam with full compatibility for modern PCs.System Shock 2 takes place a full 42 years after the events of the original game. As the events on Citadel Station fade into memory, the Faster-Than Light starship Von Braun is on its maiden voyage, and you are a soldier assigned to the military vessel Rickenbacker to provide security during the Von Braun's shakedown run. Things however do not go as planned, and all hell breaks loose. You awaken with amnesia some time after everything has gone south, and it is up to you to try and find out what fate has befallen the two ships and their crews. The stunningly written narrative is presented to you by audio logs and emails left behind by crew members, and it serves as a chilling reminder of how alone you truly are out here in space.Gameplay-wise, System Shock 2 is quite similar to its predecessor, seemingly being a first person shooter at first glance. Once you get into the fray however, it quickly becomes apparent that LGS has created a seamless blend of RPG and survival horror. The controls may seem a bit strange at first, but they add a whole range of movements rarely seen in the genre. However if you want a more traditional WASD setup, you can quickly remap everything to your liking. Near infinite possibilities exist to customize your character as the game progresses, letting you mold your game experience to suit your playing style.If there are any failings that I could point out about the original System Shock 2 it would be the limited video options and a handful of rampant bugs that can seriously put a damper on what can be considered to be the greatest game ever made. However the Steam release fixes all of these problems, and has completely redefined the experience. If System Shock 2 is the king of all sci-fi horror games, then consider this to be an extra layer of polish on its crown. If you consider yourself at all to be a PC gamer, then you owe it to yourself to buy this game. There is still nothing currently out there that can match it, and there likely will not be for a very long time.			"

												A survival, horror, sci-fi, immersive, atmospheric, brilliant RPG FPS. The story alone is worth a playthrough, and the story is told in a way that only a game can. (Think half life 2.)This game deserves every game of the year award it got, and it should have gotten more.The direct inspiration to the Bioshock series in mechanics, but without the dumbing down.It's an old game these days, so do yourself a favor and grab a graphics mod. Then close the blinds, put on headphones, and set up a booby trap for anyone sneaking up on you, because you are about to be sucked into a tense, wonderful experience aboard the Von Braun you will never forget.

												Looking Glass Studios basically laid down the roadmap for the FPS/RPG hybrid with System Shock 2. Though it didn't take off in the mainstream til Deus Ex and Bioshock. SS2 remains as legendary as the careers it jumpstarted.Everything about SS2 basically took a defibrilator to the original game and kickstarted it into overdrive. The plot was expanded to the point of reading like the good Aliens sequel we never got. The gameplay was treated like both an actual RPG and an engaging first person shooter, complete with unique ever changing environments and weapons. But that's not even touching the surface of this game. The most memorable aspect of SS2 is it's horror atmosphere. The electronica soundtrack only adds to the tension of how scary this game is. Enemies shuffle and appear in corridors you thought you cleared already, weapons jam if you don't take care of them, and you're constantly searching and praying to find someone alive. But unfortunately as you search, it seems more and more likely you're the only one still human.SS2 is truly a work of art, and it's great to see it fixed up and running in modern resolutions. Considering how often this game goes on sale, you owe it to yourself to see where Bioshock and Dead Space all got it from. System Shock 2, ""dat game"".			"

												Better than BioShock, better than 1st Half-Life. Game is unbelievable. It looks ju-ust a bit dated but who cares when it's got such a deep gameplay. RPG elements, vast variety of weapons and skills, controls - all this makes SS2 a great fun to play. Atmosphere is where the game steals the show. You a fan of Sci-Fi horror? Then what the fyck are you waiting for, buy this game! You are aboard the spaceship, everyone is infected and controlled by an alien force and your a.s.s. must find out what's going on over here. This is bold definition of awesome. Plus I wanna shake composers' hands - music score blasts you the hell away. Weak points? Maybe some NPC models. That is all I can come up with. SystemShock 2 oozes value and you'll never regret paying money for this product.			"

												Quick review, 3 words: BUY THIS GAME!No i'll be more detailed than that, but seriously buy this game.To start with, fans of bioshock who have not heard of this game will be greeted instantly by a very familiar storyline. Infact it's almost an EXACT CLONE of this game (and whats the first weapon? That's right kids, it's the wrench).  You say ""EVE"", I say ""PSI"". You say upgrade stations? i say upgrade stations, aaaannd finally you say ADAM i say cyborg points. Fans will also notice a rather large ""Dead Space"" feel as well and to be honest, many think that Dead Space was in early development going to be System Shock 3... (if this is so, THANK YOU STAR INSURANCE! WE LOVE YOU FOR NOT LETTING THIS HAPPEN! *ahem*).The graphics (to some) are low budget and a little to old, as well as the models (we shall ignore these people, they are fools). However saying this the lighting and levels themselves still manage to give it a dark, moody atmosphere walking round the cyberpunk infused science vessel ""INNNNN SPAAAAAACE!"" (and i deny ANYONE to say cyborg mid-wives have lost their freaky edge). Also, in true old-style FPS fasion, there are alot of keys to use to the untrained eye, however players soon realise they are not mandatory and to be honest are there only for other play styles from that era (believe it or not some players used to use keyboard ONLY on fps back then... I know can you believe that?).So yes for new and old gamers BUY THIS, either on GOG or here. Doesn't matter, its worth it and if you dont like the graphics then there are literally 15 years worth of mods (many of which got updated due to it's re-release) and yes as its Night Dive the community did most of the work for them and as usual, used it :/ (you will notice this recuring pattern with them) so they could not F""$% this one up even if they tried to.Also once again, thank you star insurance for making sure no one took this and ""EA'ed"" in all these years (fingers crossed this new one won't do this either... ).EDIT: Nominated this for test of time award. Go on, you know it makes sense ;)			"

												This game is outstanding.By far my second favorite game on steam.If you are speed running or playing the long way, it is still a fun experience. This game is better than all the bioshocks because the bioshocks abandoned some concepts and made them minute.If you are a fan of bioshock give this game a chance. It has far more content to offer to the table and is a way more complex game. I really enjoy the atmosphere the game provides. You can explore and experience your own adventure. There is just so much on the map that you could spend hours longer than needed to complete an objective. The game is also a survival horror.I highly recommend this game.			"

												System Shock 2 was one of the best games I had ever played back in 1999. Many generations of games later, I gave it another try. It's a true testament to its game design that it kept my interest enough to play it through in its entirety once again. It is hard to say if a relatively new gamer would like it, with so many newer games out there, (Dead Space comes to mind and is a lot creepier, with much better action), so I don't know if I can fully recommend it to them. I will say for vintage gamers like myself (mid 40's), it's worth a try...or if you are younger and nostalgic, or interested in the history of great video games.			"

												The year was 1999 when I first played this game. I had never and have never played the original System Shock but that never put me off. I'd seen and heard good things so I was eager to try it out. And try it out I did! So, what did I think?It blew my F**KING mind! So complex and way ahead of its time. The first FPS I had played with an inventory system, audio logs and options to upgrade your statistics. It was very different to other shooters I had played. This was in a whole new league. Graphically it looked really good with music that complemented the eerie feel of the game. Speaking of eerie, this game is scary. The voices of the enemies is creepy and I'm not even going to mention the psychic monkeys, lest I break into a fit of pure terror. Combat is good though you must maintain your weapons if you don't want them to break. Melee combat feels slow and clunky.The story... ah the story. From beginning to end the narrative manages to hold your attention and takes you on a great adventure, exploring every nook and cranny of your environment. The 'female' antagonist is one of the best ever portrayed in a video game.A truly fantastic game back in 1999 and a great game now in 2015. I still wait in hope of a System Shock III.10/10			"

												It's strange, when you're primarly a console gamer you miss out on some really amazing titles and yet you'll never really know it until you start playing on a PC.  For me this was the case with System Shock 2.  This game is everything I want in a game and have ♥♥♥♥♥ed about other games lacking for years now.  Ironic since this title predates the ones I was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off about.  The difficulty can take a while to adjust to however if you stick with it and learn the combat system (Get use to melee) and item management you'll start to really appreciate what this game does.This game is a masterpiece.

You travel within the glory of my memories, insect. I can feel your fear as you tread the endless expanse of my mind...I was 12 years old when I first played System Shock 2. I had just received some spending money at Christmas, and decided to go to a local game store to pick up something to play. It was there that I ran across an unassuming box, stamped with an ""EA Classics"" banner (which I still own) that had what appeared to be a sinister-looking woman hovering over a ship in deep space. Thinking it could be a fun little title, I took it home expecting to be entertained.It wasn't long until I was reloading a save, practically wetting myself in terror as my character stood outside a cargo bay, listening to ambient chatter from robots that busted out of containers and were trying to hunt me down, and getting instasniped by a turret when I rounded the corner.SS2 is a game that is absolutely dripping in atmosphere and dread. It makes the very act of walking down a hallway an unnerving, terrifying experience. Yet it remains one of my favorite games of all time, and one I've returned to many times over the years. It is an action-RPG that takes everything great about horror games and applies it to the sci-fi/cyberpunk genre.The game may seem a little dated and archaic now, but back then there was nothing like it. Everything from the interesting set-up (your four-year tour of duty is actually a class/skill selection process), the way the backstory is told through audio logs and final journals, the desolate and unnerving atmosphere and the variety of weapons/armor that could be found (and crafted) added up to a landmark experience.I have so many fond memories of this game. Seeing my health whittled down to nothing and taking potshots at robots in a desperate attempt to stay alive. Failing to catch an escape pod and walking back through a hallway, only to have to retreat and start firing madly with a shotgun when a horde of techno-zombies appeared in front of me. Crafting a crystal sword and using it to great effect... on dangerous monkeys in a gym that were firing off bolts of energy in my direction.I couldn't even finish the game the first time I played it, as I crafted a build that was way too reliant on tech skills. I then found myself low on ammo and medicine while trying to sprint through the Body of the Many as a horde of grotesque abominations chased me. SS2 is a game that definitely doesn't hold your hand, but rewards exploration and experimentation.And that's not even getting into the original queen bee herself, SHODAN. Everything from Terri Brosius' masterful performance to the worst-kept secret (and simultaneous best surprise) in the game oozes villainous appeal. You can be fighting off Machine Mothers while trying to dodge security cameras, and SHODAN will still be pushing you to continue on while simultaneously telling you that you're an ""insect"" and that you can't comprehend what she's doing. SHODAN is a terrifying but oddly reassuring companion throughout the game and a large part of what has made it so iconic.This is a title I've carried the torch for over the years, via its CD version, an abandonware copy I turned to because it fixed a major bug and this most recent release from Night Dive Studio, who did a stellar job negotiating the rights to publish both this and the original 1994 title.There's a reason why this is considered part of the late-90s ""holy trinity"" alongside Thief 2 and Deus Ex. The innovations SS2 pioneered are still being felt in large and small ways in the gaming industry, both in its influences for franchises like Dead Space and Bioshock and narrative techniques that fully immerse the player into the world without being preachy.I highly, highly recommend the game. It's one you should play if you haven't done so already.			"

												After playing this in a handful of long sittings I can now say this is an absolutely fantastic game. Sites all over the net made it clear this is a must play game, being in numerous top 10 games of all time and top 10 RPGs of all time lists. And I have to say it's certainly made mine too! For starters the setting; Sci-fi/Cyberpunk. It looks great! Obviously to today's standards the graphics are poor but if you're like most sane and decent gamers you won't let that stop you from playing it. If it makes you feel any better there are mods to improve the graphics, but I always recommend playing games vanilla first time through to get the intended feel of the game. The game is a First-person shooter/Roleplaying hybrid that is well known with classic Looking Glass games. Again to today's standards the combat may be a little but clunky but overall get's the job done. My only minor nitpick is the wrench as it's so damn annoying to attack smaller enemies because it's constantly missing! In terms of roleplaying you have a lot to work with, with the potential for 3 different types of characters it adds a lot of replay value as well as the potential for many character builds. Personally I went in as the typical soldier/'warrior' build and just beefed up on strength and my guns but you could master tech hacking your way through levels opening chests and disabling security or you could us PSI (Psionics - Imagine it as System Shocks 'magic') This type of character gives you tonnes of skills like shields, telekinesis, firing projectiles and so much more. So many potential character builds and different ways to approach the game. System Shock 2 also comes under another genre, survival horror. Now for the most part I'd say it is a First-person shooter, action roleplaying game, However the atmosphere in most of the levels of this game is intense. The enemies themselves creep around the decks of the ship stalking you and I'm not going to lie they made me jump and made me scream like a little girl on numerous occasions, especially earlier in the game when I felt underpowered. The way the NPCs speak is also quite chilling at times. I would say however that as the game progresses, some of the later levels lose that horror edge, but it doesn't completely detract from the game. Now a few final things to finish up on. The major thing I disliked about this game was movement, again It's an old game, old engine, old physics etc, but getting stuck in tiny nooks and crannies was seriously frustrating (I'm looking at you last levels!) And although I love the climbing in this game (It works like Thief) some times it was unresponsive and unpredictable. And of course we can't forget the story. It's great, It's not the best story but it's certainly good and I think you should experience it for yourself! System Shock 2 - 9/10			"

												1999.Ken Levine, in co-develope with Irrational Games and Looking Glass Studios, brought us one of the most expected sequel of the last century. System Shock 2. Mixing RPG, FPS, Survival Horror and Adventure.After 30 years, TriOptimums went to bankruptcy and all the stock was bought by a Russian company named A. Korenchkin, who restored the company after a decade and its signing now weapon contracts with politicians and military organizationes.Then 12 after the events in Citadel TriOptimum is restored, in fact is now testing a new FTL ship, called the Von Braun which is not alone. Another ship is following it, named Rickenbacker. Why? Simple, Rickenbacker does not have a FTL device, so it needs to be ""attached"" to the Von Braum for the trip.5 months after and you´ll wake up in your cryo-tube inside the Von Braum to find out that something has happened there...This is just an introduction about the plot, which is very interesting. Now lets move to the gameplay.System Shock uses the Dark Engine (yep the same as Thief: Dark Project) but it is slightly different. It wasnt finished so the programmers were fixing bugs when encountered. BUT this only makes things better, because they were working closely with the engine code allowing them to ""create"" or ""write"" additional features. Thats why we said that the Dark Engine in SS2 is the Enhanced Dark Engine. In addition to this fact the DE (Dark Engine) was able to display a wide variety of colored lighting, thats why SS2 uses some tricks with lighting and sounds to create a perfect atmosphere of terror.The worst part about the DE is the limit in the polygons (only 1024), but this can be fixed with some mods, besides if you´re not a Graphic ♥♥♥♥♥ you´ll deal with it.As i said above, this game has consciousness about his best points, sound and lighting, but we are not talking about screamers. We are talking about subtle Terror full of hues, as the good terror-touch should be. Just an example, during the game, youll heard the enemies claiming this response ""We are part of the many"" this ""many"" is the ""Hive"" created by the enemies to defeat the human beings in the ships, now they know (and WE know) that you are alone, and they try to delve into that fact to psychically destroy you.As for the RPG, SS2 keeps a good Skill-System that allows you to perform a wide variety of actions during the game, this is possible with the ""Cyber-modules"" given as rewards for searching or completing objectives. But this is a good CRPG system so you wont be able to upgrade EVERYTHING. Here it is why:-First, it encourages you to replay the game. Every skill build will be different, each one will provide you something, and EVERYTHING can be a tool to achieve your goal, win the game.-Secondly, and the most remarkable. It adds difficulty to the game. Difficulty its not a way to qualify a game. But it helps to define it, here in SS2 you wont be able to restore your Cybermodules, they are limited, valuable and its use will reward you, so be mindful of your purpose.-Thirdly, motivation. Want to be the best Psico/Hacker/Soldier/etc..? Give your best. Dont expect to be the best being a passive-player, the more you risk the more you´ll achieve. Some room will have nanites (money) or another item that you need, and OF COURSE they´ll be enemies around, turrets or security robots, so break your mind, build up your tactic and try to overcome adversity in order to improve your character.Apart from CRPG, Adventure and Horror the shooter part is so well oiled, i mean seriously you have an entire arsenal to use, every weapon has its own stats, effects and mechanics, so you can ALWAYS get another weapon, avoiding that bland part in every game when you only get 1 weapon for all things...Also the game includes a degradation and maintenance of the weapons and a variety of ammo.Back in the day this game was relevant, nice scores, many awards, positives reviews...But only the time bring System Shock 2 to the summit, it has a lot of followers, a Cult Follower, an active community of modders since 1999... I know that i left a lot of things in the inkwell, but this game is that sort of game that must be played, not read.			"

												Imagine your very person, locked up in a cryogenic chamber aboard a gigantic starship en route to a very distant place from home. Imagine yourself, facing dreadful foes who have never seen the face of Earth. Imagine both your mind and body enprisoned within an enormous metallic beast with close-to-nothing to survive. Will you manage it? Or you will let Mankind's demise shrivel from your unstill hands? Okay that was a dramatic way to put it, but it gives you the idea of how much this game affects me. We have a very deep plot as well as a good Cyberpunk atmosphere, furthermore there is an endless line of items!The faults that this game has are various:-Old (can be renewed with mods)-You don't want it to end! (remember when you played for the first time DE:HR? Same thing here! You don't want it to end! (Luckily there is the stunning editor explored in detail furtherly)MULTIPLAYER WARNING!I noticed that when using two or more Windows XPs (who got them anymore?) there are no so many crashes. However if you do use an XP and a 7 (or just two modern guys) you got problems (this is probably due to some sync issue or just Win 7 can't bear it to have such an old guy like that).I DO RECOMMEND:1) GRAPHICS ENHANCEMENTThe graphics can be enhanced through a variety of mods which you can find here:https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=4447.0orhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/shtup-system-shock-2-texture-upgrade2) DROMED (or ShockEd)And there is DromEd, a powerful Editor which will boost gameplay (if you have both patience and time):https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?board=38.0Take a seat during free-time, and watch the tutorials which are very helpful. BE SURE TO INSTALL THE TOOLKIT AT:https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=5312.03) THE ORIGINALI would recommend to play the first installment of System Shock in order to get the bigger picture of what SHODAN is, after you finished the second one. Why? Because otherwise it would spoil everything. You are so lucky if you do not know the existence of the first installment or whatever goes on there, for you can enjoy this game far way better.You can find it online:https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=211.0You can find it here on Steam too! (but for a price)It is aged, but works just fine. This is just for old-timers.In short:Every game you play (from FPS to RPGs) has been directly or indirectly been inspired by this true masterpiece. So if you do not have it, well it's like missing Dante's Trilogy in your home library (well not that so, but say something like a must-have).Okay this looks like a game with inefable emotions attached to it. You can either buy it (suggested) or not (God Bless You).Thanks for reading.			"

												You know what's so special about this game? The fact that the graphics are bad. Well, I mean you can improve them with mods which make them look ok, but nothing compared to what today's games can accomplish. That means that the only way this game maintains it's horror aspect is through crushingly oppressive atmosphere, and sound design. Most of the voice acting is very good, and results in a convincing sense of urgency and panic. I heard in a different review for this game that a part of the voice acting that makes it so good and adds to the atmosphere is that the characters don't sound dramatic, they only wish to be heard in a hopes that someone will recieve the message. Other parts of the sound design hold up very well. (some of it even sounds still today very disturbing.) Before I go any further, I must mention the writing is also superb. The hybrids sound scary and tortured, begging you the protagonist to put them out of their misery. The humans sound scared and panicked adding more to the loneliness of the atmosphere. And the cyborg midwifes are beyond terrifying, their humanity washed away by mechanical brainwash, and their monotone voices muttering the most unrealistic yet perfectly written dialogue that makes you almost want to avoid them entirely. (This is my personal experience, tell me how you reacted to them when you get to deck three.) I'm not mentioning anything about the rpg mechanics just because I feel like the game is worth playing just for the atmosphere, I am stunned how well this game still terrifies after eighteen years. Play it, it is definitely worth it. This system shock games are terrific, and I feel they should get moer recognition compared to the bioshock games. (While great games as well, I do not feel they hold up nearly as well if you think on a broader spectrum.) Enjoy the game, it is amazing even to this day.			"

												I played this after BioShock but I like this one more.  The elderly graphics don't bother me too much, but then I am used to older games.  The story is fantastic and you can easily see where the developers incorporated the plot from this game into BioShock.SHODAN is easily one of the best video game villains of all all time.  Her voice is both terrifying and seductive and she gives me the absolute creeps.  The Many was no slouch, either. It's not easy to find a scary game that disturbs me.  I've seen a lot of horror and I'm not easily freaked out by monsters, gore, or jump scares.  System Shock 2, however, provides a haunting experience that I highly recommend.There are clunky aspects to the game, however, since the RPG stat-building elements are not well-balanced.  Some paths are far more viable than others, and the game practically begs you to take hacking as a skill.  Even so, it can be fun to make a strange build to provide a greater challenge. And speaking of challenge, I appreciated what I experienced in System Shock 2.  It's very easy to die in this game, and you need to be conservative if you rely on ammo to kill most enemies because they do respawn.  If you're careful and focus on melee during the early levels you can do well near the end game, but even when I did that the final areas took me a few tries to complete.  When compared to BioShock, which provides most of its challenge at the beginning of the game, this was very refreshing.  It's my favorite game on Steam for a reason!			"

												I had heard great things about this game, which BioShock is said to be a spiritual sequel of, so when I saw it on sale, I decided to buy it to give it a try. And I don't regret it. The comparisons between this and BioShock are pretty much spot on, but I must say that this game seems like a more complex version of BioShock; a great thing, in my opinion.The gameplay is pretty varied, from the number of different weapons you can get, to the psionic abilities. The RPG aspects are pretty good as well, allowing you to customize your character according to your playstyle. The weapons get damaged over time, which means that you must perform maintenance on them periodically, otherwise they'll end up breaking (you can still repair them, though). The hacking mechanic is good, and the research function, which sometimes requires you to find the appropriate elements for your research is excellent.As far as environments go, you can go almost anywhere. You can return to earlier sections of the ship to look for stuff you left there, and all the different decks have their unique style. There's a good variety of enemies, each with their own weaknesses and strength, which you can learn about by researching their organs after you kill them. It also has a good soundtrack, and the story, without spoilers, is excellent.I really recommend this game, especially if you enjoyed the original BioShock.			"

												I just can't get enough of this game... Ever since I beat it I can't stop thinking about it. This is easily one of the best games I've ever played. There is nothing else like it... Which sucks. The atmosphere of this game in incredible, it's mix of RPG elements and survival horror are unmatched, and the story and audio are phenomenal. I will say however that this game WILL NOT hold your hand! It can be very hard and sometimes frustrating. So if you don't like a challenge you can always put it on easy without it ruining the experience. If you don't have this game though you need to buy it. It goes on sale quite often so there is no excuse. This game is a classic that sits up there with the ranks of Half Life, Portal, and Bioshock. 9.5/10			"

												One of the best games of all time and masterfully crafted by one of the best game developers to ever have existed, System Shock 2 stands proud as a paragon of game design. The atmosphere, gameplay, story, and sound design are all so top notch that I have doubts any game will ever surpass it. If you can handle the immense difficulty, terrifying horror, and somewhat dated graphics, then by all means pick up this game and play it through to the finish. It is, at the very least, worth a playthrough in order to better understand one of the highest-praised video games in history.			"

												System Shock 2 is truly the pinnacle of Sci-Fi horror. It combines complex, deep and challenging gameplay into one sweet result. The game feels overwhelming at first but once you get past the 2 or 3 hours mark you slowly start to understand how the game works. The game's complex level design makes exploring very satisfying, and very rewarding too. Audio logs contains usefull passwords and stuff, really easy to miss. So its really important to look everywhere before continuing on. Enemies spawn at random too, so you can come back to an earlier zone and there will still be hybrids roaming around. Kinda forces you to stay on your guard at all times. The game features a pretty elaborate research system, too. If you pick up a strange item, you can research it and get damage bonus on certain enemies or even use the items as temporary upgrades on you. However there's a catch, you can't just research everything you want. You have to find special chemicals stored inside rooms in some levels. Not all levels share the same chemicals too, so you have to check in every room for the required chemicals. I thought that was pretty deep and well conceived. I thought there was too few items to reasearch too. theres maybe 10~ total.The game features an evil AI called Shodan. Probably my favorite antagonist in any game ever. The developpers made sure to handle the characther with great care, every single of her quotes are all very memorable and devilishly creepy. The atmostphere in this game is perfect. Don't let the old graphics scare you away. The graphics adds a certain charm to the game, there is nothing quite like the atmosphere you can find in System Shock 2. I believe its atsmophere is what makes the game so special in its own way. Hacking seems complicated at first, but it becomes pretty simple when you discover that you cant do anything about it and that your hacking stats does everything for you. Basicly, you just have to click the blue squares and hope something good happens! Its a good idea to upgrade every hacking skills though. The game actually requires you to hack something to make progress. So you cant run away from it.All in all i think its a fantastic game and is worth everyone's attention. Its captivating gameplay and atmosphere is sure to make any hardcore rpg fans very satisfied! "

												I probably won’t be saying much of what has already been said about this game, but in my opinion System Shock 2 is one of the most pivotal games to hit the market.  System Shock 2 arguably created a type of genre that has been and is still being mimicked/used to this day in the gaming market; and that genre is what I call the FPS/RPG survival hybrid; you see this ‘inventory and upgrade’ based system in many of today’s games for both survival and shooter style games alike.  System Shock 2, although somewhat antiquated for today’s standards was very groundbreaking for its time (this could be said about both SS1 and 2), but without saying more repetitive rhetoric that’s already been said I will get down to the pro/con list in this game that I think is appropriate:Pros:-Groundbreaking FPS/RPG hybrid that works very well even to today’s standards.-Very immersive atmosphere (it really does feel like your there).-Fluid and extremely customizable and varied control scheme system (you can even save your control scheme setup!).-Varied options in terms of playstyle and choice of weaponry.-Various interesting choices and options that actually make you THINK in which a lot of modern games today even lack.-Small options and features that only add to the immersion such as weapon customization and maintenance, hacking games, inventory management perks and sub-perks, and a currency system for hacking and the purchasing of items via ‘value-rep/vending machines’ (you can even add markers on the mini map and name them as well as add markers in the level in real-time).-Occurrences in the game that were some of the first of their kind (‘meeting shodan’ for example).-A game engine that seems to have stood the test of time (with the recent (and even old) updates to the game it runs extremely fluid on pretty much all modern systems).-Fun and satisfying combat.-The game creates an overall feeling of fear and tension that was done well.-Interesting and diverse enemies to fight against.-Very high replay value.Cons:-Some of the options available for upgrade/purchase can be redundant and useless (although every option does have its uses depending on playstyle and skill level of the player).-Some minor bugs/exploits.-cyber interface and control scheme can be somewhat complicated for new players.Overall I consider System Shock 2 to be one of my few personal all-time favorite games and I place it high on my list.  I feel that if you enjoy FPS games and like deep immersion you really should consider giving this game a try.  My rating breakdown:-.1 some redundant upgrade and weapon choices dependent somewhat upon playstyle-.1 minor bugs/exploits(10-.2 = 9.8)Final rating of 9.8/10			"

												It may have been overshadowed by the scope of its contemporary, Deus Ex, and the streamlined accessibility of its spiritual successor, BioShock, but System Shock 2 was unique in its day and still holds its own today as a classic First-Person Action RPG, providing an experience that, unfortunately, still hasn't quite been reproduced in any other game since.The original System Shock was somewhat ahead of its time (consequently it suffered from questionable execution of some of its ideas such as with its controls) whereas Shock 2 arrived at just the right time to help define the Immersive Sim genre with an arguably more refined take on the cyberpunk horror concept. Created from a collaboration between Looking Glass Studios and Irrational Games, Shock 2 has many similar traits to other games from the school of immersive sims such as Thief and the aforementioned Deus Ex. Atmosphere, world-building and multi-solution problems - all pillars of the genre - are to be found here in abundance.With deep customization trees that allow you to use all kinds of weapons and tools and develop exotic powers, Shock 2 allows you to approach the game in a variety of ways, and then return to its creepy hallways with a new character build for a different experience. Enlist with the Marines to wield the heavy-duty military weapons found scattered across the Von Braun; or spend some time in deep space with the Navy and learn to use highly technical engineering tools such as hacking and energy-based weapons; or maybe you'd rather get in touch with your inner zen and gain mastery in the powers of the mind. Shock 2 might make you work to earn each and every skill point, but it rewards investment into specialisations.Shock 2's story is told through an impressive number of different narrative devices, each serving to slowly reveal the mysterious ship, its previous owners, and its new inhabitants. Clear plot points and objectives keep you moving forward through the numerous decks of the ship. While wireless transmissions, audio logs and emails are the norm in today's games, they were still new and innovative when Shock 2 made use of them. The game steers clear from technical hurdles that would shatter your immersion - there are no awkward NPCs to draw you out of the experience - instead, the game emphasizes isolation and loneliness, and the characters come to life through their voices, whether logging their last moments or speaking into your receiver to instruct you with dubious intent. In fact, the sound design may be Shock 2’s crowning achievement. The doom-ambiance of the cargo bays will be an enduring memory for those who have gone through that harrowing ordeal. The multitude of enemies identify themselves through their terrifying sounds, such as the tragi-horrific moans from grunts of the Many, urging you to kill them, and the ear-splitting screeches of the psi-enhanced monkeys. The iconic antagonist SHODAN is memorably characterized by her evilly seductive and corrupted speech, echoing throughout the ship and reverberating within your skull.Shock 2 won’t be considered a looker today - it certainly wasn't at the time either - but there are a few community-built mods available to help make it more palatable to the eye. By and large, you’ll still have to develop a taste for its neon-green cyberpunk aesthetics and hard-hitting techno soundtrack, but if you do, you’ll find plenty of interesting enemies and well-realised locations as you explore. The layout of the ship follows a believable structure, with different decks for different purposes such as the Medical wing that you start out in, and the Recreational deck complete with a swimming pool and basketball court. The HUD successfully feels like a cool sci-fi neural interface, allowing you to manage your inventory, browse through your logs and emails, upgrade your software and even conduct research on unknown materials. Not to mention the inclusion of a mini game console, complete with game titles to collect like Overworld Zero, a roguelike to help you unwind during your downtime or to kill the minutes as a security alarm ticks down. The combat might feel rather stiff and clumsy owing to the game’s dated engine, but if you approach every scenario with careful preparation and strategic thinking, you’ll overcome the odds without much fumbling.All of which is to say that there is so much to System Shock 2 that is worth your time. It’s not easy to get into, but it’s almost impossible to let go of.  It rewards exploration of its mechanics, environments and story. It is a classic that endures the test of time and continues to influence games and gamers, a decade on.			"

												This game is old. However, it does so many things right that even modern video games can't get right.If you like old, classic games, or just want to visit for a nostalgia trip of 90s gaming this game is a must buy! It is one of the best by far!Pros:- Voice acting is CRISP CLEAN! Even the audio logs (or whatever they're called).-Atmosphere is great (makes you really feel you're in a screwed up situation)-One of the best villains of all time (Shodan <3)-Amazing horror elements-Alright story (my opinion)-Great level designCons-There are WAY too many audio logs-AI can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times-Sometimes it's hard even on Easy mode.-I never got into using PSI very often. -The UI isn't perfect. It's a bit clunky.-The normal weapon recoil is just stupid.-They could have done a better job on the tutorial.-I never got multiplayer to workOverall, despite the issues it has it is quickly overcome when you get used to it. And it's a smooth experience there after.**** There are no friendly NPCs in the game due to the memory limitations from the 90s. I refused to put it on the list as a con as it was a problem way back in 1999 and they really can't do anything about it now. But yes, due to this the game can get pretty lonely at times. You just want to see a friendly face after a while.*But hey! There are mods to make your experience better ya know! ;)Buy this game immediately! Or buy it on a sale like I did for a $1.50. System Shock 2 is a steal for that price! Because yes, there are better games for the same price or even lower. So I'd recommend waiting for a sale. But either way this game is worth every penny.This game sits on one of my favourite games of all time! It's good! It's fun! It gives a good experience! And has one of the most memorable villains of all time! Shodan <3My overall score to System Shock 2 is a 8/10. Despite its problems it's well worth for its time.It's a must buy.			"

												This is the greatest video game ever made.I realize that's a hard sell.It's also the truth, at least, in my own personal opinion. Rebind the keys, check out PC Gaming Wiki's modding guide to improve the archaic graphics, put on some headphones, stick it up on a good-sized monitor (something that takes up a lot of your field of view, ideally), get past the initial opening hump, and experience the game that inspired so many greats, from Bioshock to Portal, Dead Space to Fallout 3.System Shock 2 is the game that inspired a friend of mine to say ""hey, you're right, Doc, it is better than Bioshock!"" One of the highest-rated games of all time, but System Shock 2 outdoes it. It's a better horror game, a better adventure game, a better RPG, and an all-around better game than Bioshock. Its widespread influence on gaming is undeniable, and at least, if not more influential, than Half-Life.Yeah, it's old, so it looks ugly and doesn't have the kind of animation quality you might find in a newer game. Yeah, the weapons degrade, and some people don't like that. Yeah, the key bindings are weird and awful. But it's great. This game has some of the best atmosphere and storytelling you'll ever encounter, and the experience will sear itself into your brain, the way staring at the sun sears itself onto your eyeballs.You may play games you think are better, but you'll be hard-pressed to admit that this isn't one of the best games of all time.There is no better horror game than this. There are fewer, if any, better gaming narratives than this. Nothing possesses the same emotional highs and lows, even when almost directly copying the game, as Bioshock and Dead Space did.Remember Citadel. Remember 45100. Have a blast. You won't regret trying.			"

												Great game. Scary at some points. Something about monsterus humans screaming about how you should run because they don't have control of their bodies gives me the creeps.The game is an old deus ex like shooter. It has all the fun stuff like save scumming and an overly complex character customization system. I mean there are like 7 systems in place at the same time to consider when upgrading your character. Psy stuff, stat points, weapon proficiency, etc. All different categories. On top of that there’s weapon durability to consider, (weapons jam and have to be hacked or repaired in a different way when warn down) type of armour that’s best for a situation to consider and the whatever-they’re-called things that give passive bonuses but run out of rechargeable energy things to equip. There’s a whole lot of complicated systems at play in this game. SS2 comes from an era before game systems were dumbed-down for players.Enemies respawn but supplies don’t meaning that you’re always sort of on a clock until you’re screwed with no ammo. At some points there are ‘hallways of death’ that are over-tuned and spawn too many enemies every time you have to pass through them. The game encourages specializing in one weapon type but is sparse with ammo suggesting the use of multiple weapons be the best course of action.In the early part of the game character logs that play back audio are great. Latter on in the game enemies are way more powerful and there’s not really a moment of downtime to listen to them. They stack up. This isn’t a big deal.The whole psy stuff is cumbersome. Basically the game has a system of using things similar to dues ex augments. Stuff like ‘use this much energy to get a 2 minute long damage reduction shield.’ It’s hard to specialize in psy weapon stuff when you don’t know ahead of time if you’ll ever even use half the abilities they provide. Changing abilities in battle is also hazardous.The game has a great pace. The game introduces new enemies one at a time. It builds up to the moment and the enemies are really hard when first encountered. Then as time goes on and the player becomes more powerful and new enemies are introduced the old enemies become easy to deal with. This is fun and makes you feel powerful despite your power increase coinciding with the increase of power of enemies.The game can’t be stealth’d. This is no dues ex. If an enemy is close they know where you are.The game has a fun twist where you were being directed by the evil AI the entire time. Going-in to the game, basically reading any sort of thing such as the description of the game you’d know ahead of time this was going to happen so this isn’t a spoiler. The thing is: since you know it’ll happen you sort of just wait for it and it’s a bit of a let down.For some reason the main character can just sort of see ghost custseans every so often. The game explains it with some techno mumbo jumbo. It’s as if the game devs wanted to put everything into the game including the kitchen sink. They really packed the game with stuff that seems unnecessary. Remember before when I mentioned the 7 systems at play at once. Same sort of thing here. There’s no need for randomly 5 or so ghost events to happen for no reason.The game sort of has a pothole where the AI you’re working with takes over all the ship’s systems but security cameras and bots and stuff are still against you. Wtf? By the way the entire game, well most of it is on a super massive space ship. It even has a shopping mall. It feels like a ship that can support having a shopping mall in it. It’s just that big. There’s a bit of backtracking in the game. It’s fun to go back to old areas. The first wing of the game is basically getting access to 5 main floors of the ship. It feels like a cohesive world when all floors are accessible. Then the game’s like whops there’s a new elevator and now the game is a more linier path forward until the end. Then eventually the player gets to a point of no-going-back and it feels bad to never revisit all the areas cleared of alien infection. BTW there’s an alien parasite sort of thing and that’s why everyone’s dead. The AI you work with made it in SS1.Anyways. Good game over-all. The very end’s trippy. The final cutsean of the game’s hilarious. No spoilers.			"

												A very complex game. It has a lot of RPG elements in it, and i wouldn't recommend it to people who doesn't have the patience for such things. With that out of the way, this game excels in most of the things it sets out to. Combat can feel wonky due to the stiff animations, but with character stats, backpack management, weapon management (including repairing jammed weapons, unloading guns before throwing them away, modifying and improving them. ), psionics (think plasmids from bioshock, but more difficult to use and a much broader range of abilities), research of foreign materials and navigation via maps and signs, you'll be too busy to be bothered.Creepy atmosphere, creepy enemies and creepy political undertones. Groundbreaking game.Edit: ""Nah""10/10			"

Should you play this game?Short Answer:Yes- I’d certainly recommend it. This game is lauded as one of the greatest PC games of yesteryear for a reason- and I can see why it has afforded such lavish praise. So long as you are a fan of first person action RPGs with horror elements, as well as the admittedly familiar setting of “abandoned space ship crawling with monsters”, I would say you only stand to gain from playing this game. However, I found that there was a learning curve to surpass before I was able to fully enjoy the game (although this may differ for other people)- so be aware of that.Long Answer:Background Info:First person action/survival horror RPG, developed by Looking Glass Studios and Irrational Games. System Shock 2 is one third of the triumvirate of quintessential PC games from the past, alongside Thief: The Dark Project and Deus Ex. The game was made using the Dark Engine- a fact that I consider important and will address later on. Gameplay:The game plays out as an action RPG primarily, with the survival horror elements taking a backseat. The game controls very well- not much more to say there. Gameplay-wise, I was expecting the game to play out like Doom 3 (a game similar to SS2 in both genre and premise). I was expecting to be thrown into the game, issued an objective and I would pick up a variety of weapons throughout the game to make killing the denizens of the space ship easier on my way to the end.I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was mistaken. Instead, SS2 treated me to a huge array of action RPG options, such as a detailed and nuanced skills system, armour and an arsenal of weapons that caters to many playstyles. I was shocked to see how detailed these gameplay systems were when considering the somewhat limited setting of the game. They’re the kind of systems that I would expect to see in an open-world game such as Fallout rather than the confines of SS2’s space ship. Nevertheless, these mechanics give the game huge scope for replayability. Put briefly, there are four areas that you can spend your upgrade points on: Combat, Tech, Psi, and Stats. There is a lot on offer, especially when you consider that the Psi category has 5 whole categories of skills. This is one of the reasons for the learning curve. There’s such a huge array of choice that I felt overwhelmed at first- as I didn’t know what to upgrade in order to see everything on offer in the game (word to the wise- invest some points in hacking and research: they’re necessary to beat the game). It took me a good few restarts until I had devised a skillset that I was happy with, but when I did reach that point I had a lot of fun afterwards. Similarly, the skills system isn’t explained very well. Instead of picking your starting skills from a menu and then beginning the game; you are booted into a tutorial wherein starting skill acquisition is linked with ingame lore (Eg. Navy=Tech, Marines=Combat etc.). The whole process is longwinded, boring and individual skills are very poorly explained- which only compounds the issue of a learning curve. Final Verdict: The depth of SS2’s gameplay systems makes them the game’s greatest strength, in my opinion. However, the skill system lacks clarity- establishing a learning curve which could deter new players. I recommend perseverance- it’s worth it.Soundtrack:The soundtrack is fantastic. It matches the game’s cyber, futuristic setting and each tune is memorable. However, while the soundtrack does match the game’s setting, it does not match the game’s genre quite so much (IE the survival horror aspect). For me, the music didn’t connote an eerie, oppressive atmosphere as much as it did a fast-paced, frantic one. This is one of the reasons why I consider the game more of an action RPG than a survival horror. There is one notable exception near the end of the game though; one level where your only companion is your footsteps and the ambience of the stage. Final Verdict: The OST perfectly matches the setting, but not so much the genre. Whether or not this is a good thing is debatable, but I for one am glad that we got an enjoyable, memorable soundtrack. Story and Setting:Thankfully you don’t need to have played the original System Shock to appreciate this game’s story. The general gist of the story is that the player wakes up from cryosleep aboard the space ship known as the Von Braun to discover that it is overrun with creatures. They are then tasked with escaping by a benefactor at the other end of the communication device.  The rest of the game’s story is mostly left to the player to figure out; namely via acquiring audio logs that shed more light on the events that led up to the ship’s downfall. Thus the main body of the game’s plot is available via optional collectibles. This could have been problematic for players who don’t stray from the beaten path, but thankfully the developers have accounted for this. Specifically, exploration is essential in SS2. It’s not just encouraged- it’s necessary. Some audio logs contain codes for doors, for example. Ergo even if you’re not directly searching for further insight into the plot, you’ll probably end up finding it anyway due to the emphasis on exploration. The plot itself is adequate- not too interesting or unique; however let’s just say that the antagonist of the game is iconic for good reason. Final Verdict: Although the story itself isn’t too special, the way in which it’s presented to the player is well done. In terms of this narrative style, a close comparison would be Dark Souls (although without the ambiguity). Game Engine and Graphics:The graphics are acceptable- not very detailed but also not unpleasant to look at. As for the game engine, I find the choice of using the Dark Engine slightly questionable. After all, this engine’s biggest asset is its audio capabilities- as the player’s footsteps change depending on the surface being walked on. Thief played to this strength very well- because it was a stealth game. SS2, on the other hand, does not. You can still hear your footsteps and how they change, but this ability doesn’t factor into gameplay at all. The lack of this strength accentuates the weaknesses of the engine- such as weird character models (which makes the enemies look ridiculous and often funny instead of scary) and some muddy textures. Final Verdict: SS2 could have been more effective in most departments if it had played more to the strengths of its game engine. I question the use of the Dark Engine; however I can understand it given Looking Glass Studios’ involvement in the game (since they designed the engine themselves). Conclusion:SS2's biggest strength lies in the most important part of any game (in my opinion): the gameplay. The systems are detailed, there’s a myriad of gameplay choices and above all it’s fun. This strength supersedes all of the weaknesses for me and I strongly recommend that you play the game if only for this aspect. The soundtrack is excellent as well, and compliments the setting and fast-paced gameplay very well. The story is adequate, but presented in an interesting way. The biggest weakness for me is the poorly explained skill systems and the choice of game engine; however even these flaws weren’t enough to hinder my enjoyment overall. As soon as I passed the learning curve I enjoyed the game until the very end. Final note: if you are thinking of buying the game only for the fear factor, I wouldn’t recommend it. I wasn’t scared at all, due in most part to the ridiculous-looking enemies and utter lack of a scary atmosphere (although this is a subjective matter). Nevertheless, I whole-heartedly recommend this game and I believe it deserves the lofty praise it receives.			"

												(Disclaimer: I've spent much more time in SyS 2 but outside of Steam).Beforehand: I'm as far into the game that I just have to share my thoughts with you. I started with the vanilla version but I spent most of the time with a modded version (community patch, various texture and graphical mods). So my experience is mostly based on a patched up SyS 2.As many others, I knew Bioshock before I've heard of SyS 2. I was aware that Bioshock was heavily influenced by Sys 2, the one can be seen as the spiritual successor or the other way round SyS 2 as the predecessor.Some say that SyS 2 is the better game and I was sceptical about that because of the game's age and Bioshock's quality. Well, it's a matter of taste and I won't debate it here. (Let's finally start with the review at this point.) However what SyS 2 delivers is downright beautiful. I actually turned the new NPC models (mod) off because the original ones with high poly scare the pie out of me.This refers to my first point: -Atmosphere- The setting presented is executed in a brilliant way. Music (ambient one, not the DnB/Techno - at least for my taste) and surrounding are intertwined beautifully. Additionaly the mechanics and gameplay add to the hostile feeling and environment because you're constantly short on supplies. You are worried about every next step. This again meets with the urge to explore. The game does it right, because not only you want to explore, you also have to because of the supply shortage. And you don't feel forced to as well as you will get rewarded for your curiosity without making the game predictable.I forgot to mention the customization which goes far deeper than in e.g. Bioshock. Your character can be developed in innumerous ways - not only in terms of common classes. In sum classes and specialization are very ""fluid"". Everything makes sense in-game - it isn't just there, so you can do it but it's thought through. The way this game makes you making choices is just hard to be matched.-Realism- Some people classify this game as a ""sim fpsrpg"" and that for a reason. E.g. every weapon wears off. You can maintain, repair and modify objects. Certain weapons work on certain enemies etc. You have to know and can research your enemies weaknesses. It boils down to stats eventually but also on how you approach every single situation. Gunplay (if focused by your way of playing) itself isn't very satisfying but it serves its purpose. -AI- Well the AI has aged but it has implemented the stages of awareness you might know of the Thief titles - being suspicious, alerted, etc. It may be clunky but pathfinding works good and it strangely fits the game. It is bone-hard to beat anyway, and the AI makes it even scarier.Some final words: Of course the game has faced enough criticism as well for being clunky and overly complex but I guess the community patches have brought some extra balance and smoothed out the rough edges (graphically and figuratevly speaking). And the mod manager let's you turn mods on and off (!) in a matter of seconds which is a big advantage compared to dumb copy and paste of modded directories. Simply put, the (modding) community is great - also thanks to Looking Glass Studios.Ad Backtracking criticism: I don't consider this as a problem. As aforementioned - it makes sense and is part of the realism. Furthermore it adds to reduce linearity so often seen in games and it rewards players who can memorise stuff.Final words: SyS 2 reminds you of what a game can be and what a game can and should do right. I recommend it to everyone and plead for some patience of those who feel e.g. overwhelmed at first.Yours,B.			"

												In 1997, three Looking Glass employees left their jobs and founded Irrational Games. Their first project was to work with Looking Glass on a sequel to one of the most innovative FPS games of all time. The end result was of the most atmospheric, immersive, frightening and enjoyable games I've ever played.System Shock 2 is a thinking man's shooter, a complex RPG, a stealth game and a survival horror nightmare combined with an amazing story to tie it all together.The game is set in the year 2114, 42 years after the events of the original game and, while it helps in a few places, you do not need to have played the first game in order to fully enjoy this one.You start as a nameless soldier applying to enrol into the UNN. After 4 years of service in your chosen branch of the UNN military, you are called upon to join the crew of the Von Braun, which is about to take her maiden voyage into the furthest reaches of space. You wake up on-board, with no memory of the last few weeks, to find that the crew has been slaughtered by an unidentified force.In System Shock 2, every single bullet is crucial to your survival as you explore the open-ended environments. You will also have to think about what ammo to use against what targets, maintaining, repairing and upgrading your weapons to keep them in good condition, hacking computers, replicators and security systems and upgrading your cybernetic gear to allow you to carry more items, run faster, hit harder, hack better and take more damage. You will not be able to purchase all upgrades or master everything so choosing wisely is essential.Don't expect to be guided by the hand however, you will have to find your own way around the ship. You can and will have to revisit previous areas of the ship and any items you have left there will still be there on your return journey. Don't expect cleared out areas to remain safe however, the game will keep you on your toes by re-spawning enemies making very few areas safe for long.Talking about environments, this isn't a dark, miserable, flickery lighting infested place. This is a place where people had to live; you'll not only visit warehouses, docking areas, loading bays and shuttle bay areas but also living quarters and recreational areas, a casino, movie theatre and even a botanical garden!  There are some other amazing places too but well.. where's the fun in me telling you everything? ;)As for the story, its told in a way similar to that of the original game; you'll find audio logs around the ship made by the crew. From every day chores they had, love interests, moaning about co-workers to what is happening to them as they're recording, the logs give you a picture of what happened to them and may even help you find things hidden around the ship for your own survival.System Shock 2 is built on the same technology Thief uses, known at the Dark Engine. Because of this, the advanced character controlling and stealth mechanisms are carried over to Shock 2. You can hide in the shadows and observe enemies and their behaviour. Enemies can hear you and can be distracted by noise, they'll search the area if suspicious of your presence and will alert their allies if you are seen or manage to escape from them after a fight doesn't go as planned.For all its amazing points, the game does have some faults; some of the RPG skill branches don't make much sense, the level design at times feels rushed. The character models, even for the time, were incredibly ugly and whilst the game's story ends on a high note, the ending is a massive 'To be continued...' bombshell that may never get fully answered.This is the pinnacle of 90's PC Gaming. Games like Deus Ex and BioShock would never have been made without this and games like Borderlands, Fallout 3/New Vegas, Dishonored, Mass Effect and Dead Space all went on to borrow elements from this one game.Absolutely 100% recommended!

												So I finally got around to beating System Shock 2 and I have to say I’m impressed. Even after all these years, not unlike the original 2 Thief games, SS2 holds up quite well even by today’s standards. The story is immersive and given that this series was the precursor for the Bioshock series, there are RPG elements related to how you level your character’s attributes which actually have an impact on how the game plays out (i.e. if you increase you hack skill enough you’ll be able to instantly perform a security override without the need to actually hack anything when one of those annoying security cams sees you, granted you’ll still need to find the nearest security interface to do so... but still).The premise of the game, though not necessarily unique in the plot twist it presents, essentially has you teaming up with Shodan (the AI main baddie from SS – totally hot!) to stop the AI Xerxes (not to be confused with the bling’d-out god king from 300 – total d-bag!) controlling the vessel you’re on, among other things. There are droids, security bots, zombie droids, egg sacks, turrets, spiders, larval worm things, monkeys, monsters and mutant freaks aplenty to be found throughout the game. To combat them you can make use of a Psi device with various properties, like kinesis or a cryo blast, and there are firearms as well. However, those things aside, nothing beats the wrench that you’ll gain access to early on – just level your strength up all the way and smite thine foes into oblivion!!Sure, the graphics are a little clunky and there are a few wonky things going on with the AI in the game itself at times, but any pseudo horror/sci-fi game is worth a go and the idea of a sentient AI running amok has never been creepier than in this series that paved the way for so much else, the least of which is the now legendary Bioshock series.

												The dramatic tension in this game is not only gripping but adult in nature. System Shock 2 takes your standard Sci-Fi themes and explores them on the next level, integrating you into the narrative with a terrific plot, personalised character development, and some of the most effective audio design ever achieved in anything, ever (yes, that good). When you finish this game you feel like you have furthered your insight into mans future in space. Ken Levine and everyone who worked on the game deserve massive kudos for making something quite extraordinary. 10/10			"

 Review - System Shock 2 === Rating: 9.5 / 10 - Incredible Masterpiece, both revolution and genesis of an entire gameplay style. === The Good - Stunning depth in character creation and development. Infinite possibilities for builds, to suit ANY playstyle or even role-playing experience you might want to start.- Incredibly intricate and deep level design: they don't make stuff like this anymore. You will get lost in the horror of the putrid bowels of infested spaceships, and you will be delighted of it.- A real challenge: top 2 difficulty levels are a real tough challenge even for experienced players. Very limited resources, you will have to search any corner and dark conduit to survive; also, once the stuff is gone, is gone. No magical shops, no item respawns, nothing. You are out of ammo? healthpacks? money? You die.- Open world, dynamic horror: the entire ship is explorable, and it is IMMENSE. You will have to get through the entirety of it many times to uncover all of its secrets and survive... but danger is never gone, as enemies will constantly come out of any crack, air vent and corner to hunt you down.- Enemies have very good AI for being from 1999, each has its own behaivior, some more complex than others, but all of them hurt a lot and are serious threats.- Gigantic replayability: another build means an entirely different approach to the game's combat and difficulties, another completely different experience.- Co-Op campaign: share the horror with a friend, actually a very fun experience at highest difficulties, but it takes away something from the true horror experience of being ALONE in the living hell of System Shock 2.- Tons of community made mods, patches, fixed, anything you can imagine to get only the best out of this game. Also, fan-made missions.- SHODAN is one of the most ambiguous, well crafted and intriguing characters ever crafted in gaming history.- Very good variety of items and weapons to find- Extremely well made environments, sound design and atmosphere ensure true immersion in this ludicrously horrifying experience. At its time it was 5 years ahead of anything you can think of.=== The Bad  - Co-op mode is very, very bugged. This because the developers did not fix the bugs in it as they ceased game support. Still, community patches can fix lots of problems, but some stay, you will find out by yourself eventually, my only suggesion is SAVE OFTEN and make MANY SAVE SLOTS. Still enjoyable and playable though.- Some character builds are kinda underpowered compared to others, balancing is not perfect in some things but it's no major problem and eventually skill and tactics can overcome what power cannot.- Seldom crashes in area transitioning, probably due to running on new operating systems and such.=== The Ugly Nothing to report here!=== Conclusions This game is the real deal. Masterfully crafted FPS / RPG of the highest finery. Father of an entire genre, any other game of this type is simply blown away by its sheer amount of content and the quality it is made with.As of 2016, there is no game of this same genre (like Bioshock genre) that can even come close to this level of depth, gameplay, technical realization and design.You just get it.

												Before Ken Levene was mucking around with Bioshock, he was doing something a little more everything, in the form of the 1999 Irrational Games/Looking-Glass Classic, System Shock 2, a game held still in extreme regard and praise, with passionate fans still pumping out mods and texture updates, over 15 years later.I snagged the game for next to nothing in a Steam sale, and was set. I started a new game, figured everything out and watched a couple of videos to refresh anything I didn't understand and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's 4am, I'm 9 hours deep, completely scared out of my mind, with the mouse and keyboard sweaty as hell at this point, cans of Coke strewn across my computer desk before having to stop just after reaching Deck 5. And I'm saying to myself in my head, ""this is the best game I've ever played in my entire life"", and I truly believe that. Behind the strange UI interface and mechanics that seem archaic at first, is possibly the scariest and exhilarating games ever created. Get used to the UI and the RPG elements like the upgrade system and the cyber module thingys that seem like collecting cookies or something at first. The game I first thought was a half life tip off was now making half life look like a ♥♥♥♥ing babies toy, with the most basic gameplay and storyline you've ever seen in your life. Not only have I never been gripped by a game quite like System Shock 2 (Ocarina of Time came close), but had story and the gameplay depth that I didn't even think was possible for a game of its age. Now I've sucked enough of the games proverbial...um, laser rapier(?), now onto what makes the game so special. The Shooting: I'm starting off with the 'weakest' part of the game (which is in closed captions for obvious reasons (none of the game is bad)). Your guns can seem very underpowered, to the point were using your wrench to bludgeon an enemy to death seems more viable, but this is usually only for the first few hours of the game. Keep levelling up your standard weapons points, and your guns feel refined and realistically accurate. This, although annoying to have underpowered guns for the first few hours, makes so much sense. Your memory is completely wiped, you've forgotten almost everything about yourself, so it makes sense that you've forgotten how to use a basic firearm until you've overcome a learning curve. Everything in this game is tightly woven to have a purpose and to seem real, it's truly incredible for a game of its age. The RPG stuff: The levelling up element of this game makes KOTOR's RPG mechanics look like week old ham, and that's coming from a person who absolutely adores KOTOR. There's no hand holding here, you either figure out what's going to keep you alive and don't be too generous with your levelling up, or upgrade the stuff that's not really needed and have to start again half way through. The psi amp is something that makes the game truly replayable. In one run, you could choose to not use it at all, and in another run could use it solely. Either way, you better figure out the twidly RPG stuff like looting and log reading really quickly, because it pretty much is the game. Luckily it's done exceptionally here. The Weapons: What's more entertaining that being able to carry a machine gun, rocket launcher and weird alien gun you need to research 300 times before it can be used and a laser sword at the same time? Nothing, that's what. The weapon load out is incredible here and is another place were the game really shines. What doesn't shine (pun intended, as you'll see) is that your weapons degrade over time, which forces you to constantly repair them, which is more of something put in for realism than an actual nuicance. This is 100% believable however as you're literally fighting for your life onboard the Von Braun. Another great element. The Research thingy: Okay. Here's something that the community collectively hates. The research element. Whilst it is possible to go through the game researching only one item on deck 3 and still beat it, the research mechanic is another thing thrown on top of the chocolate and ice cream-sundae that sweetens up the experience even more. It's extremely diverse too, as some items yield you a damage upgrade on specific enemies, and others allow previously useless items to become healing materials. The thing people hate about this is that often, these  items will need chemicals to research, and you'll often find yourself being forced to backtrack several floors before finding the correct chemical. Personally I liked this, as it really drives home that you're only priority is to SURVIVE. Nothing else. And that often times requires doing such things. This mechanic also allows you to explore the game in way more depth and really get to know your way around which is absolutely crucial in this game.  Overall I really liked this element, as it's not really needed but offers up limitless replayability and exploration. The enemies: Suprisingly, for such an old game, all the enemies feel very real. Reprogrammed protocol droids infected by the evil SHODAN/Xerxes, horrible infested messes, brutally mutilated humans, sacrificed to the 'Many'. Truly terrifying stuff that chills you to the core. But, again this all feels real, and the enemies, although lacking in technical design, are absolutely terrifying in visual and sounds design, and over all, the MidWifes and the Hybrids are 2 of the best enemies ever created in video game history. The later enemies that you encounter, particularly the psi projections and the rumblers are brutally unfair at points. In the last few hours of the game especially, but that isn't really a bad thing because, hey, you've made it this far, why would the game relent now? Either way, the enemies may be brutalizing at first, but once you get to deck 5, you pretty much have the most reliable weapons in the game and are able to have a little fun with how you dispatch your hunters.The last thing to really comment on the level design and the impact the game has left on me and I'm sure countless others. The level design is absolutely impecable and by far the best from any game of it's age and even to this day it is absolutely incredible. The sheer scope and scale of some of the settings and levels are just crazy. Considering this game was made in 1999, by a team of complete amatures, it is remarkable. The 'Body of the Many' is hated by mostly everyone, however I thought it was a nice break from constant grey walls and space-stuff, even if you can get stuck on parts on the environment due to the Dark Engines fairly Lego-Like physics capabilities. Things we take for granted in modern games, like incredible interactivity (i.e, anything not nailed down WILL move/can be fiddled with) and security cameras that, if spotted by, will cause some lovely friends to come running for your flesh. Overall, the impact this game has last can simply not be understated. The amount of things that happen in this game that have triggered my mind to go ""Oh yeah, I've seen that in *another aclaimed game*"" was astounding and I think just makes you appreciate the game even more. The game is perfect in every sense of the word and I truly believe this is the Citizen Kane of gaming. So diverse and open, terrifying and dripping with atmosphere and all around just amazing. This is by far my favoutite game, as it's just so charming and playable that it's kinda annoying to think that no game since has even touched the ground that System Shock 2 trail-blazed. Once you perfect the keyboard shortcuts and perfect the use of the U.I, it becomes a truly magical experience, doing what other games lack infinitely by allowing you to really sink into the shoes of the protagonist and feel like you're experiencing the terrors of the Von Braun first hand.System Shock 2 is the best game ever made.

												Getting back to another old school game playing System Shock 2 was a really intense experience.For a 1999 title this game is beyond awesome. Setting the flag for the survival horror schifi rpg genre, SS2 is a game lots will enjoy, and few can handle without any help from walkthroughs and maybe cheats as well.Find yourself alone in a ship far away into the dead space in the middle of a chaotic hostile and evil environment. Choose your skills well. Your moves even better. Trust the machine. Scavenge. Hack. Kill. Survive.The game is scary, creepy, spooky (insert more synonyms here) and good god it's so hard. I had my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me by this game so many times and I had to take small breaks in order to keep my mind clear.PROSAmazing RPG elements. Gameplay that makes you think before acting. Perfect voice acting. Voice audiologs way so perfect for its time. Perfect script and story. Good graphics for its time. No major bugs. You can install mods. Environent design and scary elements that makes this game the Dead Space of 1999....on crack. Replayable due to class selection and different way to handle the fightsystem (if you got enough pills with you) CONSLots of backtracking. Difficult game to beat.Fan of the genre? Don't mind old games? You have no excuse not having this game in your library and not already downloading to play it. Totally recommended.			"

												This game is basically a smart version of bioshock seeing as it was the predeccesor to it, me being the huge bioshock fan as I am wanted this game really badly for a long time, so my friend bought it for me as a gift. i finally can play on my pc again so here is my thougths.It is a great horror game and the atomosphere is awesome (cyberpunk horror) and i love the difficulty in it, the graphics are okay for 1999 but i think that tfc had better graphics. my main problem with it is that the gui is way too cluttered and the combat is kinda bad. this is only a little bad thing, this game is great. 8/10			"

												An awesome classic game!System Shock 2 is horror or spooky RPG/FPS. You fight monsters that are transforming out of human.The story is simple but nice and has some surprises.The best of the game is the atmosphere for me! The most I liked is the cool voice editing I guess. Regulary you hear some voices in your head and these are edited quite good. The creepiness comes along with scary monsters and creepy voices. The monsters respawn randomly so you actually can never cool down. Additionally, you are alone all over.The RPG part consists of a skill system. So you can hack consolses and more but you have to have the knowledge for example.Moreover, there's a research system and for some objects you have to find chemicals. I really like that idea.Altough System Shock 2 is from 1999 it's great. It's a classic game. I really like old games. You too? Then don't wait to buy this game it's really worth it!			"

												Ignore playtime, because I've disconnected SS2 from Steam to install newest SS2tool and some mods.This game is really good. Like, unbelievably good. So much better than Bioshock and stuff - it's not even funny. Atmosphere is dense, interface is nice, gameplay is deep. Controls do feel unresponsive sometimes, but still.Also, 'buggy' coop was not buggy at all for me and my friend (with latest SS2tool, at least) - excluding couple desynchronisations between levels, but they are easily remedied by saving before changing level.And another good thing - it was quite fun in coop. Not sure if it's better than singleplayer, more like another kind of experience, but still entertaining. So, if you haven't played this game (and if you have nothing against dated graphics - but again, mods), I can easily recommend it to you. It's golden classics.			"

												One word for this game: Amazing.It's truly ahead of its time and is really unique. The story is really good and the gameplay is also pretty solid, but you might want to rebind some keys first.Really in-depth RPG elements with adventure makes this game truly amazing, the only downside is maybe that the game isn't really made for Co-op so dont waste your time with multiplayer.Score: 9/10			"

												System Shock 2 is gaming perfection. It sets up a fantasticaly scary atmosphere (turn the music off if you wanna be scared), amazing in depth RPG mechanics, alot of replayablility, fantastic story that does not hold you hand and the perfect enclosed setting.  The layout of the ship is completely amazing, each part of the ship has a purpose showing how much attention to detail and effort that was put into the creation of the vessle.9/10 buy this♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Living classic of FPS genre, standing in one row with Half-Life but has got much more variable game mechanics. And a brutal wrench instead of crowbar.All fans of such shooters as BioShock, Dead Space, F.E.A.R. definitely should play this game 'cause without both System Shocks these games would never exists.P.S.: there's no such a charismatic antagonist in video games as a Sentient Hyper-Optimized Data Access Network (call her SHODAN). Closest cultural reference - Agent Smith from Matrix, I'd say :)			"

												This will be a review for people who have never played the game.Should you care about this game and why? It's over a decade old and you've got these people yammering on about how good it is, and now you might be wondering if you should bother with it or not.This is the first time I've played this game and I have to say that there is some excellence to be found here and some annoyances, just like in any good game.This is an FPS with RPG elements, with heavy emphasis on RPG. You'll want to research a bit about character creation before you start, or you could just have a go at it, if you don't mind maybe having to restart half way through.The sound design in this game is what really makes it for me. I turned the music off as soon as I started. The atmospheric sounds really hit the spot. I played with 2.1 speakers (that's two speakers and a sub) and it really worked that sub. The character logs in the game are fully voiced. You can also replay the logs and you will probably have to because sometimes you'll be walking along, listening to a log and a scripted log will come up, playing the two simultaneously, which was kind of annoying.You'll want to reconfigure the controls for a more modern set up. WSAD and all that good stuff. The game feels pretty natural after you get set up.The gameplay, coupled with the forboding machinery and sound effects, is really tense. I found myself making extensive use of the leaning keys (Q and E) in order to peek around corners to see if I could get the drop on an enemy before they got one over on me.The story, while not a direct sequel, does borrow heavily from System Shock 1. Having never played the first in the series, the story still works for me because they fill you in on the basics in the intro.The level design is, for the most part, pretty good. I didn't have to wonder or wander too much in order to figure out where I was supposed to be and exploration was rewarding. Things start getting a little weird near the end and I have to say that, while at first, I felt the game was stretching out a bit for time, it ended up making me feel like the last two or three hours were a necessary trial. BTW, there's no waypoint markers, in case you were wondering, but then what's the point of exploring if you've always got an arrrow telling you where to go??So, if you can deal with reconfiguring controls, dated graphics (there's a few texture resizing mods that are good), some old fashioned exploration without waypoints, and the last few hours feeling a little like a hail mary denouement, it is pretty good. I don't have the rose-tinted glasses to tell you that it's a cornerstone of PC gaming or that everyone who has business calling themselves a gamer should have played it, but I would say that I might actually play it again someday and that's not something I say often.

												Similar to the original deus ex in a lot of ways but unlike deus ex where i find certain mechanics like stealth for example a bit dated now, i always found nothing dated about system shock 2 and it still holds up very well today. It's atmosphere, level design, visual design and level of depth in its rpg mechanics is why i love this game. Great techno music during combat, great writing and a fun and creepy story. It's still an amazing game i just think that most gamers are spoiled with the hand holding in modern games and they will never be able to get into this kind of game and experience it which is sad. You have to figure out what you have to do and where you have to go by yourself. There is no magic waypoint all the time telling you where you need to go. You have to read logs to find codes for doors to progress and research specific items needed to progress using different chemicals that you have to find in the levels. You have to carefully manage your inventory and supplies throughout the whole game or you won't be able to progress. The game forces you to use your brain and you get a great sense of accomplishment when you complete a stage you have been on for hours (engineering). This game also rewards you very nicely for exploring every area of the game with items which encourages taking your time and exploring every area of the ship. This game has some of the best sound design of all time with the voice of shodan and the sounds of the ship and the music and sound effects etc. It's still honestly one of the best games ever made i would put it somewhere in my top 20 i can't really think of anything i dislike about it. 10/10 (Masterpiece)			"

Posted: December 11, 2014
												Ah man, where do I start with this game. This game is one of the greatest computer games I have ever played. From the creators of Thief, and it’s just as good. Anyway, let’s get into this.DISCLAIMER: This review will include some forms of spoilersGameplay- The gameplay is very nice; very easy to get into. Admittingly the two different forms of HUD were a little funky at first, but I quickly got use to it, and I enjoyed running in one direction away from Hybrids while trying to reload my gun with a different set of bullets. The “Cyber Modules” system was also good. Using Cyber Modules you can upgrade the player’s Stats, Weapons Skills, Psi Powers, and Tech. At the start of the game it’s easy to get into upgrading your character with the different Cyber Modules you are given or pick up throughout the Von Braun, and then as the game goes on Upgrades start costing more and more Cyber Modules to the point where each Cyber Module you receive is like the greatest thing ever, and that my friends, is how you do a Upgrade system. I never actually got into the Psi Powers, so I can’t say much on that, but of what I did it was pretty cool and snazzy.Graphics- The game was made in 1999 for Computers… So that should say something about the graphics. But the graphics aren’t horrid, they’re easy to look at, but it actually took the “Horror” aspect of the game down a bit because of how laughable some of the enemies look. There are some mods are textures you can download however to increase the quality of the textures, and those do look good so I would recommend them.Setting- As I mentioned above, the game is “Horror”. However, it is much more than just a Horror game(and as I mentioned before the graphics make it not all that scary). In the first few parts of the game you’ll come across the occasional severed limb or head. But as the game goes on they start appearing less and less until they’re just gone for good almost. In my opinion that shows that the developers weren’t trying to make a full out Horror game (of the Hollywood variety anyway). There are also a couple dead bodies hanging from the ceiling with horrific face expressions, but I only find like three of those. The main enemies in the game are Hybrids, which look like humans with a worm coming out of their chest biting onto their head, but really, it’s not all that scary. Now that I’ve covered the Horror parts of the game, it’s time to talk about how the game isn’t actually a “Horror” game. As I said before there is so much more to the game. It is definitely a Suspense game, and that it does perfectly. The game depends on the mysteries and suspense to creep you out rather than gore, which is great for the game. There are also the many Audio-logs left by the dead crew members. Many of these Logs help flesh out the history of the ship and it’s inhabitants, and all that happens before the start of the game. Some of the Logs you’ll wish you never read… Ehehehehe*Spoilerriffic stuffs start here*SHODAN is also a very important point of the game. Starting from her reveal up to the end of the game the game is at it’s best, with her constantly talking to you and prodding you along in her distorted yet adorable(I kid) voice. SHODAN’s interactions with the player are some of the best parts of the game: “I AM SHODAN”, “I-I-Insect!”, “Can’t you do anything right?!” I was actually pretty disappointed when she betrayed me, I thought me and her had something, D:*End*VERDICT- This game is great, but probably not for everyone. If you are a fan of darker games or just want to play a game that’ll scare you(DARN ROBOTS!) but not give you nightmares, play this. Also I recommend this to fans of the “Thief” series, as it is made by the same studio and shares many voices(Stephen Russel, FTW!). This game took “Sci-Fi Horror” and made something great. I would really like to see a third game someday… *looks off into the sunset*Anyway, 8.5/10! It’s a great game!ALSO: I highly recommend listening to Cryoshell’s Breakout while playing the game! X3  "

												System Shock 2 is the sequel to the criminally underrated and severely difficult System Shock. Let me just say, System Shock 2 is one of the my personal favourite games. You play as a man stranded deep in space, 6 billion lightyears deep, on the ship the Von Braun, and it has been overrun by the ship's AI, Xerxes. You are guided through his HUGE ship by Polito, another survivor, and you must work you way to the Rickenbacker, the Military ship piggy-backing on the Von Braun. This game has elements of an RPG, such as you picking a class. Hacking, Psi Skills and Weapons are the classes, and each have their good elemnets, however, you get to use all three, but the one you master in is the prominent one. Hacking is the most usefull, for you will be doing all through this game. The enemies range from ""Zombies"" to robots that have been taken over by Xerxes and even Xerxes himself. The game is a very scary game, and I mean it. It's terrifying. You also have an inventory that is pretty big and obviously very useful. It will be packed out the♥♥♥♥♥by the end of the game. Now, let's get to the bad stuff. First off, the layout of the Von Braun is severely huge, and will♥♥♥♥♥♥You Off! The enemies are very tricky and each have a certain weakness. Also, what you are supposed to be doing is very murky and difficult. You must check EVERY PIXEL OF THIS GAME! That is sooo important! Things are really hidden in this game! So, if you do play it, go back though a second time just for the story, the story is amazing. Anyway, good luck!			"

The gameplay is excellent, and the story, music, and atmosphere are all amazing.  Bioshock's ancestor.  A classic.  10/10I haven't even played the game with mods (I personally don't mind the dated visuals); that being said I have only heard and seen good things about some of the popular mods available for this game, which are definately worth a look also.  Compared to its contemporaries, System Shock 2 doesn't have the best visuals, but there is a certain charm to it still.			"

												Finally started playing this gem. The game has aged surprisingly well and retained its scary ambience. A major factor that makes this possible is the sound design that most of the time makes aware that you are not alone (and when it doesn't it is equally scary). Good headphones are recommended for the game.I play the game on Linux. Steam has linux version of the game, but as far as I'm aware, that is only a Wine wrapper and atleast I had some problems with constant clicking sound. Playing the Windows version on newer Wine version works without problems.			"

												System Shock 2 is pretty cool, I guess. I write this review on my own will and totally not because I see the gleam of a rifle scope from a very irate group member in the distance.It's hard to actually talk about SS2 because the game came out in 1997 before Ken Levine drank the Kool-aid. Everything that could be said about SS2 has already been said, but I'll be damned if I don't try.You play as a soldier I call Goggles because his actual designation has too many numbers in it. Goggles wakes up from cryo sleep aboard the Van Braun, one of Earth's first endeavors into FTL travel. Or as my friend likes to call it: The USS Chimp-wagon. The Chimp-wagon is also escorted by the Rickenbacker, a military vessel who's crew will totally help you. Totally. Unfortunately, when you wake up upon the Chimp-wagon, everything's gone to hell and the ship has been taken over by a very polite A.I, humans possessed by alien worms, and robots that like to explode and hurt me and my feelings.But like I said before, there isn't anything I can actually add on to System Shock 2's review narrative since everything has already been said, so I'm going to just tip toe around it and add my own personal experience.The graphics aren't bad, especially for the time, but a lot of things look like mud. I was informed a little too late that there was a texture pack, but by then I had already beaten the game. That's all I will say about the graphics, I guess.The game itself kicked my♥♥♥♥♥ I wasn't expecting it to be the ball buster it was. It's not that the game itself is overly hard or anything, it just expected a certain amount of competency I'm not use to giving, especially with all the modern games I play. Gremlin Rock 2 is hailed as one of the scariest games of all time, something which rolls off me no problem because I'm super brave. But in all seriousness, SS2 didn't really do much to scare me, but that's not to say that I wasn't uneasy. There's this sense of dread that permeates in every nook and cranny the game has. Once I turned the music off, all that was there to keep me company was the rumbling of the Chimp-wagon and the sounds of alien possessed monster men talking to themselves or looking for me. The hybrids, or as I like to call them, wormy guys, are the most numerous enemies in the game. These are humans that have had their minds taken over by alien worms and formed into a collective called “the many”. The wormy guys travel around the Chimp-wagon looking for non-wormy humans to wormify so that they can all think the same, do the same, talk the same, and share the same beliefs and goals.SO basically it's Facebook but with less overall murders. Other than the wormy guys, there are suicide bots, giant angry battle robots, annoying spiders that rush you down, and who could forget: pudding given life. If I have any complaints about Hamster Frock 2 it's that it kind of drags on a little bit too much after the big spoiler reveal that everyone already knows so I won't even bother spoiling the spoiler. It sends you out on errands to do a bunch of objectives that add up into infiltrating the Many's giant poop dungeon. But even though the fetch quest was kind of boring, it kind of showed off Painting Smocks greatest strength, which is it's level design. The Chimp-wagon is built like an actual space ship instead of a series of levels for you to traverse. You can go back to anywhere on the ship at any time, which is neat for scavenging or leveling reasons.I spent more than enough time trying to find an area to level up and upgrade my stats until I realized that I could just go back to Engineering and set up there, it kind of turned engineering into my home base before I went out to get my head smashed in while my assailant tells me to run and begs for euthanasia. So basically like living in Detroit. But should you play System Shock 2?You already have, but I guess you should. It will kick you out of the modern game mindset really quickly if you hope to get through the game in one peace. The game's graphics haven't aged all that well considering there isn't even a muzzle flash on your fire arms. But graphics aren't everything and the game makes up for it with a heaping bowl of atmosphere and the mandatory sci-fi horror poop dungeon near the end.Girly Socks 2 gets 4 flat-faced men with goggles out of 5.Seriously, whats with sci fi games and ending in poop dungeons?

It's not sleak at all compared to recent games, but nonetheless just as immersive when it comes to exploration and combat. The retro style may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I suggest playing for yourself to really get a feel for it.It's on sale for a steal, but even full price is beyond worth it, especially with System Shock being re-released.

												So, what should I say about this game? Simply wonderful. Finest example of horror survival shooter with RPG elements, which is able to engage the player with a brilliant story with many plot twists (ok, not so many, but they're very good), and a great atmosphere conveyed by spot on sound effects and an hammering electronic soundtrack.Great value of replay-ability, since you can try to beat the game going full melee, soldier, hacker or psionic, or a mix between these main classes.I guess it can be considered the father of modern survival and shooter games, since embody all of the characteristics you can find in games like Dead Space and Bioshock (obviously, it comes from the same devs). I must say I really enjoyed every single minute I've played System Shock and I am forced to recommend to anyone this gem.10/10 "

												I have never played System Shock 2 and it was one of those games that had been looming over my head ever since I bought it a couple of years ago. I have played most of the ""cult and classic"" old school RPG's (Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment etc) in the past few years given how I didn't have a PC back in the day that these were released and I have finally managed to get some time to play the game that inspired the Bioshock series (which I love).Little did I found out that this was an amazing experience to have even after 18 years since it's release. This is a true survival horror first person RPG with a lot of atmosphere, depth and amazing writing and it is a MUST PLAY.			"

												System Shock 2 is a first person role-playing horror game.  It mixes action adventure and survival horror elements. I could compare gameplay somewhat similar to Deus Ex.  System shock 2 was designed by Ken Levine and co-developed by Irrational Games and Looking Glass Studios. It was released in 1999. Some aspects have not aged well but I HIGHLY recommend that you give this game a chance.To start off, this is challenging game to review in 2016. System shock 2 is nearly as old as me. The graphics are very outdated, the hitboxes of enemies are really wonky, and there is an absurd amount of backtracking. However, mods can easily fix the old textures and make this game more appealing for “first timers”. I played with a wide range of texture mods to make it easier on my eyes. If you can get past the few setbacks this game is absolutely incredible! This is easily in my top 5 favorite games of all time. The atmosphere and characters are designed so well. Its blend of FPS and RPG gameplay, as well as its organic storytelling, is hard to find in most games today.  Also, this game is challenging. It does not hold your hand. It shows you how easy games are nowadays.  Not to mention, this game is extremely similar to BioShock. As some may know, Bioshock is said to be the spiritual successor of System Shock 2. That is clearly the case. Many components of System Shock 2 are the exact same in BioShock. For example: the wrench, the psi powers, the upgrade machines, and even some pieces of the story. In my opinion BioShock is just a watered down version of System Shock 2. Literally, its really watered down. Like underwater...(sorry about my bad puns).SCORE:10/10Would be called an “insect” again!			"

 Positive + Perfectly combines both RPG elements and shooting mechanics, with even some survival-horror elements which add to the game greatly+ The well-crafted story doesn’t rely on cheap jump scares and the like to scare you, instead relying on hostile and frightening enemies with creepy environments to make your trek through the game terrifying to say the least+ The sound design as well only adds to the atmosphere, with enemy groans and whispers of deceased crew members echoing throughout the haunted corridors+ Memorable antagonist, which has inspired other characters (most notably GLaDOS from the Portal series) in videogames, and has a looming presence throughout the campaign+ Approximately 10 hours of game time (on Normal difficulty), with a good amount of replay value if you want to experience playing the game using the variety of playstyles available. Negative - The games interface involves a somewhat steep learning curve, the map system especially is relatively poor (unfortunately a product of the time), as they are essentially static images- Some irritating and difficult enemies to defeat; while the shooting mechanics are well-done, they’re not exactly on-par with similar first-person shooters from the same era. Worth Mentioning • While the game is dated graphically, the community has done a good job of creating mods and texture packs in order to improve the graphical quality of the game (among other things), ensuring that even if graphics are a high priority to you in videogames, installing mods will hopefully negate that issue with the game. Verdict “Long before Bioshock (and Deus Ex to a small extent), there was System Shock 2. This game is the definition of classic, and still to this day stands the test of time as a truly great game. I’d wholly recommend this game to any fan of 90s shooters and RPGS alike.” 9/10 TJBs  "

												System Shock 2 is an interesting game. A lot of people (like myself) first go into this game after playing the Bioshock series, expecting something similar to it with a lot of shooting action. When I first played this game, I absolutely despised it. I hated the combat, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t difficulty, the immersion breaking techno loops, and other minor annoyances that added up to me really disliking the game. However, after replaying the game for the 5th or 6th time (which I did after beating the older Thief games), the whole experience for me kinda clicked. I knew what stats were useless and which ones were needed, so I upgraded them in advance to prepair myself for what was to come. Doing so actually made the experience a lot more enjoyable than it was before, infact, I actually kinda like the game now. It's also worth noting that there are some pretty awesome fan missions out there, most notably being System Shock Infinite, which redisigns the game in certian aspects, and is overall pretty enjoyable, even if most of the game is stock System Shock 2. But you're probably wondering what I originally didn't like about the game, and that's mostly due to the fact that this game is punishing if you don't know what the hell you are doing. It took me 5-6 playthroughs to even finish, let alone enjoy the game. And while I'm on that subject, the ending (without spoiling anything) is complete garbage, and didn't make me feel accomplished for the journy I went through. It didn't help that the last few levels aren't that great either, I mean, they're not Half Life Zen level of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but they aren't good either. This is also a game with a pretty slow start, which may turn off a lot of newcomers, especially if you hate slow starts. Now massive flaws like these aren't the blessings of a masterpiece, and that was something that has, and still does bother me. This game is NOT a masterpiece, in any form, but it definetelly isn't complete garbage either. System Shock 2 is more akin to a Cult-Classic, than a Magnum-Opis, and if you go into this game expecting a masterpiece, then I'm afraid to say that you may be a bit dissapointed. It's hard for me to reccomend this game, but I can reccomend it overall, so long as you go into it with an open mind, and I wouldn't hesistate that much to look up a walkthrough if you're getting stuck. I would strongly advise playing through the first 2 Theif games first, as they will kinda teach you how The Dark Engine (the game's engine) works, to an extent that even System Shock 2 fails to tell the player. That and they'll help you become much more patient, which you're going to need when playing this game. Once you're done taffing around with those 2 games, then System Shock 2 will give you a really awesome journy to behold, Insect.			"

												Honestly there might not be a more chilling game experence then hacking into system only to hear the door next you open and suddenly you only hear the door open quickly followed by a twisted ""Run"" leaving you with only a couple of seconds to leave the terminal and react to this twisted create that's infront of you before he can beat your face in.Also nothing quite matches the feeling of terror as you're running as fast as you can from a robot that's speaking to you like it's trying to help you but you know for a fact that the moment you turn around to confront it you'll be blown away to kindom come. This game does atmosphere like no other (as long as you turn off the texno music) and this game is feel with tons of (mostly) well voice audio logs that do nothing but help build this world and it's atmosphere with it's steller writing and tone setting. What may seem like a drawback with the fact that the graphic's haven''t aged very well has only added to the alien and the horror of some of the creatures in this game and the alien feeling of everything and everyone in this game. This game is a must play for people who like rpgs and a must have for anyone who enjoys scifi or horror.			"

												If there's ever been a stealth company, it's Looking Glass. While other companies come and go claiming themselves to be this month's master of the first-person shooter, Looking Glass spends their time quietly taking the genre to places it's never been before. Perhaps even more amazing is the fact that they manage to set the industry on its ear again and again with startling consistency. With Ultima Underworld and its sequel Ultima Underworld 2, the company took on the daunting task of infusing the depth of an RPG into a first person engine. With the original System Shock, the team created an action game that actually made you feel like you were in a sci-fi movie. With Terra Nova, the developers tackled squad based combat from a first person point of view and succeeded wildly ¿ years before Tribes was even thought about. More recently, the company offered up Thief: The Dark Project, an amazingly deep title that introduced first-person fans to a world in which each enemy was a potentially lethal threat. Each one of these games took a completely new approach to the shoot-everything-in-sight feel of most first-person shooters and instead created a world in which you actually felt as if you were the protagonist. Now, silently, the company has done it again. Their latest foray into the first-person shooter world, System Shock 2, is an amazingly well crafted example of the genre that combines raw action with horror and suspense to deliver a gameplay experience that is very different from anything else on the shelves. It's funny, usually with a really good game, it takes an enormous amount of time to explain just what it is about the title that sets it apart. With System Shock 2 it can be summed up in a single word ¿ atmosphere. This game creates an incredibly rich game world for you to explore and conquer by offering up flawless graphics, great voice acting, interesting and frightening enemies, and a powerful storyline that meshes seamlessly with the play experience. All of these factors are important on an individual basis but more importantly, they all contribute to the dark, oppressive and often terrifying feel of the game as well. Because of this, while it's easy to sum up what makes System Shock 2 great, it's still very important to take a closer look at how each piece of the game excels and how it fits into the greater whole. Let's start with the storyline. System Shock 2 takes place in the same game world as the original title, a universe in which the Earth has already reached out and colonized the solar system. Since the out-of-control AI, SHODAN, has been stopped (in the original System Shock this thinking computer went crazy and killed a large number of people on board a the Citadel Space Station) the governments of Earth have come together in the form of a new entity titled the UNN (United National Nominate) and have lashed out at the megacorporations (specifically the largest, the TriOptimum Corporation who was responsible for SHODAN's creation) that have held power for so long. The power struggle has resulted in an uneasy truce in which the UNN still holds power officially and the corporations still hold a great deal of de facto power through their very own armies and police forces. Into this already dangerous struggle comes a new source of tension. A new ship, the Von Braun, is being built that uses a new engine developed by a Nobel scientist that will make the craft capable of faster than light travel. The new craft, which is being built by TriOptimum (despite all efforts by the UNN to keep the company uninvolved), is scheduled to make a maiden voyage that will take it to a far away solar system. Along with the Von Braun will be a security ship, the Rickenbacker, which is designed to 'piggyback' the larger ship in order to take advantage of its FTL engines. As with most new technologies, the Von Braun doesn't really work as well as it should. Hackers on board the ship have managed to screw up a lot of little things, but some of the major items don't work simply because they haven't been properly tested. One of the problems of greatest concern is that the ship's central computer, XERXES, seems to be all kinds of buggy. Worst of all, the crew, which is made up of both UNN and TriOptimum appointees, is starting to separate into two factions that mistrust and hate the others. As the game begins, the ship receives fragments of a transmission that originates at the Tau Ceti system, far outside the area of explored space. You are assigned to the ship as it begins its journey to find out what is sending that signal, and if possible to make contact with them. Once the game starts, things really get cooking. You've been kept in cold storage for the journey and awake to the not so dulcet commands of Dr. Janice Polito, the Senior Systems Analyst onboard the Von Braun. Although she's not very clear, it's obvious that the ship is in some kind of serious trouble and it's up to you to sort out what it is. As you travel around the corridors of the ship, you'll have three ways to learn more about the situation. First, you'll occasionally get messages on your PDA from Dr. Polito telling you about things that have just happened and giving you advice on what you must do next. Second, you'll find small disks scattered around the ship that hold the log messages of the crew. As you pick up and read these logs, the story will slowly unfold in front of you and you'll also get more information on how best to proceed. Finally, and perhaps most disturbingly, the cybernetic system that's been installed in you seems to accidentally pick up strong psychic signals much as a bad portable phone picks up the radio. When your system comes in contact with these emanations it will try and interpret them as light and sound. The end result is that occasionally, as you walk through the ship, you will see 'ghosts' of people who lived on the Von Braun. This is really creepy and may cause you to shoot at the images before you realize exactly what they are. Using these clues, you must figure out what happened to the crew of the Von Braun, who's managed to survive it, and how you're going to go about stopping the menace. While I'd love to go further into the storyline, there's no way to do so without totally spoiling the game. One thing I can tell you is that whatever has taken over the ship has found a way to infect the crew and turn them into horrible zombies. A lot more resilient and intelligent than your run of the mill 'a comet flew over and I was raised from my grave' undead, these vile creatures are smart enough to use complex weaponry, respond to security alarms, and to, after a fashion, speak. Other creatures you'll run into include giant spiders made up of a weird bio-material, cybernetic nursemaids and stealthy cyber-assassins.Okay, there's a lot of other things I'd like to say about this game, but I think you've probably got the basic idea by now. The one warning that I would offer up is to hard-core action fans who may be put off by the RPG elements that make this game what it is. In the end though, I would recommend this title for just about anyone who's over the age of 16 (this game is really scary) and who likes deep rich play adventures.			"

												Is this game the best game in existence?  Heck no.  Is it really, really good though?  It is very much so.  System Shock 2 is an action-rpg with an emphasis on the rpg element.  At first, you'll be very weak with nothing but a wrench, maybe two medical hypos, and a acute fear response to every sound that occurs in the game.  However, System Shock 2's greatest strength is it's depth.  There are tons of items, weapons, and psionic abilities for you to choose from.  The rpg element adds greatly to supporting different builds and playstyles.  Numerous audio logs and emails can be found throughout the game allowing you to piece together the story of what happened to the ship and even use the dead's words to progress through the game.  Not to mention, each item has a description you can spend hours reading describing the item or even giving a little corporate humor.  Sure at first the game can be difficult forcing you to save often and carefully plan your moves, but if you play smartly and allocate your upgrade points appropriately, you can literally become an invisible, flaming, inhumanely strong, lightning fast, psionic ninja that can, I kid you not, two hit every single standard enemy in the game with a hunk of crystal.  You see, I made the mistake of picking a psionic character for my first playthrough, cause you know, FREAKING PSIONICS and choosing to play on hard mode.  You can, however, choose the run and gun marine or the sneaky hacking sailor or whatever combination of the three playstyles.  This isn't to say that System Shock 2 is perfect.  Projectile weapons degrade like wet toilet paper (the primary reason why I only used melee weapons which don't degrade), certain items and abilities clearly weren't balanced appropriately (the crystal shard is actually bugged so it does more than double damage with the smasher perk and the regeneration psionic ability basically makes psi hypos far more valuable than medical hypos), the sensual stimulation units later in the game are broken (reeeeal missed opportunity there (by the way if you don't get that that was a joke, please leave now)), and the heavy weapons, besides the fantastic grenade launcher, are useless or underused.  Still, System Shock 2 is an excellent game and I'm honestly suprised I don't see more people playing or discussing it.  Maybe I've just been to the wrong communities or forums or something, but regardless, System Shock 2 is well worth your time.			"

												Still, HANDS DOWN, one of the BEST and CREEPIEST games EVER.I still got goosebumps playing this game. The atmosphere, the story, the difficulty... all of it culminates together to create an experience that makes you afraid to get into combat, the enemy is truly dangerous, and you feel small compared to the power the enemy wields. I will never put this game down for good. Okay, now that the worship is over.The ControlsThis game came out in 1999, 15 years ago. That being said, the default controls are a little out-of-date, but once you change them to a more modern FPS format (A and D strafe instead of turn, maybe use R for interaction because the lean on Q and E are very useful), it is much more comfortable. Mantling is something I had never seen before in a game, and it's popular now, but this is the first game I had ever seen it in. (long time a go folks!)The StoryWho doesn't want to find out what is going on? Everything has gone to hell and you are confused, alone, and know nothing. The perfect place to start. Even as you progress, the elements of the story are told from the perspectives of so many others,  creating a world much like a book would. Story after story unfolds before you, each one telling a small piece of what is happening to you. You never quite have all the pieces, and the mystery grows and grows until the end...The RPG ElementsEveryone likes RPG Elements in good games like this. Getting to make your own choices, living with those choices, and adapting to them is what an RPG is about. Each choice you make feels significant, and as the game progresses, you succeed or fail by the decisions you make.The DifficultyI would have to say that the game is incredibly difficult if you are unprepared. The game forces you to play smart, to look around corners, to conserve your resources whenever possible, to take your time... This is a good thing, because it gives the game a feeling that you are always in danger, and without the difficulty it wouldn't be as frightening. This is an aspect of games that has been lost over the years... and now many games, even on the most difficult setting, is not too difficult. I've yet to try and beat this beast on Impossible... Kudos to any masters who have done it.The GraphicsThe Graphics are from 1999. The textures are ancient. Yes. We know this. Go Download SHTUP and follow the instructions to update your textures if it's that big a deal. For the time, they were pretty darn good. JUST BUY ITYOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED			"

												System Shock 2 is an easy game to describe generally but a hard one to pin down exactly. In simple terms you can say that it's similar to its contemporary Deus Ex or its successor Bioshock, but I'd say that it's an experience entirely of its own. The main reason for this is that it's gosh dang scary. The logs and character writing give the creepiness depth, but I can't give enough credit to how much atmosphere the game derives from enemies and graphics that by today's standards shouldn't be enough for much more than a jump scare. Instead, even when the hybrids become easy to kill (one of the few flaws is the lack of enemy variety), their appearance and quavering sounds as they approach get me paranoid every time. The player progression is also far deeper than that of the Bioshock games even if it lacks the same in-universe hook to its upgrade system that Bioshock had in the Little Sisters. Overall, System Shock 2 holds up incredibly well as a game that makes being deeper than Bioshock and scarier than Dead Space seem completely effortless. 9/10on second thought the hacking in this game doesnt have those BS pipes so 10/10			"

												It is an  RPG seen from first person view.You might want to stay away from that quicksave button because I think it breaks the game experience by giving you the chance to have everything in your favour. Try beating the game with only autosaves. I played on hard difficulty with constant quicksaves, finished the game with more than 1500 nanites (the currency in this game) and over 40 med hypo.You can play the game anyway you want with numerous different builds you can try. You can be an all melee character, a psi warrior or a boring soldier wielding common standard guns. Always remember that the wrench is you friend, and it is year 2114 - not knowing some hacking is almost the same as being illiterate.The enemy AI is in consistent. Sometimes they see you, sometimes they don't (maybe because I was in the shadow?). My biggest gripe in this game is sometimes there's just too many people talking at the same time: there's Xerxes with it's security annoucement, an incoming mail, the soundtrack playing and the hybrid babbling.After more than a decade System Shock 2 is still great.

												This is an essential game for anyone who wants to learn their roots.  Often considered ahead of its time, System Shock 2 is a great FPS/RPG with a great horror/sci-fi setting, and is one of the few survival horror games that gives an actual sense of survival with very limited ammunition and healing supplies.  It set the bar for story telling and atmosphere in a way that few games since have matched.  If it can be said to have any flaw, it would be its dated graphics, but even those aged fairly well when compared to other games of the time.  Over-all, this is just a fantastic game.			"

												Note: Before I even start, let me mention that if you aren't a fan of the outdated control scheme, then there's an option in the game to rebind the keys to that of a modern fps. You don't even have to rebind them yourself, just check the saved key bindings; there's a layout there already. I hear a lot of complaints about the controls, and frankly they're so easy to change that it really shouldnt be an issue. Alright, on to the actual review.System Shock 2 is generally known as an FPS/RPG hybrid, when in reality it's far more Survival/RPG. What few fps elements there are aren't particularly interesting. Headshots and the locations wherein you shoot an enemy make no difference to damage and the enemy placement outside of scripted events is very random, so if you're looking for something akin to Quake or Doom then you'll probably have better luck elsewhere. What System Shock 2 gets right is the RPG and Survival elements, which complement each other perfectly. You see, you don't get experience via killing enemies in this game, instead the game's equivalent of XP is collected through exploring the environment and searching for pickups called 'cybernetic modules'. Want that extra point in strength?  Well then you're going to have to bite the bullet and search that dark, scary room. Need another point in weapons to wield the assault rifle? Guess you're going to have to poke around that creepy corridor you've been avoiding. It's a great risk/reward   system that makes exploring all the more satisfying. There's nothing like finding a cybernetic module the developers snuck in between a pair of crates or stashed on a corpse. With such an intense atmosphere, everylittle victory feels like a conquest.And the atmosphere is brilliant, providing you turn off that weird techno soundtrack, of course. The sound design for this game is marvelous. The heavy clank of your footsteps, the far off voices of Hybrids begging for death, the scrambled, mechanial screams of a Cyborg Midwife  as she dies, it's all very immersive stuff. Just do yourself a favour and turn the music off. The game isn't without its faults, though. For example:-First time players might make some slip-ups with their levelling and put all the points into something stupid like Research, Agility or repair. There are a lot of skills in System Shock 2 that are sort of useless, so I'd reccomend looking up a few tips before starting. -Little wizard monkeys are a reccuring enemy in this game. No joke. It's sort of jarring to be fighting some horrific monstrosity one moment only to be going toe-to-toe with a fireball-throwing mokey the next.-Dying isn't much of an issue, as you just respawn at a reconstruction chamber as soon as you bite the dust. It takes away some of the tension.-It's ugly. There's no denying it. System Shock 2 is an ugly game. The polygon count is low, all the character models look like origami and looking out of a window into space is like staring at a pixelated screensaver. It's ugly. -And finally, you might have some trouble running it. I never ran into any issues, but it's an old game and I've heard some complaints. Just a warning. Overall I'd say that System Shock 2 still holds up today as an impressive RPG, and is worth your time as long as you're okay with resource managment and character development that requires you to have a specific type of character in mind from the start.

												A ""cult classic"" that I missed the first time around. I found System Shock 2 to be a DEEPLY FLAWED game: The geometry of the levels is very sticky and will ""grab"" you unexpectedly; things like desks and destroyed enemies in narrow hallways serve as their own obstacles and I found myself frozen in place unexpectedly a LOT At higher levels of AGI your character becomes slippery and platforming becomes difficult The final zones (even from the Rickenbacker onward) become incredibly cramped, confusing and difficult to navigate The semi-final boss spawns so many enemies so rapidly you can actually plug doorways with corpses and have to leave a distance to discard the corpses Difficulty is very front-loaded; while this is good to make you feel like a super-enhanced killing machine toward the end of the game, it will make the beginning even more frustrating, especially while trying to learn the myriad systems Melee weapon hit detection is incredibly awkward and lagged Even with the map, emails and notes, figuring out where to go takes a while. It's interesting that it doesn't hold your hand whatsoever, but enemies spawn infinitely throughout the game and you can't pause while looking at notes/maps so you get attacked regularly while trying to figure out where to goAnd yet, I have to recommend the game. Why? I still had fun with it. Despite the myriad annoyances and frustrations, when it wasn't being an unpolished, irritating bugger it was quite a lot of fun. The beginning and ending were gross, but the middle was sweet enough to make the journey worthwhile.			"

												Was a juggernaut of game design and was at the forefront of what was deemed possible for videogames, much like half life.The narrative is told superbly through a combination of cinematics, voice overs, cyberghosts, space journal entries and the environments themselves. The sound design is top-notch, the voice of the malevolent SHODAN being the greatest example.A thick sense of foreboding permeates through the entire game, and body horror is used to good effect. It boasts a full inventory system, upgrade and stats systems, cybernetic implants, psionic powers and weapon modding, making it quite an elaborate game for the time of its release.The combat is kind of clunky, but is servicable enough (if it had gunplay and A.I. as good as half-life that came out a year before, it would be pretty much perfect)			"

												I'm researching a unresearched object so I have plenty time to give some feedback (should have installed a mod to let that happen faster though)Back in the day when this game came out I was too young to properly understand the mechanics and gameplay. It's almost 15 years later and i'm all grown up and I have too say it's still damn fine playable albeit with some .cfg modifications, sstool and some mods to fix interface at high resolution. It works like a charm @ 2048x1152The game mechanics where far beyond it's time, that's why after 15 years SS2 stills holds up pretty well.

												System Shock 2 is surprisingly powerful for a game for its age, everything from the atmosphere to the story to the audio is just chilling and fills your body with fear, the game dosn't need fancy graphics to scare the player, most of the horror comes from disturbing dialogue that comes in the format of audio logs, which explain a lot of the events going on. The enemies you face are pretty scary as well, one of my favorites is the hybrid with its unforgetable quotes which also reveal the events going on. The atmosphere is just, words cant explain the frighting tone of the environments, just watch the trailer to see what I mean. I could right a novel on why System Shock 2 is such an amazing powerful game but I'll just end it hear, the game is really one of the best games of the 90s, My only complaint is that the ending, with out spoiling anything just dosn't live up to the hype the game was building up to, but overall9.5/10			"

												One of the most hallowed, respected and enormously influential computer games in history, System Shock 2 does without doubt deserve such an accolade, though it is not an undertaking for the fainthearted for a number of reasons.Before outlining the frustrations which can be inherent playing this, firstly, let us extol its virtues. The back-story of a spacecraft whose crew have all mysteriously been violently killed has intriguing depth and immersive appeal, especially important for a role-playing game. Giving the player choices of which particular skills to require before the game-proper actually begins, does indeed give one the feeling that you are forming the player character out of your own choices and decisions and this further increases one's emotional involvement.As you slowly begin to explore the craft and pick up clues as to what has caused such havoc, the tension is palpable. From emails and voice recordings which you discover as you journey onwards, a sense of an actual place which was once full of living, breathing humans definitely starts to take shape. In addition to these manifold good points, the graphics themselves still look great even 15 years after the game was made.However, there are more than a few droplets of vinegar mixed in with the Ambrosial honey.Primarily, the main drawback, or perhaps a kinder word might be ;challenge', to System Shock 2 is the often bewildering complexity of elements at your player-characters disposal. In order to make intelligent progress, akin to how one might actually behave in such a real-life situation itself, the player has to juggle a veritable myriad of game-world stimuli. Emails, personal data assistants, logs on computers, notes and letters found on bodies, a constant stream of voice-messages in your character's earpiece, and much more of the detritus of exploring the seemingly dead spaceship, constantly seems to bombard the player until at times one can feel at a loss as to what to take note of and what to ignore. Perhaps this can be seen as part of the character's real-life predicament, but if the designers had taken the trouble to give more structure and order to the bombardment of information thrown at the player throughout it could have led to a less confusing and more enjoyable gaming experience. On the other hand, maybe I'm just a bit slow at times, or too methodical and tidy in my own personal way of dealing with tasks so I do hold my hand up and offer that as an explanation to the above constructive criticism.Even so, I have heard from several other sources of note, such as some seasoned gamers and highly respected gaming press, that System Shock 2 involved far too much traipsing back and forward through similar-looking corridors in search of a vital key or door-code or something of the like, without which further progress was not possible. Yet, for the gamer, completing these tasks became distinctly arduous, often extremely monotonous and frankly, unpleasantly exhausting. Elongating the play-time of a game in such a manner is frowned upon these days and for good reason.However, these constructive criticisms are as nothing compared to the monumental depth, complexity, tension and intrigue of this computer game behemoth, which also includes one of the most legendary and infamous end-of-game bosses in the annals of video-gaming.To play this game is not just to steep oneself in an immersive, tense and believablely frightening world, but it is to experience a piece of computer-gaming history.

												This definitely goes up there as one of the most entertaining games that's leagues ahead of its time through its upgrade and PSY systems, and in great level design that'll just make you feel uneasy. Delightfully uneasy. The voice acting is top notch, even though I felt like there was too much telling instead of showing. I thoroughly enjoyed how questionable aged the graphics are, but there are heaps of mods out there that soften the blow. A dude even did co-op, imagine that. Not going to lie, nabeel just killed it in his review. Just read it.

												The atmosphere is just amazing. Much like horror games, you need to keep your lights off and a great speaker setup to get the best effect. Just make sure the chair you are in is soft, you will be getting very jumpy as you play. You don't know what will pop up and when. Great Atmosphere + Great Story = WOW.			"

												At first i didnt understand the controls and stopped playing it after the first level for about a year or 2.  I decided to play it again after hearing about system shock 3 being made.  And i gotta say it was soooo worth it.  The story, the setting, heck it even doe a great job scaring me a few times.  Few words of advice, one KEEP THE HAZMAT SUIT, i left it thinking i didnt need it because it took up too much space and i never used it. TRUST ME YOU NEED IT. I stopped playing after a while as well just cuz i couldnt be bothered to go all the way back to my last save point with the hazmat suit which was pretty far.and two always remember what you have. sometimes i forget i had little perks which can help me a lot like the PSI so try to keep that in mind.

												Shockingly goodDespite being a 16-year-old game SYSTEM SHOCK 2 has a lot to offer. Yes the graphics look very dated when compared to today’s games but they can be improved by the mod packs readily available online. And it’s really only the visual differences that set this game aside from contemporary titles. It’s immediately obvious that SS2 is the progenitor of the excellent Bioshock series. There’s a strong storyline backed by first-rate voice acting. The combat is okay given the game’s age, and the RPG elements are convincing. Personally, I’m not a fan of weapon degradation and repair (thankfully dropped in the Bioshock games) but otherwise the gameplay design is very good. You can pick this game up very cheaply these days and if you want a nostalgic wander down Video Game Lane you can’t go far wrong with this.4/5			"

												The game is tense, and does its best to make sure that you never feel safe, which is certainly a very different (and more exciting) brand of horror than the jump scares that are the norm of today. It's not even very dark most of the time, most of the horror is psychological and is driven by you doing your best to survive.I feel that from a gameplay perspective, this vastly outshines Bioshock, or at least Bioshock Infitite. Well worth a try if you enjoyed the Bioshock series and are disappointed by the continual dumbing-down of its gameplay, or if you enjoyed Deus Ex, as it is very similar in terms of being a hybrid of tetris-inventory RPG and FPS gameplay.The graphics are definitely where the game has not stood up the test of time, as even when it came out in 1999 it didn't look very good. However, there are mods such as SHTUP and Rebirth that improve the model and texture quality, the models being the most lacking back in the day.In short: worth a try. It is perfectly compatible with modern systems, thanks to the recent NewDark patch, and is definitely worth it to see how much Bioshock Infinite has thrown away the series formula. And if you thought GLaDOS was the universe's scariest evil AI, you're in for a surprise.			"

												System Shock 2may have flew under the radar for many gamers like myself, However and i am glad to have stumbled upon this gem.The game is set in the distant future, where the first FTL spacecraft was created through earth's technological advancement. The creation of Intelligent AI was also one of them.You, the hacker must unravel the mystery of the ship, the Von Braun which had been taken over by a strange presence in the ship which had caused the slaughter of 1000s of crewmembers on-board.At first glance, I knew this game was something a little more complicated then your average shooter, by no means is this a 'Doom' or 'Quake' or even halflife game. Its something deeper. The addition of RPG elements much like Deus Ex adds a bit more depth upon choosing 3 distict paths in the game. The marines, The Navi and The OSA.Each class will determine the way you will pass each challenge throughout the game. By choosing the navi, you have more technical abilities then the others. You are able to disable cameras and turrets from a security terminal to remain undetected as you advance through each stage.If you were to take the OSA approach, which focuses on your 'Psi' powers (doing things with your mind), you are able to possibly go invisible, disable a camera or turret, or just use a blast of cryo energy.if you were the marines perhaps, you could get your hands on an arsenal of different weaponary ranging from laser pistols to fully fledged alien assault rifles and even grenade launchers! using your leaning ability you can shoot around corners with out getting hit (but the game cheats sometimes and you can get hit through a wall).With all these in mind, you are not resticted to your class qualities alone. you can spend your cyber modules on skills from the other classes and not feel guilty either. Although the impulse is to go for a Jack of all trades approach, its best to stay loyal to the chosen path.The games difficulty is an interesting aspect of the game. You will be underpowered, and you will be killed faster then your pc rig can play pong. the vunerablility of the player gives a sense of danger, what could possibly be around the corner, or what could possibliy bring me to an end? thats the intention. The game wants you to pay attention to its surrounding, where one wrong move could mean your life, or slow you down from progressing. The atmosphere of the game is astounding! It has that Half life and dead space feel to it, but darker and scarier. the corridors have mutant crewmembers, rouge cyborgs and even (monkeys?) ready to snap you in half. And even as you progress further through the game you are constantly Taunted by SHODAN (the antagonist) as if you were just a mere bug. nothing encourages you as you progress, but you feel the reward of going against that.The audio logs of crewmembers found throughout the ship helps the player to understand what has happened to them or the events in a personal manner. You are sunken into the mystery of what happened to the crew member as you find audio log after the other, just like chapters in a book. I absolutley love when developers give characters more depth through audio logs or written passages.The music and all dont always give the atmospheric vibe you should expect from a game of this caliber, but sometimes, silence is the best kind of music.In all, I was satisfied with the ending of the game and the twists and turns inbetween, and for any of those wondering whether to buy this or not, i reckon its a worthy investment of your time and money.

I would highly recommend this game to friends but i would warn them to conserve their ammo and medical items. This game gets a 10 out of 10 in my book.			"

												Tense. Scary. Deep. Gripping. A wonderful experience for a BioShock fan like me, uncovering how the series was born and finding a story just as interesting as Rapture and gameplay way more satisfying than I could have imagined. The fights in this are some of the most white knuckle moments I've had in a game, playing out more like a really high pressure MMORPG battle than the simple shooters future entries were. I encourage anyone who loves good survival gameplay, where you really have to think about what supplies you have and what build your character is, to try this out. And of course, that story.That ♥♥♥♥ing awesome story.			"

												System Shock 2 is known all around as a cult classic in everyway. A game that redefined PC gaming. There hasn't been many games as critically aclaimed as System Shock 2. I actually haven't played System Shock 2 until now. Now i realized what people were talking about. It was a great game style and tight controls. A very diverse gameplay style and unique quality which many games of the new mdoern generation fail to have. An art style that feels like Deus Ex. This game feels like the blueprint for future first person action games to come. It's also a horror game. This game is filled with Scares which will make you wanna wet yourself, but also do it in such a good way that makes it such an immersive experience. Only complaint is that that the graphics haven't aged well at all. But just like the almighty classic Ocarina Of TIme, even with aged graphics, this game has a type of artstyle and charm that surpass Pixels and HD shapes. 9/10 Pros: innovative gameplay, revolutionary first person mechanics, Very unique artstyle and story, An amazing horror immersive experience, a true classic. Cons: Graphics age is very noticable			"

												System Shock 2, even though it's going on 15 years old now, is still a fantastic game.  Like the first time I played through it, I still jump at certain spots.  With the character customization, it's play-throughs vary considerably.  It's audio log system adds so much to the atmosphere, and while not every audio log is required to advance the game, the extra logs add so much ambiance and story.  This reminds me of a time when it wasn't only graphics that were important, but telling a good story, sucking the players into the game.Game installed perfectly and ran perfectly on my Windows 7 system, something that blew my mind, because I remember trying to jimmy this game into working on older OS's, but newer than what it was designed for, and it was a huge pain in the rear-end.There is really no reason not to purchase, install, and play the hell out of this game...  unless graphics are the only reason you play games.  If you want a great story, a great game, buy System Shock 2.			"

												If you never got around to playing System Shock 1 and do not plan to in the near future you can read up on everything that happened before System Shock 2 here. In all honesty though, since we now have an updated version of System Shock 1 available on Steam and GOG there is no reason not to play it.The protagonist of System Shock 2 is soldier G65434-2, one of the UNN soldiers aboard the Rickenbacker. After awaking from cold sleep with no memory of the journey up to this point he awakens on the Von Braun's medical/science deck. He is immediately greeted via intercom by Dr. Janice Polito, the Von Braun's senior systems analyst. She tells him that the ship is under the control of an unknown force and she needs the soldier to help her retake control of the ship. Also, she was responsible for having the soldier implanted with military grade cyberware. Thus soldier G65434-2 gets on his way to get control over the ship back with only Dr. Polito guiding him.System Shock 2 is one of the games that are really hard to define by genre. One could call it an action adventure survival horror game with elements of first person shooters and roleplaying games. On the surface it plays like an FPS but has much more complexity to it. At the beginning of the game the player can choose the soldiers' military background thus giving him some starting abilities. All further upgrades are done ingame via cyber modules. The military branch only effects the starting abilities, any ability can be learned during the game. The three classes are Marine, Navy and O.S.A. Agent. While the marine focuses on weapons, the navy soldier is skilled at hacking and the O.S.A agent can use psi powers.The game is all about managing your resources. The cyber modules are hard to find and increasing levels of abilities also have increasing cost. There are numerous helpful abilities. You can choose to increase attributes like strength, dexterity and cyber as well as weapon abilities (standard, energy, heavy, exotic) which are prerequisite for using certain weapons. You'll also want to learn some tech abilities like hacking or modifying and and maintaining weapons. Hacking can help you bypass security systems, open secure crates or make vending machines sell additional items at a cheaper price. Tech abilities can greatly help you tip the hostile environment in your favor. Tech abilities also feature research. Research allows you to get additional information about enemies or items giving you passive bonuses against those enemies or enabling you to use those items. If you're playing heavy on psi abilities many of your cyber modules will go into those since some of the more expensive abilities are extremely powerful.System Shock 2's sound design and level design alone is worth a look. The game conveys the feeling of being alone in a hostile environment where everything is out to kill you. The ship feels large and you will revisit areas of it, unlocking paths there were closed off before. Searching all the rooms for consumables, access cards, ""money"" (nanites) and cyber modules is worth it since you will need all the resources you can get. You will also come along various audio logs that contain interesting background and also valuable information. Some of the crew have left several audio logs. If you find all of them they convey short stories about those characters.There's only one thing about System Shock 2 that I imagine could turn people off: it is really complex and some people may find overcomplicated. But if you like complex games or are willing to overlook that fact you are in for a hell of a ride with great gameplay depth, interesting and enjoyable characters, a convincing, sprawling environment and a creepy, chilly atmosphere.More reviews here "

												System Shock 2 is a must buy for ANYONE who likes Action RPGs, First Person Horror, or story-driven games. This game was the inspiration for BioShock and was made by most of the same team. Irrational Games with some help from the gods of the First-Person RPG, the now-defunct Looking Glass Studios, crafted an amazing first person atmospheric RPG experience that has some of the best writing and deepest mechanics of any game ever. The visual style has aged pretty well aside from the character models but mods can fix it or you can just ignore the visuals entirely because the sound design is where the game shines. The haunting moans of the hybrids, the slow beeps of security cameras, the announcements from an AI totally oblivious to what has happened, and of course, the taunting of one of gaming's greatest female characters, SHODAN. If you like BioShock, System Shock 2 is BioShock but better.			"

												System Shock 2 is a mix of FPS, RPG and even survival horror, Irrational Games's sequel to the the Looking Glass's classic using their Dark Engine, released in 1999. You probably know this game as ""that some random game that every classic gamer is required to be bonkers about"". It also was supposed to come out for Sega Dreamcast but didn't. Shame.Then in 2013 this game got rereleased digitally thanks to Night Dive studios. Who are quire a heroes, managing to bring this IP out of legal hell, as it was owned by three companies. With some insurance company being one. Now they own it and thus were able to re-release System Shock games so we can all buy it legally and digitally. They also updated the game to work on modern system.Technically, this game should work pretty nicely on modern systems. It supports widescreen too.However I had a strange glitch where cutscene movies will not play if I had Firefox Internet browser running. No idea what was conflicting there. But I guess it's just your everyday PC Oh-So-Master Race thing. HA!This game also includes coop multiplayer. Not sure about multiplayer community, after all it doesn't use server browser, you have to connect directly to IP. So don't expect to just play with random, gotta nag friends up.And from what I heard multiplayer is there because EA, the original publisher, demanded it. It really is single-player experience. So I guess it's something just-for-funz, not designed for. I just know that they would put game on Hard difficulty. But I didn't yet play it.Plotwise the game is a direct continuation of the first System Shock, a cyberpunk setting. Or sci-fi. SHODAN's returns once again, as spoiled by cover art. But there is a new horror you must defeat as well on Von Braun ship, the first ever Faster Than Light ship with unknown side effects, accomplished by the Rivenbark ship for security. Or rather, because PsiOptimum and UNN don't trust each other.Game itself is often called a father of Bioshock games, as well as infulencing other FPS games. There are similar things to it indeed. There is a wrench, there is magical PSI powers, there are logs to learn stories and codes.You will explore the ship, trying to survive and often backtracking. Ammo is rare and you often will have to use wrench. While also having RPG system that will decide what you can do and what you currently can't equip.And when compared to System Shock 1 it pretty much adds two things heavily: RPG elements and Survival Horror.Yet I can't help but to feel dissapointment in this mix of FPS and RPG. Probably because I loved the first one more. The first game was about world immersion, it was about combining all the elements into one belivable game. It had RPG elements, but cleverly implented. You was growing in power, but you did it not with some stats management but by finding new weapons and new hardware, which gave you new powers that you also had to use wisely.It also gave you full feeling that it was YOU who was taking on SHODAN. No pointers, no objective clearly written, you had to figure it all out by yourself from logs.The sequel hovewer decided to add much more videogamey RPG elements to it, that it pretty much screws the original ideology of System Shock. The stats building ones, yep. And yea, it's one of those cases where the abstraction of RPG elements doesn't fit perfectly with FPS immersion. Like, for example, you need to have at least 3 points in ""standard"" weapons category to equip shotgun. Like, we aren't talking about shooting horribly, it's about not knowing how to pull the trigger, it seems.It also isn't well balanced either. There are options that are much more efficient than others. And some options are so unefficient in how much precious points they require, it's hard for me to say that this game is designed for variety of playstyle. More like for punishing for not knowing what's ahead. It's a linear game after all, with 10+ hours requirement, so it's not sliding. Like, here high investments into hacking, mantaintance and standart weapons are requirements, but no one will tell you so.Ok, I just did. Welp, at least was lucky that my build was using those so I didn't screw myself.That, and it feels a bit more dumbened down as well. Ok, more specific, in the name of RPGness, the hacking mini-games were changed from the proper puzzles into just stat-checking RNG thing. And lots of PSI magic weren't so useful.SHODAN also felt less signifant here, strange that she gained any reputation of character and made every second person on retro forum have her as avatar because of this sequel. That, and I felt much less like I was the one who was moving on storyline, instead being felt like an errand boy. With all objectives clearly being told to you in PDA notes, along with all codes that you have ever saw, so there is only a single time you have to kinda remember and analyse it yourself (""art"" part).I mean, it's not exactly what I would usually complain much. I don't hate what people call ""casualized"" fun. Like it, even. But we are talking about sequel to System Shock 1. And not just sequel, but the one which is called hardcore old classic and has 96 metacritic score and just gets praised as best game ever. And I came in with my body and mind ready for such thing. But oh well.Not to say that this sequel is a lost cause. After all it adds more of survival horror to it and some of it is awesome! Thanks to technology of 1999 too. It feels even less abstract and more like real ship. And with such technology, it can show horror much more effective. Mind it, there are no jumpscares. Just twisted, trippy things going on, especially as the end comes closer. It really is quite experience. With nice ambient music occasionally. And action ones too.Heck, it even makes you often feel unsafe. There is nothing like being busy reading a newly acquired log only to notice a mutant walking into the room where you are hiding.I also liked the fact that it was taking itself more like survival horror gameplay-wise too, where your ammo and recources are scarse. And everything costs nanities (money thing) now. Well, they kept respawning chamber thing which may not fit with survival, but at least it costs nanities too, even if very very cheap.It even makes ammo scarse and all guns are easily breakable. Which sounds like survival horror thing. Almost. Because they didn't manage to balance it right, as early in game guns break so much that they are more scarse than ammo. And later in game the whole survival horror feels to go away and instead replaced by just hard corridor shooter. And hard corridor shooter isn't same as hard survival horror. Not to mention that while other Survival Horror have ""shoot or run"" thing, this one has ""WRENCH THEM ALL and sometimes shoot"". No, seriously, melee there is pretty much for everything aside from worms because they are too tiny. Annoying thing. System Shock 1 also had you using melee a lot, but that was because it was very effective and thus mixing of melee/ranged was fun. In SS2, I dunno, it just isn't. You use unfun melee because game doesn't want you to have fun.Okay, I actually had a fun. And as said, I got lucky with my build. Just a shame that in beggining it will not be much fun for most with those gun breakage while at end it deflates. Then again, later levels, after Von Braun ship, are quite generic and mediocre, really.Also, research mechanic was interesting. Real-time slow process which also requires visiting chemistry rooms for some chemistry, as there are too many to carry.But you know, it's quite a goody adventure otherwise. Albeit not the best game ever, sure thing it's not. Quite overrated. But hey, that happens sometimes. Hopefully System Shock 3 will be more in line of what System Shock 1 was standing for.That, and I want to take one of those maintaince bots to my house. Too cute.			"

												A great game. It has worn well through the years as a story, and even though the graphics may turn you away, don't let them. The atmosphere of this game is executed very well and the feeling that something is lurking around the corner always catches you by surprise. It has fast-paced action elements with a unsettling dark tone. An RPG for the books. Strongly recommend playing in a dark room, with headphones and by yourself. This game has been an amazing experience. I strongly recommend purchasing this game.			"

												System shock 2 is one of the best sci fi horror rpg that I have ever played. The game takes place on the worlds first star ship ""The Van Braun"", unfortunately, the ship has been taken over by an hybrid force known as ""The Many"", you would then have to explore and do certain task to reach your main objective.The level design is great the graphics are not great but you could download mods to optimize your graphics. There is something called ""fan missions"", fan missions are levels that you could download off of websites, fan missions are my favorite part about system shock 2 because you could create your own custom levels and the fan missions you could get are VERY fun! The soundtrack for the game is one of the best that I have ever heard, some songs are creepy, some are awesome, but sometimes they will start creepy and then they would sound kick butt. The gameplay is slow paste at first, but the more you level up, it will start to become a bit more fast paste and at some points chaotic. There is multiplayer, but you would need to download a program in order to play with your friends. The story and chrectors are well written, the AI could be stupid at some points but its usually not a problem for this game. I give this game a 8/10			"

												System Shock 2 is a must buy for ANYONE who likes Action RPGs, First Person Horror, or story-driven games. This game was the inspiration for BioShock and was made by most of the same team. Irrational Games with some help from the gods of the First-Person RPG, the now-defunct Looking Glass Studios, crafted an amazing first person atmospheric RPG experience that has some of the best writing and deepest mechanics of any game ever. The visual style has aged pretty well aside from the character models but mods can fix it or you can just ignore the visuals entirely because the sound design is where the game shines. The haunting moans of the hybrids, the slow beeps of security cameras, the announcements from an AI totally oblivious to what has happened, and of course, the taunting of one of gaming's greatest female characters, SHODAN. If you like BioShock, System Shock 2 is BioShock but better.			"

												As someone who only just played this game for the first time last week, I can definitely say that this is one of my top 10 FPS games. The gameplay, while a mesh of three different genres, does it very well. Combat works well, and is satisfying. Movement is a bit wonky, but it's easy enough to get used to. I love the character building element, meaning a different experience depending on what you choose to upgrade, both early and later in the game.The story is great, as well as the atmosphere. Listening to the audio logs to fill in the story, all relies on you, and it really sucks you into the game. I love how you can explore the whole ship, and it IS a ship, complete with everything you expect a ship to contain, including bathrooms (minor detail, but again helps the immersion). After a while, you really begin to dread most things, especially once you slowly realize just how alone you are on this ship full of monsters, killer cyborgs, and murderous AI's.While the game looks old now, being it's been 15 years, you can easily mod the game using the new engine (included with the Steam release), as well as other aspects. The music, amazing, though a tad out of place in my opinion (only the hyper-techno sections, the normal ""horror"" segments are great for the feel). While it didn't ""scare"" me as much as I had hoped, I still got a little spooked just at the story alone, as well as some of the enemies (Cyborg Midwives, holy crap). As I said, atmosphere is king, and you do well to allow yourself to get ""sucked in"" to the game.Overall, a great release; and after playing it from a modern standpoint, I still think it holds up well today. I believe now when people say it's one of the most ""innovative"" FPS games in the last 20 years, as well as it's overall quality. Worth a shot, definitely now that it's available to everyone on modern machines thanks to Steam.			"

												7/10This has always been a great game-visually and mechanically it holds up well still(textures on players/npcs look bad but still playable and sound design is great)- but it must be said:There are still a ton of issues playing this COOP. Multiplayer desynchs are common, and I would say it is unplayable to have more than 2 people(maybe more with hamachi if you want to put in the effort, I played over IP). Even with two, prepare to have 3 or 4 save files you constantly use due to desynchs happening at maybe 1 in 5 times you go to another area.			"

If you play this game with a friend on a very high difficulty, you might just kill your friendship.			"

												System Shock 2 is a tense game. You’re lost in a derelict spaceship, away from everything and everyone, while trying your best to survive and understand what is going on. Every element of this game is masterfully designed to keep you always at the edge; weapons break all the time, ammo is hard to find and the inventory space is limited, meaning you never feel well-equipped and has to make tough decisions. The levels are claustrophobic and help to create the heavy atmosphere of loneliness, but also feel real, an actual spaceship, not a pointless maze. Even with danger lurking in every corner, exploration feels great; there are various secret caches, and you will slowly uncover the fate of the crew through mutilated corpses, bloody scenes and the now-famous voice logs. On top of all that, the class system provides many builds for players to try out, various solutions to the diverse challenges and a solid reason for multiple playthroughts of this gem.			"

												SS2 is one of those rare games/movies that affect you so profoundly...emotionally, cognitively, physiologically...that you are simultaneously overwhelmed by the experience and sadly resigned to the fact you can't forget it all and experience it for the first time again.  It has plot twists that sucker punch you like The Sixth Sense, and depth that challenges your mind like Inception.  The atmosphere alone is enough to make you feel a sense of fear and dread while playing.  Be warned though, if you're idea of a great game is the latest eye-candy-scripted-shooter you can play through in 10-12 hours, you may miss the point and experience of SS2.  You actually have to read and think to fully experience the game ;-)  In case you spring for it, here are a couple of links to help you get the most out of your first experience:SS2 ModdingSS2 Newbie Guide[www.shtupmod.net]TTLG SS2/Thief Fan Site[www.ttlg.com]I highly suggest loading all the mods in the steam forum post, as they will improve the graphics significantly.

												If you never got around to playing System Shock 1 and do not plan to in the near future you can read up on everything that happened before System Shock 2 here. In all honesty though, since we now have an updated version of System Shock 1 available on Steam and GOG there is no reason not to play it.The protagonist of System Shock 2 is soldier G65434-2, one of the UNN soldiers aboard the Rickenbacker. After awaking from cold sleep with no memory of the journey up to this point he awakens on the Von Braun's medical/science deck. He is immediately greeted via intercom by Dr. Janice Polito, the Von Braun's senior systems analyst. She tells him that the ship is under the control of an unknown force and she needs the soldier to help her retake control of the ship. Also, she was responsible for having the soldier implanted with military grade cyberware. Thus soldier G65434-2 gets on his way to get control over the ship back with only Dr. Polito guiding him.System Shock 2 is one of the games that are really hard to define by genre. One could call it an action adventure survival horror game with elements of first person shooters and roleplaying games. On the surface it plays like an FPS but has much more complexity to it. At the beginning of the game the player can choose the soldiers' military background thus giving him some starting abilities. All further upgrades are done ingame via cyber modules. The military branch only effects the starting abilities, any ability can be learned during the game. The three classes are Marine, Navy and O.S.A. Agent. While the marine focuses on weapons, the navy soldier is skilled at hacking and the O.S.A agent can use psi powers.The game is all about managing your resources. The cyber modules are hard to find and increasing levels of abilities also have increasing cost. There are numerous helpful abilities. You can choose to increase attributes like strength, dexterity and cyber as well as weapon abilities (standard, energy, heavy, exotic) which are prerequisite for using certain weapons. You'll also want to learn some tech abilities like hacking or modifying and and maintaining weapons. Hacking can help you bypass security systems, open secure crates or make vending machines sell additional items at a cheaper price. Tech abilities can greatly help you tip the hostile environment in your favor. Tech abilities also feature research. Research allows you to get additional information about enemies or items giving you passive bonuses against those enemies or enabling you to use those items. If you're playing heavy on psi abilities many of your cyber modules will go into those since some of the more expensive abilities are extremely powerful.System Shock 2's sound design and level design alone is worth a look. The game conveys the feeling of being alone in a hostile environment where everything is out to kill you. The ship feels large and you will revisit areas of it, unlocking paths there were closed off before. Searching all the rooms for consumables, access cards, ""money"" (nanites) and cyber modules is worth it since you will need all the resources you can get. You will also come along various audio logs that contain interesting background and also valuable information. Some of the crew have left several audio logs. If you find all of them they convey short stories about those characters.There's only one thing about System Shock 2 that I imagine could turn people off: it is really complex and some people may find overcomplicated. But if you like complex games or are willing to overlook that fact you are in for a hell of a ride with great gameplay depth, interesting and enjoyable characters, a convincing, sprawling environment and a creepy, chilly atmosphere.More reviews here "

												 Oh sweet baby Jesus! Why do I hear monkeys? And why are there so MANY?!?An oldie but a goodie. Yes this game shows its age in the dated graphics, but the story and gameplay are solid. A magnificent blend of FPS, survival horror, with RPG elements thrown in for good measure. You start the game as a raw recruit. Add some basic and advanced training tactics and then choose your path to glory.......glory of the MANY!I won't ruin the story. There is misdirection and subterfuge abound, a mentally unhinged protagonist/antagonist, monkeys, ghosts, ninjas, and true love. And it's in SPACE!!! Who doesn't like killing stuff in SPACE? Precursor to the Bioshock series (which were considered to be the ""spiritual""successors to this very game.) The controls take some getting used to, since this game released more than 15 years ago. It's challenging. Ammo is scarce as are nanites. Enemies require specialized ammo. Limited inventory space necessitates the need to constantly evaluate what to keep. The sound effects are the best part of this game and will constantly having you wiping your sweaty palms on your pants every time. There are some jump scares, but mainly the stage is set through the sound. Will you run in fear or take the fight to them? Run!Join Us! "

												System Shock 2 is a must buy for ANYONE who likes Action RPGs, First Person Horror, or story-driven games. This game was the inspiration for BioShock and was made by most of the same team. Irrational Games with some help from the gods of the First-Person RPG, the now-defunct Looking Glass Studios, crafted an amazing first person atmospheric RPG experience that has some of the best writing and deepest mechanics of any game ever. The visual style has aged pretty well aside from the character models but mods can fix it or you can just ignore the visuals entirely because the sound design is where the game shines. The haunting moans of the hybrids, the slow beeps of security cameras, the announcements from an AI totally oblivious to what has happened, and of course, the taunting of one of gaming's greatest female characters, SHODAN. If you like BioShock, System Shock 2 is BioShock but better.			"

												Since this game was made in 1999 you notice how crappy the graphics or NPC's are, however, this game is amazing, the potientail that this game has is outstanding. I was pretty much, hoping for the author to pop out all of the sudden and say ""I plan to update this game completly, everyone who bought System Shock 2 Will get a free copy of the new updated game System Shock 3 :)"" But that didn't happen, Oh well, at least we have you system shock 2. The game itself is good, if you know what to do and how to do it, if you don't know what to do or where to go, then you might as well be trying to eat pie without your mouth. I really enjoy it, and i was suprised on how good the game was considering the fact it was made, a while back, not only that but i was also suprised on how smoothly it ran throught the whole time i was playing, perhaps it got scared of the old graphics. I would recommend this game to the people that are open minded when it comes to old games, don't mind playing old video games, and people who like scare's now and then. Would not recommend to people whom Dislike horror games, outdated graphics and plots, ect ect. Other than that I would rate 11/10 Cats.			"

												Do you like sci-fi? Do you like FPS? Do you like RPG? Do you like cyberpunk? Did you happen to like a game called: ""Deus Ex"", by any chance? If you answered ""yes"" any of these, then this game is most likely relevant to your interests. System Shock 2 is a wonderful mix of RPG and FPS in a dark and isolated enviroment, so it's something for the horror fans as well. This is one dark and mysterious game, and can be a bit hard to learn from the start, but once you get a hang of it, it's one of the more immersive games you've probably ever played. It's not really expensive, since it's an old game, but it's a good one for that matter, this was the game that inspired many games today. If you wanna see where many of the popular games nowadays have taken inspiration from, you should definately try System Shock 2.			"

												WHOAAAAAA! I picked it up because of its high metacritic score and lots of people say it's a classic and one of the most important shooter. I later found out it was made by Irrational Games, the ones who made my one of my favorite games, Bioshock. The ressemblances are striking. It's really quite the experience to play the spiritual ancestor of Bioshock. The controls may intimidate players but the whole gameplay isn't meant for your average gamer. I suggest you to configure the keys to something you're more used to. Any Bioshock fan will feel at home in this game. The pacing is similar although the map are less straight forward. It's incredibly challenging, yet, rewarding. Ammo, health packs, respawn areas, weapons, everything is scarce. I gotta admit that I had to use the console frequently to help myself. I highly suggest you to quicksave as often as you can. I bound quicksave to Enter and quickload to Backspace. The ending is quite amazing also. I wish I'd discover this earlier when I was a kid but in 1999 I was 5. Great game, a must have for Bioshock fans, at $2,50 it's a steal!			"

												Shock 1, Ultima Underworld, Terra Nova, Thief sjećate li se tih naslova? Does these names ring any bells? Gaming tvrtka Looking Glass zadužena za sve ove naslove okupivši par u to doba amaterskih programera koji su radili side projects na ovim igrama je izdala pod svojim bannerom System Shock 2.Kako ocijenit igru koja je izašla 1999 godine u 2014toj? Nemoguća misija?! Varate se, kultni naslov nikad ne gubi svoju čar. Iako sam sam igrao igru malo nakon što je u orginalu izašla (konfiguracija mi je bila p4,1GB RAM,Voodoo Graphics) sad nakon 15 godina imam isti osjećaj. Thank you STEAM na playable verziji igre! Pa pogledajte samo review ove igre prije 15 godina, sve te silne nagrade, jednostavno naslov je masterpiece! Od kraja do početka, jedna od rijetkih koja ima što se kaže u našem žanru ""dušu"". Koncept, ideja, storyline, atmosfera. Nimalo zahtjevna a ako volite ovaj žanr (Cyperpunk, Sci-Fi, RPG, Horror) i dalje igriva i držat će vas za tastaturom. Ukratko o System Shock-u:Igra se odvija na zvjezdanom brodu u 2114 godini. Igrač preuzima ulogu usamljenog vojnika koji pokušava zaustaviti epidemiju genetske zaraze koja je poharala brod. Gameplay se sastoji od igre u prvom licu i istraživanja. Također uključuje elemente sistemskih razvijanja jedinstvenih vještina i osobina, kao što su hacking i psionic sposobnosti. Sama igra uključuje elemente RPGa te ima odličnu horor atmosferu.Možda novije generacije neće htjeti i neće imati želje da se vrate ka ovom starom naslovu ali ja kao već sad ""old-gamer"" itekako želim.Nemojte zaboravit da iza ovog naslova stoji Ken Levine ""mastermind"" koji je osmislio i ostvario multi milionski projekat, igru ""Bioshock"" nasljednika, te kroz nju progurao sve elemente gameinga zastupljenog u System Shocku. Čak je u više navrata rekao da je System Shock sa svojim uspjesima i razvojem te načinom igre bio orginalno prethodnik Bioshock-a.http://theigraison.wordpress.com/ "

This game in my book still sends the shivvers and chills of isolation down my spine. I finished this 3 times and theres not a better horror title from the late 90's that compares to this in imersiveness. Regardless, don't let me keep babbling about this game and all it's BEAUTIFUL GLORY! Of horror. Play the damn game and never leave those goodies behind when you need them. I'd wish you luck, but luck is not in this game at all.Oh... I guess you can say this is a ""shock"" to my computer ""system"".			"

												absolutely one of the most bone chilling gaming experiences i've had the pleasure of undergoing. if you let yourself get immersed, or worse, comfortable, you will be in for the most pleasantly unpleasant 10 hours of your game life. of course, 90s textures can only do so much for the horror atmosphere, which is why i recommend graphical enhancement mods like SHTUP, which can be found on the system shock forum (first result on google) and also mods for weapon models and the like. SHMUP is also a vital enhancement since it attempts to fix the low bitrate soundtrack, which improves immersion. theres a list of recommended mods on reddit that have every texture mod you could like. the story, gameplay, UI and level design are all genius, and require your full attention at all times, since you will find yourself backtracking a lot and needing to go back to storages or other areas for your own benefit. no quest markers here, just a minimap and your memory. the only real complaint i have about this game is the lack of strafing and then the unfortunate end cutscene, which i like to pretend never happened. overall this game is an incredibly pleasing experience, well worth 10 dollars or any sale price.

~ Your flesh is an insult to the perfection of the digital. ~You've probably heard it by now, but System Shock 2 can basically be described best as ""RPG BioShock set in space"". But considering SS2 was first it basically means BioShock is ""FPS System Shock 2 set under the sea"". But I digress. SS2 takes place on the Von Braun, a spaceship that's surrounded by the darkness of space. After training for four years (or four minutes in our lives) you wake up on the Von Braun. If that's not enough to feel claustrophobic, early on you also find out something mysteriously and equally terrifying had happened on the ship on your absence. Guided by another survivor you start from the bottom of the ship and you work yourself to the top to uncover the ship's secrets. No marks, no hints, you're mostly on your own and there's little to no holdings hands (as it should be). Gameplay wise it holds up great, the combat is deep, the pacing is good, and there may be some dated animations here and there, but nothing too serious. Combat can be experienced as a little less flexible than BioShock for example, but that's because you're ""stuck"" with your current build, due to the skill points you invested in it, which means you can't drastically change your play style in SS2, which was possible in BioShock. But on the other hand, it means the replay value is higher in SS2.This is the first time I played this 16 year old game and I'd definitely recommend this for other people who like a good RPG dripping with atmosphere that doesn't hold your hands, like most of the games nowadays.+ An isolated feeling, claustrophobic, drips with atmosphere.+ Main antagonist is very sinister and interesting, good story.+ Optional audio logs you can find add to the atmosphere.+ Expansive gameplay with lots of options to suit your play style. + Little to no holding hands. There are no markers of any sorts.-/+ - No subtitles. Which isn't a big problem, even for non-native English speakers like me, but sometimes there's a lot of background noise in-game which makes it a little hard to hear. But there's a log system that you can use to reread most of the dialogues and diaries.- Some (not all) songs are way too ""bombastic' and sound somewhat out of place, they don't have that feeling of isolation and claustrophobia to begin with. - Some enemies, at least at first, spawn very quickly, which can lead to some frustration. Especially in the beginning when you're not exactly full on Medical and Psi hypos.- The final boss battle ends on a ridiculous and downright out-of-place note that may leave you with somewhat of a sour taste in your mouth. ""Nah."" The final cut scene after that is good though.  "

												This might be the best game I've ever played, seriously.After no luck with the original Deus Ex from the fact I just couldn't get into it (Human Revolution is my favorite game), I was rather jaded and cynical. Having loved Bioshock 1 and 2 equally and the love I have for the dead space franchise (even though it's annoyingly console oriented), I thought ""eh it's only like £1 on♥♥♥♥♥quot;. The major dissapointment of Bioshock: Infinite, granted I only played on it on console, made me want to explore the roots of two of my favorite games. I did research into Irrational Games throughout the late 90's and thinking of those programmers, sound engineers and art designers crammed into a tiny room creating this gave me a whole new appreciation for video game creation.So on starting the game, I found all the different elements confusing at first (as with a lot of games), but immediately started noticing the similarities between bioshock and SS2:  - PSI = EVE - Cybernetic Modules = ADAM - Security Codes - Wrench - and much more.Given that this game was created barely a year after I was born, it has aged phenominally well and feels like a modern AAA title just with worse graphics. Also SHODAN is now my favorite villian of all time, maniny due to the creepy apperance and voice(s). The Many is also a VERY creepy villian and ALMOST tops SHODAN and how I noticed the similarities between The Many and The Corruption.I didn't feel as if playing the first game was nessasary and I think even after playing this I would find it just too dated. I didn't however, use any additional mods or graphical enhancements and played on easy because I'm bad :P. I can't wait to play the user created levels.So in summary, this game is near perfect and DO NOT EVEN HESITATE to buy it, seriously. The Many flesh levels and the rather underwhelming boss fight were the ONLY bad things (I actually liked the ending, made me chuckle). And then we have news that System Shock 3 in development and Terri Brosius is again voicing SHODAN which is the best news ever. I feel as if this game was made for me, as do so many others.-----98/100 - a.k.a BUY IT!			"

												Don't mind my recorded time. i Played and beat the GOG version of the game.Simply putting, if you are fan of Bioshock games, you will feel right at home.System Shock 2 is survival horror set in  spaceship filled with zombie-like monsters and other aliens.The game had quite a good atmosphere to it and sometimes can be challenging and tough, with weapons break often, ammo is rare and and you have to use heal items a lot, and they don't heal you instantly.like Bioshock, you have your Bio-weapons for magic attacks, you can hack systems and turrets to your advantage and develop special ammo for your weapons and upgrade your characters (Toughness, Hack ability, stamina,etc...)If you are into survival horror FPS games and a fan of Bioshock i absolutely recommend you this game, and yes, it has an active modding community.Just note: if you have a modern PC, this game might give you troubles. be sure to install community patches.

												It may be heading towards having been release for 15 years, but thanks to overhauls, compatibility patches and high definition texture packs, it's kept a lot of the graphical shine.And this is nicely backed up by the great storyline and voice acting throughout, along with some truly suspenseful and terrifying parts.If you've never played it, play it at least once. If you don't own it and you like it, then WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?BUY IT!			"

												SS2 needs no introduction, its one of those games which took the FPS/RPG hybrid genre forward. This is a game which is completely ahead of its time by all means, it has a powerful story, an awesome pacing, well crafted narration and the gameplay is so unique there are tonns of options you can use while playing. These options are basically character development, you have a deep system of Stats, Skills and Attributes just like an RPG game and thus adds up to the replaybility. Even weapons come in variety and you have to stick to a specific class of weapons, energy based, bullet based, explosive, melee or even your cybernetic powers like telekinesis and stuff. There is a lot of exploration, you scavenge the environment for ammo, health and other things to survive, the premis of the game speaks for itself, story comes to you by means of PDF's and audiologs found all around the area. The story is suspense and as it unfolds, it drops your jaw.The atmosphere is thick and the musical score if composed by non other than the pioneer Eric brosius. This game comes from the same people who later on developed Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite, this is Ken Levines first Master Piece...Im not a fan boy but i can confidently say that SS2 does a lot many things much better than Bioshock.If you like Cyberpunk, RPG, FPS or even if you liked the first Deus EX, YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS GAME...

												My personality- I'm a player who prides himself in trying to experience a game as the makers had originally intended. This includes setting the difficulty in most games to a high enough level that it requires me to put thought into how I invest my limited resources, yet not so difficult that I'm trying to save precious ammo (or health, etc) by fighting a single fight only to run back to the last point of safety to re-group. I also appreciate (somewhat) linear narrative games with in depth plots and character building...REVIEW - I found this game extremely enjoyable for almost it's whole duration. The plot was something I could imerse myself into and get hooked. The character depth was slightly limited (with respect to some of the newer games that have come out) but not so much that it felt like it lacked something. Putting myself back into the year this game was released, I would have indeed called it revolutionary. A great game overall.(SPOILERS) However...I was extremely irritated by one HUGE miss... throughout the game, the choices I made left it literally impossible to defeat the final boss. I had chosen to invest my point in skill other than hacking, which when it came time to fight SHODAN without ICE-picks it was literally impossible to defeat her. I did not find this out till later. I spent a long time fighting her, intrigued and perplexed by the difficulty, I kept telling myself that there was something I'm missing. This increased my anticipation for the moment when I finally figured it out. Eventually I explored what seemed like every option. I resorted, to what I consider my LAST resort, I looked up how to defeat her online. If any of you share my personality, you know how difficult a choice this was. What I discovered was that, in fact, I was doing all the right things, but because of my choices ealier in the game, I could not finish the game. This left me irritated and frustrated. In my opinion one of the best things about a game is the nostalgic feeling that you get when you think about a game that you had finished awhile back. The final boss SHODAN removed this feeling from this game for me entirely. My suggestion... if you really want to experience this game as the revolutionary and awesome game that it truly was... Put at least one point into Hacking!If you take my advice you will experience a great game, unfortunately my own was ruined by a design miss on the developer's part.			"

												This game has one of the best atmospheres of any I've ever played.I absolutely loved playing this game back in my high school years, and it was nothing but enjoyable all the way through. I never thought I'd see the day where monkeys would make me paranoid and make me scared to turn the corner.If you're a fan of BioShock, you'll find System Shock 2 to be very similar to that series, is I believe this is the spiritual predecessor to the series. It has great game feel, in my opinion, and it has this eerie feeling to it, and that's just increased so much more by the respawning enemies. Hell, the hybrids still freak me out to this day, and I love it.While it's an old game, it's a damn good one at that, and for $10 it's definitely worth the pick up if you're into sci-fi FPS games, with a horror-theme. The audio logs just got so much more enjoyable and set up the atmosphere for the game so much more over time. Definitely check it out if you have the time!			"

												If you're a gamer who needs cutting-edge graphics to make a game worthwhile...take a pass on this one.  But to every one else...what are you waiting for?System Shock 2 was (and IS) a crossroads in gaming history.  It's the first true 'hybrid'...combination of horror, survival, RPG, FPS, and story-driven actioner.  PLUS it's got the single greatest 'reveal' in gaming history!  (NOTE - remember that it's 17 years old...if you've been playing that long, you'll remember that games didn't hold a lot of surprises back then.)The mechanics and inventory management aspects are a bit clunky, but they're easily doable once you get into the swing of it.  And unlike a lot of more recent RPG games, you absolutely CAN NOT max all skills, particularly if you go with the hardest settings.  Which means that, on the 'Impossible' rank, you have to be very careful about where you spend your upgrade points.  If you're smart, you may be able to max the one skill that saves your life.First timers may find it a bit of a cliche, but you have to remember...this is the game that created those cliches.  Classic games like Bioshock and Deus Ex were spawned from System Shock 2...so if you are a fan of those games, you owe it to yourself to experience the grandfather of them all.  But maybe I'm just an old fart who loves the evolution of games...decide for yourself.			"

												Are you the kind of gamer who almost exclusively enjoys super-fast first-person games in which you race about at lightning speed, effortlessly shooting hundreds and thousands of enemies with the aid of a seemingly inexhaustible supply of ammo loaded into a vast array of super-duper-mega-weapons which never jam and are capable of obliterating almost an entire herd of beasties in a single mouse-click?  Then you may well enjoy the Serious Sam games...and should probably give THIS one a wide ♥♥♥♥in' berth.   System Shock 2 is one HARD sonofa♥♥♥♥♥ of a game.  At first I thought it might just be me - as it so often is - but a quick chat to a Steam friend who's much more of a ""natural"" at games than yours truly confirmed that not only had he found it challenging, he had in fact found it SO frigging difficult that he just threw in the towel altogether, before the match had even officially begun.  This game is NOT from the user-friendly era which we're so used to nowadays, in which kind-hearted games essentially hold your hand for the entirety of the journey, like an oh-so-generous ""self-help"" coach who won't let you give up, no matter how hard times might get.  This game is more akin to a brutish boot-camp commandant, who just can't wait to push your worthless face down into the mud one more time, just in case you weren't suitably humiliated by the first ninety-nine times.  In short, this game DOES NOT PLAY NICE.  But for the most part, it does at least play FAIR...unlike, say, the recent Slender: The Arrival, a game whose difficulty can be mostly attributed to rather dubious design and execution.  Whereas System Shock 2, for all its frustration-inducing mean-spiritedness, is in fact an EXCEPTIONALLY well-designed and executed piece of work.  But a game for the weak-hearted or impatient it most certainly is not.   Weapons jam and need to be repaired, frequently.  There's♥♥♥♥♥♥all healing, certainly in the earlier stages.  And the maps, one of my few genuine ""complaints"" about the game, almost require a degree in Interstellar Architecture to follow.  To make matters trickier, there aren't any arrows helpfully pointing you in the ""right"" direction at all times, and it's basically up to you (or the always-generous Google) to work out just what the hell all those items you keep picking up actually do (and which ones you should bother to keep, when your limited Inventory space inevitably fills up almost every time you search a new area...hell, it took me a while to realise that all the pot plants I'd collected were basically extraneous)!  And what about all those different skills you can choose to spend your all-too-precious ""cybermodules"" on...""What the hell do I need a ""Research"" skill for, you crazy, crazy game"", I hear you cry?!  Well, the simplest answer to that question is, ""That all depends on HOW you want to play the game.""  Put another way:  Don't expect to explore all the possibilities System Shock 2 has to offer on the first play-through.  I personally didn't even TOUCH any of the ""Psi"" attributes, and only barely scratched the surface of all that the ""Tech"" stream of abilities has to offer.  (For all the dumb♥♥♥♥♥people out there, like me, maybe just stick to being a half-decent fighter to begin with...doesn't take a genius to work out what a gun is for, while the worthiness of the ""Hack"" skill, for example, may be a tad more obscure at the outset.)   So okay, I get it, it's hard and it's complicated, but is it actually any GOOD?  Well, one need only look at its LEGACY to see how important and influential this game has been.  Unfortunately for System Shock 2, it appears to have been released at much the same time as a certain tiny little piece of gaming called Half Life, and it would appear that that game and its subsequent franchise stole much of SS2's thunder.  But have you also heard of a series called the Bioshock games?  Well, this is the ""spiritual predecessor"", designed by much the same people.  You can also spot the influence this game has had on, say, the Dead Space and F.E.A.R. franchises from several small galaxies away.  The more ""RPG""-ish aspects of Borderlands, et al, would also appear to owe something of a debt herein, what with the space-age vending machines you can use to purchase items and ammo and healing and what-not from.    A true trail-blazer of a game indeed.  But how do the graphics and sound stack up against modern games, then?  Well...okay, the graphics have dated a little.  But they're more than made up for by some of the most imaginative and downright disturbing sound design in VIDEO GAME HISTORY.  It's nothing less than a work of art, ya'll.  And the story, while suffering from the limitations which are unavoidable when you're talking about a game where you basically traverse large distances while killing lots and lots of ""baddies"", is about as good as you can reasonably ask such things to be.   Look, it's not a completely ""perfect"" game.  As well as the aforementioned maps, there's other frustrations to be overcome and/or tolerated, such as the incredibly irritating tendency for a completely random ""wandering"" enemy to waltz into the room in which you thought you might finally have sufficient breathing space to listen to that ""PDA"" you've been carrying for the past several minutes.  You're gonna have to learn to do things like bring up the Inventory screen and heal yourself WHILST RUNNING down a corridor avoiding enemy fire.  And most of all, you're gonna learn to Save just about every time you pick up a new item or defeat a fresh enemy.  But with a little patience and just a teeny tiny bit of skill - Lord knows, I have precious little of the latter - you might actually manage to defeat the completely insane HAL - whoops, slight slip there, make that SHODAN - and emerge triumphant in a world ruled over by rampant technology.  Sounds like a nice change from your ""real life"", day-to-day existence, don't it?    Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys a not-entirely-mindless ""shooter"", and an absolute must-play for anyone with an interest in the history of such games.  Doom, Quake, Half-Life, THIS...that's just about the list, I believe.  I guess I should probably play System Shock 1 some time, too...dang, no rest for the wicked...Verdict: 9.5/10.			"

												Easily one of the defining Sci fi/Horrow RTS games of all time.  A game that not only offers you a run and gun option, but throws in a RPG element allowing many other styles of play.  Build your stats and skills, learn to use different weapons or psi abilities and survive a well told story.  100% recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Definitely worth playing. It's not only long and difficult (a rarity in more morden games) but it has depth with regard to weapon customisation, psi abilities, side stories through collected audio logs. You can play through the game without ever picking up a gun or you can blast things mercilessly, you can sneak behind enemies and hack security panels or run quickly past cameras and turrets. System Shock 2 offers a fantastic array of options in almost every scenario.			"

												Damn good game.  The character graphics are a little dated, but the environment itself has aged spectacularly.  SHODAN is particularly memorable and the game hits a nice mix of horror, difficulty, and survivability.  There's a lot of the Bioshock series' gameplay in this (for those of you who played those before this), which makes sense since the people who made System Shock 2 went on to create the BIoshock games.  Some gore, but most of the horror will come from realizing that you have a particularly powerful enemy around the corner coming after you, and you just ran out of bullets.  Good luck!SS2 isn't easy, and it definitely is the kind of game where a screwup early on can indeed wreck your game later on.  It's perfectly possible to find yourself in a nearly unwinnable situation - don't waste ammunition, be sure to pick up ammo from everywhere you can, and learn to love the melee weapons.All in all, well worth the purchase price, and a classic.

												System Shock 2 is a game that a lot of modern shooters try and fail to emulate, because there was a cult classic love to it that wasn't because of any overused horror trope or any trendy game mechanic. No, the game actually broke from all of the standards by incorporating RPG elements along with its FPS style. You'll hear some people complain about the inventory system. Others will be hung up on the late-nineties graphics (which are close to those of the original Half-Life). I even have one friend who stopped playing simply because he couldn't take one of the enemies seriously.Don't listen to these people who get hung up on the small stuff, and don't be surprised by the difficulty that the game presents you. System Shock 2 was made back when games weren't willing to sacrifice quality just to get you to the ending credits and the obligatory sequel teaser trailer. It's a game that makes you consistently and intelligently plan your way through in order to survive, let alone make progress, aboard the Von Braun. There are multiple ways to play the game, with different types of weapons, and many skills and strengths to invest in. This means extreme replay value, and ensures that you won't get bored quickly.My advice to you is to pick up this game for yourself and make your own opinion. If you come into it with a modern bias, you might not give yourself a chance to enjoy it. Just install it, play it, and see where it takes you.And my biggest tip? For the first time through, put yourself on Away, log off of your communication devices and programs (Skype, AIM, et al.), and play System Shock 2 alone. The experience alone will leave you wanting more.			"

 Some heavy Spoilers System Shock 2 is a First-Person RPG Survival Horror where you play as Soldier G65434-2, commonly known as ""Goggles"", the almost silent main protagonist who is without much development so it's easier for the player to project themselves as the character who signed up to work at the UNN Rickenbacker, a military space vessel that accompanies a FTL(faster than light) starship known as the Von Braun.The player gets to choose which military branch they'd like to select which ultimately comes down to which ""class"" you'd like to pick.The O.S.A, which helps you focus on psionic abilities which resembles ""magic"" where you'd have a wide variety of abilities ranging from firing energy to damage enemies, pulling items that would be otherwise unobtainable, to even healing yourself when you're low on health.The Marines, that focuses on combat granting you early access to some weapons with a little of utility stats so you don't risk being a brainless brute.And finally the Navy, a class that has more focus on hacking, repairing and access to minor weaponry so you're not completely defenseless. There are tons of terminals to hack and your weapons degrade incredibly fast so the Navy has a lot of useful utilities.With that said the classes do not limit you to types of weapons or abilities including hacking and repairing as you can increase your stats, so choosing a starter class will have very little impact on your overall gameplay. They matter a bit more but much akin to how Dark Souls handles its classes.From the games events eventually you'll find yourself being awoken in a cryo-tube on the Von Braun by some disturbances and contacted by a woman called Dr. Janice Polito who will guide you through the starship's decks, now infected by beings known as The Many, who will also telepathically persuade you to become a part of their mass and along the way you will begin to question Dr. Janice Polito's intentions as she talks down to you as if she's a goddess and you're just a mere  insect .The starship has all dangerous monstrosities ranging from The Many's undead-like abominations that hunt you and not only that it seems like the whole starship wants you dead as even the electronics turn against you. The scarce amount of supplies and the unrelenting difficulty makes you dread what's around the corner as you'll be balled up in a room questioning yourself if you want to use the round of bullets you recently picked up whilst hearing the moans of the grotesque creature in the other room telling you that he's ""Sorry."".The graphics are very dated seeing as the game was released in 1999 but the excellent audio compensates and helps keeps you immersed at all times ranging from the enemies speaking to you or themselves and the audio of your crew member's logs that help you understand their twisted experiences on the ship and sometimes include their inevitable demise.The game has a co-op option so you can experience the horrors with up to 3 other friends but be prepared to save often before you load new zones as someone may not be able to make it through. Luckily the game is old and even on dated systems you're able to load it back up in less than half a minute. Unless you're keeping a light mood or goofing around, the experience of survival horror will remain there as you need to now manage the divided scarce supplies but with the advantage of having more hands with more skills to help you battle through the hordes.Lengthwise the game is very long with little backtracking, without exploring everything my first time completing it took me 14 hours on Normal difficulty and for what it costs if you like Horrors and First-Person RPGs then it's a must buy.Personally this is the best survival horror game made to this date and one of the better games made and is absolutely recommended.""I hope you enjoyed your little rebellion, irritant. But remember, what SHODAN gives she is more than able to take away."" "

												I'll start with the things this game got wrong. Most games like this with skill trees/points in particular are bad about forcing you to min-max and this one is no exception. If anything it's worse than most other games from the same era cause you can literally make the game un-winnable if you don't know what stats you need and don't. The psionic abilities and weapons are also horribly inbalanced against themselves, have to knock off points for that since there's a fair amount of combat in this game.Those complaints aside this one is incredibly atmospheric, far more than any Bioshock game was ever able to achieve. The limitations of the engine create a crushing sense of isolation and the only contact you have being with entities that cannot be trusted further add to the lingering sense of dread.Flaws and all, this is still a game worth experiencing. Definitely worth checking out.			"

Just dont expect to be able to switch so easily on impossible difficulty. Infact, don't expect to be able to survive impossible difficulty. Normal enough is pretty hard even if you do know what you're doing.			"

												System Shock 2 is the spiritual predecessor to Bioshock, Deus Ex, and many other FPS-RPG games. It's one of those ageless classics that games today are still borrowing and learning from. It has been trapped in the Windows 98 era for far too long, and finally re-released in an official capacity only within this year. It is absolutely worth playing if you're into FPS-RPGs, sci-fi, cyberpunk, or stories about rampant AIs.			"

												I did not play System Shock 2 until 2014, and have never played its namesake.System Shock 2 is not a good FPS. It was never designed to be a great FPS. It is an old game that shows many signs of age. The textures are dated. The models are dated.It is an old game.What then, makes me recommend System Shock 2? What is its relevance along technically advanced games of more modern times? It is the marriage of forgettable FPS and engaging RPG mechanics that surprise me. It is the interesting characters and fleshed out backstory that make me want to see it through. It is the complex level designs that show me attention to detail. All of these elements are reason why I review the title positively. SS2 was made before its time and yet its creation still influences games today. It is an important part of gaming as a whole and deserves to be looked at. If you can see past the age and the odd hitch, pick System Shock 2 up, tweak the controls, slap on a texture mod, and experience SHODAN.Please Consider: There are no mission arrows. The map can be unhelpful. Codes from audio logs must be typed manually.			"

												The awards and ratings don't lie, this is one of those games that you are required to have played to be considered a true gamer. System Shock 2 is a HUGE cult classic, and if I was the kind of person who easily picked favorites, this would have a good chance of being it. If you don't want to read my entire comment here, the summary is at the bottom.The most important thing about this game can be summed up in one word, and that is: atmosphere. This game has a dark Drum & Bass soundtrack, and like all old game soundtracks, it's perfectly suited for the game. It adds to the game's horror atmosphere, which has it's strength in anticipation rather than jump scares. Those of you who have played Dead Space, it draws quite a bit from System Shock 2. A horror game on a derelict ship invaded by strange creatures, with logs of the dead giving you an idea of what happened. System Shock 2 invented that and more.As Yahtzee said, this is an Action RPG, not an action game with RPG elements. The character customization has a huge effect on your character, and you have to build him carefully. Screw it up, and you'll find yourself in a pretty bad situation, sometimes unable to progress if you really botched it. The higher the difficulty, the more unforgiving that system is, though later game it isn't as bad(in my experience).So in short, System Shock 2 is a highly atmospheric, creepy, pioneering, often unforgiving RPG, that is probably one of the best games I've ever played. It's WELL worth over twice it's price, there's no excuse for you to not play it. If you want to be seen as a true gamer and not a stereotypical COD fanboy, or if you just want to experience one of the best games out there, then you may want to add this game to your collection of things you've played. No matter how advanced graphics get today, just like Doom, Quake, Unreal and Deus Ex, System Shock 2 is one of those games that left its mark on gaming, and will never go away.			"

Product received for free
												Got it as a late christmas present from a friendbasically this is the more mechanized less optomized, more complex, less graphics version of bioshock, dead space, and aliens. With similarities to other games from the 1990's such as doom, tomb raider, and the legend of zelda franchise. This game has all the pointed or well rounded polygon shapes, very chunky hitboxes, and hack and slash game you'd expect, with the retro arcade/ps1 styled look, with the addition of using powerups similar to that of bioshock. It has all the sfx sounds and AI mechanics you expect from a retro styled game, especially the walking on water soundsgameplay's pretty solidyou start off by choosing one of the three branches of the military of which your character will be composed of during the entire game OSA=PSI powerups, navy=strickly weapons, and marines=mainly maitnence as well as game mechanics.you can buy stuff from machines, hack stuff, destroy things and enemies, and powerup your character in more ways than 1.surprisingly good game that can still hold up even in today's modern gaming franchise. it also has steam trading cardsone main downside above all that it has is multiplayer/co-op is hard to do, since you either need to know how to LAN or connect through IP addressess, or use programs designed for these types of games such as hamachi.Also there is / exists modding, but its the same as multiplayer/co-op which you need to know what you're doing or else you may mess up your game/computerbut don't let that deter you from buying it/playing it. It really is a great game, only thing that can make it better is a complete rehaul or remake with the newer gaming engines			"

												I did not expect a game from 1999 to be very scary. I mean, the engine couldn't be too powerful, how scary could they make it?Very.Many games come with the recommendation ""take a break between every hour of play"", but this is the only game where I've actually done that. Although this game does have the occasional jump scare (turning a corner in to a previously empty hall and there's a monster RIGHT THERE), most of the terror is of the slow, suspenseful kind, where you're sitting on the edge of your seat, are quietly mumbling ""moommmyyy"" and wish that blasted light in your ceiling fan didn't flicker ominously.This game has aged wonderfully, and is well worth the price - especially if you can pick it up on a sale!However, there are some caveats. There are five kinds of people that should not get this game:1: Graphics snobs. This is an old game. Don't go in to it expecting Crysis.2: People with weak hearts.3: People that like being able to sleep at night.4: Small children (This should be self explanatory, but y' never know.)5: People absolutely incapable of forward planning. No respecs in this game (Although it does allow for save-scumming if you feel like it.)If you don't fall under those categories, and you like the idea of scrambling for survival in a spaceship infested with horrors-that-cannot-be-more-specifically-described-because-it-would-ruin-the-plot, then get this game.Or put it on your wishlist and wait for a Sale. You already have a huge backlog of games already (we all do!), and this game gets massively discounted during Steam Sales. "

												Here's a brief FAQ on System Shock 2 for 2014 gamers- It's 2014, should I still play this game from 1999?- Yes. HOLY MONKEY BALLS, YES!- But the graphics look crappy!- Never judge a game by its graphics, as the old saying goes. Once you're immersed in the story and fantastic atmosphere of SS2, you'll forget about pixelated textures and low-poly models. Moreover, the music and awesome voicework will give you goosebumps on more than one occasion.- But the game is so hard!- I know, right? Even on Normal difficulty it's no walk in the park. Welcome to the cruel world of scarce resources, respawnable monsters, and mutually exclusive game choices. You will have to get familiar with the game's rich mechanics. You will have to pay attention to briefings and logs. There won't be objective pointers to guide you. All of this makes finishing the game much more rewarding.			"

Also, it has co-op, so you fools should check it out if you're into these kinds of FPS games with RPG elements.			"

												SS2 is a superb game, even if you slept on it and are new to the series in 2016, like me. The intriciate storytelling, immersive level design, and long length bring back memories from the golden age of PC gaming: late 90s. If you are looking for something on the scale of Half Life, but with a more scifi feel, this is the game for you. Off the bat I have to say yes, you have to play this game with graphical and gameplay mods. I would recommend installing them right away, because the vanilla game is almost 20 years old. However, the mods are very easy to install using BMM, its about as intuitive as the nexus mod manager. There is a good SS2 community online with a recommended mod setup. I followed their guidelines and the game looked great honestly. The best parts about the game:- Wonderful story with great voice acting and music. Once you start you have to finish.- With graphical overhaul mods the game looks pretty good and (energy) weapons are very stylish- In this day and age of AAA flops and DLC on disc, this game delivers great value. Grab it on sale and you're set. Some cons:- Honestly, I found the game difficult at first coming in with no background. Sometimes I had to use console. However, I was really engrossed by the story and it didn't bother me after a while- The combat is dated if you're coming from recent PC games. It's still fun but not mindblowing in any way. However it does hold up well, no doubt about it- Some of the menus have small printOverall a great game for the price. I think every gamer who appreciates a timeless story and wants to see the critical predecessors to modern RPG games should check this one out.			"

												This game has some of the most fitting BGM to date, a truly oppressive atmosphere, amazing story, great gamplay and furthermore, it's an actual FPS-RPG, one of the greats to come out of the Deus Ex era. If you're a fan of Bioshock or Ken Levines work in general, then you owe it to yourself to see the progression of his themes and ideas, I found that replaying this after Bioshock highlighted a lot more of the similarities between them and made my playthrough a lot more interesting to say the least.If you are considering it, there are plentiful mods to improve on this game, here's a handy page for you. Make the textures look fantastic, turn your lights off, put headphones in and proceed to♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants. Glory to the Many.

 System Shock 2 REVIEWAn old cult classic from '99 which is still popular and being tweaked with mods as I write this review. Whats to love about this game? The audiologs and level design are used in the narrative pretty well. The character Shodan is a very interesting enigma. The graphic style, especially with mods really pops sometimes. But the only amazing thing I guess is that uncomfortable atmosphere sytsem shock has. Shodans voice, distressed journal entries, moaning hybrids add a constant feeling of desolation. But that kind of where the buck stops for this game. Well the combat is alright I mean its challenging in a old trial and error way. But the story ending just left a lot to be wished for.			"

												This is the critically acclaimed spiritual predecessor to the Bioshock series.This game is so old when I found it on Steam I just had to own it - and it still holds up today.Very, very few games are actually hardcore nowadays. It's refreshing to take a nostalgia trip.System Shock 2 is a role-playing game presented in first-person perspective. It is set in a distant cyberpunk future where humans receive cybernetic implants.The ship you live on has been taken over...by the ship's main computer.She's an a s s .Scavenge hard for resources and make deadly decisions every minute you play.You better be quick, pure horror lurks on every corridor...A fantastic experience from start to finish, an RPG in every sense of the word.Never play the same game twice.12/10  - A 90's Masterpiece.

												Singleplayer is brilliant, runs smoothly and gives a level of atmosphere that had me hiding behind locked doors for the first hour of my gameplay. Multiplayer is a tad tempermental, occasionly the game gets stuck on the loading screen and when starting a new game there is a bug which doesn't let you choose a career, however multiplayer is really good. The game gives you half your starting health on multiplayer making it a more difficult experience at the cost of the horror atmosphere, especially when another player gets brained by a lead pipe hybrid and falls head first into it.

												What is it with Sci Fi Horror set in space and Hydroponics deck being the most terrifying thing in the entire game? I don't know how, but this game, despite the fact that it hasn't aged well at all in the graphics department, creates such an amazing atmosphere and really sets the tone in an exemplary way. You play a guy with absolutely no fashion sense (jumpsuit and cybernetically implanted goggles make him look like Adam Jensen going through his goth phase) on his quest to find out just what went wrong on the Von Braun, which has seemingly been taken over by worm people and overly friendly robots who blow up in your face, spoiler alert. Despite the sometimes dodgy voice acting and the pretty awful movement controls (in my opinion, but then again almost all games from this period controlled like♥♥♥♥♥♥, this game is a great RPG, and one of the few in recent memory that has a fairly rich and detailed mythos embedded into the game itself. We don't get enough good Sci-Fi/Cyberpunk Action RPG's, in my opinion, and despite the fact that this is a precursor to this genre, it is still one of the best in terms of atmosphere, story and world building. I heartily reccomend this game to any fans of the genre. Speaking as a person who doesn't have nostalgia goggles on (many people seem to in the review section, and with good reason), I can safely say that this game still holds up in quite a few respects all these years on. Notstalgia usually makes people think of something that may have been ok-ish as the best thing since sliced bread, but what happens when it is something truly great for its time?			"

												I'll start with the things this game got wrong. Most games like this with skill trees/points in particular are bad about forcing you to min-max and this one is no exception. If anything it's worse than most other games from the same era cause you can literally make the game un-winnable if you don't know what stats you need and don't. The psionic abilities and weapons are also horribly inbalanced against themselves, have to knock off points for that since there's a fair amount of combat in this game.Those complaints aside this one is incredibly atmospheric, far more than any Bioshock game was ever able to achieve. The limitations of the engine create a crushing sense of isolation and the only contact you have being with entities that cannot be trusted further add to the lingering sense of dread.Flaws and all, this is still a game worth experiencing. Definitely worth checking out.			"

												Simply put a awesome game. You are a soldier assigned to a great expedition ship. You awaken to find out that everything has gone pretty bad. Basically you will find a lot of things that all seem to try and kill you. The game is challenging and unforgiving. Your weapons fail, your ammuntion will run low and every now and then you there is an enemy lurking right next to you scaring the crap out of you. This will force you to be focused all the time adding a certain tension to the game.The tension is enriched by a deeper plot line. After all your puny existanse is a small thing compared to the fate of the ship and so on, and there are people that will remind you of it. To make a few quote ""You must move faster. Your mind cannot conceive of the stakes we are dealing with."" This is only a glimbse into to the game and revealig anything else would be a major spoiler =)Strongly recommended. Maybe it is outdated but who cares. It will beat most games anyway.			"

												First of all, any PC gamer worth his salt already knows this is a masterpiece of sci-fi horror FPSRPG, it's a beast of a game and a cult classic. If you didn't know, that should be enough to convince you, but let me re-iterate it's historical importance and worthiness.This is the game that not only inspired Bioshock, but everything else like it since (that includes anything from Fallout 3/NV to TES: Morrowind/Oblivion/Skyrim to Borderlands). Here's the basic formula: they took an FPS, added actual RPG elements, a real story, plus a horror atmosphere mixed with a sci-fi theme, and basically created a new genre. That's pretty significant, so if you've played Bioshock and haven't played this, you really should be ashamed of yourself... Fortunately for you, all hope is not lost as SS2 is now available on Steam and fixed to run on modern rigs so you may yet redeem yourself by playing it. Yay!A word of advice, though SS2 looks and sounds as old as it is, there are excellent texture/model/sound replacement mods available and they work fine with the Steam version. Despite all that, it still feels and plays better than most games of the genre today and remains a very special and highly memorable gaming experience nonetheless.Let me assure you that if I could have but one single wish answered by the Gods of Gaming it would be for a proper, actual sequel. But for some stupid reason, the license rights are of course tied up in limbo thanks to the absolutely rificulous bureaucratic state of the world, and so us poor gamers are left to suffer without it.Game like it was 1999!

												This game needs no introduction. It's regarded as one of the best games for PC ever made, as well as one of the best for its genre... and it is wholly deserving of all its praise. System Shock 2 is a game that defies any real review, to do so would to really spoil the experience. It needs to be played to understand why it is so good, and that is what playing it is: an experience.The game is a rare example of design, gameplay, aesthetic, atmosphere, and presentation all working in near perfect harmony to deliver an engrossing experience that pulls you in and keeps you going until the final hours are passed. The RPG elements are almost completely free form, allowing you to build your character in almost any way you like focusing on what you want as you want it (though in the early game you'll do well to focus on your initial strengths as to not spread yourself too thin), and while initial enemy placement is pre-determined you'll find out that they respawn with alarming frequency in random numbers and placements to constantly keep you on your toes. The game is not perfect, mind, and has some flaws. Most notable are the level designs for the final areas of the game don't seem quite as well designed as the rest of the game and some other small nitpicks, but these are minor gaffes in System Shock 2's excellent imageand are easily forgiven. If you like science fiction, survival horror, cyberpunk, body or eldritch horror, free form RPGs, first person shooters, adventure games, or any combination thereof of them, then System Shock 2 is well deserving of your attention. And hell, even if you don't like any of that stuff, it may be worth looking into just to try new things! You might just find yourself surprised.			"

												I've had this review sitting up here mostly as a joke, but with the advent of us finally getting a true System Shock 1 Remake (that I've backed, hehe) I figured I'd rewrite my review to fully reflect my thoughts on one of my all time favorite games and a game I consider a masterpiece of western game development.The game's story is familiar enough, you're a soldier with amnesia who wakes up aboard a space ship where everything is royally screwed and you're contacted by a particularly angry woman who nags you to complete various tasks in order to undo the chaos that an apparent alien infestation has wrought. It may all seem very blasé at first but once you get about 1/3rd of the way into the game, you'll discover a really shocking (ayyy) plot twist that you won't see coming unless you've played Bioshock before this. But in addition to the game's main plot, you'll also discover audio logs off the beaten path that you can listen to that provide insights, backstory and tension from various deceased crew members that range from a greedy CEO who gradually turns from his precious money to fully embracing the horrors onboard the ship, to a couple who were more or less told to get a room and ended up getting an escape pod outta Dodge. It all really comes together to make the Von Braun feel like it was once a real place and it establishes a sense of humanity the place and makes the scenario all the more depressing and scary.Now while this is all fine and good, a game like this wouldn't be great without some kickass gameplay, and this game certainly delivers on all fronts. This is a really, really unique game that manages to combine Survival Horror, Old 90's esque FPS Gameplay and Deus ex styled RPG mechanichs into one delicious, although admittedly convoluted slurry that is incredibly satisfying to play through. Before you start the real game you're given a choice of a starting classes, the 'rooty tooty point and shooty' Marine, the xxxMLGPR0xxx techie, and the turbonerd Psionic who serves more or less as the game's mage and you get to pick what your starting skills are, starting with basic RPG stuff (movement speed, HP, inventory space, mana, ect) such as being able to hack various electronics on board the ship to provide you with more resources or modifying your guns to be more effective. No matter what you pick here though, you're free to build your character however you want throughout the game, so if you wanted to be a squishy wizard who wants to carry around the game's equivalent of a BFG 9000, you can. To further expand this, there's also perk stations that can sparsely be found on the ship to further specialize your build, giving this game massive ammounts of replayability that I've unfortunately been unable to find in many other games.On the topic of guns (admit it, we all play fps games to shoot the♥♥♥♥♥♥outta stuff), there's 4 weapons trees available, Standard, Energy, Heavy and Exotic. Standard is the one most people will start with and probably roll through many playthrus, as it has a Pistol, a shotgun and an assault rifle to you while also increasing the effectiveness of your starting wrench. Energy consists of weapons like the Energy pistol, the Laser Rapier, and the EMP rifle, which are typically more effective against robotic targets but have essentially unlimited ammo thru recharge stations to compensate. Heavy is an odd class as the Grenade launcher you get is the most powerful raw damage weapon in the game, while the BFG9000 you get at the very tailend of your progression is comparable to standard's Shotgun in terms of usefulness with the middle weapon being a useless Freeze ray. Exotic is almost the opposite of Energy, with it's weapons being more effective versus flesh targets and use the alien worm puddles as ammo but is made different by having the best melee in the game. It's really fun to experiment with all the weapons in the game, especially since the game discourages you from using one or two types of weapons at a time.With all the technical stuff aside, the actual gameplay is really tense. When you move throughout the ship it becomes more and more apparent that you're one of, if not the only survivor, with mangled corpses littered around that really add to the terrifying atmosphere of the game. This is complemented by some legitimately disturbing enemy design, as the main 'grunt' type enemies are ex-crewmembers who have been corrupted by the hivemind known as ""The Many"" and the results are completely visual. Their great sound design adds to the tension as you'll be hearing these guys calling you to reveal yourself before you see them, and it just gets all the more terrible when you start fighting them only for their humanity to break through and beg you to end their suffering. Add in the fact that ammo is so scarce at times that it will force you into beating stuff over the head with the melee of your choice or just leaving these things alive and roaming and you've got the perfect recipe for a butt-clenchingly tense game that makes you think about every action that you perform. Graphically, the game needs to be adressed. For 1999's standards it looks ok but it really does look like hot garbo now, so unless you're a weirdo like me and like these retro graphics, you'll want to seek out the fantastic community mods like SHTUP or Rebirth that make the game look all the nicer, and alot creepier too. Even then, the game can look really dated, but if you're the type to put gameplay over graphics this shouldn't matter.I really want to stress that this game has **SO** much replay value. This is a game that I do at least a yearly 'binge gaming' session, ususally consisting of at least 2 play throughs of the base game and then messing around on one of the game's unforunately few fan maps, but each playthrough can be entirely different based on how you choose your progression. I got into Shock 2 in around late 2009-ish and I'm still enjoying the game like I did when I was 13. This game is just THAT good.I'm really happy that System Shock is being remade, because System shock is a series that deserves your attention, though Specifically System Shock 2. This is a game that despite some of it's more oldschool mechanics feels incredibly fresh and polished even today. If you liked Bioshock at all and haven't played this yet, I suggest you do yourself a favor and pick this game up. I'm of the opinion that this game is a masterpiece that belongs in the ranks of LoZ OoT and MGS4 as being one of the greatest games of all time.			"

												System Shock 2 is a masterpiece.Criminy-- although the technology behind it is heavily dated, it is still able to frighten me. A spaceship crawling with clones of a motherly figure calling out to her egg-children and defending them with a bracelet that shoots lasers is apparently enough to make me tense. The gameplay was certainly ambitious in 1999; FPS+RPG elements; well, its successor BioShock saw very little need to update the formula. I like to think of this as ""BioShock done right,"" which is both correct and cringeworthy.SHODAN is a proper, taunting villain and unreliable narrator. The game has good pacing and a good story. Like a good survivor horror, it is very difficult. Some bugs with scripted events made me redo sections of the game because I could not progress. My god the awful default 1999-era FPS controls.			"

												As a game from 1999, I have to say this is classic. The playstyle is great, the gameplay is smooth, and everything about it is what i want in a first person shooter. It's an RPG style game, with a great storyline and atmosphere. After playing this game all the way through i can tell that a lot of games, like dead space, got their ideas from the story of System Shock 2. The game is about a ship that gets overrun by a virus, turning all of its population into zombie-like creatures, like dead space. The protagonist of the story is led the the entire ship, starting at med bay, going through engineering and hydroponics, all the way up to the command deck, like dead space. I'm not ragging on dead space, i love the game, i just thought it was funny to play through and see how game dev's got the idea. Overall this game was brilliant, and had me hooked for days up until i beat it. The game is replayable, as you can choose which playstyle you like, ranging from guns blazing to cybernetic powers. 9/10			"

												Hardcore and very old school. If you need someone to hold your hand... look elsewhere. This is what games used to be like back in the days before they all got hit by the stupid-stick and the easy-mode-club. Hard, fun and huge. If you scew up you die. If you drop quest-items before you've used them (like the sim cards) you have to run around looking for them. Nothing is for free. Ammo is sparse, enemies are hard and there is plenty of them. You really have to plan ahead, listen to the sounds of what's running around, watch out for the towers and the cameras, aim carefully. I love it :)  You will die alot...alot. You will rage-quit... But you will come back again and again because you want to beat the game. It will take you an hour or so to get used to the interface... but don't give up. This game is a jewel.I recommend that you Install a graphic-mod to fix the rather dull original textures and ""monster"" models.			"

												even though i grew up with the old generations of games, nowadays i rarely finish them, when i decide to catch up on titles i didnt play back in the day. This game fascinated me from the first moment with its atmosphere and chalenging gameplay. As someone who rarely plays shooter i got sucked in by the setting and mostly the fact that this game isnt the usual splatter horror  or some fancy action shooter, but a rare gem, that shows that it is possible to build a story driven shooter that has more to offer than simple run and gun spiced with some rpg elements. The game gives ppl the possibility to play smart, as it requires some amount of skillpoint, inventory, health and ammunition management and requires the player to tend to his weapons, as they can break if not maintained and can be upgraded (nothing fancy, just sth like lvlups). All of those actions require some skills that can be accuired for your character. Those features would be considered ""fun-stoppers"" nowadays, but honestly this is what makes games playable for me. This game was made by the ppl who later developed the ""Bio Shock"" games (the name is similar), this  game is the spiritual predecessor of those games and i liked it more than Bioshock. This game is aswell considered a classic as it influenced many games modern A+ titles, e.g. Portal (it is said that ""Glados"" from portal is inspired by ""Shodan"" from system shock) and Dead Space (inspired by the gameplay of System shock 2).

												I've always thought horror was difficult, if not impossible, to convey in video games, especially when given the tools to fight back.I was wrong.You are alone. Resources are scarce. Everything is out to kill you. And it will.The atmosphere of this game is oppressing, each second as stressful as the previous one, the ship is a convoluted maze filled with terror.Although it has a few flaws, the story is wonderful, filled with tension and ambiguosity, as you are stuck between SHODAN and The Many, left wondering which of them is the lesser evil.SHODAN herself definitely earns a place in the pantheon of video game antagonists, not only using deception but also constantly belittling any effort on your part.As for the gameplay, it's surprisingly advanced for its time, and might seem overwhelmingly complex on your fist run. If you are expecting a shooter, you will probably find it clunky and frustrating, as this game is most definitely a RPG and has all the mechanics of one.Also worthy of note, the world is fully backtrackable and the level design is incredible, state-of-the-art late 90s fare, albeit falling a bit short towards the end.A landmark in the scene and a source of inspiration for many others to come, especially the Deus Ex and BioShock franchises, both created by former Looking Glass employees.I would highly recommend this game to anyone interested in PC gaming history, make sure to play it on the impossible difficulty setting, which will give you a real challenge and enhance the thick, lingering atmosphere and sense of dread.

Product received for free
												Got it as a late christmas present from a friendbasically this is the more mechanized less optomized, more complex, less graphics version of bioshock, dead space, and aliens. With similarities to other games from the 1990's such as doom, tomb raider, and the legend of zelda franchise. This game has all the pointed or well rounded polygon shapes, very chunky hitboxes, and hack and slash game you'd expect, with the retro arcade/ps1 styled look, with the addition of using powerups similar to that of bioshock. It has all the sfx sounds and AI mechanics you expect from a retro styled game, especially the walking on water soundsgameplay's pretty solidyou start off by choosing one of the three branches of the military of which your character will be composed of during the entire game OSA=PSI powerups, navy=strickly weapons, and marines=mainly maitnence as well as game mechanics.you can buy stuff from machines, hack stuff, destroy things and enemies, and powerup your character in more ways than 1.surprisingly good game that can still hold up even in today's modern gaming franchise. it also has steam trading cardsone main downside above all that it has is multiplayer/co-op is hard to do, since you either need to know how to LAN or connect through IP addressess, or use programs designed for these types of games such as hamachi.Also there is / exists modding, but its the same as multiplayer/co-op which you need to know what you're doing or else you may mess up your game/computerbut don't let that deter you from buying it/playing it. It really is a great game, only thing that can make it better is a complete rehaul or remake with the newer gaming engines			"

 System Shock 2 REVIEWAn old cult classic from '99 which is still popular and being tweaked with mods as I write this review. Whats to love about this game? The audiologs and level design are used in the narrative pretty well. The character Shodan is a very interesting enigma. The graphic style, especially with mods really pops sometimes. But the only amazing thing I guess is that uncomfortable atmosphere sytsem shock has. Shodans voice, distressed journal entries, moaning hybrids add a constant feeling of desolation. But that kind of where the buck stops for this game. Well the combat is alright I mean its challenging in a old trial and error way. But the story ending just left a lot to be wished for.			"

												Absolutely fantastic game. This is a game that i have been meaning to play for a while, and i am so glad that i finally got around to doing it. I feel that a game that is very well known, and that has been around for around 17 years, there really isnt that much more left to say. This game is a classic, and one of the best games that i have played in a long time. It does have its flaws where it is VERY slow at the beginnig and stray you away from playing this game (it happened to me, i got 2 hours of steam time in and dropped it for over a year), but stick with it!Everything good that people have to say about it i competely agree with. I would say that there are only 3 bad things the game has:1. The slow beginning. I would have finished this game a year ago if the opening wasnt so slow, but it sets up the game nicely now that i went back and played it over again.2. You need patience. If you lack it this game will not be as fun for you. For example, i was stuck on a puzzle for about 2 hours (Hidden in the Masters puzzle D5), but that was mostly because i didnt realize what I was supposed to do and should have been solving the puzzle as i progressed. 3. The controls. Oh god the controls suck, rebind those things the second you start or you will suffer.I loved this game and will absolutely play it again in the near future. Also, even though it is not recommened for first time players, the Psi route is extremely fun and challenging. I did it on my first run and i had so much fun with it. 10/10!			"

												I bought this game in 1999 back when I was 11 years old, though I finally got the stones to fully make my way through the game when I was 17. I quit the game from fright several times, but kept coming back because I was determined to beat the terrors of the Von Braun. Since then I have returned to the game many times just so I could soak in the atmosphere of the game and face the evils from Tau Ceti V once again.System Shock 2 is a cyberpunk first person shooter with a good chunk of RPG elements. Elements such as inventory management, stats and different builds, and choices that affect your progress forward. There are also a survival aspect, it becoming more pronounced on the higher difficulties as combat gets deadlier.Several games have since then used similar themes and elements to great effect, so what makes this old timer so great? In my opinion it is the dread that the game instills in you, I haven't quite found a game that did it in a similar or quite as effective fashion. The player starts the game on the Von Braun some time after it has gone to hell and the Many has control. You end up feeling utterly alone on the Von Braun, light-years away from any semblance of help, while being sought out by the grotesque minions of The Many. You run around chasing your only lifeline and voice of reason in this whole mess, while wading through the sludge that used to be the crew of this ship only to sink deeper with every step. I remember feeling utterly crushed several times with the relevation that my struggles had only brought me more terrors to face.It is a superb game, but it is not without flaws. The latter part of the game gets less and less refined, most visible in the level design. As the game progresses the areas seem to get less and less polished, which is a shame as the details helpes alot with the atmosphere that makes this game great.  The Von Braun is largely well made for its time, but the Rickenbacker is bland, uninspiring and seems like it was rushed. The last stages of the game has some quite exotic themes and the technology of the time was perhaps not well suited for something as ambitious as these areas.Despite that, I recommend this game to everyone looking for a classic Survial Horror game.

												I've always loved this game, but I think that I appreciate System Shock 2 even more now than when I first played it. The game's tense and even frightening at times. The atmosphere is wonderfully realised and the audio still stands up as an example for modern developers to be inspired by. I think this is why I can appreciate the game so much more in 2013 than I did back when it originally came out, as its juxtaposition against modern games like the Bioshocks emphasize System Shock 2's accomplishments as even more groundbreaking than they once were. The only criticisms I have with playing it in 2013 are temporary criticisms. You'll first want to download a model replacer for npcs. The original low poly models now look a bit silly and clash with the experience the game intends to provide, so get a model replacer mod set up prior to playing. You'll also want to rebind the keys before playing, but it seems like there's an included preset that makes the game control like a modern fps, so switch to that. Make sure to play it with the lights off and the volume up.			"

												This game needs no introduction. It's regarded as one of the best games for PC ever made, as well as one of the best for its genre... and it is wholly deserving of all its praise. System Shock 2 is a game that defies any real review, to do so would to really spoil the experience. It needs to be played to understand why it is so good, and that is what playing it is: an experience.The game is a rare example of design, gameplay, aesthetic, atmosphere, and presentation all working in near perfect harmony to deliver an engrossing experience that pulls you in and keeps you going until the final hours are passed. The RPG elements are almost completely free form, allowing you to build your character in almost any way you like focusing on what you want as you want it (though in the early game you'll do well to focus on your initial strengths as to not spread yourself too thin), and while initial enemy placement is pre-determined you'll find out that they respawn with alarming frequency in random numbers and placements to constantly keep you on your toes. The game is not perfect, mind, and has some flaws. Most notable are the level designs for the final areas of the game don't seem quite as well designed as the rest of the game and some other small nitpicks, but these are minor gaffes in System Shock 2's excellent imageand are easily forgiven. If you like science fiction, survival horror, cyberpunk, body or eldritch horror, free form RPGs, first person shooters, adventure games, or any combination thereof of them, then System Shock 2 is well deserving of your attention. And hell, even if you don't like any of that stuff, it may be worth looking into just to try new things! You might just find yourself surprised.			"

												This game has some of the most fitting BGM to date, a truly oppressive atmosphere, amazing story, great gamplay and furthermore, it's an actual FPS-RPG, one of the greats to come out of the Deus Ex era. If you're a fan of Bioshock or Ken Levines work in general, then you owe it to yourself to see the progression of his themes and ideas, I found that replaying this after Bioshock highlighted a lot more of the similarities between them and made my playthrough a lot more interesting to say the least.If you are considering it, there are plentiful mods to improve on this game, here's a handy page for you.

												I played this for the first time in 2015, and it is still a fantastic game, even without nostalgia. The gameplay and AI are dated, and I would recommend looking for some graphics mods, but even after 16 years this is one of the better games that I've played. Firstly, the atmosphere in this game is incredible. I could only play in 30-minute spurts for the first few levels, because the game really creeped me out. The audio and sound effects in this game are great and help set the mood. If you've played bioshock(if you haven't you really should), this game is very similar, although it's also a lot scarier than bioshock. After some time playing, you start to get a little used to the constant feeling of fear, but as you progress you encounter more things that are even more unsettling. The audio logs added pieces of the story together as you collect them, and make you wonder what the hell happened on this ship. The atmosphere and story sucks you in, it's so good.Once you get used to the horror aspects of the game, you start to actually figure out how the game works. This game has a ridiculous amount of customization for you to choose from, but like the rest of the game you are limited in your resources and skill points(called cyber modules). I started out putting points into PSI and ended up using a lightsaber halfway through, using PSI to buff/amplify my melee skills. There are so many ways you can play, and I can easily see this game having a lot of replay value because of it. And without spoiling anything, the story is great. TL:DR - Fantastic game, 9/10 mostly because it is a little datedPROS-Amazing atmosphere-Great use of audio-Interesting story-Expansive and fun skill system, customizable-Great setting-SHODANCONS-Dated controls(fixable), UI takes a little bit to get used to-Mods make graphics pretty good, but some things like enemy models are still ugly(not a big deal though)- last minute or so is meh, was expecting an amazing ending after the rest of the game.Great game, highly recommend. This is almost a must play if you liked bioshock, because this game did almost everything bioshock did except earlier (though both games are great).			"

												This is a fine piece of history here. I never got to enjoy this game on its orignal release but I'm sure glad Steam re-released it because I had a great time playing. There is a patch that needs to be installed prior to running the software and once installed I had no issues running the program. If you enjoy FPS's,  RPG's, Sci-fi, and can appreciate the value of older games than this is a must buy for you.			"

												This game is one of the kings of survival horror and should be played if you are a fan of the genre. For a game from 1999 the graphics look pretty good although I feel like this game had a texture remake for the steam version of the game. The gameplay is fun and scary. The only complaints I have about the game would be the hacking/modifying/repairing, which are rng based events. Its worth a try and has some replay value due to the abilities you can unlock and fan missions which are levels you can download online and play. Also this game has a multiplayer mode. I'm not sure how well it works since none of my friends want to play it, but from what i saw on youtube it looks pretty good.Overall buy it if you are a fan of the genre or even just remotely curious. It is worth your time.Also dat ending doe :D			"

												Damn good game.  The character graphics are a little dated, but the environment itself has aged spectacularly.  SHODAN is particularly memorable and the game hits a nice mix of horror, difficulty, and survivability.  There's a lot of the Bioshock series' gameplay in this (for those of you who played those before this), which makes sense since the people who made System Shock 2 went on to create the BIoshock games.  Some gore, but most of the horror will come from realizing that you have a particularly powerful enemy around the corner coming after you, and you just ran out of bullets.  Good luck!SS2 isn't easy, and it definitely is the kind of game where a screwup early on can indeed wreck your game later on.  It's perfectly possible to find yourself in a nearly unwinnable situation - don't waste ammunition, be sure to pick up ammo from everywhere you can, and learn to love the melee weapons.All in all, well worth the purchase price, and a classic.

												System Shock 2 is the grandfather of modern FPS shooters. Despite it being quite underrated, System Shock 2 was the influence behind games like Bioshock and Half-Life. It is a dark and gritty game that combines a dark and scary atmosphere with surprisingly enjoyable exploration, crafting and research. As far as the story goes, you start out as a recruit and get to select your main path of game style. You have the Marines which will eventually allow you to get your hands on weapons ranging from pistols to grenade launchers and EMP rifles. You have the Navy, the ""tech"" class which makes it easier to hack machines and security systems. The last path is the OSA, which specialises in 'psi-powers' which allow you to use your mind to attack enemies, move items and objects from a distance and disable cameras. Afterwards, you are given a selection of three 'subpaths' which give you points in specific skills. Afterwards, you can level up your skills using cybermodules which are generally given to you as a reward for completing missions but you may find them in the world. Players are not restricted to the class they chose e.g those who picked the Marine path can invest their cybermodules in PSI powers. While a ""jack of all trades"" approach is tempting, it is best to stick to your chosen path because you may find it become incredibly expensive to maintain skill trees at the same time. When you're finished, the game begins. You find yourself onboard the Von Braun, a ship which has succumbed to a strange infection. All hell has broken loose and you must save yourself from the hybrids and other alien lifeforms, and from the psychotic Artificial Intelligence known as XERXES.The player can paint a picture of what happened to the Von Braun through collectibles, which are often recordings made by other crew members. Much like in Bioshock, they also may contain important passcodes and give away locations of important items. Through this method, following the story is optional and all those simply wanting to beat the game do not have to concentrate while a NPC goes on and on. (In this game, the only NPCs who talk to you are SHODAN and whatshernameagain.)System Shock 2 has some of the best level design I've ever seen, and some of the worst. Backtracking is one of the biggest issues this game has. While the levels are big and non-linear allowing for player freedom, they encourage backtracking. As you continue through the game, you are able to explore the Von Braun fully. An elevator located on every floor of the Von Braun allows you to return to an already explored floor (for the purposes of research, farming, healing etc.) What makes the level design superb is that it gives the player not only a sense of discovery and exploration, it also gives the player a sense of confusion and being lost. Some levels contain branches where you have to explore them, find an item and return to the main ""hub"" part to accomplish a mission to progress further. This does often lead to a sense of misdirection. This is something System Shock 2 does good. That being said, some levels basically have major chokeholds which don't allow the player to use different strategies if an enemy is blocking them. Every level contains security cameras monitored by the rogue AI XERXES. If it spots you, it will activate a security alarm which essentially sends a horde of enemies at you. It is always vital to watch your surroundings. Combat wise, the game offers a large arsenal of weaponry. Guns, grenade launchers, sabres and many more. Of course most weapons require a specific level in that particular skill line (e.g EMP Rifle requires an energy skill of 6.) As I mentioned earlier, the player is given the freedom to invest in the weapons skill tree even if they picked the Navy or OSA. Every weapon is degradable and you have to repair it if it becomes broken. While this degradable feature does make it substantially difficult for the player if they don't monitor their weapon's level of quality, it can be a bit annoying at times. The player can also modify their weapons using the modify skill, which basically increases the stats of that particular weapon. Combat aside, another unique feature of System Shock 2 is Research. On your journey, you may come across an item that is 'unresearched.' To research it, you require a table, and the required chemicals. To get these chemicals, you have to go to a chemical storeroom, which are located in almost every map. However, each chemical storeroom is not identical and you may to have to explore until you find the storeroom with the chemical you need. Upon researching an item, it will tell you what it does. For instance, some enemies may drop one of these items. If researched, it gives you a % damage boost against that particular enemy. While researching objects is an optional feature. It is best to invest in researching, as enemies later on do become difficult and the boost would help.Present in System Shock 2 is a hacking system, where you have to click on squares to create a line. Hacking is used to open crates, hack machines and disable security systems as well as terminating security alarms. System Shock 2 also offers a variety of enemies, ranging from psychic monkeys to annelid spiders and giant robots. As the game progresses, you have to face a growing variety of enemies. It does get incredibly difficult later on. Each encounter with enemies rests on the path you have chosen before. Marines can simply charge in, wreck the enemy and let that be the end of that. A Navyman can backtrack and find a way to avoid the enemy, and a OSA can use their PSI powers to stealthy kill the enemy. Enemies are generally randomly placed on the map, (apart from some pre-set robots.)Levels are not saturated in enemies, and there are times when the map can be empty. This gives the player plenty of freedom to explore, and makes each encounter with enemies unique. As the player progresses, enemy difficulty increases substantially. This difficulty can be eventually lowered through research. It does not matter what weapons you have, you will always be underpowered. You have to be incredibly observant of your surroundings, and this is something that System Shock 2 does very well.Present in this game is a co-op mode, which allows you to play with two other people! I strongly recommend that you finish System Shock 2 solo before playing co-op, because playing with a partner is a different experience. Knowing that you have backup deducts from the game's overall atmosphere. Co-op, although it is generally stable and bugfree, does contain some issues. (Not surprising for a game made in 1999.) I have encountered some bugs and glitches such as: unnoticable lag where automatic doors open for the host and not for the other players. The elevator can get stuck and won't change the level essentially trapping you (this can be fixed by all players restarting the game.) Enemies can [rarely] get stuck in their default model (aka 'mingebag' ) position and not do anything apart from making noise. A friend and I also encountered a glitch where NPCs would spawn in places they're not supposed to be. (We encountered some live crew member NPCs on one of the decks.) If playing co-op, i would save right before the SHODAN room (Most glitches tended to start after this scene in my case.) Apart from this, Co-op is fun to play with friends.On one final note, the atmosphere in this game is excellent in making the player feel weak and underpowered. While the game's music is topnotch quality, it doesn't always fit in with the feel of the game. Regardless, the dark, gritty and scary environments keep the player awake and observant. Just remember to keep in mind that this game was made in 1999 as the graphics have not aged well.System Shock 2 is a must-play for Halflife and Bioshock fans. It combines a range of unique aspects and abilities. it is an underrated yet enjoyable experience.			"

												Wow. What to say about this game? Basically, if you like Bioshock, you'll almost certainly like this. It has a lot of similarities in mechanics, with hacking, machines to buy ammo and items, big maps, lot of different kinds of quests you're set on, psychic powers plus weapons, recordings to listen to with door codes and hints and things, etc. But System Shock is FAR more brutal, and I was playing on easy. Be prepared to be always out of ammo, currency, health, inventory space and regen points. Yet, it's really, really, really, REALLY good. It's got depth out to wazoo, and tons of cool features and a bajillion ways to play. There's three major ""career choices""--either being a skill monkey (hacking, repairing, etc), straight-up shooter (lots of powerful weapons), and psi (basically magic, with fire, invisibility, telekinesis, etc.) You make the choice at the very beginning and there's not a lot of explanation before you pick, so do a little research online first to find the best fit for your playstyle. Let's break it down to the basics:Pros:+Great variety of tasks. It's an FPS, but there's lots of ""puzzles"". Things like ""go to this place and turn on this button."" But then there's something that's gone wrong, so now you need to go here and find the problem first, then do this other things, and then you can hit the button. You have to deal with radiation and toxins, can hack things, repair your equipment as it wears down, research items you find, etc.+Tons of upgrades. Four different main upgrade trees: ability stats (strength, agility, etc), psi powers, weapon proficiency (energy, standard, heavy, etc), and skills (hacking, repairing, etc.)+Never a dull moment.+Huge map, with tons of different areas and problems to deal with. It really made you feel like you were on a ship, with a medical/science deck, engineering deck, command, recreation, bridge/operations, etc. You could go back to anywhere anytime. There's only one point where you can never completely retrace your steps.Neutral:~It's an old game, so it's polygon count is super low. Expect characters with point heads, cloned textures on the wall, and all around poor graphics. I didn't mind it, because I'm a fan of old games, but it shows its age graphically, which might bother some people.~ There's a research function that's kind of neat, but also frustrating. You can find objects or organs from enemies to research, and they give you bonuses against them or the ability to use those organs as med kits or psi boosters or weapons. However, it's frustrating because most of the research requires chemicals, which you can't just carry arround because space is at a premium and you never know what chemicals you're going to need later. So you end up having to backtrack a loooooong way just to find the storeroom with the chemicals so you can get that ONE chemical you need. Frustrating, but it's really a neat mechanic in general, so I'm putting it as neutral.Cons:-The map is crap. There are little icons telling you where things are, like regeneration points, item purchasing, etc, but the icons are the same color as the map lines, so they're unreadable half the time because you can't tell whether it's a C or S or whatever letter you're trying to find. The low res doesn't help, either. Also, each deck of the ship you're on has different sections, which 1) don't show up on the map until you've been there (understandable), and 2) won't be available to look at when you're in a different section of the ship, even if you HAVE already been there. So trying to find that one place you were at two hours ago that you need to find again is really hard. All together, I probably did about 2-3 hours of wandering in about 30 hours of gameplay. I'm not even exaggerating. I could spend 45 minutes just trying to find a storeroom I'd been looking for.- There's not a lot of handholding or explanation. There's ""enough"" for most things, but there's no indication of what early play will be like when you're picking your career path. I started off psi because it sounded the most interesting, only to find out it's basically hard mode, since when you run out of psi points (i.e. mana) you have to resort to other weapons or melee, but your physical stats suck. I ended up restarting as the hacker archetype and made sure to up my weapon use and fared much better. Also, I didn't know when I went to a different deck of the ship that I could go back again. It may be that I'm used to modern games that prevent you from returning to earlier maps (sometimes warning you in advance that you're leaving an area in case you wanted to go back for some reason). But you're on a space ship, and you've got full run of the ship. Which meant I was wandering around, desperate for them to give me a vending machine or a heal or something, never knowing I could go back downstairs to the ones I had already been too. I didn't figure that out on my own until about 5 hours in or so.- The game is extremely stingy when it comes to weapons, ammo, inventory space, etc. Your weapons take up space in your inventory that could be used for other items, so it's not like the typical ""carrying around 8 weapons"" situation you have in a lot of FPS games. You have to decide very carefully and commit to using certain weapons or be prepared to switch when you run out of ammo.- The ""currency"" of the game is used for hacking AND modifying weapons AND buying things at vending machines, so if you're hacking all the time, you might never have enough to buy bullets. The drop rate of currency itself is also pretty stingy. Most enemies drop no money (frequent), ~25 (decent but infrequent), or 5 (common). But it might take anywhere from 1-5 bullets to take down a single enemy to get that 5 money, and a set of 6 bullets can cost 85!!!! You'll burn through bullets (and thus money) faster than you'll ever get it from enemies. Hacking helps a lot, because it can get you into locked boxes with a nice stash of 25-75 money, but you'll probably burn 20 on a tough hack and 3 on an easy hack, so it's a gamble.- There's a point of no return before the final boss, but I ended up expending all of my ammo trying to beat the mooks before it so I ended up with no health and very little ammo before the big boss with no way to go back and restock because I had been saving my game in the same save slot. My only saving grace was the implant I had found that regenerates 1 point of health at a rate of 1/30 seconds. I had to let the game idle for about an hour while I let my health regen, then had to do the same evil run through the gauntlet of baddies that took all my ammo last time, but I had to do a PERFECT run or I wouldn't have enough ammo to actually kill the final boss. After ALL that, there's a whole other area with ANOTHER boss to beat, and I got ZERO ammo before it. Ick. Not fair. And that was on easy difficulty.-They give you respawn points, but you have to activate them before you can use them. If you haven't found the one in the new area you've just entered, you don't respawn, you just die. And if you don't have a recent save point, god help you. I was saving after LITERALLY every fight and LITERALLY ever time I found a new item or healed or whatever. It was about every 5 seconds because having to redo even 5 minutes of work is super frustrating. Also, you only come back at 25 health each time, so recovering from death is very, very difficult.-Healing. Wow. Super inefficient. There are healing beds (that cost money) scattered around, but except for maybe one, you can't just use them right away. You have to find a key that unlocks them. Which means that you might have been at 25 health for a LONG time, and you FINALLY find a healing bed that will get you back up to full health....and you can't use it.tl;dr Play this game. Be prepared for a lot of hair pulling, lacking everything you need/want, but if you like difficulty, depth and variety, this is your game.			"

												Got it as a late christmas present from a friendbasically this is the more mechanized less optomized, more complex, less graphics version of bioshock, dead space, and aliens. With similarities to other games from the 1990's such as doom, tomb raider, and the legend of zelda franchise. This game has all the pointed or well rounded polygon shapes, very chunky hitboxes, and hack and slash game you'd expect, with the retro arcade/ps1 styled look, with the addition of using powerups similar to that of bioshock. It has all the sfx sounds and AI mechanics you expect from a retro styled game, especially the walking on water soundsgameplay's pretty solidyou start off by choosing one of the three branches of the military of which your character will be composed of during the entire game OSA=PSI powerups, navy=strickly weapons, and marines=mainly maitnence as well as game mechanics.you can buy stuff from machines, hack stuff, destroy things and enemies, and powerup your character in more ways than 1.surprisingly good game that can still hold up even in today's modern gaming franchise. it also has steam trading cardsone main downside above all that it has is multiplayer/co-op is hard to do, since you either need to know how to LAN or connect through IP addressess, or use programs designed for these types of games such as hamachi.Also there is / exists modding, but its the same as multiplayer/co-op which you need to know what you're doing or else you may mess up your game/computerbut don't let that deter you from buying it/playing it. It really is a great game, only thing that can make it better is a complete rehaul or remake with the newer gaming engines			"

If you're a fan of Bioshock or Ken Levines work in general, then you owe it to yourself to see the progression of his themes and ideas, I found that replaying this after Bioshock highlighted a lot more of the similarities between them and made my playthrough a lot more interesting to say the least.If you are considering it, there are plentiful mods to improve on this game, here's a handy page for you.

												I did not play System Shock 2 until 2014, and have never played its namesake.System Shock 2 is not a good FPS. It was never designed to be a great FPS. It is an old game that shows many signs of age. The textures are dated. The models are dated.It is an old game.What then, makes me recommend System Shock 2? What is its relevance along technically advanced games of more modern times? It is the marriage of forgettable FPS and engaging RPG mechanics that surprise me. It is the interesting characters and fleshed out backstory that make me want to see it through. It is the complex level designs that show me attention to detail. All of these elements are reason why I review the title positively. SS2 was made before its time and yet its creation still influences games today. It is an important part of gaming as a whole and deserves to be looked at. If you can see past the age and the odd hitch, pick System Shock 2 up, tweak the controls, slap on a texture mod, and experience SHODAN.Please Consider: There are no mission arrows. The map can be unhelpful. Codes from audio logs must be typed manually.			"

												Singleplayer is brilliant, runs smoothly and gives a level of atmosphere that had me hiding behind locked doors for the first hour of my gameplay. Multiplayer is a tad tempermental, occasionly the game gets stuck on the loading screen and when starting a new game there is a bug which doesn't let you choose a career, however multiplayer is really good. The game gives you half your starting health on multiplayer making it a more difficult experience at the cost of the horror atmosphere, especially when another player gets brained by a lead pipe hybrid and falls head first into it.

												What is it with Sci Fi Horror set in space and Hydroponics deck being the most terrifying thing in the entire game? I don't know how, but this game, despite the fact that it hasn't aged well at all in the graphics department, creates such an amazing atmosphere and really sets the tone in an exemplary way. You play a guy with absolutely no fashion sense (jumpsuit and cybernetically implanted goggles make him look like Adam Jensen going through his goth phase) on his quest to find out just what went wrong on the Von Braun, which has seemingly been taken over by worm people and overly friendly robots who blow up in your face, spoiler alert. Despite the sometimes dodgy voice acting and the pretty awful movement controls (in my opinion, but then again almost all games from this period controlled like♥♥♥♥♥♥, this game is a great RPG, and one of the few in recent memory that has a fairly rich and detailed mythos embedded into the game itself. We don't get enough good Sci-Fi/Cyberpunk Action RPG's, in my opinion, and despite the fact that this is a precursor to this genre, it is still one of the best in terms of atmosphere, story and world building. I heartily reccomend this game to any fans of the genre. Speaking as a person who doesn't have nostalgia goggles on (many people seem to in the review section, and with good reason), I can safely say that this game still holds up in quite a few respects all these years on. Notstalgia usually makes people think of something that may have been ok-ish as the best thing since sliced bread, but what happens when it is something truly great for its time?			"

												As filthy, casual gamer scum, I played the Bioshock games before this one.This kind of makes them look like baby's-first action RPG. I mean, this one even has a manageable inventory, and it's like thirty years old.It also makes me realize that Dead Space, while a fun Resident Evil 4 romp, had absolutely no original ideas and blatantly ripped System Shock off.People harp on this game's brutality, but I think they're exaggerating. If you're the type that snubs his nose at Dead Space and Bioshock, you'll feel right at home here. Being careful with ammo and resources and the constant threat of levels you've cleared magically refilling with horrible, horrible hybrids, it's what those games wanted to do but were too busy being accessible....But the big daddy fights in the first Bioshock were cool. There's not much of that in this, but whatever. "

												I'll start with the things this game got wrong. Most games like this with skill trees/points in particular are bad about forcing you to min-max and this one is no exception. If anything it's worse than most other games from the same era cause you can literally make the game un-winnable if you don't know what stats you need and don't. The psionic abilities and weapons are also horribly inbalanced against themselves, have to knock off points for that since there's a fair amount of combat in this game.Those complaints aside this one is incredibly atmospheric, far more than any Bioshock game was ever able to achieve. The limitations of the engine create a crushing sense of isolation and the only contact you have being with entities that cannot be trusted further add to the lingering sense of dread.Flaws and all, this is still a game worth experiencing. Definitely worth checking out.			"

												If you haven't heard of System Shock 2, well, it's the game that was so gripping and fantastic that it secretly got remade as another gripping and fantastic game, Bioshock.Now this game, System Shock 2, it's a doozy. I could recommend it solely because of the atmosphere it drapes over you. It's the only game I've played that actually reached in through my eye sockets, curled its wires around my spine, and really, truly made me feel powerless. Imagine, if you can, my situation. I am trapped, trapped inside the twisting bowels of a vast machine, with just a little space to move around. And the more I move around, the more I realize, I am tangled in two machines - one of flesh, the other of hissing steel. A voice is guiding me, helping me, but it's just a voice. And as I wrench myself free from deep within this machine, violently stumbling out of the clutches of one chamber and into another, always the steel is watching from my front, and the flesh is grabbing at my heels.I am never allowed to forget that between my scampering body and the dead vacuum of space lies a thin layer of aluminium and glass.This game is not a cake-walk - it's a tough journey and a tough experience. If you like horror, you HAVE TO experience System Shock 2, the acme of the genre. There are a few brilliant moments in the game that made my brain drop whatever it was doing and just kind of kick and whimper. I recall saying things like ""Ga! It can't, wait, how? Oh hell, what?? No!"" (And I'm a pretty jaded guy.) Some of these moments are big, others are small enough to miss for a while - and then, when they do hit, they hit really, really hard. It's just brilliant, singularly brilliant.Even with the horror that is the graphical technology of 1999, the visuals in SS2 do a fantastic job. The NPC models are blurry by today's standards, but somehow so disturbing that they never lose their impact. The dying spaceship you're on is a masterpiece of design: corpses and debris are meaningfully scattered, each piece telling an aching story. The stellar sound design (by far, by far, the best I've encountered in any game) begs to be experienced. A sprawling RPG skillset and intrigueing sets of tools and weapons let you survive in any number of ways, all of them challenging.I recommend playing the original System Shock first (the enhanced edition with all the sounds); it's not essential, but will give you a little more context and back-story. It is definitely worth playing just to experience the first chapter of what I think is the best villain in a video game. SS2 does a great job of painting the full picture, though.I could host a week-long seminar about the great things this game achieves, but the truth is, you should simply experience it for yourself. Get the game now, and try to play it as coninuously as you can to avoid fragmenting the experience.			"

It feels rather responsive, though you'll occasionally struggle with the strangely organised menu structure.10/10 for horror, sci-fi, cyberpunk, FPS-RPG - fans.			"

												A Classic Game I highly recommend. System Shock 2's game play is something I've rarely encountered to the same level of execution in games of that era or in fact the current era of games.  You can see echos of this game in more recent games that have varying degree of influence and pay homage (some even feeling like alternative universion versoin of system shock 2).Perhaps one of the more refreashing aspects is that it is a sequal that both seamlessly transitions from the prior entry  while at the same time not expecting you or requiring you to have played the prior entry. The game allows you to create a specialized and dynamic character. Grab your trusty Wrench and set forth on a well written and classic sci-fi adventer.			"

												As one of the all time survival horror classics, System Shock 2 has been on the top of my to-do list for a while.  Now that I've finally finished the game I've been telling myself to play since 2007, here's my thoughts:Story: The story was very well done, and it shows how much it's influenced future games of its type, like Bioshock and Dead Space.  The basics are simple enough: you wake up on board a starship with amnesia, and someone starts barking orders into your ear while you're attacked by mutants with wrenches.  Not the most inspired start by today's standards, but what really gets the story moving are logs from other people on the ship.  These recording from before and during the attack build a large world around you (as large as you can get on a spaceship), with other characters carrying out their own subplots around you.  Some of the lines can be a bit narmy, but it's kind of saddening when you find a log from a character you've been hearing of for the past couple levels, only for it to be a recording of their last moments.The active plot is wonderful as well.  SHODAN being the main villian has been spoiled since the original box art in 1999, but the build up to the reveal is quite well done, both in story and atmosphere.  The story about The Many is superb as well, and everything is wrapped up in a satisfying ending.  That's not counting the final boss fight, of course, but I'll get to that in a minute.All in all, there's nothing to complain about here.  A very well told story from start to finish.Sound: I'll split this section off into a couple different sections.  The overall sound direction is great: there's a lot of little ambient sounds that add to the atmosphere, and hearing security bots and mutants in the distance makes the game feel very tense.  You'll get a couple jumpscares, too, with unexpected explosions here and there as the ship degrades.The actual music in the game is excellent, but some of it doesn't quite fit for it.  On the very first level Med/Sci, you're treated to an energetic techo beat that seems more conductive to running & gunning, like something out of Unreal Tournament.  But, at that point, all you have to your name is a wrench and (maybe) low level Psi powers, so a run & gun style is just going to get your head bashed in with a pipe wrench.  It gets much better after that, however, with tracks that really keep you on edge.The voice acting is, to put it nicely, really over the place.  The lead character is mute (save for 1 line at the end of the game), so all of the voice work is done by the supporting characters.  SHODAN and The Many sound great, with SHODAN being a standout performance.  Some of the enemies (like the mutant hybrids) are good, too, and can cause some jump scares hearing their distorted voices coming up fast behind you.  The rest of the cast and logs range from ""great"" to ""hobo they pulled off the street, and are paying with vodka & cigarettes"".  Some of the voice acting just...wasn't convincing at all.Graphics: I won't touch too much on the graphics, considering the age of the game.  It looks great for the time it came out in, looking a lot like Half Life, Thief and the above mentioned Unreal.  The level design was outstanding as well: I never found myself getting lost, and the setup of the ship makes as much sense as a starship would make.  A special note goes to the final two levels of the game in terms of level design, but I don't want to spoil to much here.  Gameplay: the gameplay is just as polarizing as the sound direction is.  The core gameplay is a pretty functional FPS, with some platforming in a few places.  There's some RPG elements in the form of 'Cyber Modules' that you earn by completing plot related objectives, as well as by looking in some hard to reach places.  These Cyber Modules can be used to upgrade profeciency with weapons and tech related things (such as Repair and Hacking), increase your base stats, or unlock psionic abilities.  It's a pretty neat twist to the Fighter-Mage-Thief setup that many RPG's use.  The game gives you a lot to choose from, and no two characters are going to have the same build (unless you're reading from a guide or something).However, these same RPG elements are one of the core failings of the game.  The above mentioned weapons you can train in are horribly imbalanced: some weapon classes are much better than the others, and picking the wrong build (or running out of specific ammo near the end) can render the game completely unwinnable.  It's especially apparent in the final levels of the game: the second to last level renders an entire set of weapons useless, while the final level renders another set of weapons (one that was good against the enemies in the previous level) equally worthless.  If you relied on only one of these sets of weapons during the game, then time to restart!  This is more likely to happen on Impossible difficulty, however: Easy and Normal give you more than enough modules to modify your build if you notice anything wrong, and even Hard is pretty generous with them once you're on deck 3/4.The RPG elements also add some replay value to the game.  While I completed the game with a lot of Tech and Standard Weapons training, I may do a 2nd playthrough as a completely Psionic character next.  The difficulty also spikes the higher you go, and I'm honestly dreading trying up the game on Impossible.Overall: An extremely well told story and some legitimate scares, woven into a functional yet flawed FPSRPG.  If you're considering this game, the biggest question to ask yourself is this: can you stomach 'meh' gameplay for a great story?  If so, I highly recommend this game.  But, I can freely admit it's not everyone: feel free to stay away if you're not into survival horror games, or if you like your FPS's feeling a bit less 'broken'.			"

												This is a very interesting horror-themed first person shooter. Yes, it came out way back in 1999, so the graphics are dated by today's standards. I finally got around to playing it because the highly entertaining Bioshock series was made by the same guy, Ken Levine. I also remember playing and enjoying System Shock 1 many years ago so nostalgia had something to do with it. The intro to System Shock 2 tells you what happened in the previous game, though, so don't feel you need to play the original to enjoy the sequel.So, despite the dated graphics, is it still scary and/or fun? Hells YES, on both counts! I'll give an example of the scariness/awesomeness:You're trapped on a spaceship that has been taken over by hostile aliens. The aliens also control the ship's computer system, so the ship's normally helpful steward robots have now become automated suicide bombers. They will walk up to you and self destruct, usually while spouting some cheery greeting or friendly banter. As part of your travels you have to go through a darkened cargo bay with crates stacked everywhere and many tight spaces. I got to the middle of the cargo bay before I realized that all the crates around me were storage crates for the suicide steward robots, and that all the crates said ""READY"" on them in big green letters. Sure enough, as soon as I turn my back on the crates I hear the sound of them breaking open, and a horde of robots is coming right at me, giving me friendly greetings all the while! Talk about a mixture of shock, horror, and excitement!!!The game has strong RPG elements. At the start you are given the choice of being a combat oriented Marine, a technical oriented Naval Ops guy, or a Psionic Operative -- basically a high tech Jedi or wizard or whatever you want to call it. You're given a large amount of different skills to choose from, but you'll only have enough skill points to master a few so you have to choose wisely.The large number of skills and items means you have many options for defeating the obstacles in your path. Is a big mean security bot ruining your day? Use your psi powers to turn invisible and walk past him. Or switch to armor piercing bullets to destroy him. Or hack a security turret to open fire on your enemy.There are many mini-games that come with System Shock 2. You'll get a ""GamePig"" fairly early on that will let you play games completely unrelated to the main plot, everything from Tic Tac Toe to a racing game to an Ultima clone! Hells yeah!But not everything is good about System Shock 2.For one thing the game has a steep learning curve, and it is very difficult. Even a single enemy can kill you without too much trouble, and even when you're doing well you're always short of resources. This goes along with the survival horror theme but it can be frustrating at times. I'm a veteran first person shooter player, but after a few hours of getting slaughtered on ""Normal"" difficulty I had to swallow my pride and restart on ""Easy.""Another gripe I had was the inventory management system was annoying. You'll quickly run out of space, and the only way to get more space is to spend precious skill upgrade points on Strength, a skill of otherwise dubious usefulness. And even after I maxed out my Strength score I was still running out of space! Argh!As for the plot, it was nine kinds of awesome. There are several plot twists and I don't want to be too spoilerish, but I will say that the climactic finale of the game was a crowning moment of awesome. I only wish that more games had this kind of emphasis on storytelling.So System Shock 2 is a flawed game, yes, but it's worth looking past the flaws because in the end you'll find a hidden gem. If you like Bioshock, Deus Ex, or survival horror games you owe it to yourself to check out System Shock 2.			"

												One problem with this game: claims to be Mac compatible and isn't. So I sold my Mac and fired it up on my new laptop.The experience I received was nothing short of exceptional. A soundtrack that stands the test of time; gameplay mechanics that don't feel unlike games of the present day and a compelling storyline make this game heads and shoulders above most of the dross that gets flung out these days.Buy this game, or i'll find you and burst you.

												An atmospheric, riveting mish-mash of role-playing, first-person shooter, adventure, survival horror, and puzzle solving that stands the test of time. Lost in cyberspace, as if it were a case of irony, for the longest time, its resurrection as a legally downloadable title will certainly help to get more players aquainted with the game that essentially spearheaded its spiritual successor, BioShock. Indeed, you'll find that BioShock, with a few liberties of course, plays almost exactly like System Shock 2. It has a very similar plot structure, also has its own set of abilities crafted for its game world, and that oh so infamous twist. System Shock 2 is a challenging affair, however, but not always for the right reasons. While it certainly doesn't hold your hand like BioShock did with the Vita Chambers, it's honestly not far behind with the reconstruction nodes (or whatever they're called in SS2). The primary weakness in SS2 lies in its array of Psi abilities, which are drastically unbalanced and rather poorly conceived, compounded even further by the atrocious costs to acquire them whilst you should instead focus on more pressing skills and traits (such as weapon requirements and statistics upgrades). Weapons jam far too quickly. Enemies can respawn and it sometimes breaks the immersion. Controls are not silky smooth, but this is more a double-edged sword that also presents a necessary challenge that may help you appreciate the game's trials. And the graphics, in retrospect, are rather ugly, particularly with regards to character models and the innumerous FMV sequences (yeah, I used a term that has seemingly disappeared from the gaming pantheon).Stealth is, rather, sketchy in the game as well. Some of the enemies seem to possess Heimdall-esque sensory abilities at times while at others they're completely oblivious to your adjacent presence. Either occurrence can take place while you play stealthily (walking instead of running, moving around in a crouch, no firing of weaponry, etc.), so there's some inconsistent AI present. There are useful features in the game, however, such as modifying weaponry without strained limitations like its spiritual successor, being able to climb ledges and other obstacles, priming a melee weapon for a timed strike rather than swinging about like a dunce, and a full-fledged inventory system. You can also change the kind of armor you wear, and you can equip a trait-enhancing implant (two with a particular OS upgrade). Cybernetic Modules are more valuable and come in lesser quantities than ADAM from BioShock, and thus you come to appreciate acquiring them in this go-ahead. The aforementioned flaw in the Psi abilities wherein lies most of the abilities (5 pages of them, costing up to 50 modules just to unlock) doesn't help matters and may cause players to find themselves in an unnecessarily unfair circumstance later in gameplay, but at this point this flaw is common knowledge so one should be able to avoid it with a simple treading of actual reviews.Anyway, the power of this game lies in the atmosphere, characters & monsters, and setting. You are, really, quite utterly alone on the enigmatic Von Braun, and everything is out to get you. When you think there's hope, it immediately gets dashed. You must adapt to survive, or you just won't cut it. You have to strategize, and as you interact with the interfacing systems of the Von Braun and the accompanying Rickenbacker, you're defenseless and in real-time. You have to seek out the only means of avoiding the dreaded ""back to menu"" incident as a result of untimely death, which may very well happen within mere seconds of facing opposition or even harsh environmental conditions. You have to listen to the sounds of your surroundings or pay the price for carelessness. Common enemies, which are infected former crew-members, hunt you down mercilessly but apologize to you for it or beg for you to take them out of their misery. What were once simple robots built for the express purpose of undertaking menial tasks are now unwitting kamikaze units. Alien-esque creatures appear more numerous the further into the ship you venture, assaulting you from all sides. Former defense droids that kept the peace and maintained safety for the crew do everything but those things when you're around, and will cut your life short upon detection. And all you have are rather measly (at first) weapons, limited and costly ammunition to attack with, armor that slightly reduces damage at all, and on top of all that, a very mortal existence. You're on the bottom of the food chain here, you're no John Rambo, and most of all, time is running out. That doesn't take into account the sometimes absurdly dangerous environment and its contents!In the end, it is a remarkable title that deserves to be played, especially by fans of 2007's BioShock. You may even manage an ounce of appreciation for System Shock 2, and for the diabolical, megalomaniacal villain SHODAN whom adorns its cover image and just about any discussion regarding the game. You may even quiver in fear as you go about its challenges, which is always a plus.			"

												Since there are enough reviews considering the game, I will share some experience from multiplayer!No story spoilers inside, but some ingame mechanics will be discussed.First, get the better graphics mod! The vanilla player avatar looks disgusting!If you have not played this game before, play singleplayer first! Multiplayer is fun, but the scary mood will be gone. Besides... I found the game even harder in multiplayer. I am playing this with my buddy using a fake LAN (VPN) coop, since normal online coop is not possible. (We trick the system into believing it is a LAN using some software named ""tunngle"", just for those of you who want to try for themselves. It is made for LAN-only games and setup is doable. Just keep in mind that one player should host the virtual LAN, and ANOTHER player should host the multiplayer game. MUCH LESS bugs this way.)This game plays very differently with two people. Less scary, more fun. Combats are a little bit easier (just watch this friendly fire though!!!), but skill upgrade costs are very high. Forces you into hardcore roleplaying, since you must concentrate your efforts into buying the skills you really need. And with two people you absolutely need skills like repair, modify or maintenance. Not enough instant repair or instant modify items to supply 2 players! And certainly not enough ammunition to supply 2 players using the same gun! On the other hand one player will have the spare modules to buy alien and/or laser skill instead of standard weapons, something you will not see very often in singleplayer.And save often, multiplayer is a little (every 40 min on a bad day) buggy: upgrade modules vanish, out of sync, enemies wallhacking, just to name the gamebreaking ones. Fortunately, loading times are about 2 seconds.Still absolutely worth the experience, if only you get to use all this stuff you usually do not bother with in singleplayer.			"

												'System Shock 2' is terrible...at first. If you play the first hour then give up never to install the game agin, I wouldn't blame you. Even on the easiest setting, you start the game and suddenly your taken through a series of choices that do things to your character you don't understand. Then your placed into a fight and find out that you chose everything wrong and must start all over again. Repeat about four times and eventually you'll be able to get through the first level. Then you get to the second and yell ""OH FOR GOD SAKES"" at the screen as the game does the 'Half-Life 2' method of story-conflict by giving you a really simple objecive - take an elevator to Deck 4 - then adding various numbers of contrived complications. Here is how the game starts: You wake up, try to take the elevator, find the power is down and you must go down to the Engineering Deck. But the door to Engineering is locked, so you have to get the code from an NPC. You try to get to his quarters, but the door is locked. You find the key, only to find he's not there - he's in his office. So you go to his office and he gives you the key. Then you get to Engineering only to find it's flooded with radiation and you have to clear it - but to clear it you need to access a locked door, and the key is in the cargo bay. Once you unlock the door, you find the computer is broken so you have to travel across the level to fix it. This is all just to ride a stupid bloody elevator!If you can just accept that it's going to take you three levels and almost four hours of gameplay just to ride a elevator, and once you've worked out that the best way to play the game first time is to screw the fancy PSI powers and use a Shotgun and Assault Rilfe combo then you are in for a blast.Little things such as the fact the game doesn't pause whilst you fiddle with your inventory will at first be an annoyance, but once you finish this game and return to another - you'll miss it. There is nothing more frightening than trying to do something with your interface when suddenly a hybrid pops up and you have to quickly close it down and fumble with the hotkeys until you find your melee weapon. The 'fiddly' nature becomes necessary, as does the unforgiving nature of the rest of the game. There are two reasons why this game is surprisingly terrifying despite it's dated graphics: Firstly, you feel vulerable throughout. The game only gives you enough tools to get by, and if you squander those tools then it's your fault. It may feel like your being showered with upgrade points, but if you waste those points then they're not coming back. There is also a catch to everything. Your melee weapon never deteriorates, but of course melee leaves you highly exposed to ranged attacks - which almost all the enemies use. Your shotgun can't attack robots, your Assault Rifle degrades like it's make of paper, your Grenade Launcher uses rare ammo, and you need to research Exotic Weapons before you can use them...plus the ammo is even rarer. It's the complete opposite to 'Bioshock's approach - where the right combination of weapon upgrades, tonics, and plasmids can completely break the game. Secondly, want to know where 'Bioshock' ('System Shock 2's lesser, yet still worthy son) got it's outstanding atmosphere from? Due to how underpowered you feel, your already scared of enemies - but they all have unique, terrifying sounds that make you dread their presence more. The audio-logs are not as well voice-acted, but there are more of them and they progressively become more disturbing throughout; much more so than 'Bioshock'. The only problems with the game are how the story often takes the♥♥♥♥♥♥(there's a combination lock, and the only way you can find the code is to go round this large level - that you've already been around about three times - looking at paintings. Or...you could just look the code up online) and the ending feels like the developers ran out of time - and that's because they did. The final few levels become much more linear, which is a shame because the last map introduces an ingenious concept that should have been expanded on, and the ending cutscene is laughably bad. It's still not as bad as the ending of 'Bioshock' - although 'System Shock 2' suffers from the same compulsive need for a 'big boss' when this is a game that's above such cliches. Overall, 'System Shock 2' is like ramadan. It might be gruelling at points, but you will emerge a completely different person. (There is no need to play 'System Shock 1' before this. Just look up the plot on Wikipedia to get the story so far.)			"

												System Shock 2 is a ""cult"" game the way the film Silent Running is cult, many people have heard of it (in Sci-Fi anyway) few experienced it.  Plus System Shock 2 sold pretty badly back in the day and physical copies were hard to find.  But now you can remedy this gap in your gaming knowledge!Made by Looking Glass Studios (the first two Thief games) with music by Eric Brosius (ditto) System Shock 2 is the forerunner that influenced (among others) Deus Ex, Bioshock, Portal and Dead Space.  If you enjoyed any of these games I say give SS2 a shot.Numerous mods help improve music and texture quality for those put off by the screenshots, I'd particularly recommend SHMUP (improves music quality) and SHTUP (upgrades textures)  you can find them by searching for them in any search engine (maybe not Bing, I dunno =)It's pretty cheap anyway, but especially during a sale I'd call it a ""must have"".  SHODAN is one of the great computer game characters of all time.    "

												Quite simply this game is a cult classic, which started the genre, if you want a really graphically impressive game then this is somewhat dated for you.  However, if you're after something with a good story, well thought out gameplay, with nothing too complicated in the way of puzzles, the this is it!There's plenty of options for your plan of survival. There's loads of scary moments to be had too! You can be drawn into a situation where you're literally scared stiff with your 2 health, no ranged weapons, and just a melee weapon to get you to the next nanite pickup!All in all I love this game, with the mods the story expands, you'll get a lot of gameplay out of this game!

Posted: July 21, 2014
												As one of the all time survival horror classics, System Shock 2 has been on the top of my to-do list for a while.  Now that I've finally finished the game I've been telling myself to play since 2007, here's my thoughts:Story: The story was very well done, and it shows how much it's influenced future games of its type, like Bioshock and Dead Space.  The basics are simple enough: you wake up on board a starship with amnesia, and someone starts barking orders into your ear while you're attacked by mutants with wrenches.  Not the most inspired start by today's standards, but what really gets the story moving are logs from other people on the ship.  These recording from before and during the attack build a large world around you (as large as you can get on a spaceship), with other characters carrying out their own subplots around you.  Some of the lines can be a bit narmy, but it's kind of saddening when you find a log from a character you've been hearing of for the past couple levels, only for it to be a recording of their last moments.The active plot is wonderful as well.  SHODAN being the main villian has been spoiled since the original box art in 1999, but the build up to the reveal is quite well done, both in story and atmosphere.  The story about The Many is superb as well, and everything is wrapped up in a satisfying ending.  That's not counting the final boss fight, of course, but I'll get to that in a minute.All in all, there's nothing to complain about here.  A very well told story from start to finish.Sound: I'll split this section off into a couple different sections.  The overall sound direction is great: there's a lot of little ambient sounds that add to the atmosphere, and hearing security bots and mutants in the distance makes the game feel very tense.  You'll get a couple jumpscares, too, with unexpected explosions here and there as the ship degrades.The actual music in the game is excellent, but some of it doesn't quite fit for it.  On the very first level Med/Sci, you're treated to an energetic techo beat that seems more conductive to running & gunning, like something out of Unreal Tournament.  But, at that point, all you have to your name is a wrench and (maybe) low level Psi powers, so a run & gun style is just going to get your head bashed in with a pipe wrench.  It gets much better after that, however, with tracks that really keep you on edge.The voice acting is, to put it nicely, really over the place.  The lead character is mute (save for 1 line at the end of the game), so all of the voice work is done by the supporting characters.  SHODAN and The Many sound great, with SHODAN being a standout performance.  Some of the enemies (like the mutant hybrids) are good, too, and can cause some jump scares hearing their distorted voices coming up fast behind you.  The rest of the cast and logs range from ""great"" to ""hobo they pulled off the street, and are paying with vodka & cigarettes"".  Some of the voice acting just...wasn't convincing at all.Graphics: I won't touch too much on the graphics, considering the age of the game.  It looks great for the time it came out in, looking a lot like Half Life, Thief and the above mentioned Unreal.  The level design was outstanding as well: I never found myself getting lost, and the setup of the ship makes as much sense as a starship would make.  A special note goes to the final two levels of the game in terms of level design, but I don't want to spoil to much here.  Gameplay: the gameplay is just as polarizing as the sound direction is.  The core gameplay is a pretty functional FPS, with some platforming in a few places.  There's some RPG elements in the form of 'Cyber Modules' that you earn by completing plot related objectives, as well as by looking in some hard to reach places.  These Cyber Modules can be used to upgrade profeciency with weapons and tech related things (such as Repair and Hacking), increase your base stats, or unlock psionic abilities.  It's a pretty neat twist to the Fighter-Mage-Thief setup that many RPG's use.  The game gives you a lot to choose from, and no two characters are going to have the same build (unless you're reading from a guide or something).However, these same RPG elements are one of the core failings of the game.  The above mentioned weapons you can train in are horribly imbalanced: some weapon classes are much better than the others, and picking the wrong build (or running out of specific ammo near the end) can render the game completely unwinnable.  It's especially apparent in the final levels of the game: the second to last level renders an entire set of weapons useless, while the final level renders another set of weapons (one that was good against the enemies in the previous level) equally worthless.  If you relied on only one of these sets of weapons during the game, then time to restart!  This is more likely to happen on Impossible difficulty, however: Easy and Normal give you more than enough modules to modify your build if you notice anything wrong, and even Hard is pretty generous with them once you're on deck 3/4.The RPG elements also add some replay value to the game.  While I completed the game with a lot of Tech and Standard Weapons training, I may do a 2nd playthrough as a completely Psionic character next.  The difficulty also spikes the higher you go, and I'm honestly dreading trying up the game on Impossible.Overall: An extremely well told story and some legitimate scares, woven into a functional yet flawed FPSRPG.  If you're considering this game, the biggest question to ask yourself is this: can you stomach 'meh' gameplay for a great story?  If so, I highly recommend this game.  But, I can freely admit it's not everyone: feel free to stay away if you're not into survival horror games, or if you like your FPS's feeling a bit less 'broken'.			"

Character models are a bit shanky, even back last century they were rubbish but if you can get past that there's nowt else to say negatively about it.			"

												An atmospheric, riveting mish-mash of role-playing, first-person shooter, adventure, survival horror, and puzzle solving that stands the test of time. Lost in cyberspace, as if it were a case of irony, for the longest time, its resurrection as a legally downloadable title will certainly help to get more players aquainted with the game that essentially spearheaded its spiritual successor, BioShock. Indeed, you'll find that BioShock, with a few liberties of course, plays almost exactly like System Shock 2. It has a very similar plot structure, also has its own set of abilities crafted for its game world, and that oh so infamous twist. System Shock 2 is a challenging affair, however, but not always for the right reasons. While it certainly doesn't hold your hand like BioShock did with the Vita Chambers, it's honestly not far behind with the reconstruction nodes (or whatever they're called in SS2). The primary weakness in SS2 lies in its array of Psi abilities, which are drastically unbalanced and rather poorly conceived, compounded even further by the atrocious costs to acquire them whilst you should instead focus on more pressing skills and traits (such as weapon requirements and statistics upgrades). Weapons jam far too quickly. Enemies can respawn and it sometimes breaks the immersion. Controls are not silky smooth, but this is more a double-edged sword that also presents a necessary challenge that may help you appreciate the game's trials. And the graphics, in retrospect, are rather ugly, particularly with regards to character models and the innumerous FMV sequences (yeah, I used a term that has seemingly disappeared from the gaming pantheon).Stealth is, rather, sketchy in the game as well. Some of the enemies seem to possess Heimdall-esque sensory abilities at times while at others they're completely oblivious to your adjacent presence. Either occurrence can take place while you play stealthily (walking instead of running, moving around in a crouch, no firing of weaponry, etc.), so there's some inconsistent AI present. There are useful features in the game, however, such as modifying weaponry without strained limitations like its spiritual successor, being able to climb ledges and other obstacles, priming a melee weapon for a timed strike rather than swinging about like a dunce, and a full-fledged inventory system. You can also change the kind of armor you wear, and you can equip a trait-enhancing implant (two with a particular OS upgrade). Cybernetic Modules are more valuable and come in lesser quantities than ADAM from BioShock, and thus you come to appreciate acquiring them in this go-ahead. The aforementioned flaw in the Psi abilities wherein lies most of the abilities (5 pages of them, costing up to 50 modules just to unlock) doesn't help matters and may cause players to find themselves in an unnecessarily unfair circumstance later in gameplay, but at this point this flaw is common knowledge so one should be able to avoid it with a simple treading of actual reviews.Anyway, the power of this game lies in the atmosphere, characters & monsters, and setting. You are, really, quite utterly alone on the enigmatic Von Braun, and everything is out to get you. When you think there's hope, it immediately gets dashed. You must adapt to survive, or you just won't cut it. You have to strategize, and as you interact with the interfacing systems of the Von Braun and the accompanying Rickenbacker, you're defenseless and in real-time. You have to seek out the only means of avoiding the dreaded ""back to menu"" incident as a result of untimely death, which may very well happen within mere seconds of facing opposition or even harsh environmental conditions. You have to listen to the sounds of your surroundings or pay the price for carelessness. Common enemies, which are infected former crew-members, hunt you down mercilessly but apologize to you for it or beg for you to take them out of their misery. What were once simple robots built for the express purpose of undertaking menial tasks are now unwitting kamikaze units. Alien-esque creatures appear more numerous the further into the ship you venture, assaulting you from all sides. Former defense droids that kept the peace and maintained safety for the crew do everything but those things when you're around, and will cut your life short upon detection. And all you have are rather measly (at first) weapons, limited and costly ammunition to attack with, armor that slightly reduces damage at all, and on top of all that, a very mortal existence. You're on the bottom of the food chain here, you're no John Rambo, and most of all, time is running out. That doesn't take into account the sometimes absurdly dangerous environment and its contents!In the end, it is a remarkable title that deserves to be played, especially by fans of 2007's BioShock. You may even manage an ounce of appreciation for System Shock 2, and for the diabolical, megalomaniacal villain SHODAN whom adorns its cover image and just about any discussion regarding the game. You may even quiver in fear as you go about its challenges, which is always a plus.			"

												Good game.  Clunky old school interface and inventory/log system take a little bit to get a handle on, but after about the first hour you'll be used to them.  Good story, good atmosphere, surprisingly long (took me about 16-19 hours), and you get to choose how to progress your character at the upgrade stations.  A couple of negative things bring the game down a bit.  1.  The map system is pretty awful.  You get sent all over the ship and oftentimes it's hard to figure out what connects to what, or where exactly you're supposed to go.  2.  The game gets ridiculously easy once you get the assault rifle, are able to use it, and get it fully upgraded.  3.  Enemies respawn in areas occasionally.  It's only really annoying early on when you have very little Armor Piercing ammo, and the game chooses to respawn a bunch of robots.  None of these are a huge deal though.  Solid game that's worth playing.  Also, Bebop is an alcoholic.			"

												'System Shock 2' is terrible...at first. If you play the first hour then give up never to install the game agin, I wouldn't blame you. Even on the easiest setting, you start the game and suddenly your taken through a series of choices that do things to your character you don't understand. Then your placed into a fight and find out that you chose everything wrong and must start all over again. Repeat about four times and eventually you'll be able to get through the first level. Then you get to the second and yell ""OH FOR GOD SAKES"" at the screen as the game does the 'Half-Life 2' method of story-conflict by giving you a really simple objecive - take an elevator to Deck 4 - then adding various numbers of contrived complications. Here is how the game starts: You wake up, try to take the elevator, find the power is down and you must go down to the Engineering Deck. But the door to Engineering is locked, so you have to get the code from an NPC. You try to get to his quarters, but the door is locked. You find the key, only to find he's not there - he's in his office. So you go to his office and he gives you the key. Then you get to Engineering only to find it's flooded with radiation and you have to clear it - but to clear it you need to access a locked door, and the key is in the cargo bay. Once you unlock the door, you find the computer is broken so you have to travel across the level to fix it. This is all just to ride a stupid bloody elevator!If you can just accept that it's going to take you three levels and almost four hours of gameplay just to ride a elevator, and once you've worked out that the best way to play the game first time is to screw the fancy PSI powers and use a Shotgun and Assault Rilfe combo then you are in for a blast.Little things such as the fact the game doesn't pause whilst you fiddle with your inventory will at first be an annoyance, but once you finish this game and return to another - you'll miss it. There is nothing more frightening than trying to do something with your interface when suddenly a hybrid pops up and you have to quickly close it down and fumble with the hotkeys until you find your melee weapon. The 'fiddly' nature becomes necessary, as does the unforgiving nature of the rest of the game. There are two reasons why this game is surprisingly terrifying despite it's dated graphics: Firstly, you feel vulerable throughout. The game only gives you enough tools to get by, and if you squander those tools then it's your fault. It may feel like your being showered with upgrade points, but if you waste those points then they're not coming back. There is also a catch to everything. Your melee weapon never deteriorates, but of course melee leaves you highly exposed to ranged attacks - which almost all the enemies use. Your shotgun can't attack robots, your Assault Rifle degrades like it's make of paper, your Grenade Launcher uses rare ammo, and you need to research Exotic Weapons before you can use them...plus the ammo is even rarer. It's the complete opposite to 'Bioshock's approach - where the right combination of weapon upgrades, tonics, and plasmids can completely break the game. Secondly, want to know where 'Bioshock' ('System Shock 2's lesser, yet still worthy son) got it's outstanding atmosphere from? Due to how underpowered you feel, your already scared of enemies - but they all have unique, terrifying sounds that make you dread their presence more. The audio-logs are not as well voice-acted, but there are more of them and they progressively become more disturbing throughout; much more so than 'Bioshock'. The only problems with the game are how the story often takes the♥♥♥♥♥♥(there's a combination lock, and the only way you can find the code is to go round this large level - that you've already been around about three times - looking at paintings. Or...you could just look the code up online) and the ending feels like the developers ran out of time - and that's because they did. The final few levels become much more linear, which is a shame because the last map introduces an ingenious concept that should have been expanded on, and the ending cutscene is laughably bad. It's still not as bad as the ending of 'Bioshock' - although 'System Shock 2' suffers from the same compulsive need for a 'big boss' when this is a game that's above such cliches. Overall, 'System Shock 2' is like ramadan. It might be gruelling at points, but you will emerge a completely different person. (There is no need to play 'System Shock 1' before this. Just look up the plot on Wikipedia to get the story so far.)			"

												This game is one of the best games at making an atmosphere so scary, it just sucks you into the game. The beggining is sheeit for people who play the game for the first time, just like me. But once you continue deeper into the game, you feel less restricted since you have full automaps that show the way all the places are made up and you have more powerful weaponry against all enemies you meet. Very brilliant experience.			"

												When I picked the game up, I knew that I was in for something special.  System Shock 2 has a reputation as one of the best Survival Horror and/or FPS games ever made, so it couldn't be bad, right?Well, it's not perfect, but what it does wel, it does really well.We'll start with the positives.  This game is one of the few I've discovered that gives a damn about the ""survival"" in survival horror.  Weapons degrade quickly, ammunition is rare, and a lot of the enemies will destroy you if you just charge into every fight.  The game is nice and challenging.Next, the atmosphere.  Through a lot of the game, they manage to reach Ravenholm-level atmosphere, with enemies placed in the perfect locations for maximum jump-scare potentail.  I'm not ashamed to admit that some of my least-dignified moments have come from the protocol droids- definitely the most paranoia-inducing enemies in the game.  Not the most powerful, but if one sneaks up on you...  You're probably going to die.Now, it has gameplay and atmosphere down.  What doesn't it do right?Level design.  A large number of the levels are divided up into mutiple parts, with each one having a separate checkpoint.  You die without finding the checkpoint?  Back to the load screen for you.  Oftentimes, where each checkpoint services is completely arbitrary and nonsensical- five meters to the west is okay, but not five meters to the east, for example.Worse, later evels remove the checkpoints entirely, but don't change up the gameplay to match the lack of this mechanic.  I ended up having to completely restart the game after entering the last hour, thanks to running out of anti-rad hypos, anti-disease hypos, and health items on top of bullets.  I would have restocked, but I didn't have enough money.  The entire last area is unwinnabe unless you're perfectly well-stocked.Overall, however, the game itself is solid, and recommended for any fan of survival horror and shooters.			"

												System Shock 2 is one of the great masterpieces of gaming history, there are innumerable things that make it the shining gem that it is but I think everyone who hasn't played it should go in blind and discover for themselves why this game set a gold standard for the RPG genre and set a bar for the sci-fi/cyberpunk theme that I don’t believe has been matched to this day.

												When people talk about first person shooters that not only revitalize and set a grand example in the genre, but also offered up one of the greatest horror video games out there with a mix of role-playing elements, many would mention the spiritual precessor of the Bioshock series, the System Shock series (in this case, the sequel ""System Shock 2"") Back in 1999, this was a game that offered up several new aspects that were later used in various other games in general; utilizing game asthestics that were considered far ahead of its time. However, one question that comes to mind is this: Does System Shock 2 still hold up today as a truly spectacular action-horror experience? In my perspective, the answer is really not that simple. In case no one has ever heard one of Irrational Games's very first foray into video games (since they had no part in the prequel), here's the premise: 42 years after the events of the first game,  you control a lone survivor trying to find out the reason for why a technologically genetic outbreak has devastated the starship he's on called the Von Braun. However, through hearing audio logs left by the deceased crew and witnessing the abominations brought out by the infection, you must put a stop to it while staying alive, even if it means forming an alliance with your worst enemey. Let me just start off with what I feel System Shock 2 does the best at: atmosphere. This is largely in part to its extremely exceptional audio design. While a few of the sound effects leave a lot to be desired (some of the guns sounded iffy and not that powerful to me), they managed to incorporate a creepy ambiance with the use of miminal sound courtesy of mostly background noise. It truly brings a good amount of tension to the game, especially when you don't know what's going to occur next. It's subtlety like this that really adds to the turmoil and uneasiness within the game. The frantic techno music, however, sounds out of place and doesn't accelerate the stressful situations you will face. Plus, I may be one of the only people who didn't find this game to be all that......scary. There were a few moments which provided a fair share of jumpscares (mostly from enemies waiting right when you enter a door), but I felt that it didn't warrant high praise. There is, however, one aspect of the game that left a very dark mark in me, and that will be explained right now. How they mixed the vocal performances is something to admire, especially in the cases of the Many, where the voices are multi-layered and showcase a very unsettling tone to their threats, and Shodan, who is the most terrifying of them all, exhibiting a uncomfortable stutter with a barrage of fluctuating vocal patterns, malfunctions, and a combination of three different voices to make you cringe. There's other vocal performances to be had here, but they can make you cringe for the wrong reasons. These come from the audio logs read from the majority of the characters. Despite adding in some much needed backstory and dimenson to the overall plot, the actors/actresses that comprised a good chunk of them just sound horrible; exhibiting a stale and wooden facade that wouldn't make you take the accounts of their circumstances seriously. (Like they just had some staff members ""read"" from the script and called it a day). There are a few exceptions, but don't play this game looking for some high quality voice-acting (though Shodan's voice actress REALLY make you fear her). For a time when voice acting wasn't a huge prevalent factor in video games, this is only a minor nit pick and shouldn't ruin the entire experience at all. The story is decent enough. It often felt a tad predictable and even ends on a mostly sour note for me, but the audio logs (that I mentioned earlier) really add a lot of depth to the game. The interaction you have with either the Maker or Shodan also adds a lot of character and fear amist the insults and ""praise?"" you receive. It's no wonder these were further implemented in future games, especially in the case of Irrational Games' later masterpiece series, Bioshock. Overall though, it's not a terrible story by any means. I just didn't find it that memorable. Where it gets it right, however, is with Shodan. She is, perhaps, one of the most frightening villians ever to be conceived. Yes, the idea of a artificial intelligence getting a corrupted conscious and trying to play God isn't new, but her dialogue and speech patterns are the things of future nightmares. The graphics, unfortunately, have not aged well. While the overall level design remains influential and well-designed, and a good portion of the creature and gun models do have a nice amount of detail to their design, the models look extremely outdated, displaying ugly, blocky textures. It also doesn't help that the game suffers from the occassional glitch and bug, especially in terms of enemies phasing through doors and objects as well as some you aren't even able to kill. Here's hoping that I was the only one who dealt with that inconsiderate predicament. There's hardly any complaints with the controls at all, as they felt intuitive and very responsive to the action. You may suffer from a hint of lag, however, when you try to jump.  This led me to a good amount of frustration in the long run. Other than that though, I was most pleased with how well it controled. Lastly, the gameplay aspect is where I felt the most conflicted. For one, it incorporates the standard first person shooter genre with the traditional gunplay. However, it also adds some character customization to the mix (thus giving forth its RPG elements). You can either become a battle hardened soldier with access to some top-gear guns, a Navy officer with a mastery over research, hacking, modification, and repair, an OSS soldier with mastery of Psionics (where it be shooting ice, pulling objects to you, or much more), or a combination of them all. You can upgrade your skills, as well as your overall stats, by collecting cyber Modules usually won for completeing a task (some can also be found). While this can lead to some diverse tactics and unique customization, I felt like it can often feel unbalanced. This is especially true if one wants to develop skills outside of their job choice, but I thought it held more leniency towards the Navy class. This is especially true for the most irritating aspect of the game: the weapon deterioation. Your weapon wears off and lacks functionality the more times you use it, and if you don't have much repair/modify skills (or disposal maintenace tools), you normally end up getting rid of the weapon and trying to find a spare one. Seriously though, this system seems way too unnatural as normal guns wouldn't break so easily. It also hurts that resources are quite limited. You have to rely on having good management on your resources because ammo, nanites (currency for buying supplies), hypos (either for medical, psi, brief stat boosts, etc) and more are scarce. If you waste your money too often, you may regret it when you end up running out of ammo, leading to a most unfriendly experience. While the enemy variety is most impressive, their intelligence almost leaves something to be desired. Yes, they can kill you in an instant if you're not properly prepared, but I sometimes just ran up to them and swung my wrench to easily defeat them. It's also not in the enemies' favors when they're often stuck in a loop where they can't get out of (walking towards a wall and keeping the pace, anyone?)In conclusion, while the ugly graphics, flawed gameplay elements, and lackluster ending sorta make the game for me too overrated, its stellar sound presentation, terrifying characters, interesting back stories, and overall control scheme still left me with a good impression, as it paved the way for influencing the games to come afterwards. Shodan, you sadistic hater of flesh. 7/10			"

												SYSTEM SHOCK 2 deserves way more attention than it gets. As somebody who hated Fps games, I can safely say that this game is a piece of art and was executed to the best intentions of consumers. The whole idea of system shock 2 is similar to system shock 1 but is executed a bit better. First of all the hud was better positioned to give the user a better idea of the systems that ensure the players survival. The log, audio messaging aspect of this makes the player responsible for driving the story and finding out what happened in the lauberstraum . Shodan altough not a menacing force she was in the first ss, still feels like a unstoppable force since she is basically your caretaker and enemy. The combat in system shock 2 is actually part of a rps like upgrade system so you can be a cyber psychic or a military unit.10/10 Beats half life 1 and 2, but 3?Definitely can give Ocarina of time a run for the best game of all time "

												System Shock 2 (aka the System Shock that people liked) has gained and maintained its reputation as one of the best videogames ever made for the past 16 years, and with good reason. It is worth your time, money, and attention.16 years later, and the aRPG mechanics have not lost their luster. Switching between the menu-driven GUI and FPS combat feels extremely natural, and with a little control-binding the scheme feels equally natural. While the graphics and aesthetic have been rendered antiquated, the mechanics haven't aged a day.Mechanics that are only matched by the brilliantly written dialogue and stellar sound design that remains rock-solid through the entire game. Goes to show that you can have catchy, memorable tunes in a horror game. The dialogue (though monologues would be a better fit, with more soliloquies than you could cast a play with) is intensely engaging, even spread through the 50 billion character drama plot threads that it has. All this delivered with maximum impact by the levels. A useless map aside, each level just as interesting as the last, each one a joy to explore, each one with it's own layout quirks and exultingly memorable aspects. These aspects cement it as the classic that it is. The rest of the aspects, though, are not all sunshine and daisies.System Shock 2's quality can be easily separated into two parts, which for conveniences sake we're going to going to name ""Pre-Rickenbacker"" and ""Post-Rickenbacker"". The bulk of the game takes place Pre-Rickenbacker, easily 9/10s of it.Not great in either stage are that the enemy variety peters out halfway through the game, Xerxes never rises above his role as an utterly forgettable antagonist (So much so that SHODAN steals the show as the antagonist, despite being allied with you for the majority of the game) and the random enemy spawns is just obnoxious, and occasionally outright grating.In those Pre-Rickenbacker 9/10s of game, the pacing is fantastic, a slow steady rise of power and stakes. The character drama mini-plots equally so, the diary-and-corpse-based delivery meaning that the chronological order of the events is such that you eventually catch up to them and see the climaxes played out before your eyes. The art direction shines because in spite of the dated models, the clean sci-fi look is explored on in so many different interesting ways that take advantage of the limitations.Post-Rickenbacker, the game takes on a new direction. Imagine that you're a child, sitting around a campfire as another kid tells a fantastic ghost story. The kid takes you through its twists and turns, the moment-to-moment memorability being so engrossing that it doesn't even occur to you that nothing has actually happened in the story proper. And right as the child gets to the crux of their character spinning and woven strands of fate, they takes out their arm and blow a 30-second long raspberry into it, the stunned, awkward silence of the audience capping off the performance. Art direction becomes an eyesore. Level design, forgettable. Boss fights, disastrous. The single new character story serves only as an exposition dump, as the game throws the same enemies you've been fighting since the midway point at you just to burn through accrued resources. Despite the 9/10s of game before it, (and despite it still being worth your time, money and attention, just to reiterate), the game gets bored, burns through the last of its budget, and throws its hands in the air limply while giggling - ending in one of the most hilarious examples of asset reuse ever seen.That's how System Shock 2 ends, not with a bang nor a whimper, but a muffled fart as a tuba plays in the distance.

												System Shock 2 is a ""cult"" game the way the film Silent Running is cult, many people have heard of it (in Sci-Fi anyway) few experienced it.  Plus System Shock 2 sold pretty badly back in the day and physical copies were hard to find.  But now you can remedy this gap in your gaming knowledge!Made by Looking Glass Studios (the first two Thief games) with music by Eric Brosius (ditto) System Shock 2 is the forerunner that influenced (among others) Deus Ex, Bioshock, Portal and Dead Space.  If you enjoyed any of these games I say give SS2 a shot.Numerous mods help improve music and texture quality for those put off by the screenshots, I'd particularly recommend SHMUP (improves music quality) and SHTUP (upgrades textures)  you can find them by searching for them in any search engine (maybe not Bing, I dunno =)It's pretty cheap anyway, but especially during a sale I'd call it a ""must have"".  SHODAN is one of the great computer game characters of all time.    "

												Since there are enough reviews considering the game, I will share some experience from multiplayer!No story spoilers inside, but some ingame mechanics will be discussed.First, get the better graphics mod! The vanilla player avatar looks disgusting!If you have not played this game before, play singleplayer first! Multiplayer is fun, but the scary mood will be gone. Besides... I found the game even harder in multiplayer. I am playing this with my buddy using a fake LAN (VPN) coop, since normal online coop is not possible. (We trick the system into believing it is a LAN using some software named ""tunngle"", just for those of you who want to try for themselves. It is made for LAN-only games and setup is doable. Just keep in mind that one player should host the virtual LAN, and ANOTHER player should host the multiplayer game. MUCH LESS bugs this way.)This game plays very differently with two people. Less scary, more fun. Combats are a little bit easier (just watch this friendly fire though!!!), but skill upgrade costs are very high. Forces you into hardcore roleplaying, since you must concentrate your efforts into buying the skills you really need. And with two people you absolutely need skills like repair, modify or maintenance. Not enough instant repair or instant modify items to supply 2 players! And certainly not enough ammunition to supply 2 players using the same gun! On the other hand one player will have the spare modules to buy alien and/or laser skill instead of standard weapons, something you will not see very often in singleplayer.And save often, multiplayer is a little (every 40 min on a bad day) buggy: upgrade modules vanish, out of sync, enemies wallhacking, just to name the gamebreaking ones. Fortunately, loading times are about 2 seconds.Still absolutely worth the experience, if only you get to use all this stuff you usually do not bother with in singleplayer.			"

												I bought this game in 1999 back when I was 11 years old, though I finally got the stones to fully make my way through the game when I was 17. I quit the game from fright several times, but kept coming back because I was determined to beat the terrors of the Von Braun. Since then I have returned to the game many times just so I could soak in the atmosphere of the game and face the evils from Tau Ceti V once again.System Shock 2 is a cyberpunk first person shooter with a good chunk of RPG elements. Elements such as inventory management, stats and different builds, and choices that affect your progress forward. There are also a survival aspect, it becoming more pronounced on the higher difficulties as combat gets deadlier.Several games have since then used similar themes and elements to great effect, so what makes this old timer so great? In my opinion it is the dread that the game instills in you, I haven't quite found a game that did it in a similar or quite as effective fashion. The player starts the game on the Von Braun some time after it has gone to hell and the Many has control. You end up feeling utterly alone on the Von Braun, light-years away from any semblance of help, while being sought out by the grotesque minions of The Many. You run around chasing your only lifeline and voice of reason in this whole mess, while wading through the sludge that used to be the crew of this ship only to sink deeper with every step. I remember feeling utterly crushed several times with the relevation that my struggles had only brought me more terrors to face.It is a superb game, but it is not without flaws. The latter part of the game gets less and less refined, most visible in the level design. As the game progresses the areas seem to get less and less polished, which is a shame as the details helpes alot with the atmosphere that makes this game great.  The Von Braun is largely well made for its time, but the Rickenbacker is bland, uninspiring and seems like it was rushed. The last stages of the game has some quite exotic themes and the technology of the time was perhaps not well suited for something as ambitious as these areas.Despite that, I recommend this game to everyone looking for a classic Survial Horror game.

												Quite simply this game is a cult classic, which started the genre, if you want a really graphically impressive game then this is somewhat dated for you.  However, if you're after something with a good story, well thought out gameplay, with nothing too complicated in the way of puzzles, the this is it!There's plenty of options for your plan of survival. There's loads of scary moments to be had too! You can be drawn into a situation where you're literally scared stiff with your 2 health, no ranged weapons, and just a melee weapon to get you to the next nanite pickup!All in all I love this game, with the mods the story expands, you'll get a lot of gameplay out of this game!

In the long-term, invest in Strength for melee damage and max inventory space and Standard weapons for proficiency in Pistols/Shotguns/Assault rifle. This is because Standard/Armor Piercing/Anti Personnel rounds handle most situations. Forget about exotic weapons.			"

												Absolutely fantastic game. This is a game that i have been meaning to play for a while, and i am so glad that i finally got around to doing it. I feel that a game that is very well known, and that has been around for around 17 years, there really isnt that much more left to say. This game is a classic, and one of the best games that i have played in a long time. It does have its flaws where it is VERY slow at the beginnig and stray you away from playing this game (it happened to me, i got 2 hours of steam time in and dropped it for over a year), but stick with it!Everything good that people have to say about it i competely agree with. I would say that there are only 3 bad things the game has:1. The slow beginning. I would have finished this game a year ago if the opening wasnt so slow, but it sets up the game nicely now that i went back and played it over again.2. You need patience. If you lack it this game will not be as fun for you. For example, i was stuck on a puzzle for about 2 hours (Hidden in the Masters puzzle D5), but that was mostly because i didnt realize what I was supposed to do and should have been solving the puzzle as i progressed. 3. The controls. Oh god the controls suck, rebind those things the second you start or you will suffer.I loved this game and will absolutely play it again in the near future. Also, even though it is not recommened for first time players, the Psi route is extremely fun and challenging. I did it on my first run and i had so much fun with it. 10/10!			"

												A classic game that I enjoyed immensely, but imo, it's not flawless. Your enjoyment of this game all depends on your playstyle. Though primarily a FPS, System Shock 2 lets you choose what ""class"" you want to play as. You can be a hacker, a soldier, a psi practioner, or a combination of all. Honestly, if you choose poorly and waste points, you won't fully enjoy this game. I generally play as a soldier class and much prefer to use traditional weapons in most of the games I play. That generally doesn't limit what I can do, but in System Shock 2, it does. For a long time in this game, you'll have to conserve your ammo and the wrench you get near the beginning will be your best friend. There will however be a point where you'll need to use your weapons and what little ammo you have. Since ammo is scarce, it's very easy to end up wasting your ammo on some enemy that could've been easily avoided or taken out with your wrench. This ended up happening to me numerous times and I'd have to reload to an earlier time in the game to ensure that my ammo was not irresponsibly spent. Bottomline, your playstyle will greatly affect how much you enjoy this game and some abilities are more OP/useful than others.Though I did greatly enjoy this game, there were moments when I simply wanted to finish playing the game as quickly as possible, or quit playing it. I've played games for most of my life and I consider myself to be a hardcore gamer, but I found this game to be tough for around 50% of the game. Honestly, it's because I mainly stuck to the soldier class instead of branching out and experimenting with the psi or hacking abilities. It was when I started to use a combination of all three that the game was no longer as tough as it previously was. I still wasn't able to run through this game, but it was much more managable. Besides your playstyle affecting this game, the atmosphere is immense and greatly adds to the experience. As if being surrounded by mutants and killer AI isn't bad enough, it's the lack of knowledge that truly scares you. You'll be low on ammo or psi points numerous times throughout this game, but there'll be moments when that's made even worse by what you hear, not what you see. At times you'll be running along trying to accomplish your current objective when you suddenly hear enemies you've faced before. You won't know how many there are or if they're truly there and that uncertainty is what adds to your fear. Lastly, some tips to better enjoy this game. 1) Save often and ensure that it's done between every 20-30 minutes. 2) Conserve ammo and psi points3) Use the wrench4) Try to research the best of the three playstyles to ensure that you have many options when dealing with obstacles.Overall, I can see why this game is thought of as influential. Not only did it help contribute to the hugely popular Bioshock series, it also brought forth the Deus Ex series. With the upcoming System Shock 3 and System Shock 1 remake, many gamers will soon come into contact with this classic and will hopefully enjoy it despite its flaws. I recommend this game, but I know it won't be enjoyed by everyone, it's a very niche game. Most will see it as a classic FPS and automatically connect it to Half-Life, but it's not that type of game. This game requires more management and thinking when it comes to overcoming the obstacles that are thrown your way. I give this game a 3.5/5.			"

												TL DR: System Shock 2 is really great. The RPG systems are broken and the game does drop in quality towards the later third, but the game has very good level design, allows several playstyles despite its systems being broken, and it's a really terrifying game at times. If you've played Bioshock, this is an insanely similar game (especially in terms of story structure) but in space, more atmospheric and with less consolisation.System Shock 2 is an FPS-RPG made by Looking Glass and Irrational Games in 1999. The game starts of with a pretty immersive character creation sequence, and something that I don't think I've seen in any other game: This sequence never goes through a menu to create your character. You basically enter through one of 3 doors each time, the first selecting your base ""class"" from Marines/Navy/OSA aka ""Pure FPS""/""Hacking FPS""/""Space Magic"", and then the following 4 sets of doors are presented as your training before the beginning of the game, each door giving you different stats, skills and Psi powers.This way of presenting character creation choices to the player is not without its issues. You can't check what stats do and guiding yourself through their names might end up on a crap character, since the game does have some trap options and it's going to be a bit before you can actually level up more skills. Apart from that, where the first System Shock allowed you to use any weapon as long as you had the ammo for it, the sequel restricts the use of every weapon except the wrench to a cretain level in a weapon skill. I mean, even though not any idiot can fire a weapon well, anyone can equip a shotgun. Overall, playing in Normal ended up in having my main stats maxed out (hacking/standard weapons/maintenance) fairly early on and dumping cyber modules (the game's version of skill points which are found throughout levels and given to you for completing objectives) into random stuff just for the heck of it.The game starts after this sequence with you waking up from cryosleep in the Von Braun, one of the first two ships outifitted with FTL tech, owned by TriOptimum (the same company who owned the Citadel Station and SHODAN in SS1.) The game starts on the Medical-Science Bay with no people alive, Hybrids and Monkeys. Hybrids are pretty creepy and will even shout at you and beg for you to kill them, and Monkeys are plain weird monkeys wiht the ability to shoot psi projectiles. You'll mostly use a wrench or maybe Psi powers for the first few levels, since weapons don't have a lot of ammo and are overall crap to maintain since they last about 100 shots before they break. Using maintenance kits can keep them working but these are expensive at the beginning and low maintenance skill means that you can only increase 1 or 2 points of durability every time you use them in a weapon, resulting in 10-20 more shots. This weapon degradation system is also a bit too much. This is overall a game where you should really hoard resources for the first few levels in order to handle to make the final parts easier, especially since enemies do respawn and using finite resources such as ammo so early can be a waste. Since after you find the appropriate medical station you can respawn for a small fee, it's mostly better to use your wrench to stagger most enemies to death and sometimes die while doing it.As this is a Shock game, you get the main objectives told to you with mostly minimal story exposition, and this exposition is of course given by audio logs. The voice acting in these can range from pretty good to pretty bad, since part seems to have been done from people who were just around the office. The main antagonists are superbly voice acted though, and one of them is of course iconic. They both have a similar characteristic where their voices are comprised of several different voices which can say a sentence in different tones and tempos, and this cacophony of voice is insane and overwhelmingly creepy. The game reaches a plot twist where one of these antagonists is revealed, but you can see it coming from a mile away, especially if you've played the first game and listened to some audio logs in the second. This doesn't mean that moment isn't one of my favourites in gaming!Levels in the Von Braun are well-designed, with fairly logical arrangement of space in a spaceship, though different from the first game's circular station. The game doesn't end at the Von Braun, and after that there's a drop in quality. Fortunately the game ends fairly quickly after that (1-2 hours). Not so fortunately is the ending, which feels like a blooper joke ending and was only there because there was no time/money to do a better cutscene. The game also baits a sequel which is only coming now, as the sales in 1999 were terrible (60k units sold) despite glowing praise from critics.Overall System Shock 2 was a fairly flawed but still great experience. I don't think I'll forget some of the voices from different enemies, and exploring the Von Braun was amazing. Definitely recommended.			"

												System Shock 2 will go down as a classic for computer RPGs and FPS Shooters. It offers an amazing level of customization to your style of play while bringing the player in a atmospheric and deep world with much to explore. It was scary back when it launched many years ago long before the days of steam and even today can still bring goose bumps. I recommend it to everyone as a game that offers something for everyone.

SystemShock2 on the other hand, if you don't upgrade your stats very carefully and save up on ammo and consumable items you will have a very hard time. The game gets harder as it goes, not easier.Both games have a problem with balancing difficulty. SS2 gets too hard. Bioshock gets too easy.Combat is hard. Weapons degrade and jam (weapons dont jam for enemies though which I find to be cheap). Weapons require specific stats to even be able to use them. Ammo is scarce. Inventory space is limited. Enemies seem to respawn (which can be very frustrating because it wastes your already limited resources). It can feel redundant at times since cameras set off alarms that spawn enemies.You cant sell items until much later in the game if you get a certain item.Special actions (hacking, repair, etc) uses up currency (aka Nanites). There is even a minigame to repair items. Failing a minigame results in an explosion, breaking or alarm depending on the object.The game doesn't hold your hands.

												I'm only a few hours into it, but I'm thoroughly impressed by this late 90s classic. There's a surprising amount of realism available. Firearms degrade with use (A bit quickly, granted, but it's still interesting to see a mechanic like that in such a relatively old game), and those stim pack things slowly improve your health as apposed to automatically switch you from severely wounded to mildly wounded, or mildly wounded to suddenly completely healthy. There's some mild parkour abilities, like holding space to grab onto a ledge at about chest height after a jump, and pull yourself up the rest of the way. There's the ability to level up VARIOUS different abilities/stats. Lots of food/drink/booze/cigarettes available, and there's also no regenerative ability (so far), which is cool. After all, how does one heal in seconds or minutes from blunt force trauma, funky psi attacks, or gunshot wounds? You have limited inventory space, which is larger or smaller depending on your strength.Oh, this game also doesn't hold your hand. Even on Normal difficulty, it's not an easy game. There's no arrows pointing you in the direction to go, and so far there isn't even a minimap. You have to wander around, start to become familiar with your surroundings, and try to manage your way to where you figure you have to go. Ammo is also QUITE scarce, so try to conserve what you can. Luckily there's surgical table things that are automated, and they're scattered around the area. Not very common, however they only cost you 5 nano-whatsits, which is essentially money, so it's worth it to use one if you find yourself under half health.The atmosphere is very well done, the graphics are dated of course, but not exactly an eyesore. The story thus far is quite engaging, I find myself enjoying the game immensely in spite of the difficulty and lack of in-game assistance, and I look forward to finding out more. Searching new areas is always enjoyable because you never know what stuff you might find, and you can also backtrack to previous areas if you like. I have kind of an OCD where I have to do things in sequence; I've owned this game for months, but didn't play it because I wanted to find the first one. Finally I decided to give it a try, and I'm glad I did. I was missing out. I don't know what else to say about the game other than that I am really enjoying it. If you enjoy survival horror games, then I advise you to check this out. Even if you're not into using firearms, there's different ways of defending yourself. Different modes of attack, as it were. There's even select fire capabilities, kinda lol Anyways, I look forward to playing it more and seeing how the story turns out. If you don't minds somewhat dated late-90s graphics, enjoy FPS games, survival horror, and the ability to upgrade your character to your own play style, then I truly believe you'll come to enjoy this experience as much, or possibly even more, than I am.

												Definately a hall-of-famer, it's one of those games that is remembered fondly years later, and was worth putting on Steam :)If you've played the early Deus Ex or Thief games and liked them, I suspect you'll like this too. Good storyline and atmosphere, the graphics are a bit dated though, and the polygon count is appropriately low, but you can forgive this in a game released in 1999.No game is for everyone, and this is from a generation of games setting new standards, so while it may seem like it's lacking in features, or has a tired storyline, it is in fact a game that has been often copied in those respects.I've played this game through several times over the years, and I rarely bring myself to complete games more than once. I'd definately recommend this game for what it is, and if it's on sale, even better - who wouldn't want to buy a classic for less than the price of a pint! :)			"

												Do you like Bioshock? well this is its Grand Daddy. System shock 1 was a great rpg but a terrible fps. System Shock brings back everything the first one did right and improved every single aspect. This game inspired many of the recent loved RPGFPS we see today, distopian future where something goes wrong.Played this in the 2000s and now after so many years i bought the steam version (this one actually is the more stable one, being GoG the second best).This game is ageless, even thought its graphics are not up to today standards, modding comunity makes it and revitalizes its visuals.Not an easy game to slip into comfortly, it needs studying, patience, reading and its sometimes slow paced. Combat is great, the animations still suffer a nip of stiffness nevertheless.This game has one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) plot twist in the whole gaming industry and any industry in general.If you respect yourself as one person who enjoys quality gaming you NEED this game. This game set up the bar REALLY high for this genre and few if any, have reached its amazing ideas and novelty. And most of all remember this is 15 years old right here. In some way it reminds me of Metropolis from the 20s, also ageless.NOT for the running spraying type, this needs patience and thinking.			"

												Electric Boo-ga-loo music seems out of place for a horror game, it makes you more afraid that the game is going to change pace and morph into a rythm game, but sadly it never does. I give Bioshock Space Marine an A plus out of a total of 95 points.  (thats a pretty good score if you can't tell)			"

												If you want to play a more in-depth Bioshock with a better story and more fleshed out lore play System Shock 2. There's an Incredible amount of flexibility in Character skills and proficiencies, the sound design and music is unparalleled for a game from 1999. There's also uneasy feeling and atmosphere that System Shock 2 provides all times to keep you immersed throughout the game.			"

												If you enjoy eerie games of the 90s, System Shock 2 is the perfect game for you. You are an unnamed soldier given cybernetic upgrades after being recruited as a crew member of U.S.S Iforgotthenameoftheship (sorry). Your recruitment is essential, as it gives tutorials of the different play-styles (guns, technology, and psionics) and, more importantly, your customization options. You're given 3 classes, or rather careers: Marines, Navy, and OSA members. Marines are your standard class if you want to have a run 'n gun experience. Navy Seals specialize in hacking and strength, and OSA members specialize in Psionic abilities. Customization options continue depending on ""missions"" you take during a ""tour"" preparing for your career while aboard the ship. I quote these terms because they are not actual missions filled with action, merely filler explanations as to why you start with certain skills. After performing a your ""tours"" for three years you are upgraded in your cybernetic form and placed in a cryo pod, only to wake up to ship-wreck crawling with parasite-human hybrids and monkeys. This is where the gameplay begins. It resembles a survival horror game at first, with your only weapon being a bloody wrench. Soon you will discover nanites, or currency, data logs, and cybernetic modules. Data Logs actually contain quintessential information for learning more about the game's story. I actually enjoy listening to them, as they add a new layer of depth to the game. Listening to the logs of now deceased crew members is awfully eerie, meaning that this game is fulfilling its purpose in trying to make the player immersed in an uncomfortable fashion. Cybernetic Modules are the experience points of the game, allowing you to upgrade skills or psionic abilities. These, however, come far and few between, and you have to be prepared to make certain decisions regarding upgrading your skills at upgrade stations because said upgrades are permanent. Do not, I repeat, do not spread your skill points thin. You won't have enough to make it beyond mediocre. The general atmosphere of the game is very creepy and unsettling. What makes it even more unsettling is the fact that game is set in space, the setting one would least suspect as a subject for horror. Thoughts of a starship exploring the vastness of space usually leaves one with a sense of pride and overall positive thoughts. But this is no U.S.S Enterprise voyage accompanied by Captain Jean Luc Picard himself, or anyone for that matter. You're essentially alone, left to fend off against twisted creatures that were once human, and, more importantly, the highly intimidating, highly intelligent, highly creepy computer AI known as SHODAN. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is she creepy. Once in a while, when you least expect it, she'll begin a short monologue describing how much inferior you are. Her voice is mangled, fluctuating between an almost human, female tone and a demonic, twisted, deep voice. I almost jumped when she first spoke. I can safely say that the gunplay is alright, but it is clunky. If you're skill set does not have strong Maintenance, you will discover that guns break quickly, which really gets annoying at times. Furthermore, ammo either runs out quickly, or they cost too many nanites at dispensers (the equivalent to shops). This could either be a good or bad thing. The advantage of limited, expensive ammo is that it adds to the survival-horror element of the game, as it forces the player to conserve ammo and strategize how to plan their next move. The disadvantage is that it can be near impossible to progress without it, especially later in the game when there are more long-ranged threats. Luckily your psionic abilities counter this problem, if you're skilled. Psionic abilities essentially feed off of an energy meter, granting you super powers of sorts. They can come handy, such as the defense and cryokinesis (basic attack) abilities. It definitely adds to the otherwise sketchy combat. My biggest problem with the game, however, is your inventory interface. The game does not pause while it's up, which leads to many problems. For instance, the only way to switch weapons is to manually do so through the inventory interface. Now imagine that you run out of ammo for a particular weapon while a few hybrids are chasing you down. You don't have enough time to manually switch weapons before being clubbed to death by the hybrids. But you have to switch weapons if you don't want to lose progress being forced to run back. Furthermore, enemies respawn, meaning that if you visit an old area you might run into even more hybrids and monkeys. There is absolutely nothing you can do except die. I tried switching weapons in a similar scenario and managed to survive, only with 11 hit points and no health packs or healing station in sight. It was even against one basic hybrid while I had armor on. To top it all off, when I made it back, there was another hybrid, waiting for me. The enemy-respawn and user hostile inventory interface add questionable difficulty.If you're a newcomer to this game, like I am, I warn you that this is a very difficult game, even on the normal difficulty. However, System Shock remains as one of the more positively sophisticated and creepy games I have ever played, a game that still deserves to be critically acclaimed by many. Just turn off the music while playing; it ruins the creepy atmosphere.			"

												The BAD:    Dated graphics. Silly user interface. The Bioshock follow up tarnishes its reputation. Those are the only bad things you can say about this game. The GOOD:    Survival horror/ RPG blend that works perfectly in the first person. Replayability. HARD. Thick atmosphere. True feelings of isolation. Memorable antagonist. Tension, lots of survival horror tension. Different difficulties that don't just make enemies bullet sponges. The SOUND! The Voice acting. The GAME! All of theses combined make a powerful user experience.The BOTTOM LINE:   Labled as one of the greats, it deserves all of the praise. Ahead of its time. Things found in this game are present in the DNA of many other games released after it. A classic and timeless. A worthy experience to be played and played again later.			"

												One of my favorite games of all time, love it to death. I forgot to do a review for it and its been awhile since I played it. System shock 2 is moody, atmospheric, interesting, tense and horrifying. Its a hybrid FPSRPG game that rewards players for exploration and completing objectives opposed to killing enemys for more XP. There are various ways to play the game and all playstyles are valid as long as you specalize.  Its a far superior game to bioshock by far, for the RPG and horror fans out there you owe it to yourself to play this game!!			"

												System Shock 2 takes place a few decades after its predecessor. The stories aren't directly related so don't worry about jumping straight into this one. The first took place on Citadel Station, where an AI named SHODAN, stripped of her ethical restrictions, went batshit crazy with dreams of Godhood. She failed. Fast-forward 40-some years and you play a soldier on the maiden voyage of a FTL spaceship, built by the same company who was responsible for Citadel Station - TriOptimum. You wake up after cryo-sleep and, conveniently, suffer from amnesia - the favorite theme of infinite game developers world-wide. Needless to say, something bad is happening on board, but I'll leave the rest for you to find out in game. It reminded me a bit of Dead Space (or, rather, the other way around - if I had played the games by their chronological release), but it isn't a jump-scare ""horror"" game as I was led to believe. Creepy, yes. Disturbing, indeed. But it's not frightening in that traditional sense of changing your underwear. There aren't shocking twists and turns in the plot - no wheel is reinvented in this sci-fi space crisis. If you're approaching this at 2014 after being around the gaming and movie block for a while, you'll probably be familiar with most of the developments. You probably know SHODAN as the iconic villain from the game that is well-loved (out of character). I'm sorry for the upcoming blasphemy, but I didn't find her too different from the generic granduer-obsessed villain. Maybe it's because I'm playing this game 15-years late and I've been exposed to all sorts of antagonists. Maybe I'm just a dim-witted gamer who can't see the sophistication. She did have some shining moments, however, that made me realize that this is one messed-up cyber girl. And while my remarks here might make it seem as if I consider the game bland, that isn't the case. I enjoyed the ride, just more due to the gameplay rather than the story (which is the other way around with BioShock: Infinite).I played System Shock 2 after the BioShock trilogy and was immediately surprised. The amount of gameplay functions was a bit overwhelming at first, especially when you're used to modern gaming standards. I won't list these said functions down because I don't think it'll make any sense to a reader who hasn't played the game. You need to experience it to understand. After the tutorial and an hour or so into the campaign, however, I got the hang of it. More or less. Once I grasped the basics, the further I got into the game the more I felt a growing regret about how criminally streamlined the last installment in the BioShock series - Infinite - is, compared to its ancient ancestor. Now, I ike BioShock: Infinite, I really do. But it pains me to think how magnificent it could have been if it maintained some of SS2's complexity in RPG mechanics.If you've played the BioShock trilogy you'll quickly notice the shared DNA. Shock 2 has the audio recordings you probably like (I certainly do) that help tell the story. It has its ""magic"" abilities (like Plasmids and Vigors), it has hacking of security cameras and turrets, it has vending machines, it has research of enemies, it has big maze-like levels that make you open your map time and time again - and as I wrote earlier, it has a lot more than that; things I enjoyed a helluva lot that I wish were in later games, too. The RPG is strong in this one. From ability scores to expertise in different sorts of weapons, this game offers you much more than your average shooting (which is good, considering shooting in 99's standard isn't as exciting and challenging as it is today).Actually, I should confess about the challenge - I started out on Nightmare (the last out of four difficulty levels), and early on lowered it to Easy. I know, I know. ""A filthy casual."" Maybe it's becuase I didn't have a lot of time per day to play and didn't want to waste what little of it I had respawning and refighting the same fights. Maybe I didn't enjoy the combat mechancis of a 15-year-old game. Maybe it was just honestly too tough for me. Maybe a bit of all, or something else entirely. I can speculate that on Nightmare this game truly /is/ a challenge. Your HP is extremely lessened, I suspect enemies do more damage, and every upgrade requires many more ""Cybernetic Modules"" (think of them as XP points you find throughout the game). Maybe one day I'll replay it as a different class (I went for a Tech\Hacker sort) on the highest difficulty, because SS2 certainly has replay value between a Tech focused character or a ""Magic"" (Psi) one. But it is not this day.Speaking of 90s game - the graphics are, obviously, dated. However, I played it with mods which made the game look surprisingly pleasant and I strongly suggest Googling quickly for some prime graphical enhancements. System Shock 2 is a brilliant game whose age isn't half as felt as you might expect it to be, and shockingly offers more complexity than many modern products. A creepy sci-fi setting with an iconic villain, complex RPG mechanics while still capable of being played as a shooter, and a challenge to be found if you have the patience for it. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the BioShock trilogy in particular, and FPS-RPG games that amount to more than taking cover and shooting in general.			"

The gameplay is in between Half-Life and Deus-Ex.The settings are what make this game so good, the music and sounds are stunning and the universe reminds of Alien, Virus and other Space movies from the 90's.Took me 22hrs to beat it by exploring everything and playing safe.It's definately a game I'll remember for a long time...Enjoy !

												I've just bought this on steam - no hours logged on steam itself but I've played this game on and off since it came out (1999)  Look at you, hacker: a pathetic creature of meat and bone, panting and sweating as you run through my corridors. How can you challenge a perfect, immortal machine? This is, simply put, one of the best games ever created.  Have you played Deus Ex?  I hope you have because this is the only game that I'd put on the same level (and is fairly similar in some respects).  FPS-RPG cyberpunk horror pulled off with as much aplomb as you're likely to ever encounter.  This is a real gem from Looking Glass Studios, made before the time when all devs were interested in was jumping on a band wagon, creating something pretty and legging it with your cash.  This game is a psychological work of art.  In terms of surprises, in terms of being genuinely disturbing, in terms of thoughtfulness, in terms of storyline, in terms of music, in terms of voice acting, and in terms of really ""making you feel it,"" this game is the dog's bollo*ks.  The only thing that's aged is the quality of the graphics but it's a masterpiece even if you don't bother installing the excellent community graphics updates.Do you not trust the feelings of the flesh? Our biology yearns to join with yours. We welcome you to our mass. But you puzzle us. Why do you serve our mother? How can you choose cold metal over the splendor of the flesh? But you fear us. We hear your thoughts, and they rage for your brothers who you believe dead. But they are not. They sing in our symphony of life. We offer another chance to join us. If you choose to lie down with the machine, we will rend you apart, and put you separate from the joys of the mass.It's gonna drag you in and sh*t you right up, guaranteed.

												One of the best first-person RPG's ever made. This is better than its forebearers in almost every way, that is except for visuals and if thats the only reason you play video games than maybe you need to get your head checked. The atmosphere and overall feel of this game is one of urgency and dread. Whenever I hear a hybrid muttering or growling to itself, I nervously start looking for its source, deciding which weapon or psi-power to dispatch the threat with. Later on you encounter more horrifying opponents. If you like horror, strong story elements, and a progression system that actually makes you feel like your choices matter, System Shock 2 is for you. There are mods available to update the graphics some but I feel they're unnecessary. The game will speak for itself, you just have to step through the door==of your cryo-pod.			"

												Unique experience of surviving on the giant spaceship vanquished by mad artificial intelligence. Blood-chilling atmosphere and elaborate hardcore gameplay with dozens of interesting features. System shock 2 is a sci-fi FPS-RPG horror that is still exciting after 17 years since release. Iconic game and an absolute must-play.			"

												hey ♥♥♥♥er do you like WORMS because ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if system shock 2 doesn't have a ♥♥♥♥ton of worms in itdid you know worms have TEETH. apparently in system shock 2 they do. and you have to platform from worm tooth to worm tooth which should be fun, right?? the late 90s and early 2000s were the ♥♥♥♥ing hey day of fun 3d platforming, right?? the nintendo 64 was a thing, and god knows how many 3d platformers there were on the N64. no. turns out the platforming in this game, actually ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. it's literally the worst thing in the game. but honestly, honestly, it's the only complaint i can muster for the game.the rest is good, solid closed-circle survival horror in SPACE. how do you ♥♥♥♥ that up. you don't. unless you do, but that's not the point. play this game if you like worms.

												One of the best first-person RPG's ever made. This is better than its forebearers in almost every way, that is except for visuals and if thats the only reason you play video games than maybe you need to get your head checked. The atmosphere and overall feel of this game is one of urgency and dread. Whenever I hear a hybrid muttering or growling to itself, I nervously start looking for its source, deciding which weapon or psi-power to dispatch the threat with. Later on you encounter more horrifying opponents. If you like horror, strong story elements, and a progression system that actually makes you feel like your choices matter, System Shock 2 is for you. There are mods available to update the graphics some but I feel they're unnecessary. The game will speak for itself, you just have to step through the door==of your cryo-pod.			"

												Having never played any game in the System Shock series in my life or heard of it until rather recently, I came into it with an incredible level of skepticism. My fear was that everyone was looking through rose-tinted glasses and blinding themselves to design flaws or serious issues with the game, something I feel like a lot of old games suffer from unfortunately. While there are issues with this game, I'm going to start with the positives. The level design for each area is incredible, my playthrough was completely blind and I forgot entirely about the map, I never used it once, which is a good thing. Each area had distinct objects or looks, so I never really found myself wondering where I could possibly be or where anything was. Each time I entered a different room, I knew exactly where I was and where any room I had been to previously was in relation to it.On top of that, each level is very large and still seamlessly connected. Any loading screens I found myself staring at were only there for a mere moment before I was on the other side and ready to go. On to the atmosphere, it deserves the praise it gets from all of its fans. The game works incredibly hard to build up a feeling of isolation while at the same time enemies in the form of rogue robots or horrific monstrosities are crawling out of every crack in the wall. While playing I had never felt so alone and yet so outnumbered and overwhelmed at the same time while being so desperate to meet up with even one friendly face. Even the enemies manage to be worthy of fear, their appearances combined with the amount of damage they do and the voice lines that they had lended multiple reasons to fear them. Failing that they usually had the element of surprise on top of everything else, which is extremely difficult to predict unless you're slowly walking along, listening for them and even that doesn't work sometimes.The combat, oh the combat. I can't possibly say enough about it, there are so many ways to approach a fight in almost every situation. Especially if you manage to sneak up on them, run in guns blazing as some arms specialist. Cave in their skulls with blunt force trauma and brute strength as a melee specialist. Freeze, burn, drain, hypnotize or sneak around them, invisible, as a Psionic specialist. And that's if you even want to fight them, if you decide you want to save whatever ammo you can for a necessary fight so you devise some skiddish guerilla-warfare fighter that leans more on hacking and utility skills while using a light combination of combat abilities then go for it. Almost no fight in the game is absolutely necessary as you can outrun and hide from almost any foe in the game. Not to mention what you choose to be best in actually changes your playstyle in a significant fashion.The hyper endurant marine might be able to stand there and keep shooting enemies while staying alive off of pure testosterone and gunpowder. But due to their physical focus they will definitely suffer when it comes to situations that call for hacking or researching, which can put them in some very bad spots. Whereas the Psionic specialist has all of the strength of a wet noodle and the endurance of tissue paper, but their intelligence will come in handy when hacking, or researching and at the same time present a completely different form of danger and combat prowess. Rather than just being the same old marine that just shoots guns and has a way to shoot guns in a slightly different way to shoot guns that could possibly be more effective. A problem that many mutiplayer games suffer from today.The story was great, in my opinion. While there were certain points where I found myself questioning things just a little, it was never enough to put me off of it. The length was perfect, long enough to keep me invested to the end so I could see how it turns out, yet not so long that it felt drawn out and wore out its welcome. It was one of the few times in gaming that when I was coming up to the finale I felt a genuine sense of climax and when it finished I was satisfied with it, despite the ending being a teasing cliff hanger. Right, now what was bad about it? For one, anyone who is new to the game will likely be met with the point where reality slaps them in the face hard and they discover that they've been specializing themselves wrong and now can't progress any further in the game. Forcing a restart. Which can be extremely frustrating to those who would like to simply play the game through rather than just get to the 70% mark over and over again. I had been warned about this so, despite knowing it had the potential to completely ruin the game for me, I entered a cheat that maximized my statistics permanently. Still wanting to have the best experience I possibly could, I cranked the difficulty to impossible for my run through. I will admit that having max stats from the starting gate did cheapen the game in some areas, but the difficulty made up for it.While playing through the game and encountering as much as I did, I couldn't shake the feeling that the game had been partially designed with co-op in mind. Intended to have people of various skillsets so they would have to work as a team to cover those in areas where their particular skillset isn't helpful and letting those same ones take the lead when the situation changes. This would be a good thing, especially since the Steam version came with multiplayer modded into the game, were it not for the fact that co-op almost ruins a key part of the game. Atmosphere. Having a partner or partners around, living breathing reinforcements, denies any sense of isolation and can seriously dampen the psychological games the game tries to play with you. That said, I highly recommend the co-op play, it brings a very unique approach to team-based cooperation and is still very fun. Just play the game by yourself first, don't deny yourself the gem that is the atmosphere.For all the good I gushed out about the combat there are flaws, not deal-breaking ones but flaws nonetheless. The AI at times can create issues that range from silly to annoying, either spotting you through a corner of a wall and shooting at you or setting off an alarm, which thank heavens is an extremely rare occurrence. At the same time, the AI can prove to be rather dumb. I think that it was amazing for it's time, but there are instances where you'll walk right up behind a cyborg assassin and rub up against him even and he will refuse to notice you unless you walk right around in front of him. This is slightly more common though not by much, but when it does happen it fortunately ellicits a smirk and a little giggle due to the small levity it usually creates.On a final note, I think the melee enemies suffer greatly in this game, even without any real points in my agility it's almost insultingly easy to dodge an enemy melee attempt due to their usually extended and overlong attack animations. Even from the lategame melee enemies, if you have any agility at all it turns them into a joke, a game of how many times can you run up and juke back to watch them hit the empty air. This can happen anywhere and everywhere with any enemy melee attack in the game, which is a little sad. If it were up to me I would have someone shorten the animations or rework them entirely so enemies that try to knock your lights out present a legitimate threat to more than just the people who got stuck in the corner with them. This is my biggest issue with the game at present, but that said, it's still a rather minor problem and more of a gripe than anything. I still highly recommend this game to everyone who is interested in receiving a unique and very fun take on FPS horror.			"

												System Shock 2 is an extremely vast, high-fantasy RPG set in the fictional land of Azeroth. Players can band together to complete quests throughout the game world and in instanced dungeons or raids. There are two main factions, the Horde and the Alliance, which are in a state of constant war (and thus divide the server.). Player-versus-Player combat is available in preset battlegrounds, arena areas, and contested world zones.			"

												The thing about this game is that it doesn't rely on jump scares, hell even the graphics are pretty outdated, but you see that not what horror games should rely on. This game has TERRIFIC voice acting, and what i mean by that is TERRIFYING voice acting. The voice acting and sound design MAKE this game scary and it gives you the feeling of survival, rather than action *coughResidentEvil6cough*. I wish more games would be patient and take the time to set up the atmosphere rather than take shortcuts with cheap jump scares. The only jump scares you get are the ones you create YOURSELF, simply because you don't check behind enough times. Lastly, if Time splitters is to goldeneye, then Bioshock is to System shock 2, and those games are timeless.			"

												In my opinion this game deserves way more praise than Bioshock, just a lot of people don't know about this amazing game. Bioshock 1 is System Shock 2 with a different coat of paint, even how the story progresses and plot twists are almost the sameOverall the game has a lot of gameplay mechanics, RPG elements, and really optimize keyboard and mouse controls for the interface and couple different playstyles. Although navigating the inventory can take some time to get use too. The difficulty can be challenging even the easy difficulty. As a survival horror game, this game is very creepy (as long as the music is on mute) The main antagonist Shodan is one the best villians I have every seen that she just taunts you through the entire game and sounds creepy as well. If you love Bioshock you will love this even more and let people know about this masterpiece, also there are plenty of mods online that can make this game look great			"

												System shock 2 is a game that was made well ahead of it's time in my opinion. It is one of the best shooters i have played so far, and it will keep you on the edge of your seat. With a great sound system, a menacing antagonist who will occasionally appear to make you feel more uncomftorable than you thought possible (and then some), and some nice level design, there is alot about this game the developers did right. There is an average variety of enemies who can, at times, prove a real challenge and some controls that you will have to get used to. However, once you look past that, there's not much bad about this game. With the main setting in space on a ship that has been through everything you can imagine, there are several sectors that you will get to explore, very nice level design, and sound that goes along great with the enviornments of the game. Shock 2 also has a nice RPG element to it, with three classes to master, which are the Psychic, Soldier, and Hacker. These classes come in handy in situations from fighting enemies to outsmarting complex security systems. The game's story is nice too, with some twists that will leave you astounded, and an interesting back story that will keep you wanting more. With all of this in one game, i would say the only real flaw is the textures of the characters and levels. However, this is a minor flaw at that, and with everything else to make up for it (and considering the time it was made), this game is a must-have for survival-horror fans and shooter fans alike.

												It surely was a shock to the system and me when i got an error saying your graphics card is not supported for 1080p and this is with a titan x that only does 4k and beyond so yeah 2 shocks confirmed.I just had to restart the game and it was fixed as for the game in general i found the map designs to be brutal its so badly done and confusing i think according to the interwebs it says this is a classic but i just dont see it but since it gave me a good giggle from that graphics error im gonna gave this a high five ya dig.

												An earlier game by the makers of Bioshock.Imagine Bioshock but with outer space instead of the ocean, cybernetic implants instead of ADAM, psychic powers instead of plasmids, a computer instead of Frank Fontaine, a biologial version of the Borg instead of Andrew Ryan, and nanites instead of dollar bills.  Also, Bridgette Tanenbaum is some French woman, the pace is slower (for more of a survival horror feel; think Dead Space), and character development choices are permenant.So essentially, Bioshock is this but not in space.

												System shock 2 is a game that was made well ahead of it's time in my opinion. It is one of the best shooters i have played so far, and it will keep you on the edge of your seat. With a great sound system, a menacing antagonist who will occasionally appear to make you feel more uncomftorable than you thought possible (and then some), and some nice level design, there is alot about this game the developers did right. There is an average variety of enemies who can, at times, prove a real challenge and some controls that you will have to get used to. However, once you look past that, there's not much bad about this game. With the main setting in space on a ship that has been through everything you can imagine, there are several sectors that you will get to explore, very nice level design, and sound that goes along great with the enviornments of the game. Shock 2 also has a nice RPG element to it, with three classes to master, which are the Psychic, Soldier, and Hacker. These classes come in handy in situations from fighting enemies to outsmarting complex security systems. The game's story is nice too, with some twists that will leave you astounded, and an interesting back story that will keep you wanting more. With all of this in one game, i would say the only real flaw is the textures of the characters and levels. However, this is a minor flaw at that, and with everything else to make up for it (and considering the time it was made), this game is a must-have for survival-horror fans and shooter fans alike.

The fact that so many websites still name 'The Legend Of Zelda' as ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" gaming series ever only tells you how far video games still are from becoming a serious art. Music critics have long recognized that the greatest musicians of all times are Beethoven, John Coltrane and The Velvet Underground, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Film critics rank the highly controversial Stanley Kubrick over talentless hacks like Christopher Nolan who is highly popular with folks around the world. Game critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Legend Of Zelda sold more than everything else (not true, by the way), therefore it must have been the greatest. Music critics grow up listening to a lot of music of the past, movie critics grow up watching a lot of motion pictures of the past. Gaming critics are often totally ignorant of the video games of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that The Legend Of Zelda did anything worthy of being saved.In a sense, The Legend Of Zelda is emblematic of the status of game criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena (be it Call Of Duty or Minecraft) and too little to the merits of real developers. If somebody creates the most divine gaming experience but no major publisher picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of game critics will ignore him. If a major publisher picks up a game which is as stereotyped as can be but launches it worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on said game. This is the sad status of gaming criticism: The 'journalists' are basically publicists working for major publishers, distributors and multimedia stores. They simply highlight what product the industry wants to make money from.Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great video game like System Shock 2, which never sold much, and commercial products like The Legend Of Zelda. At such a time, game critics will study their gaming history and understand which developers accomplished which feat, and which simply exploited it commercially. "

												Imagine having sex with a woman, you naturally will be thinking about how easy games are nowadays and how you wish games would have engaging atmospheres. System Shock 2 is the answer to your thoughts while having sex with a woman. This atmospheric Action Sci-Fi Survival FPS RPG is the greatest gaming experience I have had in a long time. There is a reason games try to emulate the feeling that System Shock 2 invokes, because it is an amazing experience. So next time you're having sex with a lady, think of System Shock 2, I know I will.-Jesus Chris			"

												Playing this game for the first time in 2015 -- I recommend it very strongly to fans of FPSs, RPGs, and space horror. There are so many great aspects to this game that I will break my rule and compile a list:It requires and rewards exploration of diverse levels and environments. Everywhere you turn there is something you either need or want... or fear. There is some degree of backtracking, but that's part of the fun: as you explore more of the game world you progressively understand how it all connects together. I got quite emotional when I had to go back to the areas in which I started! So much had happened since then. *weeps gently*Nicely balanced skill-based character progression. Decisions you make on how to upgrade your abilities have very real consequences. Not only that, but there are paths you can choose leading to very different gameplay styles, thus allowing for some very nice replayability. On my first play, I focused on melee weapons and hacking skills. It would be quite a different game the next time I play it, focusing on psionics.Careful loot management: you never know when something might come in handy. Luckily, you can stash it and come back to it later... although it might not be so easy to get back. To help you out, it's possible to put markers on the map with your own custom text: a very practical and logical little feature that I hope other games would mimic.An engaging story that reveals itself slowly throughout the game via superbly produced audio logs, as well as environmental clues. The story is spooky as hell. The characters are not well developed, but there's enough details that you can get attached to them, even though you never quite get to meet them in the game. Or do you...?The game has aged very well, but you might want to install NeutralX2's mod pack for more up-to-date visuals. (Nothing very fancy, but at least it looks better for contemporary screen resolutions.)And it's hard, very hard in some areas. I played on ""normal"" difficulty and still got quite a challenge. It never got unfair or frustrating, though, so if you're feeling up to it, move your mouse away from ""easy""!If I have any criticisms, they're about the physics system: it's awful. Running and jumping around swinging sword-like objects can get a bit clunky (and even buggy) at times.But that's really petty criticism. This is a very fun and satisfying game, as well as an important piece of gaming history.I'd like to thank the developer for the effort of releasing a Linux version. Unfortunately, their release did not work for me. (It's based on WINE, by the way.) However, I could play it just fine on Linux using CrossOver and Steam for Windows.			"

												I think System Shock I---not II---is my favorite game of all time. It was a (nearly!) full-fledged sci-fi horror RPG-FPS hybrid built around story telling and delivering a creepy atmosphere. On top of that, it included finding logs, a lot of backtracking and puzzling too, and making choices what to carry using your clumsy inventory and the worst user-interface since VI. The game has since been updated and is currently in full reboot; I look forward to this game enormously.System Shock II moves along similar lines, but as you might have guessed, is not my favorite game of all time. But. It is still a great experience and I'd certainly recommend you to try it as it is a stepping stone leading up to other games such as Bioshock, Dead Space, or Alien Isolation. So I know that there are many RPG games such as Dragon Age and Skyrim (actually played the former) and these games are far more elaborate, but for some reason the scifi genre appeals to me much more than the fantasy genre; I like firing lasers and handgrenades more than shooting arrows and casting spells.The RPG element in Shock II is more a nice attempt than an actual RPG though. From the start of the game you can select three classes but that results in a difference only in the first half hour of the game. The tech-guy with all the hacking is interesting, but after a while you use your PSI skills (i.e., the wizard) to do pretty much anything. I recommend playing as the PSI guy.System Shock II, like its predecessor, is heavily story driven and the RPG system has matured; slightly. However, there are a few items that, in my opinion, did not make it such a great game to me as Shock I. Mainly, while Shock I would offer you an entire new level to explore, Shock II's level design is much more linear. Like Bioshock most levels are mostly a very long hallway with a few side branches to explore. To me, this resulted in not feeling like you are on a single space ship, rather a collection of levels. There were no new doors or elevators that would transport you to a part of a previous level giving you that ""so that is how you get here"" feeling. A degree of backtracking was involved though with too many items you could not take with you, in particular the many chemicals you needed to research enemy parts and organs for damage bonuses and advice.The second main disappointment of the game is that after a while you need to leave all of that behind as you enter the second space ship (the space ship you are in is actually two space ships; perhaps this is why it never felt that you are on a single space ship?) and work your way through lesser level design towards a most unsatisfactory end. But by that time you've experienced several memorable moments and revelations---and admittedly, the kind that were never in Shock I---and that you so liked so much in the Bioshock series.But what made the game really great (especially compared to Bioshock) is that everything you need is in very, very short supply and the sound design is really wonderful. It's not as if you need to really plan ahead, but it will make you thread more carefully and forces you to use the right type of weapon on the various enemies you encounter. I remember spending a lot of time ferrying over items that I could not keep in my inventory (or that I had to unlock) and storing them in the only safe place in the game: the elevator.  I would not have to backtrack so much, avoiding areas were cyborg nurses who sing to eggs and try ripping out your spine keep respawning. On my old PC I played the game on first it took about half a minute to reload after dying, so elevator collecting made great deal of sense at the time.			"

												Incredible story, checked this one out because it was the studio that made Bioshock and I'd heard incredible things about it, and it did not disappoint.  Few things:PROS: -Amazing storyline. A dark, complex story that holds up, had me looking for as many audio logs as I could to get more of the backstory and to discover the fate of different crewmembers-Character development was excellent (not so much for your mute character) considering the only interaction with a lot of the characters on the Van Braun was through audio logs. Observing how some descended to madness while others struggled for survival was fascinating. The development of the antagonists was also spectacular, and I saw why SHODAN is considered an all time video game antagonist.-Weapon variety and enemy variety are both solid-Playthrough time was excellent, really a substantial game that though long, never drags in terms of interest. -Also, considering the game takes place entirely on a spaceship, there was some pretty solid variation in environments, which I appreciated. -Player customization is very diverse. Replayability potential is there. I went through barely even using the psionic power, focusing more on weaponry and repair. CONS:-This is more a quibble with the mechanics than the gameplay itself. This is a very dark game, visually (although thematically as well, which is great!). The gamma slider does exactly squat, at least for my laptop, and while for the most part it's not that big a problem, on one of the later levels in particular it makes the game very difficult to navigate. -Also something that might have been specific to my computer, but the game wasn't terribly responsive when it came to firing weapons, and something that drove me crazy was an inability to fire a gun while moving.  This meant that when faced with some of the stronger enemies, once they got within a certain range it was unpreventable death. Overall, great game even as we approach something like 20 years. I would love a remaster a la the Resident Evil remaster, since the graphics definitely could use an upgrade, but even the poor graphics don't detract from the experience that much because the story is so strong.10/10 story8/10 mechanicsDefinitely recommend!

												1st step:Go here and download the 400~ mb mod pack -  http://neutralx2.com/2013/07/14/system-shock-2-mod-packThen upzip and put them in - C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SS2\The website has super simple intructions and even a screenshot to help.  2nd Step:- Navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SS2\  and find the  'cam_ext.cfg' (make a backup first in   case anything goes wrong)- Do a search for the line 'd3d_disp_scaled_2d_overlay 64' you should see a "";"" in front of it. Simply remove this and save the file. Your in game HUD should now be much larger and much easier to read for 1080 or 4k resolutins!3rd Step (optional):  If you have one the last few generations of Nvidia cards and no 4k monitor, user DSR!   It allows you to run games at 4k on a 1080 monitor!  Looks amazing!-Right click your desktop and click the Nvidia Control Panel.-Look for DSR Factors and check the 4.00x box.-Now you can run 4k resolution on a 1080 monitor!4th step - Enjoy this awesome game!!  Amazing game, even for 2016!  It's from the same creators as Bioshock and you can surely see the similarities!  Hacking, different ammunitions types, perks, skills, respawn locations, vending machines (hackable), hackable keypadded crates, audio logs, ect.  Also the main antagonist is a real trip! A MUST-SEE for any Sci-Fi fan.  She's based off Max Headroom and is freaky as ♥♥♥♥!  Just the way she talks to you is a trip!  This game will not hold your hand like most modern games.  It is very difficult as first as not a lot of things are explained.  Ammo and weapons are scarce in the beginning making it even harder.  Use your wrench as much as possible at first to save up ammo.  Your map is incredibly useful.  You can also add notes to it by pressing N.  Which creates a node, the you can click the node on the map to enter notes.   I usually enter notes for places I want to return to at a later time, such as locked doors, chemical rooms (chemicals are needed to reseach items), locked crates which I'm not powerful enought to hack yet, healing bays (rare), ect.  Lastly since most games in the 90's game with manuals (not seen whatsoever in modern days) I will paste you tips taken directly from the SS2 1999 manual!  They will help you a lot!  En♥♥♥♥ingjoy!GENERAL HINTS:•When you’re low on ammo and fighting robots that explode on death, attack with a meleeweapon to wear them down, then finish them off with one or two shots at a distance so as notto be caught in the explosion.•Hack all the turrets you can, to get them on your side against other foes, but be careful todisable the security system first.•Maintenance skill/tools help keep your weapons in good shape, while repair may be able to fixbroken items.•Leaning can often be the difference between living and dying.•Rifled slugs will poke a hole in armour and droids, whereas pellets work much better againstflesh targets.•Use pipes, columns, even desks and tables as cover. Crouch to make it more effective.•Hotkeys save you valuable time when loading and changing ammo, especially in a firefight.•EMP based weapons specifically damage circuits and robots. They are useless against humansand other carbon based creatures.•If you see a bio-reconstruction unit, activate it! You never know what's around the corner, even in a quiet hallway. Death can come quickly on the Von Braun.•Most broken keypads and items can be repaired.•If you're out of ammo and all you have is a wrench, don't go toe to toe with a protocol droid. It will always win at close range.•In addition to expanding your inventory and armour equipping capabilities, BrawnBoostimplants make you pretty fearsome when swinging a wrench.•Always check weapons you find for ammo. Even if they are in terrible condition, you should pickthem up and unload them before discarding. Every bullet counts!•Hit the Bkey to reload a gun with a different type of ammo than is currently loaded.•Melee combat is all about distance. If you're fighting with a melee weapon, you should readyyour swing while still some distance from your opponent. Run towards him, then release theswing once you're close. If you then immediately back away again, you have a good chance ofevading your opponent's swing while you are readying your own next attack. Some opponentsmay have a longer melee range than you do.•A jack of all trades is a master of none; specialisation is the key to success. Many tasks (especiallylate in the game) require high skill in order to even attempt them. Don't try and become amaster of all four weapons classes, pick one or two and stick with them. You can always pick upanother one later on, if you have enough cyber modules available.•On the other hand, don’t put all your points into a single skill; find a small cluster of skills thatsupport each other. If you like Energy weapons, put some of your points into Maintenance, so asto store more charge in your weapons. If you prefer Heavy weapons, strength will be key, asmany have high strength requirements. If you want to explore Exotic weapons, invest inResearch skill, as Exotic weapons can't be used until they're researched.•Even if you're not playing an OSA character, judicious use of psi can be quite effective. After all,all characters have psi points, whether or not they choose to use them. Once your 'basic skills'are reasonably high, you might consider investing in a few Psionic Disciplines that complementthose skills.From:http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/238210/manuals/System%20Shock%202%20-%20Manual.pdf "

												System Shock 2 is the kind of game I show people when they say that all old games are inferior to modern games because I know of no other game from 2010 onwards with this level of depth and densely packed lore. Every audio log, item flavour text and message scrawled on the wall in blood serves to better immerse yourself in it's world and create. Not to mention the music which helps create a tense atmosphere, something which many games struggle with even today. To be honest, System Shock isn't perfect mainly because of the upgrading system, for you see, System Shock is a FPS RPG and NOT a FPS with rpg elements so being that if you try to hold a gun without investing a point into the basic stat; the game doesn't let you. This creates a dilemma becuase, later in the game, if you don't invest your points wisely you'll hit a brick wall you can't pass which really holds back the game. But, hopefully, modders will have something to fix that by now. So in summary, I give System Shock 2 a hearty reccomendation as long as you are willing look at a guide to invest your points well.

												This game is a wonderful example of weird, but brilliant, science fiction story telling. It's unsettling atmosphere is literally oozing out of every place you go. For a game made almost 20 years ago, it holds up even though some might say its ""difficult"" or has bad graphics. It started the ""shock"" type games, though few there are, they are great games. Speaking of which, this game beats Bioshock. End of story. In all seriousness this is one of my personal favorite games, I even have a little PSI amp replica I made.

												The gunplay/combat is showing its age and isn't really worth writing home about, and the soundtrack doesn't mesh well with the horror atmosphere that the game is trying to establish (i suggest turning off the music. Makes the experience much better imo) but regardless of those flaws everything else is amazing.			"

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 2 | 3 4 *5*] = ~92% (83%-100%)If you don't get System Shock 2 at some point in your PC gamer life, you're doing it wrong.You're dealing with virtual reality interfaces e.g. whenever you play a 1st person shooter. While those interfaces are normal by now, developers still too often get them horribly wrong, so contrary to what most people might believe, we're not quite there yet. But the pioneering times are over, we're well inside the age of these games now.This is thanks to groundbreaking works like System Shock 1/2, Deus Ex (1), Half Life, Doom, The Colony, etc. - these games conquered the new territory. While someone else would have been there instead (We're not talking ""OMG nobody would have thought of that!""), these developers were there and made possible that we can have these new human experiences that were impossible before. It were these people who climbed the abstraction ladder to the next level and opened this door to mankind by giving this experience to the public.That is what you have to keep in mind. It is for these reasons that these games feel the way they feel. That is the magic behind the experience, which I do hope you can tap into.Enjoy the new world, however normal it has become to you by now.			"

I can see how Bioshock takes from this game and I really enjoyed that.  The game that inspired one of my favorite series reminds me so much of it.  This game is a must buy for anyone who wants to enjoy a good story with good ol' shooting mechanics of the past that games such as deus ex have.  I would get this game if you enjoy older shooters that are action/rpg and great stories.			"

												Where to begin!?!?This, in my opinion, is the greatest sci-fi game ever made. Not the biggest, nor the best, nor the one with the best graphics (the enemy models were considered poor even back when it was released, but you can update them now via a community mod).The main character (nicknamed 'Goggles' by the community, due to his eyewear) can be upgraded in many ways. There are three main areas of expertise: Weapons, Tech (hacking etc.), and Psionic (magic, basically). On top of that, you can also upgrade your personal stats, like Strength etc.Sadly, this is one of those games where there is a 'right' and 'wrong' way to level up. I will add, though, that it's hard to make your character completely useless. But not upgrading certain skills can make it VERY tough at the end of the game, similar to the Vampire: The Masquerade videogame.So why do I think it's the greatest?All the parts come together to create something greater than themselves.Because, for me personally, they've nailed the atmosphere - and nothing else gets in the way. It's that simple.For instance, Deus Ex: Human Revolution does a lot of the same stuff, gameplay wise. But I HATE the 'hacking' in that game with a wrath, which is why I will never reply it, ever. the hacking 'gets in the way'. I also can't stand the story or any of the characters.There's only a very few cutscenes - and only the intro and end cutscenes remove control from the character. The rest of the story is told along the way, and the audio logs can fill in the blanks - or be ignored. Compare that to, say, the recent Fallout entries, which remove player agency far too often for me to be able to truly enjoy them. Oh, I LOVE them, don't get me wrong. But I don't need to deal with that at all here, because it never 'gets in the way'.I can rebind keys effectively (I did not pay for a gaming mouse so that the extra buttons can be ignored, thanks), so that doesn't 'get in the way'.the music isn't overly annoying (even if it should have been replaced with mood tracks and ambient sounds), so that doesn't 'get in the way'.I don't need to install another Steam-like shopfront in order to play a game I bought on Steam (I AM LOOKING DIRECTLY AT YOU, GHOST OF GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE), so that doesn't 'get in the way'.I don't need to install an inventory mod, because the inventory makes sense to me and doesn't 'get in the way'.And while she's showing her age (well, the game is), SHODAN remains one of my favourite villains in any medium, ever. While her insults can be intrusive on a personal (to the character, not the player) level, they don't 'get in the way' of me enjoying the game.In fact, the only thing that really 'gets in the way' for me when I play this game is......yep, you guessed it: Real Life. I award this game 100 Cybermodules out of 10, because I hate maths.			"

												I take into consideration that this game is not recent. I did not play this game when it was new, but I did appreciate other games that were released around the same time.I have to compare this game to Deus Ex, and in that regards, it falls hopelessly short. As most games of that era the combat was fairly basic, and varied only in as much as the player forced it to be. You can choose different paths, though on anything but the hardest difficulty it doesn't really matter unless you want to present yourself the challenge of using ""psy"" instead of weapons.The story was fairly predictable, not bad, but it didn't stand out as a masterpiece like it was explained to be. The inclusion of recordings really helped this along a lot, without them there would just be a shuffle of going from place to place, re-killing the same dudes, collecting random♥♥♥♥♥♥and using it on other random♥♥♥♥♥♥until you got to shoot the boss. There were a couple of twists and turns, but it wasn't anything overwhelming or shocking, they did add a little bit of intrigue.Overall not a terrible game at all, revolutionary for its time, but if you don't have the nostalgia aspect you'll find yourself grinding through it for the sake of playing a piece of history. If you want something far better and in a similar Genre, go with Deus Ex. It didn't feel like you revisted the same locations pointlessly a thousand times, the decisions you made mattered, and there were actual benefits to taking different approaches to play through the game rather than forcing yourself to experience unnecessary challenge.Fun? MehValid To Video Game History/Development? SureAppealing to players not familiar with the series? Nah. Just play Deus Ex if you want Cyberpunk from that period, or Bioshock 1 if you want the same game only better now.			"

												I haven't finished this game yet, but I can for sure tell you that this is one of the best games I have ever played. Here are my best highlights so far:*The story is so insane and makes you feel so small and weak against a giant menacing antagonist. *The gameplay is a little odd to today's standards, but I caught on very quick to it's controls and weapons system. *The character models are very old, but high resolution enviornments keep up with the standards of modern indie games.*Voice acting is superb all around! Enemies scream for you to kill them in the most chilling way, Xerxes's voice is very well done, and Sodan (who steals the show) is probably one of the best voiced antagonists ever.There are so many more points that I would like to talk about, but I feel like I am taking forever anyway. I am going to continue this review once I finish the game so I can give a personal score for it.All I can say for now is that this game is well worth more than it's asking price.			"

												It’s been almost 10 years since I last played System Shock 2. The nostalgia I have for this great survival horror rpg is incredible. Everything that established my love for games can be found in this game. Great atmosphere, great gameplay, a mysterious and enticing story, great environment design, the whole package. Considering it’s a re-release from 1999 with updated compatibility for modern systems, it’s well worth the current price. Night Dive studios have done a great job at fixing up the game and making it available for the modern audience. Now if you’ve played any of the Bioshock games you will most likely fall in love with System Shock 2. Irrational Games (most notably Ken Levine) built the System Shock games before moving onto the Bioshock games and they share many similarities in terms of pacing and story. I’m going to refer to similarities between both these game series so that more modern gamers can more easily understand System Shock 2. System Shock 2 really does stand on its own as a unique adventure that throws you into the bowels of a distressed spaceship. Unlike Bioshock though, there are many more RPG elements. Your character uses cyber modules earned by completing objectives to unlock upgrades and skills. You have an inventory that can hold various different in game items. Weapons degrade over time, different armours can be equipped, and parts of enemies can be researched to find weaknesses. Also similar to Bioshock, there’s a lot of scrounging. You have to constantly look for supplies and ways to stay alive. Finding that one clip for your pistol or hiding from enemies as they search for you. Irrational games KNOW how to make tense situations and I love it.In terms of survival horror, it doesn’t get much better than this. I remember being terrified of certain parts back when I was younger, and to an extent, these parts still scare me! That feeling of dread around every corner is very common. The sound design is made so well that it enhances the atmosphere in ways I can’t easily describe. This is something that was done well in the Bioshock games too. The graphics are great too! All resolutions are supported up to 1920x1080 and many mods can be applied that further enhance textures, models, etc. You can refer to the user created Steam mod guide for ways to further enhance the experience! There’s also a co-op mode through the main story. It’s not supported officially, but can still be used by creating your own network using Hamachi or similar programs. I’ve yet to try this out for myself.At the end of the day, System Shock 2 is better than ever and I’m so pleased that one of my favourite games has finally made it to Steam. If you like sci-fi RPGs, give it a go. If you like Bioshock, you should already have played this :P "

												Remember when games didn't hold your hand? When games were actually hard? This is system shock 2. A challenging but very satisfying game. The graphics of course are dated but the immersion and atmosphere is not. When you level up your character you pray that you put your points in the right way because you'll regret it at the end when you’re up against powerful enemies. Some things did bug me, like how enemies keep respawning, draining your resources. However that adds to the uneasy feeling of this game that you want to get off this ship as soon as you can. Which- it took me about 23 hours to beat this game so you won't be getting of this ship soon. If you want a game with great immersion, story and depth this is the one for you.			"

												This is the scariest game I've ever played. It's old and its graphics didn't age very well, and it's a bit hampered by archaic mechanics......but holy hell, it's pretty atmospheric and Shodan's voice still chills me. If you have the patience for older games, this game is truly a classic.			"

												Update for the contest:The ""GAME WITHIN A GAME"" Award - this game had many games that you could install in your PDA and it was fun, to just lock yourself in somewhere (hopefully) safe to play those games :)Back to old review:System Shock 2 is one of the best games I ever played.It shows that FPS games can be merged with RPG games flawlessly AND deliver amazing story.At the time, it also looked good, but that was just a bonus.If you never played it back in the day - think BioShock. Because BioShock took everything it has, from SystemShock 2. That is not even a generalisation. I don't mind though, because If it took more, it would have been even better :)Many ways to develop your character offers replayability. Coop exists, but it is best not to admit it does. It's a single player game. :)Highly recommend to anyone who can overlook slightly outdated graphics (there are mods though).10/10.			"

												MOST OF MY TIME WAS SPENT ON A COPY BOUGHT FROM GOG, NOT STEAM. Considered by many to be the spiritual precurser to Bioshock, System Shock 2 is a FPS-RPG with stealth and horror elements.The gameplay still holds up to this date. While not overly complex, you'll find that the gameplay is more advanced than your average shooter. There are some puzzles here and there that will require you to use your brain or require you to obtain a certain object in order to proceed. The gunplay is fairly standard as well, you point and shoot. Guns have a efficiency rating, so the more you use your gun, the more it will deteriorate. This can be fixed by repairing it.The RPG elements come in the form of player stats and classes. There's four categories: Stat, Tech, Combat and O/S. The Stat skill comes in the form of your average stats: strength, endurance, psionics, agility and cyber affinity. Tech comes in hacking, repair, modify, maintain and research. Combat deals with standard guns, energy guns, heavy guns and exotic weapons. O/S helps with your body's operating system, and can enhance it with modifications such as being able to run faster, jump higher, increased stats or being able to do other things. The classes include Marine, Navy and O.S.A. Agent. Marines are for the people who love to use guns and overall combat. You first learn to use standard weapons, then later learn to use other weapons. The Navy class is for players who want to play with the Tech side of the game. They are better at hacking, repairing items, modifying weapons and things like that. O.S.A. Agents are the most interesting and fun classes to play, but can also be the most challenging. This class uses Psionic Abilities, which gives you this ball that you hold in your hand that can allow you to do many different things, such as shoot energy balls, telekenisis, heal your self automatically or give you stat advantages.The graphics in this game still hold up today. The game looks a lot better than any other game that came out around that time, so better than HL1 or Deus Ex. The textures are smooth and nice, and with a few Steam updates, it runs really well. The athmosphere is at first a somewhat familiar one if you're a fan of Deus Ex or Mass Effect. Set in a futuristic space station, it's been overrun by an AI O/S called Xerxes. Pretty much, him and SHODAN (another AI) control the whole ship and there's zombies on it and other monsters on it. They've also programmed the robots to be hostile towards you. The whole ship is very unsettling. The whole ship has a cramped feeling to it, and combined with it being dark a lot of the times does not help it at all. It really provides a very scary athomosphere when playing.The sounds in this game are phenominal. If you're a audiophile, you will not be dissapointed by this. The ambient noises are eerie, the voice acting is surprisingly well for it's time and the music is awesome. I'd recommend using a pair of headphones for this game. Hearing the Hybrid zombies in the other room or the hostile mechs marching across the hallway is always frightening. Now, for some cons about the game.First off, I feel the interface is dated. It's really small, and doesn't upscale good enough on large monitors. It takes a while to get used to and it's hard to use if you don't have great eyesight.This game can be pretty challenging even on easy modes, and while this isn't really a con, it does put a lot of new players off, especially people who don't play older games too often.Along with being challenging, the controls are a little wonky. They make sense after you get used to them, but that's the thing, you have to get used to them.The lack of a journal system can leave you flustered. You have to make sure you pay attention to the lady speaking to you telling you what to do. PDA's help a little bit though.Overall, this game is very great, with very few bugs and cons. Challenging, fun and exciting everytime I play it. I recommend this game for people who are just getting into retro gaming. This is a good introduction into what games were like 15+ years ago. Other than that, I also recommend this to players who like horror games, FPS with more depth than your SHOOT DA BAD GUYZ muscleman games and RPG fans.My personal score: 9/10 [MUST PLAY]			"

												I haven't finished this game yet, but I can for sure tell you that this is one of the best games I have ever played. Here are my best highlights so far:*The story is so insane and makes you feel so small and weak against a giant menacing antagonist. *The gameplay is a little odd to today's standards, but I caught on very quick to it's controls and weapons system. *The character models are very old, but high resolution enviornments keep up with the standards of modern indie games.*Voice acting is superb all around! Enemies scream for you to kill them in the most chilling way, Xerxes's voice is very well done, and Sodan (who steals the show) is probably one of the best voiced antagonists ever.There are so many more points that I would like to talk about, but I feel like I am taking forever anyway. I am going to continue this review once I finish the game so I can give a personal score for it.All I can say for now is that this game is well worth more than it's asking price.			"

												Remember when games didn't hold your hand? When games were actually hard? This is system shock 2. A challenging but very satisfying game. The graphics of course are dated but the immersion and atmosphere is not. When you level up your character you pray that you put your points in the right way because you'll regret it at the end when you’re up against powerful enemies. Some things did bug me, like how enemies keep respawning, draining your resources. However that adds to the uneasy feeling of this game that you want to get off this ship as soon as you can. Which- it took me about 23 hours to beat this game so you won't be getting of this ship soon. If you want a game with great immersion, story and depth this is the one for you.			"

												It’s been almost 10 years since I last played System Shock 2. The nostalgia I have for this great survival horror rpg is incredible. Everything that established my love for games can be found in this game. Great atmosphere, great gameplay, a mysterious and enticing story, great environment design, the whole package. Considering it’s a re-release from 1999 with updated compatibility for modern systems, it’s well worth the current price. Night Dive studios have done a great job at fixing up the game and making it available for the modern audience. Now if you’ve played any of the Bioshock games you will most likely fall in love with System Shock 2. Irrational Games (most notably Ken Levine) built the System Shock games before moving onto the Bioshock games and they share many similarities in terms of pacing and story. I’m going to refer to similarities between both these game series so that more modern gamers can more easily understand System Shock 2. System Shock 2 really does stand on its own as a unique adventure that throws you into the bowels of a distressed spaceship. Unlike Bioshock though, there are many more RPG elements. Your character uses cyber modules earned by completing objectives to unlock upgrades and skills. You have an inventory that can hold various different in game items. Weapons degrade over time, different armours can be equipped, and parts of enemies can be researched to find weaknesses. Also similar to Bioshock, there’s a lot of scrounging. You have to constantly look for supplies and ways to stay alive. Finding that one clip for your pistol or hiding from enemies as they search for you. Irrational games KNOW how to make tense situations and I love it.In terms of survival horror, it doesn’t get much better than this. I remember being terrified of certain parts back when I was younger, and to an extent, these parts still scare me! That feeling of dread around every corner is very common. The sound design is made so well that it enhances the atmosphere in ways I can’t easily describe. This is something that was done well in the Bioshock games too. The graphics are great too! All resolutions are supported up to 1920x1080 and many mods can be applied that further enhance textures, models, etc. You can refer to the user created Steam mod guide for ways to further enhance the experience! There’s also a co-op mode through the main story. It’s not supported officially, but can still be used by creating your own network using Hamachi or similar programs. I’ve yet to try this out for myself.At the end of the day, System Shock 2 is better than ever and I’m so pleased that one of my favourite games has finally made it to Steam. If you like sci-fi RPGs, give it a go. If you like Bioshock, you should already have played this :P "

Firstly, the score that accompanies this game is just amazing (score composed by Eric Brosius), the art design is great and the lighting of all things is still on par with a lot of games today. It runs on the Thief engine and plays flawlessly on today's PC's. No hand holding in this game, just you against the horrific remains of the crew and the morbid voice of Shodan aboard the Von Braun. All of the voice acting in this game is really good, especially the voice of Shodan (Terri Brosius). System Shock is a Sci-Fi, heart attack inducing experience like no other.The game mechanics can be quite complicating at first (unless you've played SS1) as there are lots of things you must wrap your head around to fully get this game. You have stats for weapons, tech, psi abiltities and overall skills (things like strength and Agility). You have a large grid based inventory that forces you to prioritise certain items over others. you also have a very large range of choice when it comes to weaponry and how you use it. There are multiple ammo types for nearly every weapon and alternate fire modes (obviously not for melee weps).   There are a lot of things that are great in SS2 but there are still many things that hinder it. These hinderences include some horrible level design around 80% into the game's story (the many), shotty hit detection in areas and overlapping dialogue in certain areas of the game. It is also noted that some of the enemies in this game take way too many hits to go down like the rumbler and the psychic floaty squid thingies that dish out insane amounts of damage in return, this wouldn't be so bad if they weren't so frequent in the last portion in the game especially since ammo is very scarce with these guys just eating it for breakfast.I think SS2 is a game that really benefits from more than one play through as there are many different playstyles and weapons/abilities/skills you can experiment with that will significantly change your experience in sme aspect. Just to warn you, you can seriously ♥♥♥♥ yourself over with your skill points if you use them poorly to the point that it would be better to just start the game again. One thing that I think really holds the game back is that there is only one set ending. Having a set ending isn't such a bad thing but in a game with so much choice in playstyle, it seems sort of like the game is only crippling itself. Multiple endings in my opinion could have made SS2 a much better game with much more replayability and maybe put itself up as high as a game like Deus Ex (which in my opinion is the greatest game ever made on the face of the earth). I only nitpick because I have now played SS2 multiple times and have had time to analyse it's positives and negatives to further enhance my judgment of the game's quality without too much bias. It is definitely worth buying as it is an extrodinary game overall with great music, dialogue, voice acting and atmosphere. Please, please don't buy the next Call of Duty or Assasins Creed. Buy games that the developers actually gave a♥♥♥♥♥♥about. Buy this and play a real game.			"

												Update for the contest:The ""GAME WITHIN A GAME"" Award - this game had many games that you could install in your PDA and it was fun, to just lock yourself in somewhere (hopefully) safe to play those games :)Back to old review:System Shock 2 is one of the best games I ever played.It shows that FPS games can be merged with RPG games flawlessly AND deliver amazing story.At the time, it also looked good, but that was just a bonus.If you never played it back in the day - think BioShock. Because BioShock took everything it has, from SystemShock 2. That is not even a generalisation. I don't mind though, because If it took more, it would have been even better :)Many ways to develop your character offers replayability. Coop exists, but it is best not to admit it does. It's a single player game. :)Highly recommend to anyone who can overlook slightly outdated graphics (there are mods though).10/10.			"

												Do you like the gameplay of Thief(reboot or the old ones), Deus Ex HR(or 1 for that matter), Bioshock, Dead Space or Alien Isolation?If either or all games interest you in their gameplay or story, than this game will most likely still be very engoyable to you. The only downside is the old graphical engine and its aged look. Nonetheless the atmosphere still holds up!A very well written story and thought-out game-mechanics to enjoy it with. The graphics are rather old and clumpy but they suffice to keep the atmosphere and even  frighten you some times because the sound is still top and keeps it thrilling until the end. But be warned if you play with a high resolution youwill need a big monitor. the menus doesn't scale very well.Try it, if you long for an entertaining scifi-story in an action/stealth-packed environment.

												It is deservedly a classic. The atmosphere is tense, and great sound design means you are constantly on edge for what could be around the next corner. In terms of pure gameplay and resource management I truly think this game might surpass Bioshock; although the classic technology vs. environment story isn't as interesting as it's anti-objectivist spiritual-successor. One of the best experiences I had playing a game and definetly worth playing. A lot of people dislike the technomusic in this game but I kinda love it; I don't get all the hate, I mean I guess it does detrackt from the horror a tad but it's one of the few video game soundtracks that I will go back and listen to without playing the game.

												One of the best video games of all time. Is pretty moddable, with mods improving it and making it look like a modern indie game. Just.... try it! Especially if you liked the Bioshock games (since this was the inspiration for them).			"

												Finally beat this game after its kicked my♥♥♥♥♥in several attempts, and I think I get what all the praise is about now.Despite the rather janky shooting the game design is actually rather timeless. It is simultaneously a great survival horror and action/rpg game. And even though the actual plot is rather hokey and pulpy sci-fi, it actually manage to still have quite a few spooks. Which is saying something because Its not very often that polygony zombie boys that go ""bleh"" are actually scary because of their ubiquity. These specfific enemies when seen up close are actually kind of funny looking too. It goes to show that making something actually genuinely terrifying in a video game is not just spooky monster design it needs to be backed up by mechanics that make you feel vulnerable, and SS2 does that flawlessly. And honestly, that janky shooting is really not that bad, because it is plugged into a rather deep roleplaying experience whereby everything you wish to do in the game requires some kind of specialization. You can't just pick up a shotgun off the floor at the begining of the game and blast all the spookmen away. You have to meet the prerequisite strength and weapon skill requirements to be able to even wield it, and then that shotgun will still not be useable because you will also need enough repair skill to get it working again, and even if you do all that you will maybe have like 2 shotgun shells and little in the ways to maintain it. It may be kind of tedious at first, but it does convey a sense of helplessness in a hostile environment when you have all these complex systems thrown at you and you are expected to fix an entire space station that is rapidly breaking down by the minute without handy waypoint markers. So, you'll also be asked to make a mental map to remember where all the resources you couldn't use and/or carry before because sometimes the game will literally block progress sometimes until you have researching level 2 plus some chemicals to understand some mcguffin needed to progress. The secret to what makes a viable character for progression is budgeting your upgrade points into a specialized build. Sure in the late game those precious upgrade points are handed out liberally, but at least it builds up to that, meaning you actually understand how awesome it is when you are running 100 miles per hour, circle straffing around enmies while shelling them with grenades, because you were such a weak helpless babby in the begining.Oh yeah, and the sound track and sound design is impeccable.Its a great game, still, even. I'd say its probably an essential game to expereince and I'm so glad someone was able to bring it back from being abandonware. "

												EDIT: After mulling on it for a while, and doing a bit more research, I think I've managed to pinpoint why I didn't enjoy this game.At the risk of sounding like a casual or a scrub, It's just too damn hard.Apparently, even easy difficulty is fairly difficult, and I had the guts to start on hard. As a general rule, whenever a game offers me three or more difficulty options, I go for second-highest option, because sometimes games will reserve the hardest option for people that have abandoned the concept of fun and seek only to prove that they are the very best.By the time I realized I was in way over my head, I was four hours in, and restarting at that point just didn't appeal to me. Why restart when all I had to do was lower the difficulty?Because character builds. Doing nearly anything in this game requires some amount of investment in the form of stat points, which the game hands out very slowly. And apparently, at some point, you absolutely must have some points in a couple key skills, or the game is unwinnable.I think the reason I complained about infinite respawns vs finite resources is because I had a bunch of resources I couldn't even use. By the time I quit, I had something like seventy pistol rounds, but because I couldn't use a pistol, they may as well have been paperweights.And to be fair, I believe there are infinite resources as well. Each of the infinite respawns can drop resources, it's just that you have to kill them without spending more than you get, which essentially means you have to clobber them with a wrench a few times without taking any hits. Given the clunky feel of the wrench (and, when it comes to monkeys, the questionable accuracy/hitbox), that just doesn't appeal to me.Original, unedited review below.After seeing numerous sources recommend this game to me, I decided I'd give it a try. I mean, I liked Bioshock, and this is practically its daddy.Whatever all you people see in it, it's obscured by one glaring systemic issue.There are infinitely respawning enemies in a game where managing limited resources is a primary challenge.Infinitely respawning enemies is a bad idea most of the time, but when every single one of them almost invariably chips away at your ammo count, stack of health stims, or psi points, it starts to feel like the game is punishing you for exploring. This runs in direct contradiction to the game's semi-open-ended nature.It results in a game where you quicksave after every victory, and then quickload if your next enemy encounter goes poorly. Sometimes you quickload the same quicksave several times. That isn't fun. That's tedium. That's bad design.			"

Also i recommend to avoid viewing the negative reviews since most comments are about people who don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ they're talking about (like controls suck when they refuse to actually change it and such)			"

												Remember liking the game back in its day.After gettting into it again in this day and age, after the rose tint of nostalgia wore off I just could not bear it anymore.IMHO a classic from days gone by, which has not aged all that well.I wish I did not play again, would have preferred to remember it as the classic it is embedded in the warm fuzz of nostalgia.As such not recommended, or only to die hard fans of such games.

												One of the worst games I've ever played. The graphics are poor even for a very old game and the light is almost neon which bothers my eyes. I bought it because people had said it was the inspiration behind Bioshock. Inspiration????? This game should be forgotten as Bioshock clearly put it to shame. Don't waste your money.			"

												This game takes your brain and soul into a different world...Within first hour of game you feel it.This game allows different type of perk customization during a play, and allows you to accumulate and carry different types of items! There are even a fun items! Like a mini game pads! You can PLAY A GAME INSIDE A GAME!You are too scared of mutants running in corridors around? Find some safe corner, play some car games or Tic-tac-toe... Relax and then continue!You can hack locks around in a game..You see people dying around and leaving logs....you will read them...you will try to survive. In deep space..so far away from earth..By the way, this game does not age, its older graphics is nothing compared to what this game brings in for you.			"

												I highly reccomend getting this game.This is a game that is worthy of the title PC game, it has been optemized for PCs that run Windows 7 and CPUs with more than one core.While the graphics don't look like much mods can fix it since back then mods were a big thing like PC gaming at the time (not that PC isn't big now but there aren't as many devs smart enough to realize it).The guy you play as 1-hands every gun even weapons that are normally 2-handed like rifles and shotguns, now if that isn't badass i don't know what is.This version doesn't have the 4-player co-op that the patched CD version did but again mods can fix it, i think the same mods that improve the graphics.If you haven't played this game at one point and said it's not good you're not a PC gamer so, you know, BUY THIS GAME.

It read as followed.""Forgive me for the man I have become and not the man that you have raised me to be. Forgive me of the sins that eat away at my heart, and forgive the people who took this body and desecrated it to fulfill their own ideals. Tell my mother I love here, and tell my grandmother I'm coming to see her.""This man known as Apostle died with a smile on his face. May the father forgive and may he rest in peace.			"

												If you've played BioShock and don't at least want to try Shock 2, well, slap yourself.System Shock 2 is one of the most influential games of all times, yadda yadda, masterpiece, yadda  yadda. Long story short this is where BioShock came from. You can trace it back to System Shock, but System shock even in comparison to 2 is a primitive, vastly inferior game.Essentially SS2 plays out very similarly to BioShock games. You're a dude, thrust into a situation - although System Shock 2 being far heavier on the RPG elements actually gives you a training course and an entire section during which you create your character and choose their path - and things spiral out of control as you, the player, move the story forward and realize you're nothing but a pawn. Setting those nuances aside, SS2 is still very much an FPS first and an RPG second. You will be killing a lot of things, with a lot of different weapons, and a lot of them will probably break too, not to mention be beyond your ability to mod or repair for a significant portion of the game. Fortunately for you, if you're terrible at aiming, the hit boxes for enemies are very large, considering the game is from 1999.And yes, you'll probably get killed by a monkey, and turrets, and radiation.Many sources will tell you SS2 was a landmark for storytelling and player driven narrative (though HL1 is probably more so) but SS2 basically took the concept of finding plot bits in written form - like in Resident Evil - and converting them to audio. It gives life to the characters, and adds a new layer of immersion when you unravel a story as if you are actually listening to the audio logs or reports or whatever left by these people. Just like BioShock 1, 2, 3, and Dead Space 1, 2, and 3. Other than that, SS2 is definitely one of the first games that screwed with you - a lot.You can easily get this game for 1 dollar on Steam and pretty much anywhere else, when the sales are right, and after you do that, there are a wealth of well preserved mods on the internet to try and update the 16 year old graphics to something slightly more pleasant on the eyes. Unfortunately there is no complete remake, and likely never will be, but if you're going to take the leap, you may as well play the original anyway.			"

												Opening note: you don't log Steam time when you put all the patches and mods on due to the executable being different. My play time is not 6 minutes, but rather more like 5-6 hours.This is the second major release that I've played from Looking Glass Studios and I don't get the appeal of these games. They were good 'ideas games,' as obviously games that have used their mechanics like Deus Ex and Splinter Cell were top notch. But I never played these growing up, so I don't have nostalgia glasses on like many people. I gave this game a third try recently with all of the new mods to make sure it ran well on modern hardware and looked prettier. I still didn't care for it.What starts out as an interesting 'choose your own adventure' premise, with you customizing your starting skills, quickly leads to a disaster of trying to accomplish anything. The story is...kind of non-existant in the first 2-3 hours - find a scientist who can help you figure out what's wrong with the ship you're on. While you are jumping through crytpic hoops to get to the next objective, you can find a bevy of really boring enemies with awful AI. God help you if you happen to be listening to a recording on your UMD, find a ghost, and then hit a story event all at once - ALL OF THEM START READING AT ONCE. And then you might find yourself getting sneaked up on by an enemy because you can't hear them over all of the narration going at once.Much like Thief, I appreciate what this game was shooting for, but it's not really very good or attention holding after the first few hours to me. People had often said if I was disappointed with Bioshock that this was the game to get due to how much better it was. I can now see why I didn't like Bioshock; because it was based on a cool idea that had minimal underlying substance to it.			"

												I really don't know how to rate this game.I can see why it got so much praise back in the day because in many ways this game IS enjoyable even today and one thing I appreciated was how much it make you THINK.The menus/interface, while convoluted by today's standards(and extremely hard to read on higher resolutions) are still manageable and serve their purpose on a satisfactory level.The visuals look like pure♥♥♥♥♥♥cakes but with NeutralX2's Mod Pack this game gets a pretty nice face lift and in comparison to the not so well aged Deus Ex, it runs beautifully at 60FPS.The soundtrack is pure 90's techno bliss and deserves an award by itself.The atmosphere is killer and in comparison to it's successors(Bioshock) it gives you a much stronger sense of danger through that same atmosphere.The story is cool(though nothing new per se if you've already played the first Bioshock) and it's all very immersive.The problem with System Shock 2 like in it's weapon systems, overly complex RPG elements and its GOD AWFUL wrench combat.In Bioshock it's not always a big deal to be left with only your wrench to use. In System Shock 2 it's a much different story. The attack animation is ridiculously dated and there isn't even a mod to improve it.This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the aforementioned problems with the weapons and RPG elements were better.Ammo is way too scarce and powerful weapons like the shotgun and grenade launcher for example require you to level up certain skills before you can even use them even after you've found them. So, for a nice few hours of backtracking and getting enough cyber modules just to use ONE WEAPON(that still may only last you for so long due to scarce ammo), you'll be using the wrench.It's a grind fest on the level of unbearable sometimes and God forbid you set of an alarm. You'll be battling hoards and hoards of zombies like enemies until the alarm passes and it's always THE SAME DAMN ZOMBIE. At best he may have a shotgun some times to ""mix it up"" and there's also the occasional gun turret and kamikaze robot. -_-You will be using the wrench A LOT unless you already know ahead of time to enlist with the OSA and build your psi powers more than everything else. Do NOT pick the Marines if you decide to play it anyway because as I said before you will be screwed and doomed to wasting more hours to make progress than what should be necessary.This game was made more for PSI players than anything which sucks because I'm the type that uses PSI powers as SUPPORT for things like firearm combat. Not the other way around.I would have likely enjoyed this game more with a few minor things improved and again I can see why people loved it so much in 1999 but let's be real here...It's not 1999 anymore.I'm overjoyed to know the IP has been picked up and we can expect some new System Shock games for THIS generation but System Shock 2 in this state is not one I can recommend to anyone unless they just like wasting their own time.Wait for System Shock 3 and the remake for this one and the first and if you have yet to play Bioshock play those instead.

												System Shock 2 may have been a good game when it first came out. I'll even admit I enjoyed the game when I first played it years ago. With that being said, this game hasn't aged very well. A combination of frustrating controls, stat based requirements for progression and poor game mechanics does this game no real favors. For the $10.00 price of admission, I just can't really recommend this game at the cost. There's better and more modern games you can find around the same price tag. If this game were cheaper (maybe $5.00) then maybe. If you can get this on a sale, I encourage you to do so, but not at the current asking cost.			"

Unlimited respawning of the enemies ... while the resources are limited. AI is stupid and tends to get stuck - but overpowered in the damage it does. Hacking is randomPROS:Upgrade-system.Voiceacting.Conclusion: ...it´s just tedious. Not a game - at least if you don´t have OCD. If you´re a masochist: this game is made for you. If you want some challenge and fun: look somewhere else. I am 10 hours into the game on normal mode - and finished about 1/3 of the game.			"

												I got interested in SS2 because I am a big fan of the original Deus Ex and have played through that several times.  This is no Deus Ex.  DX has stealth, conversations, and an engaging story.  SS2 seems to be an old-fashioned shooter that may have story elements to it, but I don't have enough peace from being attacked to listen to any of the logs and understand it.  About the only similarities I see to DX are the graphics and the fact that they both start out relatively hard -- but SS2 is MUCH more difficult to start than DX.  I started at ""normal"" but immediately had to reduce to the ""easy"" mode and I still die over and over.  The narrator says things, but I have no idea what she's talking about.  ""Go to Storage Room Blah-Blah and get a Something-or-Other.""  The storage room isn't marked well on the map, which requires you to tab out to see and then needs a magnifying glass to read it.  If you can see what you want, it's at the far side of a maze and you can't find your way there without constantly re-opening the entire map -- which is usually when you get attacked, so you might as well just roam around and hope you come to the right spot.You can easily understand the advances in gaming since this game was high tech.  There is no tutorial; the map is poorly designed; every alarm you set off brings fresh hordes of attackers; when your inventory is full and you pick up something, the game drops something else for you, which you may not notice; and items on the floor may disappear without notice.  Another thing I've noticed is that the guides for this game are written by experts who assume more knowledge than I have.One thing I'm not complaining about are the graphics or the sound; there are enough mods out there that these are not a problem for me.  Just the gameplay.  I've had numerous restarts and spent a couple of hours roaming around and trying to figure things out, and it's just not fun, so I'm giving up on it.  Thankfully it was cheap so no great loss there.			"

												Time has not been nice to System Shock 2. I played for a few hours with a friend. A mistake I guess, but I probably wouldn't have had the patience playing solo even for that long. I played using NeutralX2's Mod Pack (better visuals).Audio was pretty basic, albeit monkey screams echoing and hybrids telling you how sorry they are had more of a comical effect rather than a scary one. If only all the remade textures had worked, visually I wouldn't have much to complain considering the age. Everything is just a fistful of polygons, but stuff is at least recognizable most of the time.The controls feel sluggish at times. It's hard to describe what it is, everything just feels numb. The wrench, the few weapons I could try, climbing ladders, running, jumping - the last two were perhaps just a problem in the co-op network code, but they were quite horrible. I watched some speedrun videos, and things looked a bit different. The players were flying through the corridors, but that's not what the average player is going to encounter.I usually dislike the strictly linear nature of modern games. Here things seemed the opposite: you have to go back and forth all the time. The only joy we got from that was when we got lost all the time and laughed about it. The transitions themselves weren't really fun, especially when enemies spawn randomly to the rooms you just cleared. I get it, it's meant to give you this feel that the place is living were you there or not, but it's hard to suspend my disbelief when another service bot just spawned right from nowhere just to annoy the player. In an old school FPS game you are encouraged to explore the non-linear maps, but it's rarely enforced. Here, you reach X just to realize everything was in vain (scripted events), and you have to go back to Y first, and then return to X. It felt mainly tedious.The mechanics will take some time to get into. Nowadays I'm not that patient a player as I used to be, and quirks and small things that as a kid might have seemed cool, felt unnecessary and complex in a bad way. E.g, I figure the weapons breaking only after a few shots is to to discourage the player to shoot'em up through everything, but when you have several skills and items to tackle the problem, it just feels dumb. There are psi skills, software upgrades, implants, but they usually seemed to be just buffs like ""+5 % health"" or something. Things seem very deep, but in the end aren't really, as basically you are shooting stuff either with a psi-amp or weapons, so why not just drop the other. Arguably variability like this adds replay value, and probably you can micromanage yourself a nice ""build"", but for a casual player, it's not entertaining or interesting. It's more like statistics and numbers than tactical choices. There's also currency you can use to buy stuff from vending machines, you can hack the machines to get discounts etc. Ultimately, it's all again just micromanaging, and the unpolished GUI isn't helping a bit.The atmosphere is what everyone mentions as great. The game might have been scary fifteen years ago, but it isn't nowadays. Things felt a bit comical. I don't like survival horror, so it wasn't a good base to begin with, but it was hard for me to imagine suspense here. The audio and visuals have much to do with that, but with the clunky and heavy mechanics it felt hard to get immersed in the world.What makes all this funny is how much I loved BioShock 1 and 2. All the mechanics - psi-skills, hackable vending machines, respawning enemies, audio logs, running back and forth - were there. But most of the time, interface and playability was smooth, there still was a lot of variety for weapon/psi combos. BioShock got things right. I have respect for SS2 in pioneering things, but the truth is, it just isn't enjoyable anymore.On a side note, as some have already mentioned: the Linux version is actually wrapped with Wine, and there is no multiplayer option by default. You have to do some manual work to get it there, and even then you probably encounter some network issues as I did. Eventually I just played using Windows. It might be worth your time to install OpenAL in Windows to get echo effects - it's included in the Linux/Wine version by default, but not in Windows, but I read that you can get it to work.In conclusion, if you want to check out a relic that introduced some new mechanics to the world, do try SS2. You might actually enjoy it. For casual gamers, you're probably a decade late for this ride.			"

												I cannot believe this game would eventually give us the excellent, nearly flawless Bioshock and it's sequels.  I've tried to get used to the unfair, pointlessly difficult AI that you can't hear until you're dead, the turrets that kill you in one shot and basically prevent you from continuing through the game, and the amount of ambiguity of what you're supposed to do and where you're supposed to go also doesn't help.  Do not go into this expecting a Bioshock game.  I figured I loved the Bioshock series so much I'd give this a shot; I did and I'm sorely disappointed by the results.  I'll wait for SS3 to come out or the HD remaster to drop with improved mechanics and gameplay.  I'm aware the game came out in 1999, so age is sort of working against it, but when your game is being praised as one of the best of its genre, I did expect more.  With that said, I sadly cannot recommend this to anyone who wishes to have any kind of fun playing games.			"

I know claustrophobic mazes.And I know that you need to be a very good level-designer to make the gameplay flow,to keep you going even when you get lost occasionally.But System Shock 2 doesn't put you into a GAME-enviroment.It just stuffs you into a huge♥♥♥♥♥labyrinth of samey looking corridors and elevatorsand says ""♥♥♥♥ you!

												Meh.Strife was more intesresting even though it was from an older generation.I wouldn't recommend System Shock 2.Dated graphics with seemingly little innovation the game fails to grab one's attention.Even worse is the fact that its positive standing seems to come from the fact that it's ""cool"" & ""retro"" to approve of this nearly 2 decades old game.This trend is so bad that one of the ""most helpful reviews"" is poorly rendered ""art"" using ascii characters.If one wants a good suspense story I recommend Bioshock. If one wants a more intersting story in a game of equal & even higher age, one with elements of espionage & a dystopian future, I recommend Strife. And finall if one wants homicidial computers nothing, hands down nothing, beats the Portal series from Valve.Over all avoid this game; over priced at a whopping $11 in local currancy at a point 17 years after it's release the PUBLISHER is hoping for quick monetary gains while giving little back to the PC gaming community.

So i finally got to playing System Shock 2 and much like later Ken Levine's games like Bioshock, it's ok but not great. Thanks to it's use of even then antiquated Dark Engine (Thief's engine) it looks primitive compared to much older Quake and controls are incredibly clunky. Compared to Deus Ex, System Shock 2 is very linear game with predictable story.			"

												Aged very poorly, with other good games that came out around the same time as this it's hard to recommend this one. No idea why it had such a following, perhaps the eerie atmosphere but the gameplay is dissapointing. Half-life 1 and the original deus ex are both way better games then this.			"

												I consider myself to be a person of few words, so I'll try to keep this short and in small points.System Shock 2 is the sequel I didn't ask for and I sure as hell didn't want either. The blend of FPS-RPG elements seems haphazard at best and very clunky in implementation. The gameplay doesn't help either. The Dark Engine clearly wasn't meant for head-on combat (as exhibited by the Thief games where combat is mostly avoided) but unfortunately the player is forced to combat enemies all throughout the game. The pacing isn't very good either; I spent four hours just trying to get off the first floor I started on. The story is okay in most areas and I did like the concept of The Many, but the ending literally♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off to no end because it ruined an otherwise satisfying sequence and basically turned the entire game into one big joke. However, the voice acting for characters, the textures, and the sound design was top notch, just like the first game. Now comes the points on why this isn't a very good game and some points on it being good:- Gameplay is clunky and very bad in some areas (guns constantly breaking in the beginning and the middle section of the game, movement is awful and feels very awkward compared to other games at the time, melee combat is also literally the worst thing I have ever experienced in a game like this; I fail to understand how you could be standing in front of someone and miss with a melee weapon, etc.)- Skills are often split into seperate skills for absolutely no reason other than to overly-complicate things (Why is maintenance and repair seperate skills? Doesn't it take some maintenance knowledge to be able to repair something and vice versa?)- Story is alright mostly, but the ending is quite possibly the worst videogame ending I have experienced in quite a long time. (The comedic relief was completely out of place and ruined the whole ending sequence turning the game almost into one big joke.)- Pacing isn't very good. I spent four to five hours just trying to get off the medical / science (and engineering) deck to be able to explore the rest of the damn ship. After finally getting off those floors, the game started to pick up again but falls flat once again once I reached the Command deck and boarded the Rickenbacker. The Many's flesh home also suffers from being terribly boring and monotonous (kinda like Half-Life's Xen section) and also slightly ridiculous at the same time!There are some good things about this game however:- The voice acting is excellent for the time and is top notch just like the voice acting from the first game was.- The textures are great and the level design is alright, but somewhat monotonous as I managed to get lost a few times.- The sound design is excellent, nothing more to say.All in all, this isn't really that great of a game, and I don't understand how this overshadows the first game so much. The first game is superior in literally every way. I might have missed a few things so I might come back and edit this review later.			"

												+ atmosphere+ story is very intriguing+ great mix of variety in upgrades- controls are abysmal. I wanted to play this outside of finding mods that might fix this, but as is it's just so unenjoyable. ""W"" moves forward, ""A"" turns your camera to the left, ""D"" turns your camera to the right, and ""S"" toggles crouch. Peeking around corners is just undoable as you might as well be a backing up truck trying to get back behind cover. Also this makes combat way more difficult than it needs to be. This is my main gripe with the game, so if you can find a way around that you'd probably enjoy it- I'm increasingly surprised at how difficult the combat is. There's no nice ramp up or settling valley with difficulty, it's just ""did you get there first and swing your wrench? no? alright you're probably dead"". I can understand why this game has influenced as much as it has. There's a lot to like here, but the base controls and difficulty work so much against what it tries to build.			"

												Getting into this game now, after all these years... was a no go.I tried, I really tried since I've read so many good reviews about it and many people calling it the origin of Bioshock and due to the love I have for that game I just HAD to give it a shot. But I just couldn't. The game feels incredibly aged, clunky and unintuitive. I think this is one of those games that if you hadn't played it at the time it was new, gotten into it then you won't get it cause now it has aged poorly.Gave it a shot, didn't enjoy it at all. Don't think it has aged well.			"

												I tried very hard to like this game. After 3 hours, I just gave up on it. I know what people say about how great this game was and how important it was in the evolution of game development. The truth is though, this game is broken. They tried to do something different. It failed. Sorry but this isn't a great game - not even a good one. How can a game be good when it is too broken to play? I can see what they attempted to do, and I can see why it was important to the progression of game development. However, I can't see how this is enjoyable to play.EDIT: To elaborate, I say the game is broken not because of some technical issues. It is broken because of the difficulty combined with cryptic class and upgrade mechanics.			"

You'll understand that this game may have the hints of a decent game but they've failed on every front to deliver what any dime a dozen AAA game that comes out now can deliver on. The only reason to play this game is to sit down with it and realize that we've come so far and to promptly turn off the game and go play something else.			"

												One of those classics that hasn't aged well at all.  As demonstrated in the Thief games, the dark engine can pull off stealth beautifully, however it falters when it comes to straight up combat (it's floaty, awkward, and really doesn't work as an FPS engine).  Thief 2 wisely avoided combat entirely for this reason, but unfortunately too much of ""System Shock 2"" is just straight up combat. The early portions of the game when you are just getting your bearings and exploring the ship level by level are entertaining enough, but as the game progresses it turns into a much more tedious corridor shooter.  Ammo is scarce, enemies are repetitive and, even worse, they repeatedly respawn. Like Thief, the levels are massive and thus easy to get lost in, but unlike Thief they are not all that varied or well designed.  And as the game progresses too much of your time is spent back tracking over areas you've already covered on tedious object hunts which usually don't amount to much more than cleverly disguised ""find the red, blue, green, etc, etc keys to advance"" style of game play that used to be 1990s FPS' stock and trade.  There are some brilliant ideas here (it has tons of atmosphere, the scarcity of ammo really creates a palpable sense of desperation and fear at times, and Shodan is one of the most memorable and influential video game villains ever for reasons that would probably be too spoilery to go into), but for all its innovation and clever ideas unfortunately the core game play just isn't that fun.

												Son of ♥♥♥♥♥ this game.Look, I dived into this game with the upmost optimisum, looking past the hype...or the age...or the fact that I had several gripes about bioshock 1 & infinite. Seems the 'shock series' in general tries to combine many great gameplay elements, only in the wrong way, with the end result being something more gimmicky that you stick on a trophy shelf rather than enjoyable or replayable.[The Good]-First person ledge clipping-Not as linier as many devs would make a game like this today-Clever and simple weapon maintenance strat-Wide personalization through stat building, skillsets and environmental interaction-Although manual binding is required, the controls allow you to quickly perform many different actions both 'physicaly' and menu based[The Bad]-Linux support is only an emulator that allows you to run the windows version, wine is even better for doing this-Actual combat compared to the training sucked and as I continued the strategy boiled down to: use psi, die, respawn, repeat-Psionic moves were frequently overcharged due to random framerate loss-Knew that switching to a more direct combat build would make the game less frustrating but, would lose the personalized path I bought the game for in the first place-Couldn't have fun with psi[The Ugly]-There were more rewarding / graphically pleasent / well paced RPGs that came out before 2000 like: Orcarina of Time, Fallout 2, Harvest Moon, Pokemon Gold / Silver, the Digimon RPGs-There were more tactical / fluent FPSs that came out before 2000 like Counter Strike, Perfect Dark, HL Oppossing Force, Unreal Tournament-There were more scary / atmospheric games that came out before 2000 like Super Metroid, Castlevania Symphony of the Night, Resident Evil 32 out of 10 total let downs "

												I heard a lot of good things about this game from some pretty unreliable sources around the time it came out, but I never played it.  I suppose it's not fair to give it an earnest review now that the game is so old, but I'm going to do it anyway.I sort of knew what I was getting into with this one, but I was bored and curious and it was on sale.  Playing this game was sort of like going back and watching Blade Runner for the first time because you heard everyone talking about what an inspiration it was to later science fiction movies.  You could see all of the influences System Shock had on the genre.  You could see the amorphous, rudimentary blobs of creation that would eventually evolve into enjoyable gameplay mechanics in later titles.  You can also see the cancerous growths of an unforgiving and largely cryptic leveling system that punishes you later on if you didn't happen to level the way the game never told you you should.System Shock 2 is a relic of an earlier era.  I would not argue with people who claim that the game was revolutionary for its time, or that it was the progenitor of many of the modern games that I love -- assuredly these assertions are true.  However, I am forced to ask simply, ""Is the game still fun to play?"", and sadly I must answer ""No.""  Ignoring the draconian advancement system, the game feels sluggish and poorly optimized, and the interface is a complicated counter-intuitive mess.  Also, I hate to say it, but the dated graphics seriously hurt the ambiance the game attempts to create.  I've been told that the game can be made less unpleasant through the use of mods, but I simply can't be bothered.  The game is old.  It was probably good for its time, but it's old now.  Let us give it the respect it deserves and allow it to fade into a pleasant, nostalgia-laced cocoon of obscurity.			"

												Now, it isn't often that I found a game difficult to play but this might be because I'm jumping from newer games to a retro game.System Shock 2 was fun at first, but it got old quickly. Now, this is by no means a bad game- there is a ton of story to unravel and there is a wide variety of playing style. Now, since I have the binary ""Yes or no"" options, I'm going to have to say ""no"" to if I would recommend it or not for these reasons (These are why I personally cannot recommend it I should say):1- The graphics, although great for their time, are dated and are hard to follow2- The game requires a great deal of focus and attention to get the most out of it3- Things aren't really explained, security cameras are bad apparently and it's not discussed why that is until its too late4- Weapons degrade with use and repairing them is costly, this might be the ""survival horror"" aspect, but the game feels more like a ""stealth shooter"" than a horror game.I wasn't able to play the game as much as I wish I could. I ended up restarting my game multiple times trying to figure out what play style worked for me and really didn't find anything that suited me. Don't let my review stop you from trying it for yourself, but just be prepared that this is an older game and one of the origional ""immersive horror"" games... it would be like playing the origional Resident Evil game after having played Resident Evil 6- It just has a completely different feel that stands solely on the nastolgia factor.

												I picked this game up becase it is apparently a staple of gaming history, and everyone seems to love it. But when I play it, all I see is a ridiculously complicated upgrade that seem that requires you to be able to see into the future to know what the 20 or so different stats do and why they are useful, and then running through metal corridors pressing buttons and beating alien zombies with a wrench because shooting them with a shotgun is about as effective as tickling them.

												This is the first time I've felt moved to review a game on Steam.  I'm a huge gamer - and I especially love old PC games, challenging games, obtuse games.  But I just can't quite dig System Shock 2.  I tried a playthough doing the PSI route, and it was so insanely hard that I thought I was missing something, or not understanding the rules of the game.  I tried again going the Military route, which was much better, but after a few hours of gameplay I think I've had enough.I love challenging gameplay - I'm a decent gamer.  But there are design issues as far as I'm concerned.  You can save/load anytime you like - but the game is so brutally unforgiving (there are many times you literally can't do anything about just constantly losing health, from radioation or toxins, etc) that it becomes a ""save, load, save, load"" kind of experience.  You can use anti-toxin hypos, but because of the design, its almost better just to reload and try again, because hypos are so ridiculusly rare.  There are places you can regenerate in the game, which seem redundant with the save/load always available.  I invest in maintenence, but there are no repair tools.... like, for HOURS of gameplay.  I invest in repair, but I'm not even sure how I'm supposed to repair things.  I invest in energy weapons, but after so many saves and loads I seem to have left an energy weapon somewhere, so that's out, as I won't see another one for another hour probably.  It's one nonstop annoyance after another, this game, as far as gameplay mechanics. The atmosphere is great, sure.... the story and audio logs are amazing.  I can't think of any other game I was more excited to actually listen to the audio logs you find throughout the world.  The creepy factor is superb. I love the arcade, old-school style challenge.  But the whole ability to save/load at any time sort of undermines the experience.... it's almost just as good to use your wrench and just keep doing save/loads until you get lucky and get through a series of hallways.  I invested in research, and the chemicals I needed were in a DIFFERENT chemical storage room, far away.  Really?  How many dang chemicals are in this game?  Sheesh.  Is it worth it?  It seems to suffer from nerds-designing-games.  It's incessantly complex, but it feels arbitrary.  I'm genuinely confused at the good press and reviews.  I think I actually hate this game on a gameplay level.  I think only if you designed it, you would know how to play it.  This is just my opinion - but I've played games for decades, I'm a fan of tough games from Another World to Dark Souls, Doom to VVVVVV.  But this just feels kind of sloppy and ""save, die, load, save, die, load, save, die.""  I'm sure people will say, you don't know how to play it, or something.... but I actually feel like I don't.  I tried a few times... it went better the second playthrough, but.... I think I'm over it..... just my opinion.			"

												Im not sure wether or not this game is good, and unfortunately i will never be able to know for sure. That is because the port of this game is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ When changing screen resolution, the game freezes and you have to restart you computer. When you start a game, it wont detect your keyboard and mouse, and you have to restart your computer. The reason you always have to restart your computer is because if you alt+tab out of the game, your whole computer is put into some legacy mode and is too glitchy to use.Im very dissapointed, as this game looked really awesome. If there is a fix that i am missing, please let me know so i can change this review.			"

												Sucks♥♥♥♥♥♥The controls are annoying and unintuitive, the pacing is slow as ♥♥♥♥, gameplay consists of beating people with a wrench because there is no ammo anywhere so all your weapons are useless, the RPG elements are way too complex and don't give any feeling of progression, the levels are just a bunch of identical corridors arranged in a maze. I was running in circles and didn't even notice it until several minutes later.On top of that the game is full of death rooms filled with radiation and security cannons that kill you as soon as you enter, which completely discourages any exploration. The voice acting range from passable to god-awful and the graphics haven't aged well at all.I do not recommend System Shock 2. Play BioShock instead, it has much more streamlined and intuitive gameplay. If you must play System Shock 2 I recommend playing on the easiest difficulty and following a walkthrough to avoid getting lost or accidentally upgrading one of the many many many abilites that never will be used in the game.

												The story telling and the atmosphere is good well besidethat..Its a damm tedious game...you can really see the ideas and gameplay mechanics that were laterrefined and used in Bioshock and Dead Space Do take note of the word ""refined""My main frustation is that you will definately get lost in the maps with no idea where the hell is a certain place you need to go, andit can take you half an hour plus or maybe an hour to find the place ormaybe you need to press a button to get to an area, but the button is so insignifcantthat you would miss it a few times. (aux storage 5....nerve center...!@#!@$)this lengthens the gameplay a lot as you will revisit the same place over and overto complete the objective, plus you have to deal with respawning enemies, limited ammo and worse..maybe youhave upgraded your ablilities wrongly.I gave up halfway trying to complete it without cheats and an online walk through..hopefully this review helps you			"

												System Shock 2 doesn't hold up particularly well unless you have a decent amount of nostalgia for it.

												I'm pretty sure that if i had played this game back in its glory days I would've loved it. However, I've played so many modern shooters that I found this one really difficult and not fun at all. I might give it a second chance sometime but after a few hours spent on it, I didn't enjoy it enough to keep me attached. I specially didn't like the controls, in the WSAD control scheme the A and D don't make you move to the sides, just turn.I'm sure it's a great classic game and it was revolutionary and maybe a masterpice in 1999, but today I just couldn't get into it.

												This is me coming from after playing bioshock. the sequel sucked, and infinite was good too, but the first bioshock was amazing. So after playing them, i decided to try system shock 2, because i heard it was a classic game to play. Sadly it doesn't age well. I know all the mechanics are basically the same as bioshocks just not as refined as it was an early game. So i wouldn't recommend this game unless for nostalgia or learning purposes. I wish i could get into it but bioshock is basically system shock but modern, simplier and in my opinion better.			"

												Im sure this game was great back in the day, and I can see how it could potentially still be great today, but the game just wasnt for me.I had this game on my wishlist for the longest time after hearing how much praise it had, and snagged it for $2.49 during the halloween sale. But I asked for a refund after around 1 hour of playing. The graphics dont bother me. In fact, I think that older graphics CAN do a much better job when it comes to horror than super realisic ones, and i find graphics from this era nostalgic and charming.But this game is supposed to have some great story to it. You start out hearing a 2 second story about an AI from like 42 years ago. then you go through basic training, and choose a branch in the army to join, without any description of what the difference between them is. then youre in the service for 3 years, but in reality about 3 seconds. you choose three asignments which I guess are supposed to be a ""clever"" way of creating your character class, because different choices grant different stat boosts. After that you are suddenly and JARRINGLY (cant stress that enough) placed in the middle of the Van Braun, and some dish is flying at the window threatening to put you out in space so you have to get the hell out quick. and welcome to the main game.There was absolutely no story. I mean I guess that the story will develop as i go through it, but I am quite literally dropped into a ship with weird alien/zombie/hybrid things on it that are trying to kill me, and a random lady who I have no idea who she is giving me random instructions with no goals or explainations. So all the ships crew was instantly killed exept me I guess, and the lady is giving me instructions like ""you need to get to the medical wing"". OK, um, how about giving me any reason at all to do that other than you told me to? Motivation is kind of a nessesary part of story. I get that its a game and theres only one place I can go, but there still should be a motivation for my character doing that. Like maybe im looking for a safe place with no monsters? or looking for survivors? or trying to find a way to bring the ship to port? ANYTHING would have been better than nothing. I just felt uninspired and bored.Lets take half-life for example. it has even less guidance, since you have no voices guiding you at all. but that game starts with you walking through the compound, meeting people, realizing people know you, you go down to do some experiment, you SEE♥♥♥♥♥♥hit the fan. THAT is your motivation. you saw everything go to hell, so your obvious motivaion is to get the hell out quick. and you walked into this place, so one way or another there has to be a way out.In system shock youre dropped into the ship after the cataclysmic event has already happened. and youre in space. so getting to safety isnt going to be as simple as finding the exit. I just had no idea why I was doing what I was doing.On top of that was the weird system of things. I have these skils, like research, that noone bothered to tell me how to use, or what they even do. There was nothing about research in the training, and i keep finding items that say they are researchable, but when I click them it says ""you need a research level of 1 to research this"" 1!? HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DO ANY RESEARCH IF IM NOT SKILLED ENOUGHT TO RESEARCH LEVEL ONE STUFF? even if i didnt choose to boost research in my ""character building"" everyone should start a game with at least level one in everything right? whats the point? and i always hear stuff from my PDA like ""there are chemicals in this room to help with research. dont try to take them all at once. they will help you."" ok so i dont know what the benefit of research even is, didnt know i needed chemicals to do it, and now i just know ambiguously that these might help in certain situations? And if you get seen by cameras, the alarm goes on for about 8 straight hours and it calls the monsters on you. how does that make sense? are the monsters WORKING for the central computer system so they respond to his will? that would be an interesting drive of the plot if they had explained that to me.The biggest thing I couldnt get over though, was the controls. the only way to access your inventory is to go into USE mode. this brings up the inventory and PDA and stuff, and restricts all your movement so you can use the mouse to click things. this is how you switch weapons and take health boosts, and also how you look through chests and things. Heres the probelm though: IT DOESNT PAUSE THE GAME. So if you try to go into inventory to take a potion while an enemy is fighting you, they just keep fighting you, and you die. if you are in a fight and you try to go into inventory to switch weapons, you die. the game gives you no chance to safely go into your inventory to heal or reload because enemies could come out at any time. and worst of all, YOU CAN ONLY MOVE STRAIGHT FORWARD. Pressing a or d causes you to rotate, which is completely unnessesary when you have a mouse. pressing s makes you crouch and uncrouch. so the only way to actually move is w, so you can only move in the direction youre looking. And with the attack rate in this game being SO SLOW (what is this pistol, a bolt action? a muzzle loader?) combat is almost impossible. you cant move back while attacking, so the enemies kill you before you can kill them, unless you find a way to turn around 180, run, turn 180 again, shoot once, then repeat, which was way too annoying for me to actually try. and if you have more than one enemy like when you set off an alarm, youre just done.Sorry I just cant reccomend this game.

												I feel that I at least need to be polite, so I will state this delicately: System ""Suck"" 2 is a game for jobless virgins. Before anyone accuses me of being a troll, I want to state that I am 40 years old, and played this game when it came out. If some subhuman millenials weren't stupid enough to think that it's some sort of ""forgotten gem,"" people would still recognize it for what it is: Crap. When this game came out, every reviewer and audience member hated it. The only reason people like this is because they are stupid hipster kids who can't listen to an old person's wisdom and understand that maybe if someone is twice your age they may have learned a thing or two. So if you are anything like me, avoid this game like the plague.			"

												Not too far into it, but I love it. It has a feeling similar to Deus Ex (or rather, since this game is older, Deus Ex as a feeling of System Shock 2). I love cyberpunk games and I love horror games. This game is great mix of both. It's in the strain of older computer games, so it's more difficult. It's also partially survivalist, because the game barely gives you anything ever. Overall it's a great challenge and the plot is pretty sweet. I'd definitely recommend buying it, especially if you liked Deus Ex.			"

												System Shock 2 secured its place as an example of an excellent scifi-horror title.  It's true scifi - not simply a monster show in a space ship.  But included are idiosyncrasies of a tech-space enivronment.  Complete with a gripping story both complex and layered, with great atmosphere.  Deadspace may have been a spiritual sucessor, but it hasn't been up to par with how cerebral SS2 is in its implementation as a game, nor as sophisticated as a story (with side plots).  Yes its old and its graphics (obviously) way outdated.  But looking past those, you have a masterpiece in scifi horror story telling / rpg / fps.

												SS2 is as much fun to play now as when it came out. Ahead of it's time, allot of the game mechanics it invented are now standard for first person games. And with the Steam version being updated to run solidly on modern systems, this plays like its a few years old not the hidden gem from 1999 it is. The graphics hold it back, the model and textures look very dated but the games atmosphere is so well crafted that it doesn't hurt the experience. And this game has atmosphere. This is not the flashlight in a dark hospital school of modern horror games. SS2 makes it's monsters feel like a real force in a real world. A walk around disaster movie. With guns. And cyborgs!The real beauty of SS2, what earns it it's £6 price tag, is it's story. No mission logs or quest markers here. Tasks are driven by the story and coloured by a host of well written fully voiced characters. Right from the start your hooked in, desperate to survive with the key to your survival (and the bigger mystery of what exactly is going on) always feeling like its just through the next airlock. If you like games like Bio Shock, Half-life & Dead Space you can't go wrong with this game. Buckle up hacker, this is gonna be one hell of a ride.     "

												I love this game. This is one of my favorite games and I have played it dozens of times. It is a richly atmospheric and incredibly detailed world with a great story and amazing art direction that has held up very well over the years. Walking through the corridors of the Von Braun still fills me with the same sense of dread and apprehension that I felt the very first time I played it. The pacing was perfect, the sound design with 3D effects was superb, and the music selection for every deck past the med bay (pounding techno) was excellent. Since 1999, there have been scarier games, there have been homages and spiritual successors, but none have captured all of the elements that make this one of the orignal masterpieces of PC gaming. Even with a third act drags at times and an ending that is abrupt and out of place, this is still one of the best games I've ever played. Top 5. Still, there's a caveat when it comes to recommending it. The game is punishingly difficult. I've had to use the ubermensch cheat nearly all my playthroughs. (Shame!) If you're curious, cheating doesn't ruin the story or break the immersion for me. The lack of quest arrows and handholding tutorials that plague so many modern games are totally absent here (yay!), but that can be a turn off for some or most. If you liked BIoshock and that's what brought you here, just be aware that this game is way more involved. There's inventory management, weapons stats, char stats, etc. I'm not telling you these things to scare you away -- I just feel that if you're more prepared to deal with them, you'll get past them easier and move onto enjoying the truly excellent core. Be sure to look for mods to improve the textures and whatnot. There is an amazing online cult community that has created some truly incredible stuff. Long story short: This is still one of the best games I've ever played. Top 5. It's nearly 20 years old and while many of it's gameplay elements are dated, the storytelling techniques and the immersive sim aspects are features that were ahead of their time and have only recently made their way into the mainstream games.

												I played SS2 'back then' and loved it ... nothing has changed!The atmosphere, the game play and the story are awesome. when you invest some time, you can add graphic mods, so it doesn't look 'that outdated' anymore. but even w/o such goodies, it's still a great game.It has to be said though, that it's not a Doom-like shooter where you have almost unlimited ammo and your goal is it to kill tons of enemies. it's a survival game, where you have limited powers. you can choose between different skills, which it makes 'RPG-like'. you also need to upgrade/repair your weapons, so you really have to think, what you do with your resources.The only thing i regret, is putting it on my wish list and waited for a sale, so i can save a few bucks (instead of buying it for 'full price', which is it worth).

												This game.While on a glance the graphics might seem dated by today's standards, this is one of those games that shows that a lot of love and attention was given to all the little details to ensure the end product will be as enjoyable as possible. As a survival horror game, part of the experience comes from careful resource management, from ammo, to health, and even your ""experience points"". Because your ability upgrades are restricted this way, a player can't simply ""grind away the difficulty"", like most other RPGs (both eastern and western) allow you to do. But at the same time, the mechanics are balanced enough such that even if a player isn't ""optimal"" about point distribution, they can't necessarily cut themselves off from playing further. The game is reasonably challenging to a newcomer from beginning to end. It also strikes a decent balance between progression and exploration, so it doesn't feel too linear to some, or too overwhelming to others.This game is shaping up to be one of my favorite games. I only wish I had found it sooner.			"

If you want to experience the full horror, play alone. If you feel you're too much of a pansy-wansy, play it with a friend, but be warned, once you play it with a friend, you can never experience the true horror of not knowing what's around the corner, alone, afraid, an insect in her corridors.They wanted to make a scary game, and they succeeded.

												Here's something I recommend: play Bioshock FIRST but you MUST come back and play this game as soon as you finish. If you do this then you'll know the style of play when you enter and all of the extra features that add depth will be easier to understand. System Shock 2 has aged somewhat over the years with weird default controls and sometimes frustrating geometry problems but there are times when you will see that this is the exact same game as Bioshock. There was a moment in both games where I found myself crouching down after I had started a security alert desperate that no enemies would find me and the inevitable panic when they do. The core survival horror/fps/rpg elements are all there and some more than others. The inventory management is complex sometimes but it adds challenge and the character development is so extensive that you really should read a tutorial on what kind of character build you want to start with. I played a Navy type character that focused on hacking and standard weapons and as a result the entire psi mechanics is something I never touched in my game. All of the options means you have to ask yourself what is the most importaint for your survival? Do you want to be able to use all of the guns in the game? Do you want to hack and modify everything? Or will you put some points into psi abilities to force grab goodies off of high shelves? This game will make you a cyberpunk survivalist at times when it drains your resources and throws the hardest boss fight right after. This game is tense and atmospheric with the only thing to break the flow being sometimes laughable enemy ai. If you like listening to audio logs then you'll enjoy the story but sometimes I found it hard to put all the logs into a cohesive picture of what's going on. The overall arch of the collectiveist organism vs the rouge ai and how they fight to controll this one soldier that has a foot in both worlds is amazing. One audio log seemed like the seeds to the Objectivist philosophy in Bioshock. One thing I found interesting is how this game made me feel smart through doing things like research and hacking to rewarding exploration and bravery. Final thoughtsIt's the successor to the Dead Space franchise (setting wise)It's the successor to the Bioshock franchise (gameplay wise)It's deeply complex (not a casual game)It's hard and frustrating at times (you can get lost and confused)It's scary and atmospheric (not to mention stressful)It's a classic for pc gaming and just buy it			"

												A gripping game with an almost perfect atmosphere and rich plot, System Shock 2 holds up wonderfully despite being over a decade old. The gameplay is arguably more complex than anything found in modern RPG games and the enemies creeped me out even with their ancient graphics (which can be fixed with new mods). The story, while at times making you feel like an errand boy, is wonderful and a huge driving force.If you are at all a fan of the Irrational's work with Bioshock or love Dead Space, then you must play System Shock 2.

												System Shock 2 is, so far, my favorite game of all time.  It was one of the first FPS RPGs and it executed wonderfully even as a risk-taking pioneer in the genre.  SS2 provides the player with valid and interesting playstyle choices, from a straight-up military gunner, a navy-trained technician and hacker, to a spec-ops trained psionic wizard.  The player starts with an inclination toward one and can go any direction they want with it after the game starts.  This invested specialization makes the game ideal for repeated play, and the Co-Op mode it supports.  Apparently Co-Op is a feature that Looking Glass never really wanted, but I treasure it and as somebody who has beaten the game multiple times, it's a great tool to get back into the game with friends who have never played.  The game executes wonderfully in lots of ways beyond just good RPG systems and shooting gameplay, such as a truly haunting survival/horror atmosphere, a tense and memorable story (the true innovator of the much-imitated audio-log storytelling device in videogames), the inventor of the sarcastic and manipulative AI villain (GladOS owes her existence to SHODAN), robust body control (with leaning and mantling mechanics)... the game is so feature rich and it all comes together into a wonderfully immersive game experience.I can't recommend SS2 highly enough with the only caveat being the very dated 1999 visuals.  Install a high-resolution textures and models mod and I'm sure you'll be able to see past it.			"

With just a little tender loving care, Hamachi, some compatibility fixes for modern systems and a few asthetic mods, one of the greatest times you may ever have in a video game will be grabbing a friend or two and spending a few nights playing through a cooperative campaign in the science fiction/horror universe of System Shock 2. Bioshock and Bioshock: Infine are beautiful works of art in their own right, but their predecessor, System Shock 2, will always be closest to my heart.			"

												If you liked the bioshock series then system shock 2 is for you. System Shock was the beggining the mother of bioshock actually they made bioshock in later years. It has the same idea, but in space who doesn't like space! I highly recomend this game even though the graphics aren't that great.			"

												System Shock 2 is the kind of game that most overlook because it looks too old, or it's too similar to BioShock.I can say with authority here (50 hours) that System Shock 2 surpasses BioShock in every concievable way, shape or form.Looking Glass Studios brought this gem to the world with the help of Ken Levine (who went on to create BioShock). If it doesn't mean anything else, System Shock 2 is the pinnacle of late 90's computer gaming, an era many laud as the richest in history. This game still retains the imfamous scares it's known for, the sophisticated plot twists, and the gameplay hold up very, VERY well. This game laid down the framework for Deus Ex, BioShock and aspects influenced by System Shock 2 can be seen even in games like Mass Effect (specifically, the Action-RPG). SS2 will always stand tall as the one game that nobody acknowledges, but is the one we see every day. In any shape or form.			"

												I'll first have to say that the co-op/multiplayer patch is really glitchy. I've played with another friend and it was glitchy some of the time. Add another person and it went really glitchy which caused it to crash.Seriously though, this game is great. Some of the features in this game are there as an option but aren't nessesary to finish. Puzzles in this is basically moving from floor to hub; doing something in the process. The note system is very helpful but not enough to take away the challenge.The story itself is interesting enough to keep you entertained. There are many logs to pick up which help you figure out the story ahead of time, but isn't nessesary since you can only do what you are told.The gameplay is alright but not the best. Weapons function as they are but break really easily. Never went melee or psionics so I have nothing to add to that. If I'm allowed to teamkill, then mission accomplished.			"

												A lot of classic games become irrelevant as their innovations and gameplay mechanics sublimate into the greater consciousness. Take Half-Life 2, for example: Putting a brick on a seesaw to make a ramp might have been revolutionary at the time, but it sure as hell isn't anymore.This game, on the other hand? It's still as fresh as it was over ten years ago. Sure, much of what it's done has been copied, but the mix of ideas and styles has never quite been the same. It's scary, it's difficult, and there's never been anything like it since. I don't know what else I really need to say.(If the primitive visuals bother you, just pretend it's an indie game with a lo-fi style, you damn graphics ♥♥♥♥♥.)			"

												System Shock 2 is seriously my all time favorite RPG right next to Morrowind if I ever had a top 10 list and here is why. So I've heard about System Shock 2 practically my whole life, but I never played it until 2 years ago because I thought it was just another one of those overrated ""classics"" that I would be disappointed in. And man was I wrong there...System Shock II is an RPG FPS game and it's seriously the most atmospheric games I've played. They NAILED the atmosphere in this game perfectly. Also, the game gives you the choice to play the way YOU want. Want to be an awesome hacker? go ahead. Want to be a pro in gun handling? How about low-gravity pro? Go ahead. Prefer stealth over going in gun's blazing, go ahead. This is a RPG so player choice is to be expected but man, this game is really strict on you leveling up. You level up not by killing stuff, but by finding things called Cyber Modules which you can use to buy points for your skills, and these ARE NOT easy to find, so spend them wisely. You can also purchase stuff from vending machines that will help you. The story at first is a bit confusing as you first go through ""Training"" as you read the narratives of your time learning your three selected skills over a span of three years, and then you are suddenly dropped on a decaying space ship. This is where it's up to you to discover the story or not by PDA pick ups throughout the game that I listened too because they are actually really cool. Here is a short summary: You're about to embark on the most ""historical"" mission in humanity when suddenly things go wrong because of the evil AI Shodan who wants to eliminate the entire human race. And yes, she is the cause of everything and she is wayy scarier than GLaDOS will ever be. System Shock II gives you a sense of desperation as ammo is not only scarce, but the enemies are much more powerful than you and this game does a great job of making you feel as useless as a spoon trying to hammer a nail into wood.Now to be fair, this game is old, so the graphics to some of you may not be appealing, but to me, I am in love with the graphics because for a game of it's time, it had some seriously good graphics and the people who made this did a really good job of making a believeable space craft that's slowly decaying as zombies, twisted turrents, monkeys who apparently know magic, ETC. take over. The lighting of the ship from bright to some areas to dark in others, to green in radiated places is really attractive to me and I love it. Be prepared to be face though with random explosions that make you feel like an extra in a Michael Bay film though...the ship is HUGEEE by the way. And it gives you a sense of exploration in such a damp and cramped area. This adds plenty of immersion to the game and makes you feel as if you are actually apart of it. The soundtrack is very creepy yet awesome! Some parts play some really sweet techno, but then it soon switches from Head-banging and foot-tapping to eerie and scary. Who would have thought that the sound of computer monitors beeping and the sound of a ship slowly drifting into space could be so terrifying as you hear zombies or ""Hybrids"" taunt you as you hide.Looking at this game as a weak FPS is the wrong way of looking at it, because, like I said, this is an RPG at heart that encourages you to explore every nook and cramped area of this massive ship so you can survive. This game is one of the best horror games to this day as well. Believe me, without spoiling the experience for you, lets just say that you are gonna be jumping out of your seat a lot if you're walking down a space corridor and the security system goes off...The enemies look very scary and itimidating and the sounds some of the zombies make is...well disturbing at best. Sometimes, when you hit a zombie, they will scream ""Kill me"" in a very disturbing voice and it makes you feel uneasy at best.And lastly, the gameplay itself is outstanding. BUT, be prepared to be saving and dying A LOT because these enemies have no remorse or mercy for you at all. Don't ever underestimate any of the enemies in this game because those zombies with metal pipes are not only frightening but are very dangerous. Hell, even those puny little monkeys WILL kick your♥♥♥♥♥if you don't have a gun on you. And the AI is pretty good and they act well...real. If zombies don't see you, they will taunt for you to come out saying things like ""We will find you"" and if they see you and your out of ammo or have no weapons at all, RUN! The AI does a really good job of defending themselves too, zombies will actually jump back sometimes if you are about to swing at them and then clobber you on the head and make you lose half your health. You can also discover a lot of the story in System Shock II by listening to PDA pick-ups you find. Some of these are actually needed to progress in the game without a walkthrough and others are quite interesting and reveals more of the story than you think and it makes the world of System Shock all the more believeable. My only complaint is the ending battle with Shodan...it sucks and it almost makes all the troubles you had to go through all throughout the entire game seem not really worth it. And the ending is somewhat comedical but is also weird considering how dark and twisted the world of System Shock II actually is. That about it for System Shock II, a much improved sequel over it's first game. I played this game a lot 2 years ago and buying it again on Steam to play it again was very much worth it which proves that this game also has high replay value!!! I hope this long review helps you decide wether you will like this or not. System Shock II is a must play before you die for sure! And the best part is I only covered half the stuff in this game during this review. There is wayyy more for you to discover in this game that I'm afraid I couldn't fit into a review or otherwise it would be way too long a read. So pick up System Shock II today and let Shodan take over your computer. I'm sure her company will please you...			"

												This game.While on a glance the graphics might seem dated by today's standards, this is one of those games that shows that a lot of love and attention was given to all the little details to ensure the end product will be as enjoyable as possible. As a survival horror game, part of the experience comes from careful resource management, from ammo, to health, and even your ""experience points"". Because your ability upgrades are restricted this way, a player can't simply ""grind away the difficulty"", like most other RPGs (both eastern and western) allow you to do. But at the same time, the mechanics are balanced enough such that even if a player isn't ""optimal"" about point distribution, they can't necessarily cut themselves off from playing further. The game is reasonably challenging to a newcomer from beginning to end. It also strikes a decent balance between progression and exploration, so it doesn't feel too linear to some, or too overwhelming to others.This game is shaping up to be one of my favorite games. I only wish I had found it sooner.			"

If you want to experience the full horror, play alone. If you feel you're too much of a pansy-wansy, play it with a friend, but be warned, once you play it with a friend, you can never experience the true horror of not knowing what's around the corner, alone, afraid, an insect in her corridors.They wanted to make a scary game, and they succeeded.

												This is by far the greatest RPG game ever made and it was done 15 years ago and its still brilliant now. Its like watching gladiator the film at home. Everytime you watch it its amazing. The enormity of this game is overwhelming in terms of music, sound effects and voice recordings. I like Bioshock Infinite but SS2 is streets ahead in immersing the user and irrational have got it spot on. They need to kickback with SS3 and a good story line. Graphics and bloody has nothing to do it with Its all about the story line and immersing the player in the storeline as if he/she were there. The PDA's, voxophones, whatever you want to call it. The classic SS2 drum and base in engineering. The medic hypos sound effects. Its all about these small little things that add up to something quite special. The fact that when you open the inventory it freezes the player is great. It creates tension if someone is running towards you with a pipe. Why should the game just freeze and stop when you want to look at inventory this creates a safehouse for the user. In SS2 no where is safe and its this that makes this game epic! 5*			"

The actual gameplay isn't as difficult to learn as some say and the very distinct combo of FPS and STRICT RPG elements make for a real good time. But prepare your butt hole because this game is unforgiving. You will be low on ammo and health and think ""Well I just got out of a huge fight so there's probably some sort of ammo stach near by to help me"" Nope. This game wants to hurt you. You will go looting desperately and end up butchered by a horrifying mutant. You will feel like an ant. The actual AI Shodan is terrifying and interesting to hear talk to you.

Despite putting only a few hours into the game, I can already see many similarities between this game and its spiritual successor, Bioshock, such as the narrative style, hacking, the suspenseful music and background ambiance.  I am looking forward to finishing this game.   Even if my purchase comes more than a decade after its initial release,  I can say that System Shock 2 still holds up to today's standards of gaming and most deservedly won all of its accolades.			"

In the begining you are giving multiple paths you can take which alter what you start with. Infinite re-playability and a whole crap ton of secrets. Want to use guns? ok! Sick of guns? use psy powers! Out of psy? bash people with a wrench!			"

												My all time favorite. One of the best fps around with genuine creative gameplay. This shows that FPS can be more than just point and shoot. Really good sci-fi story also!  I'm not gonna into details as there are people that describe the game pretty well in the reviews around here!I still hope there will be a system shock 3 but I somehow doubt it will happen! We never know though!			"

												Keep your trigger finger ready, ladies. You don't know what lurks in the corner, or maybe what's stalks you from behind, staying silence while waiting for the right moment to attack you. Yes, I'm talking about System Shock 2. I never knew the title of this game but I do remember watching my uncle play it back in 2000, recently I searched ""Scariest PC game"" and it shows SS 2 and I thought ""So that's the title is!"". Back then the game wasn't really scary at all, but when you actually in control, you'll feel the intensity, you won't feel safe. When you walk through the silent corridors with dead bodies, rooms that you thought it was safe until you heard someone mumble ""Kill me~"" or ""You don't belong here~"" while you were busy setting up your inventory or levelling up, you'll feel that intensity, pressing buttons in panick, thinking what weapon should you choose, and then zombies or cyborg girl come in swarm. You gotta be ready by then.SS 2 is a combination of FPS and Action-RPG. Yes there are level ups, equipment systems, etc. For example you can't use shotgun without levelling up a bit, increasing your status. You can't use decent armor without increasing your STR stat, and so on. The gameplay you'll find similar to Doom 3, you'll be given objectives, and you gotta starts exploring on your own. No waypoint like in BioShock. Overall this game is pretty decent, modern gamers should try this. "

												System Shock 2 might be a game from the previous decade, and the game might seem outdated in several parts (Slightly clunky controls, and naturally the graphics unless you use a texture and model replacer), but it is still one of the very best games to this date. The atmosphere, voice acting and music are at times downright chilling. The huge amount of skills to choose from, and hundreds of ways to make your character, as well as the (Not easy to get to work, but a blast if you do) multiplayer ensure that the game is practically a must-have for any cyberpunk and horror fan, especially the people that love Bioshock.

												System Shock 2 is the kind of game that most overlook because it looks too old, or it's too similar to BioShock.I can say with authority here (50 hours) that System Shock 2 surpasses BioShock in every concievable way, shape or form.Looking Glass Studios brought this gem to the world with the help of Ken Levine (who went on to create BioShock). If it doesn't mean anything else, System Shock 2 is the pinnacle of late 90's computer gaming, an era many laud as the richest in history. This game still retains the imfamous scares it's known for, the sophisticated plot twists, and the gameplay hold up very, VERY well. This game laid down the framework for Deus Ex, BioShock and aspects influenced by System Shock 2 can be seen even in games like Mass Effect (specifically, the Action-RPG). SS2 will always stand tall as the one game that nobody acknowledges, but is the one we see every day. In any shape or form.			"

												I'll first have to say that the co-op/multiplayer patch is really glitchy. I've played with another friend and it was glitchy some of the time. Add another person and it went really glitchy which caused it to crash.Seriously though, this game is great. Some of the features in this game are there as an option but aren't nessesary to finish. Puzzles in this is basically moving from floor to hub; doing something in the process. The note system is very helpful but not enough to take away the challenge.The story itself is interesting enough to keep you entertained. There are many logs to pick up which help you figure out the story ahead of time, but isn't nessesary since you can only do what you are told.The gameplay is alright but not the best. Weapons function as they are but break really easily. Never went melee or psionics so I have nothing to add to that. If I'm allowed to teamkill, then mission accomplished.			"

												The Place Where Baby Bioshock Games Come From:Considered to be ahead of its time, System Shock 2 is often cited alongside the original Half-Live as the greatest two games of their generation. It is also considered to be the spiritual predecessor to Bioshock. Many gameplay elements are found in both games, such as audio logs, vending machines, and supernatural powers that may be used alongside conventional firearms. You must choose your character upgrades wisely, as you will not come across enough resources to fully upgrade your character. This aspect of the game would later serve as the inspiration behind Bioshock Infinite's ""1999 Mode"" referring to the year System Shock 2 was originally released.  Fans of Bioshock should definitely check this out if they don't mind low polygon count graphics.			"

												I almost feel like a groupie or member of a religious cult when I talk to people about how much I like this game. Few games before or since System Shock 2 have come close to it's level of atmosheric intensity, stotytelling and quality of gameplay. It's the kind of game that you find yourself thinking about while you are at work, or when you are trying to fall asleep. To play it is to live it, you enter the game's world in a very real sense, and the lines between being on the Von Braun and in the real world become blurred.  As you may know, System Shock 2 is the spritual predecessor to the more familiar BioShock series. If you liked any of the BioShock games but have not experienced System Shock 2, you really owe it to yourself to go back and immerse yourself in one of the greatest gaming experiences of all time. And now that System Shock 2 has been optimized to run on modern machines there really is no excuse not to. Extremely highly recommended.			"

												A timeless classic in survival horror meets scifi that deserves a sequel so much. The voice acting and ideas are delicious and engrossing. Between the biological hive-minds, artificial intelligences and cybernetic implants, it's a science geek's guilty pleasure in every imaginable respect.You'll come to understand why, but even your enemies scream in agony warning that they're coming after you and they beg you for death o_o Some unknown force has taken over the ship you were assigned to and you are very, very alone, oftentimes with only a wrench to defend yourself. You must overcome your fear and do what must be done.As others suggested, the one single missing thing is a choice between which of the two protagonists to join at the end. Ultimately, you are restricted to following the path which is most ethical overall.System shock 2 got it so so right.			"

												This is a very deep game with excellent exposition and an incredible item and skill management system. You can play as one of three classes and do just about anything you want with your skills. The storytelling is done very well through audio logs that are found throughout the game, and through interactions that you have with various entities. As far as progression goes, it's a fairly linear experience. There is one part where you are given a choice to go one place or another first, but you must go to both anyway, so it doesn't really matter. However, this game is somewhat finnicky. I think this perfectly describes everything bad about the game: there is a part when you are told that you must use a certain skill to perform a task. If you haven't bought this skill and you're out of cyber modules to buy it, you cannot complete the task and you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck. Ultimately, if you enjoy deep story telling, exploration, and agonizing over your character's upgrades, you should get this game and play it until your fingers bleed.			"

												A gripping game with an almost perfect atmosphere and rich plot, System Shock 2 holds up wonderfully despite being over a decade old. The gameplay is arguably more complex than anything found in modern RPG games and the enemies creeped me out even with their ancient graphics (which can be fixed with new mods). The story, while at times making you feel like an errand boy, is wonderful and a huge driving force.If you are at all a fan of the Irrational's work with Bioshock or love Dead Space, then you must play System Shock 2.

												System Shock 2 is seriously my all time favorite RPG right next to Morrowind if I ever had a top 10 list and here is why. So I've heard about System Shock 2 practically my whole life, but I never played it until 2 years ago because I thought it was just another one of those overrated ""classics"" that I would be disappointed in. And man was I wrong there...System Shock II is an RPG FPS game and it's seriously the most atmospheric games I've played. They NAILED the atmosphere in this game perfectly. Also, the game gives you the choice to play the way YOU want. Want to be an awesome hacker? go ahead. Want to be a pro in gun handling? How about low-gravity pro? Go ahead. Prefer stealth over going in gun's blazing, go ahead. This is a RPG so player choice is to be expected but man, this game is really strict on you leveling up. You level up not by killing stuff, but by finding things called Cyber Modules which you can use to buy points for your skills, and these ARE NOT easy to find, so spend them wisely. You can also purchase stuff from vending machines that will help you. The story at first is a bit confusing as you first go through ""Training"" as you read the narratives of your time learning your three selected skills over a span of three years, and then you are suddenly dropped on a decaying space ship. This is where it's up to you to discover the story or not by PDA pick ups throughout the game that I listened too because they are actually really cool. Here is a short summary: You're about to embark on the most ""historical"" mission in humanity when suddenly things go wrong because of the evil AI Shodan who wants to eliminate the entire human race. And yes, she is the cause of everything and she is wayy scarier than GLaDOS will ever be. System Shock II gives you a sense of desperation as ammo is not only scarce, but the enemies are much more powerful than you and this game does a great job of making you feel as useless as a spoon trying to hammer a nail into wood.Now to be fair, this game is old, so the graphics to some of you may not be appealing, but to me, I am in love with the graphics because for a game of it's time, it had some seriously good graphics and the people who made this did a really good job of making a believeable space craft that's slowly decaying as zombies, twisted turrents, monkeys who apparently know magic, ETC. take over. The lighting of the ship from bright to some areas to dark in others, to green in radiated places is really attractive to me and I love it. Be prepared to be face though with random explosions that make you feel like an extra in a Michael Bay film though...the ship is HUGEEE by the way. And it gives you a sense of exploration in such a damp and cramped area. This adds plenty of immersion to the game and makes you feel as if you are actually apart of it. The soundtrack is very creepy yet awesome! Some parts play some really sweet techno, but then it soon switches from Head-banging and foot-tapping to eerie and scary. Who would have thought that the sound of computer monitors beeping and the sound of a ship slowly drifting into space could be so terrifying as you hear zombies or ""Hybrids"" taunt you as you hide.Looking at this game as a weak FPS is the wrong way of looking at it, because, like I said, this is an RPG at heart that encourages you to explore every nook and cramped area of this massive ship so you can survive. This game is one of the best horror games to this day as well. Believe me, without spoiling the experience for you, lets just say that you are gonna be jumping out of your seat a lot if you're walking down a space corridor and the security system goes off...The enemies look very scary and itimidating and the sounds some of the zombies make is...well disturbing at best. Sometimes, when you hit a zombie, they will scream ""Kill me"" in a very disturbing voice and it makes you feel uneasy at best.And lastly, the gameplay itself is outstanding. BUT, be prepared to be saving and dying A LOT because these enemies have no remorse or mercy for you at all. Don't ever underestimate any of the enemies in this game because those zombies with metal pipes are not only frightening but are very dangerous. Hell, even those puny little monkeys WILL kick your♥♥♥♥♥if you don't have a gun on you. And the AI is pretty good and they act well...real. If zombies don't see you, they will taunt for you to come out saying things like ""We will find you"" and if they see you and your out of ammo or have no weapons at all, RUN! The AI does a really good job of defending themselves too, zombies will actually jump back sometimes if you are about to swing at them and then clobber you on the head and make you lose half your health. You can also discover a lot of the story in System Shock II by listening to PDA pick-ups you find. Some of these are actually needed to progress in the game without a walkthrough and others are quite interesting and reveals more of the story than you think and it makes the world of System Shock all the more believeable. My only complaint is the ending battle with Shodan...it sucks and it almost makes all the troubles you had to go through all throughout the entire game seem not really worth it. And the ending is somewhat comedical but is also weird considering how dark and twisted the world of System Shock II actually is. That about it for System Shock II, a much improved sequel over it's first game. I played this game a lot 2 years ago and buying it again on Steam to play it again was very much worth it which proves that this game also has high replay value!!! I hope this long review helps you decide wether you will like this or not. System Shock II is a must play before you die for sure! And the best part is I only covered half the stuff in this game during this review. There is wayyy more for you to discover in this game that I'm afraid I couldn't fit into a review or otherwise it would be way too long a read. So pick up System Shock II today and let Shodan take over your computer. I'm sure her company will please you...			"

												System Shock 2 has been mentioned often as one of the best games ever made and seems to be the favorite game of many. After the digital release, I was finally able to experience the game and see for myself.The gameplay is a mixture of RPG and FPS. The RPG part brings some depth in the game, but the implementation is a bit lacking. With the exception of psi-powers, the difference between a new character and one fully developed is noticeable, but too little. For example, a fully developed standard weapons skill along with a high agility makes it easy to snipe enemies from the distance, but aiming was not that hard to begin with. A higher skill makes better weapons available, though. Regarding this, it seems a bit dumb that a marine does not know how to use an assault rifle at the start of the game. The skills in this game prepare you for battle, since there are no alternative ways of doing things. If there is a tough enemy guarding an enterance, the only way inside is to kill the enemy. I didn't notice any option to negotiate or hack a backdoor to find my way inside.The most original part of character development is research, which makes some alien artifacts available for use. Researching is often not completed with just a click of a button, but the player also needs to find appropriate chemicals to complete the research.It is not necessary to complete the first System Shock to play this game, although there are some minor references. There are some minor twists in the story, but otherwise the plot is pretty average. Finding out what happened on the ship is revealed through audio logs, which are occasionally interesting to listen. The game starts getting a bit boring at some point, as there seems to be hardly any progress in the story and the player is forced to scour the levels for the next item needed for progress.The game has a good atmosphere, which makes the player feel that they are under a constant threat, but sadly the surroundings often kills the immersion. Sometimes the layout of the levels make sense, but often they resemble narrow labyrinths and make you wonder why the ship was built that way. The levels are mostly freely explorable and have several paths. You can even go back to previously visited places, but there is hardly ever any reason, since key cards and -codes for any locked areas are never found in later levels (or at least that's how I found it). Some of the enemies seems a bit unfitting to the environment as well. The game also has unlimited enemies spawning out of nowhere, but in my opinion the spawning rate is not too bad and some areas seem to be safe.Having been released in 1999, the game looks dated. This can be remedied a bit with mods, but I'm not bothered by the visuals anyway. The voice acting is generally good and the ambient sounds add to the atmosphere, but some of the enemies sound awful. I also turned off the music pretty fast, as the electronic tunes broke the immersion more than anything else.The game is playable, but I just could not see why so many people think it's still so amazing. Some better enemies, better level design and a more interesting story would be something I need to enjoy this game more. I can recommend it to anyone who likes Deus Ex and Thief (the original ones) and those who want to see what the fuzz is about. The game was not great but, not bad either.5/10			"

												Obviously quite dated technically but still extremely immersive. Creeping around the game's corridors, left without the kind of coddling guidance modern games tend to have, gives you that tense, eeriee feeling you got watching Alien for the first time.			"

												What a game!  It's very long, and very challening.  The RPG elements feel lopsided, and the psionic abilities are nearly useless, but they do add a clever new dynamic to what would otherwise be a generic FPS.After binding the strafe keys to a and d, it's well worth playing.			"

												I first heard about System Shock 2 and its supposed greatness about 10 years ago. Since then, every now and then the title would cross my mind and I would think how I wanted to play it. That's why I jumped at the opportunity to purchase it on Steam when it recently arrived. I was not disappointed. System Shock 2 is nothing short of a masterpiece.  I can only describe System Shock 2 as a hybrid of the original Deus Ex and Half-life. It is also the spiritual predecessor to Bioshock.  With comparisons to legendary titles like that, what can go wrong?  System Shock 2 is immensely fun and extremely addictive. Its strongest attribute is its chilling atmosphere and sheer level of depth.  For a 1999 game, this kind of FPS and RPG fusion, combined with an engaging story and horror elements, was revolutionary.  The level of quality is still remarkable even by today's standards.  As I expected, the late 90's gameplay mechanics can be clunky and frustrating. Combat is rigid and takes time to get adapted with. The learning curve is fast, steep, and unforgiving, and I found myself saving and reloading frequently, which at times took me out of the experience. Eventually I got used to it.  Do yourself a favor and visit this piece of classic cult gaming.			"

Don't let the dated engine scare you, this is one of the most influential and best sci-fi multi-genre games out there. In-depth RPG character progression, deep, involving storyline and thrills and chills galore. Get System Shock 2 today! There'd probably have been no Bioshock series, if not for this game. DO IT!

												System Shock 2 has been received as one of the best games ever made and after thoroughly playing through it I can see why. Playing System Shock 2 after the BioShock games you can clearly see many similar elements that were taken into the BioShock series (security turrets, hypos, upgrade and vending machines, psionic powers, similar level designs).The general game can take roughly 25 to 40 hours to complete providing a solid and enjoyable playthrough. Reading up on the game prior to playing it, it has been described as an action sci-fi RPG and has been praised for successfully blending all of those elements together. You get various skills, abilities and traits which can be upgraded by obtaining cyber modules. Cyber modules are hard to come by so you should have in mind a style of play you want to act out prior to playing. The scope of the items and weapons that are featured in this game is astonishing and even after one playthrough there is still a number of weapons and items to experience. This as well as upgrading your character with other psionic abilities adds to System Shock 2's replayability.The game requires you to conserve important items such as ammunition, med hypos, psy hypos and auto-diagnostic repair kits in order for you to have an easier time near the end of the game. Even when I thought I had plenty of these items at the end, I was amazed at how quick they diminished and beat the game with a struggle.The only gripe I had with this game was the multiplayer since I couldn't experience it due to not knowing anyone else who plays the game. The multiplayer has two options which are 'Host a Game' and 'Join a Game'. I cannot host a game if I don't know anyone else who plays it and to join a game you require the host's IP Address. However, I am not too fussed about the multiplayer, since the main game is fantastic.System Shock 2 really is one of the best games ever made and everyone should play it. You can play the sequel even if you haven't played the first game because all of the story is told to you in a nutshell. Buy this game during a sale when it is really cheap. The retail version boxed and in a good condition is difficult to find these days so do yourself a favour and purchase it on Steam before they take down another brilliant game from the Steam Store.

												A lot of classic games become irrelevant as their innovations and gameplay mechanics sublimate into the greater consciousness. Take Half-Life 2, for example: Putting a brick on a seesaw to make a ramp might have been revolutionary at the time, but it sure as hell isn't anymore.This game, on the other hand? It's still as fresh as it was over ten years ago. Sure, much of what it's done has been copied, but the mix of ideas and styles has never quite been the same. It's scary, it's difficult, and there's never been anything like it since. I don't know what else I really need to say.(If the primitive visuals bother you, just pretend it's an indie game with a lo-fi style, you damn graphics ♥♥♥♥♥.)			"

I'm amazed to see how it looks and feels better after every playthrough, the only game that gave me this sensation was S.T.A.L.K.E.R....anyway, this game strikes the perfect balance between action, rpg, horror and survival all blendend in an atmospheric world that raises the immersion up to eleven. if you have nevere played this one, make yourself a favor...BUY IT, even full price. You'll understand what  ""make every bullet (or medikit) counts"" means, forget the modern survival games in which you have plenty of resources all the time, even the weaker enemy can pose a treat because you have to choose if waste a precious bullet on him saving your health or saving ammo at health cost because you have to go melee...and that's it's just a part of the game...

												Hot damn this game is good!  I had to rebind all the controls because they were terrible, but once it controlled like a modern shooter, this game started blowing my mind.  They brought inventory management to an FPS that doesn't suck.  I like this.  I like having to cower in a corner in order to bring up my menu in peace.  I like having to scour the entire game for the possibility of getting upgrades and temporary stim packs.  I like running at enemies at full speed and hitting them with a wrench.I don't like weapon degredation.  That ain't fun. Otherwise, this game is creepy like nobody's business and tighter than any shooter I've played from that time.  Excpept movement.  Movement isn't tight.

Add to that enemies right out of HR Geiger's wetdreams and storyline that makes dealing with GLaDOS, Hal 9000, or Xenomorphs look like a walk in the park and you've got this game.No cover, friendly computer controlled teammates to help you out in fire fights, or aiming assist, you are on your own. If you want a great shooter with an RPG element which inspired Bioshock. then this is the game for you. Prepare to lose several hours of your life and be better for it.Have fun...insects. "

												This game is hard. I wouldn't describe it as a ""fun"" game. It definetely is worth playing though. It has pretty profound philosophical overtones and an atmosphere that is extremely grim and chilling. The voice acting and cut scenes are great. The combat is point and click with not much substance. The resource managment is where the game mechanics and atmosphere really come together. You'll find yourself struggling to find med hypos, ammo, phyi hypos, etc. throughout the game. You'll be afraid to turn the next corner. It is definetly a challange. But, as I say before it is worth it.			"

												This game is equal parts Bioshock, Dead Space and Portal. That being said If you have played those games before this one than the story is a bit predicatable and its graphics are horrible w/o excessive modding. After the mods are applied it is not a pain to look at but it will still show its age. Very good game and worth buying, but probably never going to play it again. If I got to play this in 1999 I would have idolized this game until the day I died. Too bad it took me 15 years to play this game.			"

You can upgrade yourself as you go (level up system and inventory like deus ex) and it had all of the bioshock qualities to it like psionic powers you can switch back and forth between. This game has it all for action horror and you'd be a fool not to drop the small amount of cash to get this great game.			"

												This game is a gem from the 90's that was overlooked until later on. This is what inspired Bioshock and the same company made both games. The unique atmosphere of a deserted space station could be compared to dead space or any modern game out there, but the haunting feeling of a midwife stalking you, the mutated and parasitic hybrids give an eerie feeling while trying to uncover what the hell happened while you were in cryostasis for three months?Most of the story is told through pda logs like dead space which later on some of the pda logs get disturbing as a scientist undergoes the mutation of a hybrid.One of the things that I dislike but it is a minor flaw is the graphics, but that can be fixed with mods. Any horror gamer out there needs to give this game a shot. It will give you the creeps and that is something that a lot of modern horror games do not do that well at. The RPG mechanics means that there is no incorrect way to play. Do you want to be a magic user? Go with the psionic abilities. wanna be a tanky warrior? Go with physical attributes. there are many different ways you can go about System Shock 2 and it always feels fresh.			"

												Ladies and gentlemen, at long last, the game the Steam community has been screaming and beating at the windows for, System Shock 2. The spiritual predeccessor to the BioShock franchise, this game has been updated to be played on our ludicrously powered gaming computers. If you're someone who can appreciate the classics, and have an approximate IQ of 204, this game is the bread to your buttah. As far as I'm aware, the game is still only 5 bucks, and it literally takes 4 minutes to download on a 2 MB internet connection, but it is HARD. Literally, you need to be so ridiculously serious about playing this game to get through the whole thing. Think prying off your toenails one at a time, but with a disembodied voice giving you Cybernetic Modules for every successful toe. If you do everything correctly and learn what to do, it's a very rewarding game, for coming out before I was born.			"

												I picked this up off Steam hoping to fill the Bioshock void that Infinite left. It actually had a bit of a different feel than Bioshock, but it was just as good. I think this game was a bit ahead of its time and I can see why fans of this game complained that Bioshock was too “dumbed down” when it came out. There’s way more skill customization and RPG elements in System Shock 2 than Bioshock, which I like. You can upgrade your character’s hacking skill or repairing skill or shooting skill etc. to fit your playstyle. Kind of like Deus Ex. It has the same horror tone and atmosphere from the first Bioshock games, but more futuristic sci-fi Alien-ish horror than 1920s gone wrong. The only sort of problem with this game is that it’ll feel a bit dated. The voice acting is completely laughable and it’s in that early era of 3d PC games where everything looks really blocky and low-res. Which actually can be just as horrifying when you can’t quite tell what you’re looking at when a blocky monster jumps out at you. Check this out if you like Deus ex, Bioshock, old PC games or horror games in general.For more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/ "

												This game is all about atmosphere.  The game is old (so last century!) but it has a look.  The audio is edgy with a good mix of underplayed music and deeply scarey sound effects.  The story is involving and is told through well acted audio logs - some of which are quite affecting - and the fragments and remains of people's lives you discover as you explore the ship.  You are able to customize your character as the game proceeds but your resources are scarce, so you frequently have difficult decisions to make.  The choices you make will materially affect the way the game plays and the tactics you need to adopt.  All this makes for a great game and one I have no hessiation in recommding.  Try it, join us.

Look at you hacker, a pathetic creature of meat and bone.A true masterpiece from 1999, that manages to hold up to this day. Playing through this for the first time in 2014, I finally get to experience the game that helped shape all the other great FPS/RPG's that came after it. System Shock 2 is an atmospheric Sci-Fi survival experience with lots of exploration and great combat. The game will have you sweating and at the edge of your seat more than once, when you slowly make your way through poorly lit corridors, with strange noises coming from behind every corner and out of every computer terminal. Ammo is scarce, the environment is hostile and health is hard to come by. The sound design is nothing short of amazing and is responsible for the majority of the thrilling atmosphere. Well voice acted audio logs help you connect the dots on what exactly it was that has happened to the spaceship van Braun as you try and make your way through the ship. Chills run down your spine whenever the A.I. of the ship starts talking - and it is not the only one talking to you. The level design is pretty open since you can and will go back to previously visited sectors at some point, even if it is only to pick up that last chemical substance you need in order to complete the research on that foreign object you found on the engineering deck...I highly recommend playing the game with all the great texture mods and model upgrades that the active community has provided over the years, as those updates stay very true to the feel of the original ones but give the game a nice, sharp look.I found the updated graphics to be pretty good, comparable to Deus Ex and Alien vs. Predator 2. Just look through the guides on where to find and how to install everything in the community hub.Overall a highly recommendable experience, especially if you can pick it up on a sale. If you can bare with the somewhat dated graphics, you are in for a memorable piece of gaming history.			"

												The atmosphere in this game alone is a great reason to buy it, but it adds so much more by tight controls (when you rebind them of course, WASD wasn't prominent when this game was made), expansive RPG elements, easy modding, an intricate storyline, and best of all, the kind of horror you can get from this game on singleplayer. It really makes you feel alone, and fearing that your next step may be your last. I highly recommend this game, but play it on singleplayer if you want the horror.			"

												While other ""classic"" premodern games such as Half-life and Deus Ex feel very dated which dims their kickassery, System Shock 2's steam release feels like a modern indie game, although with actual ambition in story telling. I never played this game at all before 2010 but a rush of protonostalgia came over just hearing shodan's voice, which obviously inspired GladOS in a few ways or another. Many people say that Bioshock is the descendant of System Shock, Bioshock felt very spartan in gameplay, as SS2 gives you options of weapons (Half-Life playstyle), hacking (Deus Ex playstyle) and the most unique psy, which has a whole variety of unique high risk/high reward powers that were missing in Bioshock, as with plasmids I felt like I was just hurling different versions of the same attack at my enemies. Now I don't have a ♥♥♥♥ing clue what led to the general Paradigm shift in game settings, but I think a few more games set in space or with a genre-mash set in space (a la Cowboy Bebop) could spice up the medival RPG and 'Middle Eastern Conflict between America and Insurgents/Russia/SovietBlock neorussian confedarcy (SBNC) or whatever COD:Ghost entails.10/10			"

												System Shock 2 has been received as one of the best games ever made and after thoroughly playing through it I can see why. Playing System Shock 2 after the BioShock games you can clearly see many similar elements that were taken into the BioShock series (security turrets, hypos, upgrade and vending machines, psionic powers, similar level designs).The general game can take roughly 25 to 40 hours to complete providing a solid and enjoyable playthrough. Reading up on the game prior to playing it, it has been described as an action sci-fi RPG and has been praised for successfully blending all of those elements together. You get various skills, abilities and traits which can be upgraded by obtaining cyber modules. Cyber modules are hard to come by so you should have in mind a style of play you want to act out prior to playing. The scope of the items and weapons that are featured in this game is astonishing and even after one playthrough there is still a number of weapons and items to experience. This as well as upgrading your character with other psionic abilities adds to System Shock 2's replayability.The game requires you to conserve important items such as ammunition, med hypos, psy hypos and auto-diagnostic repair kits in order for you to have an easier time near the end of the game. Even when I thought I had plenty of these items at the end, I was amazed at how quick they diminished and beat the game with a struggle.The only gripe I had with this game was the multiplayer since I couldn't experience it due to not knowing anyone else who plays the game. The multiplayer has two options which are 'Host a Game' and 'Join a Game'. I cannot host a game if I don't know anyone else who plays it and to join a game you require the host's IP Address. However, I am not too fussed about the multiplayer, since the main game is fantastic.System Shock 2 really is one of the best games ever made and everyone should play it. You can play the sequel even if you haven't played the first game because all of the story is told to you in a nutshell. Buy this game during a sale when it is really cheap. The retail version boxed and in a good condition is difficult to find these days so do yourself a favour and purchase it on Steam before they take down another brilliant game from the Steam Store.

												System Shock 2 is, without a doubt, one of the most challenging and *literally* physically straining games that I have ever played. Any fans of Sci-fi, horror, or games like Dead Space and Bioshock should definitely give it a try. My own terrifying playthrough was 13 hours of hell. Instead of relying on jump scares, System Shock 2 prefers to latch on to your sanity and slowly pry. While the enemies aren't the most terrifying or challenging, your scenario is. Being completely alone an a vessel floating in the far reaches of space doesn't help put the mind at ease. The DETERIORATION of your weapons, to the point where they jam and are rendered useless, not to mention the scarcity of ammunition provides a healthy amount of fear. Health is also scarce, and it takes time to build skills for more efficient playing. Transversing the sheer magnitude of the Von Braun, entirely on foot, while avoiding enemies as much as possible made me tense enough to require regular chiropractic visits for the rest of my life. Not really, but it feels like it. Lastly, SHODAN's voice always haunts you, taunts you, breaks you. She never stops and she's always one step ahead. This game is a truly horrifying experience.			"

												OK, yes the graphics are dated. You don't have full dismemberment, bullet time or realistic dog and fish physics, but you know what? You don't need it. What you do get is a fully customizable character. Wanna blow you're enemies apart with psychic powers? go ahead! Wanna be a bad♥♥♥♥♥space marine that blows away enemies with state of the art weaponry go ahead. A pipe-wrench wielding maniac who also happens to be a tech genius and expert hacker? Sure thing.You are literally able to be almost anything in this game. Add to that enemies right out of HR Geiger's wetdreams and storyline that makes dealing with GLaDOS, Hal 9000, or Xenomorphs look like a walk in the park and you've got this game.No cover, friendly computer controlled teammates to help you out in fire fights, or aiming assist, you are on your own. If you want a great shooter with an RPG element which inspired Bioshock. then this is the game for you. Prepare to lose several hours of your life and be better for it.Have fun...insects. "

												System shock 2 is one of my all time favorites. If you can't tolerate the older graphics then just get an HD mod. Its graphics are aged alittle but its still a very effective survival horror, very easy to forget theres an enemy with a shotgun around the corner. Replays are fun because you can choose to take a different field and challenge yourself. OSA being the hardest possible class to choose. (Note too novices. play the game on navy or marine. Its the best ones to get used to the system shock world with.)You'll find this game as a classic, the kinda feeling you get when you play deus ex or half life.			"

												Ah, the predecessor of the BioShock games. I had this game ages ago, but I got too scared to play it. It's quite a scary game, even by today's standards. During the summer sale, there was a big discount so I decided to give it another go. Mind, I've barely touched it so far.Well, first of all I'd like to mention something that's frustrating to say the least. Supposedly, there's an auto-save feature, but it doesn't seem to work as you might expect. Manually saving the game is not what you usually think of in the heat of the moment. You get resurrected if you locate certain pods, but they cost credits to use. What happens if you have no credits? Game over. Yeah, that's right. If you've played BioShock Infinite, you should know about ""1999 mode"". The reference seems obvious now.A thing I notice in this game, is that it has a whole lot in common with the BioShock games, but there's a lot more. There are just so many mechanics in this game that it's easy to get a bit overwhelmed. There's a tutorial and heaps of in-game help, but it's quite staggering. I've yet to figure it all out.Other than these annoyances, this game has kept up very well. The UI isn't quite up to par, combat feels a bit clunky, and in general the game feels aged, but so does Half-Life. It feels a lot like Half-Life, just with all the RPG elements known from BioShock mixed in.So, can I recommend it? I have to say yes - if you aren't deterred by old school games.Update: They're a bit of a hassle to install, but there are some mods out there that makes this game prettier. See http://blog.pcgamingwiki.com/modding-guide/821/system-shock-2-steam-modding-guide for more information. Note that the mods seem to work without manually installing the mentioned tool. Hopefully we'll see this game featured in Steam Workshop eventually.			"

The atmosphere, voice acting and music are at times downright chilling. The huge amount of skills to choose from, and hundreds of ways to make your character, as well as the (Not easy to get to work, but a blast if you do) multiplayer ensure that the game is practically a must-have for any cyberpunk and horror fan, especially the people that love Bioshock.

Now I don't have a ♥♥♥♥ing clue what led to the general Paradigm shift in game settings, but I think a few more games set in space or with a genre-mash set in space (a la Cowboy Bebop) could spice up the medival RPG and 'Middle Eastern Conflict between America and Insurgents/Russia/SovietBlock neorussian confedarcy (SBNC) or whatever COD:Ghost entails.10/10			"

												Need to confess that the main reason to afford this game were the summer sale. As a bit afraid that the same reaction that I had playing the first Deus Ex , the feeling that the game grew too old. How wrong I was...Too be fair I had two issues with the game, right from the start  the feel of a 90´s game is define by the huge amount of info that this RPG thows at you without a proper tutorial and also I felt that the game extended itself too long.Regardless, for a huge bioshock fan as myself this is was an awesome purchase.

Probably one of the titles that inspired much of modern game design, but there isn't much to say now. Too bad I missed it during it's time.			"

												Look at you, hacker. A pathetic creature of meat and bone. Panting and sweating as you run through my corridors. How can you challenge a perfect immortal machine?There are three kinds of gamer, Those who haven't played System Shock 2, those who didn't complete System Shock 2, and those who did manage to perform the damn near impossible.I am in that latter category, and I deserve a ♥♥♥♥ing prize, because I pulled it off back in 2002, and it's not gotten any easier.System Shock 2 is set forty-two years after the events of the original, and is a shining example of FPS-RPG done correctly, and valid candidate for the greatest game sequel of all time.The game is if you hadn't figured, incredibly difficult, and if you plan to breeze through it, you're going to dealt the bloodiest nose you've ever had.Three years ago, you decided to enlist in the UNN, In either the Navy, the Marines, or the O.S.A, This is your fourth year, and you were assigned to the UNN Rickenbacker, a ship piggybacking with the Von Braun, mankind's first FTL ship on it's maiden voyage.A few months into this journey, for reasons unknown to yourself, you wake up in a cryo-tube, with the foul smell of death in the air, feeling like you've got the worst hangover of all time, with all kinds of technology lodged into your brain, it doesn't take long for you to realise that something has gone very wrong indeed.That's enough foreshadowing, let's talk functionality.The graphics have the 90s problem of early 3D, everything looks like a polygon with textures thrown onto it, this can be fixed with mods, and I may write a guide with my own recommendations, but that's for another time.Right from the get-go there are problems with the controls, and a lot of problems at that, because rebinding the controls can break other things, so you might want to look up a guide before playing, that's the issue with rushed games, you can blame Electronic Arts for that.If you're still here after all that, I do recommend the game, It's pretty damn good, if not a bit broken.

												I played SS2 'back then' and loved it ... nothing has changed!The atmosphere, the game play and the story are awesome. when you invest some time, you can add graphic mods, so it doesn't look 'that outdated' anymore. but even w/o such goodies, it's still a great game.It has to be said though, that it's not a Doom-like shooter where you have almost unlimited ammo and your goal is it to kill tons of enemies. it's a survival game, where you have limited powers. you can choose between different skills, which it makes 'RPG-like'. you also need to upgrade/repair your weapons, so you really have to think, what you do with your resources.The only thing i regret, is putting it on my wish list and waited for a sale, so i can save a few bucks (instead of buying it for 'full price', which is it worth).

												The original game was a cult classic and still is, however it is rather hard to play due to it being DOS based.The second game picks up 4 decades after the original game left off, you pick from 3 different military paths with each giving you different stat boosts based on your mission choices. The graphics may be aged for today's standards but they do give you a feeling of fear, awe and wonder as you turn around that next corner only to find a zombie with a shotgun or a turret blasting you in the face with minigun rounds. Pros:You get a wrench to smash enemies with.Later on you get a lazer sword, Psi blade and Power Armor.A choice of stats at the begining of the game, depending on player desision.A gripping, suspense filled game experience.You get guns, even big guns and even a grenade launcher.You can have Psionic Powers which are badass.Cons:Limited Inventory Space untill you find upgrades which can be hard to find.You will usually come across locked doors or crates or need psionic powers that you don't have to get loot or ammo.You have very limited ammo.Psionic Powers have a limit and you can hurt yourself with prolonged use (Burnout)On Hard or Impossible, enemies can one shot you.Pros and Cons aside, the game is cyberpunk awesomeness and everyone who is a sci-fi or a horror fan should consider getting this game.

												This is one of those ""grandpa games."" A game that stands above the rest and has aged wonderfully. To this day, many games use it's mechanics and elements and you can clearly see where Bioshock and it's sequels got it's inspiration. Luckily, the difficulty is blasted into Mach III relative to the Bioshocks. Ammo is sparse, the guns are made of wood, you die very easily, and the world is hostile and brutal. The good thing is, when you die, you're most likely going to blame yourself rather than the game, considering how smooth movement and combat is. This game is a must have.

												After playing through this game, I've been left to wonder. Why is it that such an old title, with outdated graphics and such simple AI, is by far more stress inducing and more terrifying than most current horror games? Seriously, this game had me terrified as I ran around trying to determine whether or not it was safe for me to try opening up my inventory to repair my weapons. The enemies are a constant threat, as most of them will respawn indefinately, so there is always some voice screaming in your ear, and you'll have no way to gauge where it's coming from. Weapons have a degredation system, and slowly break down with use, so you'll find yourself either throwing weapons away constantly, sticking to the few weapons that don't degrade, or scanning the area frantically for maintenance tools and working on your repair skill. SHODAN and the Many as the two primary antagonists are absolutely fantastic, and will fascinate, terrify, and aggrivate you throughout the game.If there was anything that I had any real problem with, it would be the AI, as enemy patterns are incredibly easy to figure out, and there are some real simple tricks in certain areas to prevent them from attacking at all, (although I won't say what they are), but the need to explore should get you past that issue, and quite frankly, the AI, despite being now quite old, is still leagues better than some other fps and horror games I've played.I seriously recommend this one, as it is by far a true gaming masterpiece and classic. Play it! PLAY i-it Noooowww Meat.			"

												This is the best FPS survival horror game of all times. Period. I still remember how the story completely blew my mind when playing the game first time - something that hasn't really happened before or since. This game is also genuinely scary, especially when you ramp the difficulty up into ""impossible"". No cheap jump scares, though.The only major flaw in this game is that it is finite and it ends eventually, and due to the mess-up with rights, a worthy sequel is not coming any time soon if ever. Fortunately, the rich character development system offers good replayability and the game can be played over and over again.But seriously, it's not perfect but then again what is? The last third of the game was rushed up development, but at that point you want to know how the story ends so bad that it doesn't really matter.			"

												Fantastic game! It's no wonder that this game was made from the amazing creators of the original thief game with the brilliant thinking behind the creator of the bioshock trilogy. If you enjoy old retro games like me such as hl1, Deus Ex, and thief then you'll absolutely love this game! This is almost like dead space only not as scary but much more depth. There are so many options to choose from being a gun man like me or a psychic or a bralwer. The story is really good and there is plenty of extra content to be found in the game. The game play is simple yet extremely fun. The ship is huge which means plenty of content to go round and explore. There is nothing bad I can say about this game! Though I will add that I highly reccomend playing it with the mod version so it looks even shinyer but you can play it just fine without it. Go ahead and go deep into space and face the unknown! This is game really deserves a reboot!			"

I loved it back then, and I still love it now. I'm on maybe my fifth of sixth playthrough of this game (since it first came out) and have to say that it has lost little of its power over the years - it's still a tense and rewarding experience to play even now.

												SS2 is as much fun to play now as when it came out. Ahead of it's time, allot of the game mechanics it invented are now standard for first person games. And with the Steam version being updated to run solidly on modern systems, this plays like its a few years old not the hidden gem from 1999 it is. The graphics hold it back, the model and textures look very dated but the games atmosphere is so well crafted that it doesn't hurt the experience. And this game has atmosphere. This is not the flashlight in a dark hospital school of modern horror games. SS2 makes it's monsters feel like a real force in a real world. A walk around disaster movie. With guns. And cyborgs!The real beauty of SS2, what earns it it's £6 price tag, is it's story. No mission logs or quest markers here. Tasks are driven by the story and coloured by a host of well written fully voiced characters. Right from the start your hooked in, desperate to survive with the key to your survival (and the bigger mystery of what exactly is going on) always feeling like its just through the next airlock. If you like games like Bio Shock, Half-life & Dead Space you can't go wrong with this game. Buckle up hacker, this is gonna be one hell of a ride.     "

												I was surprised. Really. The game is old, but the gameplay aged so well it only needs a texture pack for a great experience.Apart from that, it's a known classic I shouldn't have to introduce. And it's genius on many levels. I can understand now why Bioshock was regarded by SS2 fans as a downgrade. Maybe the end was a little disappointing (the great reveal of SHODAN plans and the last boss were quite disappointing and not really explained well), but nevertheless it was a great experience. RPG elements are solid. Shooting is not as bad as it could be. Horror elements build suspense and atmosphere. A must-play for anyone who wants to know the roots of current games, as System Shock 2 inspired many. It's not long, but leaves a powerful impression.			"

												Very hesitant recommendation. On one hand, it has an excellent atmosphere and intriguing lore as well as very deep character customization. On the other hand, it has some serious pacing issues, especially near the end (ie ""You need to get to Point A but first you have to perform action B by opening Door C with a key you find in section D on corpse E""). The Dark Engine holds up remarkably well for the environments though, even though the humanoid character models are bocky as all hell. I'll say it's ultimately worth it, but it's a 7/10 from someone who never played it when it was first released. Solid game in most respects but certain elements have aged poorly.			"

Like an immersion into a VR reality the ambiance and feel to this game is greatly enhanced by the voice overs and sound effects. To the point that the incessant alarms in some areas will actually make you angry ina good way.....Cheers to Bundle Stars and Steam for helping keep classics like these alive and available for generations to come.

												It feels strange writing a review for an almost 16 year old game, and everyone else has already said what a masterpeice it is, so I'll keep this review short. Everything about this game is amazing and near perfection, and if you like Bioshock or Thief or really any RPS/Horror game, then you will most definitely enjoy it. I would recommend listening to the top rated review and turn off the music, as well as installing the mod packs if you don't like the original look/You have a high-end display. One last thing is that, for some reason, the cutscenes didn't play for me. Talking to other people, they said either it was because the codec messed up while playing the game, Windows Media Player screwed it up, or it is simply because the game was made for 9x systems and I am playing it on Windows 7 (NT). If this happens to you, I guess you could just watch them on Youtube or play them from the Cutscenes folder (C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\ss2\cutscenes). I also encountered one or two small bugs, like an invincible spider, but nothing too extreme or game breaking.			"

												This is truly an amazing game from start to finish. Despite it's age, it still manages to be a deep and engaging gameplay experience which influenced the horror genre as a whole since it's release. It is a cult classic which failed to sell as well as it deserved when it was first released, but those that did buy into it at the time almost unanimously agreed that it was a great experience. While the gameplay is admittedly more clunky than most modern games, it still functions well and doesn't have too steep of a learning curve, allowing for relative ease of use. The only real drawback in this regard being it's rather odd default control bindings which will doubtlessly be very uncomfortable for anyone used to modern controls. For all I know, they may even be unusual by the standards of the time in which it was released. This issue is easiy solved by going through the controls and rebinding them to your liking. I most definitely did this.It's atmosphere is incredibly well-maintained, never breaking and remaining consistent throguhout the game. The events occuring within the game are somewhat plausible too, and don't feel entirely impossible, further adding to the dread that it will instill into those who play it. The game's ""fear-factor"" doesn't lie in producing outright terror in those that play it, but rather in gradually exposing the player to increasingly disturbing events and revealing the backstory regarding how these events took place over time through the use of audio logs. Needless to say, it was this game that popularized the use of audio logs and many other elements in the BioShock games.All in all, it's an amazing game that you should most definitely check out if you have the moeny for it. And be sure to look up mods for it. They can really polish the game up and make it all that much more enjoyable.			"

												This game is perfect in alot of ways. It has elements that games do not have in games today. When you play this game you feel isolated and puny. When you start the game you will be a weakling with barely any good weapons, but once you work on through the game you will become a walking death machine. This is an older game so it will need some modding to make it look better on higer resolution monitors and computers. This game is worth the money, trust me!			"

												I still have my original box this came in back when it was first released. System Shock 2 cemented my love for PC games and left me wanting more than what I was getting out of quake series at the time. This had sci-fi and horror, it had survival and rpg element, it had a superb story and forever changed how I wanted to play from then on.This is the game that made me excited for the industry and eager to see where it would go. Sadly there have been few games that I would say live up to my expections after playing this. It's obvious the people who made it were passionate about System Shock 2 and it shows.It might be a bit dated by today's standards but if you can look past that, and take your time to absorb the entire experience I think you will be pleasantly surprised. To this day, the sound of those monkeys creep me out.			"

												I bought System Shock 2 as soon as Star Insurance announced Linux support on the news page. I had heard nothing but wonderful things about the game and was excited to play it. Despite a rough start getting the game to run in widescreen mode, I eventually managed to switch to 1080p and started to play.I can now say that it is nothing short of a masterpiece! The kicker for me is the spectacular audio design combined with the dark, brooding atmosphere. As opposed to what many others have said, I actually really loved the fast-paced electro music once I turned the volume down a bit. Since the music usually starts up in areas swarming with enemies, it really gets your muscles on edge and your mind alert as you shakily turn the claustrophobic corners, always low on health and on your last clip, not knowing what lays in the dark corridor ahead. And SHODAN's distorted, seductive voice crackling over the PA forcing you to do her bidding is just... wow!Beware, the gameplay is really complex and doesn't hold your hand; you may not even like it the first time. I only played for about 2 hours, on and off, before I set it down and forgot about it for a few weeks. Feeling bored one day, I decided to try it again. Now I've clocked in at around 10 hours already! The game ""clicked"" for me when I listened to all the audio logs in a secluded safe spot where I could finally let my guard down.Now that I have grown accustomed to System Shock 2's unique and multifaceted gameplay and appreciated the storyline that envelops it, I can safely say that this is the best video game I have ever played! I heartily recommend it. Buy it now, and join the Many.Linux users note:When it comes to graphical quality (this game is from '99 after all), mods are your friend! Turn on bloom and HDR by tweaking the ""cam_ext.cfg"" file, and install quality mods like SHTUP in ""~/.systemshock2/systemshock2/drive_c/Program Files/SystemShock2/DataPermMods"".			"

												Hell, yes, do I recommend this game!But please keep in mind, that it was released in 1999. Graphics at this time relied stronger on your sense of imagination than today!But if you want to play the grand father of Dead Space and Bioshock and have a look, what ancient knowledge these games remember (and which they did forget!), then this is the adress to go to!Story writing of System Shock is on eye level with stuff like Dead Space 1. Not great, but definetely servicable. Voice acting is great (and everything is voice acted!).The graphics are... well... ancient. But work well enough as to not being confusing. You will be able to tell apart enemies from kitchen wear.The game mechanics are... awesome! Really, not by 1999 standards, but by today's standards. You got different weapon types, you can specialize on, different psy abilities, you might learn, but you also have to learn, how to maintain and repair your equipment. You need to manage your resources... honestly: Quite a few of today's survival games should REALLY have a close look on System Shock 2 and reconsider their mechanics!So, good game with lots of nostalgia value (remember the waxd as your default move keys?). Play it, if haven't already. That is, if you are into shooters and you can stand the rather old graphics. Check them out, before you buy the game.For those, who want to try it out, here are's a word of advice, so you don't mess up your character and have to start over again:-The most powerful weapons in the game are the pistol, the grenade launcher (and to a smaller degree the shotgun). Learn to use these and don't mind about the other weapons, unless you got some leftover points late in the game.-Psy is funny, but not that powerful. Don't spend too much on it. Cyber affinity is a must have, though.-Hacking is very useful! Lvl 4 is recommended. Repair 1 is the only thing you need for the important weapons. Maintenance needs a few points.-I didn't find the stats, besides strength all that useful.-Save ammo and nanites, whenever you can! There are a few rather tough sections during which you'll go through your resources as if you there'd be no tomorrow! Make sure, you got some!Otherwise... there are plenty of ways to play the game (even pure psy run-throughs oO), though some are more difficult than other. But, hey! Try to find your own way through the Von Braun ;)			"

												System Shock 2 builds tension more effectively than any other game I've played. It accomplishes this without cheap thrills, instead relying on ambient sound and voice acting. The level design outclasses any single player first person game ever, creating the actual sensation of navigating a real spacecraft. Levels are functional, large, and require intelligence to complete. Whereas many games today create memorable moments by granting the player extraordinary powers, System Shock 2 chooses to oppress the player - thrusting him or her into a hostile environment and demanding clever play in order to survive. There is an amazing formula at work here that deserves an entire sub-genre of replicas.			"

What I liked about the game 	Ahead of its time. System shock 2 is such a complex game, which offers loads of replayability. There are three career paths to choose from; O.S.A, Navy and Marines. I choose the navy. Each career path concentrates on a set of skills, like weapons, psionics, tech and character statistics. If you wanted you could mix it up a bit. Throughout the game you will find cybernetic modules which you can use to upgrade your character. 	Good soundtrack, adds to the atmosphere. 	You can research enemies, weapons, temporary power ups and other things in the game, which is really cool. Sometimes the research requires chemicals, which you can find in the chemical repositories.	Brilliant story. I like idea of the Van buuren sending a ship down to investigate Talos 5 to see if there's life and then all of a sudden the species starts to take over the ship and uses humans as hosts[/spolier].	 The game has awesome artificial intelligence characters like Shodan and Xermes. 	You can find logs throughout the game, which tell you what was going on with each character. Exploration is very rewarding. 	Awesome training section at the start.  	A great arsenal of weapons to choose from, which have different ammo types and the weapons can be modified. 	Impressive level design, with great lighting effects. You can also revisit levels as well. What I disliked or was disappointed with (nitpicking)	No flashlight. It's sometimes hard to see in some areas. 	When using the shotgun and the machine gun you can't see the players hand on the gun and it is the same even when you are reloading. 	It's a shame you can't see the modifications made to the guns.	Sometimes it can be confusing where to go next. 	Shame you can't hack cameras. Conclusion A fantastic game. Like I said so complex for its time, especially for an FPS. It's up there with Half-life and bioshock in my opinion. If you like half-life, Deus ex or you're a Sci-fi fan, then I highly recommend you buy this game. 94/100 "

												Fantastic game! Prepare yourself to board the Von Braun, the first spaceship that can go faster than light. The problem is that the ship's AI, Xerxes, went mad when parasitic aliens came aboard the ship. You are alone, thousands of lightyears from Earth, and you need to survive this mess, and the only thing you have for yourself are your newly installed cybernetic implants. Uncover the truth throught a fantastic plot while surviving to the aliens that claimed the ship as their new home and the army of robots controlled by Xerxes. And be ensured that it wont be an easy task! The game can be extremly hard, making for great challenges and violent fights. Only your guns, psionic powers, tactics and cybernetic upgrades will allow you to end this nightmare. All of this witrh a smooth yet hardcore RPG gameplay, fantastic storyline and a great atmosphere. A classic, you need to play it!			"

												Very hesitant recommendation. On one hand, it has an excellent atmosphere and intriguing lore as well as very deep character customization. On the other hand, it has some serious pacing issues, especially near the end (ie ""You need to get to Point A but first you have to perform action B by opening Door C with a key you find in section D on corpse E""). The Dark Engine holds up remarkably well for the environments though, even though the humanoid character models are bocky as all hell. I'll say it's ultimately worth it, but it's a 7/10 from someone who never played it when it was first released. Solid game in most respects but certain elements have aged poorly.			"

												This game was recommended to me, because of my love for bioshock. This was an amazing game...... for its time, I Enjoyed the game, but i think it grew stale for me, as I got further into the game. Never finished it, and though I can appreciate how great of a game this is, its worth noting that it lacks a good storyline, and the gameplay with a keyboard is pretty awful, I had to map all my keys because of the ridiculous key mapping. This is a game from the late 90's so to much isn't to be expected anymore, but if you love this game nostalgically, and have been a PC gamer since this games release, this a great game to visit. For me...... to old and outdated to appreciate.			"

Enjoyable, even for a person who doesn't play a ton of games (I don't often have time to play much, but upon starting this up I spent three hours on it in one go.) Definitely a must play if you're looking for a quality classic.			"

												What can I say I love this game it is one of my all-time favourite games it is simply brilliant.There are lots of mods out for System Shock 2 and there are also some tools to fix the game sorting out some issues it would have on modern P.C systems.There are things in this game that still make me jump all these years later.You can choose to upgrade your skills and there are stacks of skills to upgrade in addition to that there's lots of hacking to do and loads of freaks to kill.Being stealthy is very important in your style of gameplay because if you just rush headlong into some areas of the game the turrets will take you out.Another very important thing to remember is that if the cameras spot you the alarm systems will go crazy and if that happens then you can almost be overrun by (The Many), but once the alarm system resets then the onslaught subsides,You also have the option of choosing what style of play you want to start with and this is based on the career that you choose after you have been through basic and advanced training.Another point about the game that I really like is that you have to maintain your weapons repairing them otherwise they start to jam and can become useless. You can also upgrade your skills in this area of the game as well.You can play the game on one of several different difficulty levels and the harder the level the more scarce things become, things like ammo, nanites and cyber modules etc.So if you really like a challenge try it out on hard mode and oh yes there is also an impossible mode.You should spend some serious time playing System Shock 2 it's a great game and you will have a tremendous time, trust me, Insect.Remember Shodan is watching!You can download some great mods from here: https://www.systemshock.org/index.php "

												I've had recommendations to play this game for years now, it was a classic I missed when it came out, and didn't bother to try until now. I now regret never having played this game before. System Shock 2 is so good it transcends the boundries of time. If it was released in 2013 it'd still be one of the best games of the year. If you like the Bioshock series, this is a must buy. I dare say it is better than its spirtual sequels. The atmosphere it creates, the story it tells, are worth it alone. But it is the amazing gameplay that has you surviving each encounter only through your wits and detailed resource management  that really pulls this game together. This game should have been on Steam from its inception.			"

												A really, really good game! Fantastic atmosphere and writing, and the gameplay itself has held up surprisingly well.However, all the available customization is poorly balanced and it would be wise to consult some kind of walkthrough (shodanpedia had a lot of useful information for me) so that you dont gimp yourself by mistake. For example, there is a lot of support to play through the entire game with a heavily melee-focused character, but melee weapons literally cant hurt the end boss. The game is great If you avoid digging your own grave through the customization. I went with a very conventional character focussing on standard and heavy weapons with a few points in Research, and i had a great time! Quake with more resource-management and better writing, essentially.			"

												At first I wanted to quit because it was too scary. Next I wanted to quit because it was too hard. Then i never wanted to quit because i finally understood what this game was.Great.Besides it's dated graphics (which can be fixed via mods if you are so inclined) the game holds up very well. The gameplay is somewhat similar to the skill development, difficult combat, and exploration of dark souls aswell as RPG elements found in fallout. Combat is also similar to it's spirital sucessor Bioshock. The fantastic story is presented through audio logs and radio communication but don't be mistaken, you work alone. One of my ""new"" favorite games of all time. Better save your ammo because you're in for a hell of a ride.			"

												I'm almost finished with this game and am so glad I found it. It's become one of my favorites. It's intelligent and challenging, always in a good way. There's an incredible amount of detail in the backstory and setting, and everything makes sense in a plausible way -- a refreshing break from the mess I've seen in other games that feel like a bunch of mismatching pieces thrown together. You can tell that a lot of care and hard work went into creating this.My advice: Read some reviews and tips before starting. This doesn't play like your dime-a-dozen Dead Space or Resident Evil and if you treat it that way, you'll get frustrated and quit. People who say they don't want to play SS2 because they're turned off by the graphics are really missing out. Don't let the fact that it looks a little dated turn you away from such an awesome experience.			"

												Finished the game at exactly 25 hours, but it was a jam-packed 25 hours.The ending was terrible, but other than that, this game is great! Bioshock was good, but System Shock 2, despite being 8 years earlier, is so much better. It's short enough to play a second time, and you might want to, as the story keeps you on your toes and there are at least 4 different experiences of the gameplay to have, since you have total control over your character's stats and proficiencies... and they matter!Some people complain about difficulty, but I've found it pretty reasonable even on hard, just expect that you WILL die... save often as there's not really an auto-quicksave, and try to conserve your ammo. It's not like Resident Evil in terms of ammo scarcity, the game is pretty generous in resources, but you don't want to run out all the same. It's an RPG, so choose your skills wisely and you'll be fine.Be warned; Since the game is set on a large spaceship where areas become unlocked as you progress, there can be a lot of backtracking to get certain items that are only found on a previous deck. There's a mod that reduces the amount of enemy respawns that happen, which I found made the game a lot more enjoyable, so consider using that if you're getting ticked off with clearing the same areas out over and over. Another good mod is one that increases the durability of weapons, since on default they tend to break just a little too much for my liking.Either way, the game is best enjoyed when modded to update its graphics and fix bugs. Just follow  this guide  and remember to set up your controls as the default ones are terrible.Also, I want to be the first to say: Prefontaine is very clearly Richard Dawkins. I'm really surprised this wasn't said at some point since the game's release. He talks about the biology and evolution of the creatures and looks exactly like one of Dawkin's Photos. Same haircut and neutral frown. "

												There is no need for me to recommend System Shock 2 - it is an experience every  gamer should make. There are already many praises of atmosphere and gameplay out there, so I thought I just share some memories of my three playthroughs.There have been years between each single one, the first shortly after its release in late 1999, the second one a few years later and the final one I just finished recently. But every time I had a vastly different gaming experience, as if I played three games instead of the same. I still remember how I got SS2, because it was an impulse buy during a trip to the UK. I played what I always felt was the definite way - a Navy Hacker focussed on stealth who avoided most fights after I learned early on that fighting without skills is bad. I got so many ressources that I had to make the med bay my personal storage room. But this way I had enough Anti Personal Ammo that I even enjoyed the later parts of the game.My second encounter with the game was as a Marine shooting himself through the Van Braun.  The game was easier, but less open crates meant less ammunition and I remember running away from spiders and rumblers because I had only my wrench left - until I found more explosives!O.S.A. psyops always intimidated me because I thought there were not enough Cybernetic Moduls to get core abilities plus psy ones. While true, you do not need many skills like repair at all when you can make yourself invisible or turn the enemies against themselves. And you can be a master of the melee combat through stacking temporary buffs which is rewarding and saves ammo.Three different playthroughs, three vastly different playstyles, one game: play Shock2! (it even looks ok with mods, I promise)			"

												System Shock 2 is well awarded (7 GOTY) classic -99 FPS/Horror/RPG title. Setup is pretty much abadoned space ship, player being against it's memorable antagonist SHODAN. You need to run around to find stuff, keys, messages, see past ghosts of past and such to survive and win.Also, know that fans have created sequel campaing of some sort called System Shock Infinite (total conversion mod. I havent played it yet though, but i'm about to try it) About the main game:It assumes player having own brain and knows how to use it. This has apparently caused a lot of comical negative reviews, most of them consisting about;- People not figuring out how to configure buttons in main menu (fyi, strafe=slide)- People bying SS2 and complaining that it is not Deus Ex, even title says SS2.- People who are unable to read maps, not knowing where to go. I wonder how these guys deal with RL.- Game being too hard. (Pro tip: Take easy right from start if you are first timer)- Complaining about gun getting jammed without giving a thought that you can have a skill to repair and maintance it.- People getting attacked by spawning monsters. You know, you can head to safe spots/rooms to do what you want, without being interrupted.What however is true and often mentioned is somewhat clunky movement. Some systems also do experience technical issues and coop multiplayer is buggy. This game is also more slow paced for average player than most shooters. I would recommended to play with graph mods nowdays and that unfortunately needs a bit of fiddling, but there are guides for it in commynity hub. Otherwise expect graph look like Quake 2 and you are just fine.SS2 has been one of my personal favourites for a long time, and still is. Waiting with excitment for SS3 which got confirmed not long time ago.			"

A great combination of FPS and RPG, with a vast selection of skills, limited number of points to spend in them, a few Big upgrades (16 choices, you get to pick either 2 or 3 throughout the game), a wide variety of weapons and enemies to kill with them.  An amazing story portrayed to the player through recordings left around by members of the crew.  Even better,  the graphics have been updated to fit current resolutions in addition to the old ones (Yes, 1650x1080 is supported!)  Get this game.  Get it right now.  No, stop reading this, and get the game.  WHY HAVEN'T YOU CLICKED BUY YET??			"

												System shock 2 is one of those games where playing it twice is a no go. Because it is so epic and deep that its just kind of an effort to play again. But if you want a game with a scary atmosphere and a good plot then this game has got you covered.Pros:1: Genuinely scary with both atmosphere and SFX. (Especially those ♥♥♥♥ing spiders)2: Good En Medias Res (somewhat En Medias Res) plot with a fantastic villain.3: Deep lore.4: Interesting RPG elements.5: Tense and engaging combat.6: Complex Mechanics.Cons:1: A lot of backtraking.2: Gun Degredation. (need I say more)3: Can be really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t hard at times (in the unfair way).4: Dying without quicksaving or finding the respawn machine will result in you returning to the main menu and having to load the autosave (which are really far apart) or the quicksave that you created.

												If you like Bioshock and haven't played this, you absolutely should. Great mechanics, a more complex story, and a general vibe that somewhere, something went wrong. The game trusts you to figure out things  on your own, and feels more immersive because of it. Example: at one point, you have to find a computer chip to access a certain area. Instead of ""objective complete: found chip,"" you have to sprint to the storage area where electronics are located, reference the chip model number in your email, and find the correct model of chip before continuing. When you want to use a door keycode, you'll be checking your PDA for the code, and keeping your head on a swivel while you punch in the numbers, all while Shodan goads you like a glitchy/vindictive GlaDOS. Like the original Half-Life, there's something about the gameplay that's addicting and massively fun. Btw, if  you're worried about ""nostaliga goggles,"" I played this for the first time last year, and it still holds up.One quick con, though: the game allows you to upgrade what you want, even if it leads to failure. Hacking and radiation resistance is highly recommended.			"

Great mix of combat/exploration. Incredible story that keeps you interested throughout the whole game. Varied enemy types. Awesome customisation of your abilities, skills and traits. Huge exploration. The map is absolutely massive. Audio logs allow you to follow the story of multiple other people on the shipCONS:. A few bugs are present. After a while things may get a bit tedious and may seem repetitiveBe warned, this game is NOT for everyone. It is extremely hard at some points, but one of the things I loved about it was that it isn't impossible to beat. Many times I was stuck but I always managed to get through. If you want to beat the game, then you will probably beat the game.If you like horror games that focus on story and exploration then it would be a sin not to get this game.			"

												Easily one of the best games I have ever had the privilege of playing. It is truly a masterful work that really gets inside your head and endlessly messes with you. It's probably the only video game I have ever played that was able to retain its degree of horror despite how dated it looks, as your mind seems to fill in whatever blanks are created from the lack of graphical quality. Its atmosphere and dark themes end up seriously getting to you, and you'll find yourself anxiously checking every corner at the sound of an enemy or freaking out whenever a security camera goes off. The only real low points of the game (aside from how dated it may seem to some) are the controls. They're somewhat convoluted and take some getting used to. There is also much rebinding to do upon first launch (A and D are bound to turn instead of strafe and X is bound to backing up instead of S). But despite this, the controls are totally possible (and totally worth) getting used to. All in all, this is a game that I recommend to absolutely everyone. Even if you are not a fan of retro PC gaming or find yourself cringing at anything that seems too outdated, this game is easily worth getting.			"

												People often compare Bioshock with System Shock, calling Bioshock the predecessor of System Shock, but that's just bs. Maybe story wise the original Bioshock is on par, but gameplay wise System Shock 2 is far superior. Bioshock is more of a shooter while System Shock 2 is an RPG, there is so much more content in System Shock2 for you to explore, and the atmosphere so cold, making the title a combination of almost perfect story and gameplay. To be frank, the graphics of SyS2 might be a lil bit out dated but a real hardcore gamer shouldn't judge a game by its graphics, but its gameplay.Overall, the game was way ahead of its time and gameplay wise the depth it offers has surpassed even most, if not all of the modern titles. Bioshock Infinite is a joke when compared with SyS2, the only selling point of the former is that the plot is 'deep', but to me that's just artificial mind♥♥♥♥ery that appears to be deep, I have no idea why such a mediocre shooter could be so overhyped. tis really a shame that most modern gamers have never even heard of System Shock, and no more titles like this can be produced today even though the budgets of modern video games are much much larger.In short, ditch Bioshock Infinite and buy System Shock 2, try it and see for youself, you'll never want to go back, and become as cynical about the Bioshock series as I am.

												I was concerned that this game would have not aged very well, but when I started playing it, my god was I wrong! This game is worth every cent, it is creepy, suspenseful and the atmosphere is so tense you can cut it with a knife. The whole experience is just great, from minor details such as buying items from a replicator, to the hybrids screaming ""Run!"" before they attack you. Sure, the graphics are slightly dated, but this makes the whole game much more enjoyable in my opinion, it adds creepiness that you just can't get from many slasher games nowadays. The only gripe I have with this game is that at some points it is so difficult that it becomes frustrating and even on the easiest setting you have to replay the checkpoint about 20 times. Despite the difficulty, the game is thoroughly enjoyable and the twist in the operations sector... don't even get me started, pure classic. 8.5/10 would play again :)			"

												Holy poop, I had a blast with this one! Now I really understand those, who say That BioShock is but a frail shadow of this game? and that's coming from a BioShock fanboy!I think the best part of this game is how complex it is, you got million ways to solve any problem: upgrade yur weapon skills and kill everyone with one shot, upgrade your hacking skills and hack security so that cameras don't trigger alert and hack turrets to help you, get PSI skills to shoot energy balls from your arm or cut bad guys with PSI-sword...the possibilities are endless!Also this game is suprisingly creepy, and it doesn't depends on jumpscares to scare you.

If you dont manage your inventory or character build well youre pretty much boned by midgame. No hand holding or map markers whatsoever.A true classic, I do recommend playing the first game as well. I actually think it has a richer atmosphere, will be hard to find though since the rights just passed hands and they took down the shareware versions. Torrent or physical copy, well worth it.			"

												I've never heard of System Shock 2 until I scanned through the mac rpg games list in the Steam Store and I found System Shock near the top. I was intrigued as it was made a very long time ago, yet maintains a high score in the list, so I figured, why not?I think I struck a goldmine when I found this game, I played several RPG games like Mass Effect and Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, they were both made by Bioware so you can expect them to be amazing. But I have never heard of System Shock 2 and I found it to be one of the scariest RPG game I have ever played, and that is not a bad thing. A scary RPG game is needed in this world, in fact we need more. The world of System Shock develops from the bgeinning as you try to establish your character and what he/she specializes in. And you have to use your skills attained from the tours and your observation skills to find your way through the ship you are stranded on. The developers did an amazing job mixing horror and rpg together and created a masterpiece which hopefully lasts decades.I strongly recommend this game if you are into RPG and Horror games.			"

The story and the gameplay are fantastic, but that isn't what truly makes System Shock 2 shine. The atmosphere will take hold of you and never let go as you make your way through winding corrdors and the only signs you aren't alone are the screams of the dying. This game gave birth to both the BioShock and Deus Ex franchises and still stands as one of the best/scariest games ever made.

												The spiritual predecessor (or rather, chronilogical successor) to the Bioshock series. It was noteable for featuring RPG elements, and it still holds up very well today. It is well worth your time if you're willing to face what first seems to be an insurmountable difficulty curve and the possibility of having to resort to old saves or restarting the game completely due to saving yourself into an unescapable corner. I'd suggest consulting an FAQ in regards to character classes/building to all those who are playing for the first time, as this game is very hard and takes a significant amount of time to complete.

												Fantastic game! It's no wonder that this game was made from the amazing creators of the original thief game with the brilliant thinking behind the creator of the bioshock trilogy. If you enjoy old retro games like me such as hl1, Deus Ex, and thief then you'll absolutely love this game! This is almost like dead space only not as scary but much more depth. There are so many options to choose from being a gun man like me or a psychic or a bralwer. The story is really good and there is plenty of extra content to be found in the game. The game play is simple yet extremely fun. The ship is huge which means plenty of content to go round and explore. There is nothing bad I can say about this game! Though I will add that I highly reccomend playing it with the mod version so it looks even shinyer but you can play it just fine without it. Go ahead and go deep into space and face the unknown! This is game really deserves a reboot!			"

												An oldie but a goodie!This game has you on your toes as you travel a ship infested with zombies, robots, and disgusting organic mutations. It has a creepy atmosphere and gives you a feeling of dread whenever you hear an enemy around the next corner.This game is pretty challenging. On easy, it's a fun game. On anything higher... well... good luck... It literally makes you pay for respawning and the enemies will make sure you have to do that as often as you can until you can't anymore.There's also never really a right answer as to how you should upgrade your skills. Want to use psi powers? Ok, but you have to use psi points, and you can't use guns for a while. Want to use guns? Ok, but now you can't use psi powers like healing, and you have to constantly repair your guns and find ammo.I was absolutely hooked on this game, and I literally could not stop playing. I had to keep coming back just to find out how it would end. Unfortunately, I knew a bit about the game before I began, so that took away some the surprise. However, if you're going in blind, you're going to have a great time.Have fun, insect. 8/10			"

												This game to me is an unmatched favorite. From an era where games might not have looked the best but sure as hell gave you a run for your money. It's got a strong storyline embeded in it's core, a bit of mystery, a lot of survival and of course what would be creepy creatures to run from or kill. Your choice per say. But if you want to take full advantage of this game then slip into something comfy and slap ""Do Not Disturb"" on your user and play it in the dead of night. Even dated this game can scare you at times. The sounds are still something to be wary of, and that's not counting for the A.I. out for your blood....The thing that works best for this game is that you're never truely safe. Everywhere you turn you could be facing an enemy if not careful. The game is usually forgiving depending on your play style. They advice what first time players should use and I agree with that advice. But for the more advanced they do have a slightly confusing psy system in place to test your wit. Stats and skill points through out the game to keep you improving for what seems like nothing compared to a perfect machine (shodan.) If you have the time and interest I would strongly agree to pick this game up. It has a decent bit of replay value especially since it was made by the devs of bioshock prior to such game or company existing. Nice little tid bit for ya!			"

Second of all, I was assaulted with hard picks right from the start, like marine or navy(there was a third but it sounded gay). I though this was a space game? get it together System Shock. The next thing I know i'm getting some cutscenes thrown at me, so I calmed down a little bit because I knew more cutscenes mean a better game, but I came to find out they were filmed on a POTATO!! hehehehehehehe, thumbs up if you agree.  Thirdly of all, this game had the worst controls in the world and where do I get the guns? they weren't already in my hands so when the zombie showed up I couldn't fight him. Who was I supposed to get help from everyone was already dead.This is probably the worst game in the world, not only is it impossible to look at, it's just plain IMPOSSIBLE! I have to give this one a 1/10. I only gave it a 1 because Mr. Bioshock Infinite made it so I wanted to be nice to him. To summarize, this game is the practice child of video games and Bioshock Infinite is the best baby in the world.			"

Okay, moving on.SS2 is easyily the scariest game from my past. Maybe it was because I was young, but I had also played many other horror games as well as saw plenty of hard R rated movies and none compared or came anywhere close to the level of fear that I felt when playing SS2 with headphones, alone, in a dark room.

It's scary, it's tense, it has proper RPG systems and plenty of freedom unlike modern corridor popamole games. Sure, the graphics are dated (after all, it's been 14 years since release), but with help of mods and your imagination it won't matter a bit.

												Hey did you like Bioshock but felt it was neither deep enough nor scary enough? Give this a try. It's old and incredibly difficult but it was hugely influential on the games you play today. Also, I recommend looking online for graphics mods because with the right cadre of visual updates this 15 year old game can look brand new. Well, newer. Still, good game, give it a try.			"

												A very unforgiving game, a game with a great story and terrifying setting. It's slightly dated but it doesn't detract from an awesome story. The immersion is fantasic for an old game, playing this game in the dark of my room with the sound turned up gave me nightmares. If you're not a fan of dated graphics you should take the time to look past its 1999 graphics (Perhaps look for a graphics mod) and judge it on its story and content. For those with a taste in Cyberpunk as well as Sci fi this game is a must. One of the best games i've played 10/10.			"

												Some of the most fun I've ever had with a horror FPS. Bioshock's big daddy is one of the greatests games you can get on the PC. Controls are a bit weird at first, and the RPG elements are very noticible, but the amount of immersion, depth and masterful story telling, makes this game worth every penny. Will you rise above the machine? Or will you lose to the perfect, immortal, SHODAN.			"

												I finished it yesterday (on Easy, full disclosure) for the first time, and had never played or seen it played before, though I was VERY familiar with otehr Irrational games like Bioshock, etc. After repeatedly hearing this game's name in conjunction with the words""best of all time"" I decided it merited a try.System Shock 2 is Bioshock's older, far more badass and brutal brother. I loved Bioshock, Bioshock 2, and to a slightly lesser extent Bioshock Inifinite, and I've gotta say, this 16 YEAR OLD game makes them all look like garbage.Scratch that, System Shock 2 makes just about every other game look like garbage.Letting alone the fact the this came out IN 19-♥♥♥♥ING-99, it has a brilliant, immersive story; great equipment and RPG elements, and is scary as all hell. The sole way in which this game shows it's age (aside from the graphics, which i'll discuss in a moment) is in its melee hitting. Sometimes hitting small monsters is kind of annoying. That's It. Aside from slighgtly dated graphics, which again,  were released in 1999, the game still looks pretty good, and after spending enough time on the Von Braun you'll stop noticing their dated look.This game does present one problem; after playing it to the end, the influence this game has had on every game that has followed it is STAGGERING, you will become infuriated as you realize your favorite franchises just copied System Shock 2 (inb4 its a sequel, nothing is original. Shut up), like, blatantly. And then the logical conclusion, which is far more infuriating, HOW HAS THERE NOT BEEN MORE GAMES OF THIS QUALITY THIS WHOLE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TIME?!?! NINETEEN ♥♥♥♥ING NINETY NINE FOR ♥♥♥♥S SAKE. If you haven't played it, finish reading this, then seriously, REALLY SERIOUSLY, buy it right ♥♥♥♥ing now and set out aboard the Von Braun. This game will fall into your favorite games of all time, and deserves all the praise and more it has ever received.			"

												A fantastic journey from a seemingly straight forward spaceship survival situation to a dive into a sickening fleshy madness. Home to some of my favorite antagonists in videogames. Though the graphics may not have aged well, the tone and gameplay are still quite intact. The atmosphere is fantastic & something that should be experinced alone in a dark room.This game also has a co-op function that I feel completely shatters the carefully contructed atmosphere that the game has. Like I said: play this alone.			"

												Holy hell this game is creepy and awsome at the same time. With rpg and fisrt person elements and survial horror mashed together make this game a classic. I can definitely understsnd why is so liked among the gaming community. The setting and plot is you are a soldier woken from stasis to discover that the ship you are stationed on is overrun with an unknown alien force that has taken over the ship. So it is up to you to take back the ship, prevent the aliens from invading Earth, and just trying to figure out how the hell this all happend, all while being watched and supported by unknown allies.Pros:+creepy as hell+good narrative story+awesome villain+great lighting and atmosphere+pretty cool backstory+some pretty damn cool weapons+great cybernonic abilities+Different play styles which equals replayabillity+Game can be pretty difficult at times but is highly satisfying when acomplishedCons:-Graphics dont hold up-could be harder for newcomers-slow pacing at certain points-the body of the many level (Oh how I hate it so)-hit box with guns are bad-It may take more than one playthrough to understand allt he mechanicsNow with that out of the way, I highly suggest this game.Only $10 for this gaming gem that will have you coming back for more.HAVE FUN!!!!!!

												This is by far the greatest RPG game ever made and it was done 15 years ago and its still brilliant now. Its like watching gladiator the film at home. Everytime you watch it its amazing. The enormity of this game is overwhelming in terms of music, sound effects and voice recordings. I like Bioshock Infinite but SS2 is streets ahead in immersing the user and irrational have got it spot on. They need to kickback with SS3 and a good story line. Graphics and bloody has nothing to do it with Its all about the story line and immersing the player in the storeline as if he/she were there. The PDA's, voxophones, whatever you want to call it. The classic SS2 drum and base in engineering. The medic hypos sound effects. Its all about these small little things that add up to something quite special. The fact that when you open the inventory it freezes the player is great. It creates tension if someone is running towards you with a pipe. Why should the game just freeze and stop when you want to look at inventory this creates a safehouse for the user. In SS2 no where is safe and its this that makes this game epic! 5*			"

												Many years after its release, System Shock 2 lives up to its exalted reputation--a tour-de-force survival horror shooter. If you mod SS2 with community graphics packs, the NPCs and setting become truly gruesome. The default skins and textures have a weird 90's rubber-suit look, which makes the baddies appear less menacing. They'll still happily rip yourass to shreds.Well, it's another fine mess science has gotten us into. After short tutorial levels and initial stats selection, you, the slightly augmented main character, wake up naked and empty-handed on the Von Braun space ship, where something has gone very wrong. Things get worse from there. Super-creepy ambient sound, music, visual design, and grim audio logs gradually reveal a world descending to hell.This game is hella tough. I totally had to cheat through it, forcing myself to play normally when I wanted the true experience. Unless you want to spend 40 hours on a single playthrough, you have to master kiting the enemies with your default wrench, because there's not enough ammo and health to go full Schwarzenegger, and you can't sneak by everything.Stealth is critical in many places. One section near the end is so full of over-powered foes that only a very well-armed FPS expert could go head-to-head with them. Not possible unless you have saved every shot, and exhaustively looted and solved every puzzle, optional room, and hackable object (or you know, just cheated). At least some baddies always respawn in every area, often to your great disadvantage, so you can't hide or camp forever.This game paved the way for Dark Souls. Well, I'm glad I finished it, and that the evil force threatening the world is safely trapped inside the game, which I then deleted from my hard drive. Bravo, Looking Glass Studios (and Irrational, golf clap)! One bloody psionically regenerated thum.,..,,..,.,.=..,,,+,.+..~..,,+:.:,~,,:..,,=,~..,~:...,.,.,.~:...,.=....~,.....,.

												This is a great FPS game with RPG elements.  The character building function allows you to choose stats that focus on weapons or Psi abilities.  The ability to customize your character gives this FPS alot of replay value.  If your looking for a typical 'spray and pray' type of FPS then this is probably not for you since ammunition is pretty limited forcing the player to be more careful about using it.  This game has a nice open world feel to it since the player can return to any area of the ships throughout the game.  This game is a respectable addition to any gamer's FPS arsenal.			"

												First of all, nevermind the graphics. If you get invovled in the game, those won't matter.Amazing RPG elements added to this FPS game. Every time I go to upgrade stats or ablilities, I feel like I'm making a huge decision and I invest a few minutes into considering the pros and cons of each decision.I'll spare the tl;dr and just highly recommend this game to anyone who likes shooters and RPGs.

												You better unlock that crate correctly, or it'll explode violently in your face and kill you. When you get bored of unlocking crates, the game lets you play minesweeper. If you're particularly adventerous, you might be able to unlock the ability to play golf!			"

												This is my all time favourite science fiction role playing game. This game was revolutionary for its time, and is still fun to play again today. If you like the Bioshock series, you owe this game a playthrough. I remember being scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in 1999 playing this, and while not as scary today, it still holds up as a steller game!			"

												A must play.I will surely scare you and it will definitely thrill you. The RPG touch gives you a fair number of ways to develop your character and all of them are fun to play. The game may be old, but it's really worth the try. And the end it's LOL :P			"

												Despite its age this is a game I have played several times. The physics are a bit clunky, but if you have played ANY of the Bioshock games, you owe it to yourself to play this one. The entire Bioshock series is the child (in spirit) of the system shock series. Try it!			"

												The game has a creepy atmosphere remiscent of bioshock (if bioshock was made in the 1990s) and has superb level design similar to halflife 1. The voice acting and storytelling in this game are god-tier, you are not pulled out of the zone with annoying little cut scenes. All of the dialogue flows along while you are creeping through the dark atmospheric tunnels of an abandoned spaceship. The graphics are similar to those of halflife 1, which might be a downgrade from what you're used to playing, but keep in mind this is an old game. 10/10 fantastic game both for its time and for now, I only wish the developers would have gotten their♥♥♥♥♥♥together and made a System Shock 3, because I would be all over that.

												This is an AMAZING game with a story that is vast and honestly more than I expected out of a 1999 video game. I had read that this game is the spiritual predecessor to Bioshock, and I can definately see resemblances here and there. It has a sort of RPG element, where you can raise your stats, weapon abilities, psionic powers, and skills such as hacking. There are no levels per se, but sections that you slowly gain access to.About the only faults I can say about the game is that towards the end, there is a lot of back-and-forth travelling you need to do, it's not always clear where you're supposed to go, and I did run into some slightly bad AI at times. It is an old game, so graphics might also be on the list of faults, but I honestly didn't care about the slightly improved 1999 look.Again, the story is amazing, it'll last you a long time if you look around like I did, and the environment was interesting. I only wish they'd remake the game with today's technology!			"

												System Shock 2 is one of the most historically important games ever made. It was waaaaaayyyyy ahead of its time when it came out and it holds up very very well. I was suprised how fun this was too play still. I can remember this game scaring the crap out of me when i was a kid over a decade ago. Still makes me jump.			"

												If you've ever enjoyed the likes of BioShock, Dead Space, Deus Ex or Fallout 3, then you owe it to yourself to play this game. The graphics are quite dated now but there are graphical mods out there if you really can't stand it.Unlike games nowadays that are leaning more towards action than RPG, this game focuses more towards the RPG side. Highly immersive atmosphere and great customization on skills and abilities.IMO one of the best, if not the best, First-Person RPG game ever made.			"

												This game is perfect in alot of ways. It has elements that games do not have in games today. When you play this game you feel isolated and puny. When you start the game you will be a weakling with barely any good weapons, but once you work on through the game you will become a walking death machine. This is an older game so it will need some modding to make it look better on higer resolution monitors and computers. This game is worth the money, trust me!			"

												I recently lost my memory and I've been told that my flesh betrays me. On the other hand, I found this crystal shard that sings to me, which is nice. It helps me deal with stress of being far away from home and I've even been invited to a poetry reading in the recreation deck's commons area. I almost forget that chips are all there is to eat.			"

												If you loved Bioshock then you will love this. Gameplay wise it is more complex than most modern FPS's but atmosphere wise it is just Bioshock in space which is no bad thing. It's truly fascinating to see the root of some of Bioshock's core ideas present in this game such as the ""plasmids"" and the audio daries. System Shock 2, much to my surprise, has become one of my favourite games. Personally I would say that it is definitely worth full price especially since, because they player has to invest in certain skill types, the game has a lot of replayability so you can experiment with all the different styles.

												Awesome game. I thought that my eyes would bleed due to the dated graphics, but it turned out to be OK, thanks to a mod that improves texture quality.Once you play this, you'll realise that Ken Levine has essentialy remade his own game and just changed the setting and replaced 'system' with 'bio'. There are too many similarities between this an BioShock... kind of spoils the twist at the end (if you've already played Bioshok)... still a good game to have played.If you're into giving ancient amazing games a chance I would also recommend playing Deus Ex too.

												This game, while bad graphics even for its time, is one of three of my all time favourite games of all time.I dont feel the need to use mods to improve the graphics. The game is so well done and its atmosphere is so immersive that the graphics dont play on my mind.System Shock 2 will always be, in my opinion, one of the best games of all time.Just ask Shodan (She's tattooed on my back).

												This game has aged really well in my opinion, its older than dirt but the graphics don't make me wince like alot of games<hell games only 7 years old look worse than this. The game is also scary as hell, being one of the few games to completely creep me out through out the game with its successor Bioshock being the other of note. If you liked bioshock then I highly recomend going back and trying the original. If you didn't like bioshock then your inhuman and must be destroyed. ""You did well for an in-insect....""			"

												Saddest thing about this game is it's a reminder of how good games could have been these days. If you gave System shock 2 updated graphics it would tower above most games released these days...Absolute must for any gamer older than 12 who can think for themselves.Bioshock could learn a thing or two from it.

												Great game, not perfect. The atmostpher is dark and really adds to the experiance, but i wouldent call it scary, in the same way bioshock is creepy but wouldent ever scare you.The gameplay is great, no regenerating health means that being low on HP makes for a tense experianceThe only problem with System Shock 2 is that the leveling system is'nt the most balanced, a bad build can lead to ""Dead Man Walking Syndrome""Great game, but like all great older games on steam, wait for a sale			"

												System Shock 2's legacy lives on partly with the existence of the Deus Ex and Bioshock franchises, but it is more than capable to stand on its own right even today. Despite its outdated controls, GUI and graphics, it trumps most modern titles in terms of atmosphere, immersion, gameplay and story. In fact, many of SS2's features have been integrated into modern games, most notably the presence of audio logs put in unlikely places.I would recommend taking your time with setting up the game. The standard controls are not good. You will most likely have to rebind your keys based on which weapons/items you choose to use throughout the game, there are so many that you won't get the chance to use them all effectively. The greatest issue I had with this game is that it uses an outdated control scheme for accessing your items. A row of quick access slots, like the one featured in the Deus Ex games, would've been much better for weapon/item access.Some of the map designs are confusing, and it can be easy to get lost in your first playthrough. Even worse, the game has a minimap function that is disabled by default. Make sure to enable it as soon as you can, it'll make your life much easier.Resources are scarce. You will be punished for wasting them. On the other hand, the game rewards you for exploration and careful observation. Many items will be placed out of reach or carefully hidden, take your time to find them as long as you aren't under fire.This game rewards carefulness over gung-ho, reckless charging into unknown areas. Play carefully, lean over corners, use stealth.You will most likely get frustrated at one point or another for the reasons above and many others, but trust me, this game is worth going all the way to the end. There aren't many games that can offer the experience that System Shock 2 provides nowadays. "
