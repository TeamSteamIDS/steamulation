YouTube™ Video: Fight the Dragon Gameplay and Review (Early Access) 

			Views: 26,855		

			I show some game play and review Fight the Dragon by 3sprockets. Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/250560/ Website: http://fightthedragon.com/		

Fight the Dragon is a hack and slash RPG that is clearly made by people who love the genre.  It takes gameplay elements of games like Torchlight 2 and combines them with a level creation system that reminds me of a cross between Little Big Planet and Minecraft.  The game starts at your house where you can manage characters and access things like the level creator or user adventures. Once in the game you fight off monsters, find keys, and pull levers to reach the end.  As you play your character gains levels, skills, and tons of loot.  You will constantly be scouring the ground for helmets, armor, weapons, and more.Damage is done with a primary weapon of choice, a heavy attack, or class specific skills. All skills and items carry over between levels and every adventure scales with you so whether you play a an adventure for the first time at level one or replay it at level 5, it’s still fun and challenging. The level editor or ""Adventure Construction Kit"", feels like a 3d modeling program and is simple yet deceptively powerful.  You can place monsters, traps, treasure, and sculpt the landscape as you see fit.I loved this game and can’t wait for more.			"

												Great game, great premise, but one very huge flaw in its design.  The game is based around player created adventures but lacks a fair implementation of advertising any new adventures.Searching for adventures at first glaces seems to be very complex but after a while you you notice a poor design choice.  Only the top 24 adventures will ever be displayed in a search, no matter how many tags you select.  What does this mean?  Only adventures with a high rating will ever be visible to other players to play, meaning, your new maps will never get a chance to be played unless someone searches for it by name.  You can search for Easy, Medium, Hard, or Extreme adventures, but you will never see any adventures that are 25th+ place.  Yeah there is a search for newly created adventures, but that category only shows adventures that haven't been played once.  Once someone plays it, your adventure is now unsearchable.  There is a category for weekly, monthly, and featured adventures but those will always display the same 24 adventures in the category, most of which are the same adventures.  Since I have been playing, no new maps were added to featured (about 2 months).  There is an option to play a random adventure, but that only selects an adventure you haven't played yet in one of the top 24 adventure categories, only playing a truly random map after those have been exhausted.

												As dev of McDroid I can tell you that was they achieved here is amazing: integrating user generated levels into the game in such a seamless way, with well done facilities to thumb up and down, comment levels and make your own levels and publishing. I never made my own level in such a well designed tool and it was a blast. Seeing the number of people playing is addictive, akin to facebooking. The great thing about UG levels is the spectrum of game style is vast: from arcade to intricate RPG stories with fantastic ramp up in difficulty. The amount of level is enormous, the quality varies.The main game loop is: hack, pick up worthy loot, sell the least valuable to get extra goodies, level up.On top of that you attack a Dragon with a ginormous amount of HP, when you die, and you will die very often, you get kicked out of the arena and go back to the main game of leveling up, the HP is kept where it was.This makes for a very addictive game.Highly recommended.

Early Access Review
								I'm long overdue to post a review for this game. Why have I waited so long? Because I've been having so much fun playing and creating, I hardly use my spare time for anything else! I think it's an outstanding, highly entertaining game! The community-generated ""adventures"" make this game virtually unlimited in it's original gameplay content.I should also add that I'm new to both the Hack & Slash and RPG genres...they just never appealed to me before. I bought this game because I think the devs are fantastic, having played both Cubemen and Cubemen 2, but I wasn't sure I would care for it that much. Boy, was I wrong to even think that! Now, I'm completely hooked and having a great time playing, interacting with the community in sharing/playing adventures, and in creating my own. The built in Adventure Construction Kit (ACK) is quite sophisticated yet easy to use. You can be building and publishing great-looking adventures in a fairly short amount of time.So whether you're a seasoned pro in Hack n Slash and RPG games, or new to the genre as I was, I'm confident you're going to enjoy this game. If the current ""Early Access"" state is a concern for you, don't let it be. I would consider this a complete game...that just keeps getting better with each update, as cool new features are added on a regular basis.Now it's time to go back and conquer more ""worlds"" as I add to the already 450+ hours I've got in this game! That in itself should tell you quite a bit about how I feel about Fight the Dragon.			"

												Fight The Dragon is a simple, community-driven dungeon crawler for up to 4 players, populated with maps designed by the players themselves. There are twelve customizable character slots, and four classes to choose from, each with different weapon proficiencies and four unique abilities: the fighter, the rogue, the ice wizard, and the pyromancer. If you've played a fantasy-themed game before, those classes shouldn't be unfamiliar. The playstyles are all a tad different, but early on, it becomes quite apparent that ranged combatants are considerably easier to play, and arguably more effective as well.The look of the game is a bit classic. It isn't voxel, and it has smooth textures, but the shapes of the in-game models look quite crude in a few cases. Controls are fairly simple, and the mechanics of the game will come naturally to anyone who is familiar with the genre. The gameplay itself is smooth, if a tad unbalanced; it's rather easy for a map designer to make an area too difficult, whether intentionally or not, by saturating it heavily with certain, more powerful monsters. A good example is a trio of enemy pyromancers- they deal so much damage in such a short time that they will instantly kill you with fireballs and pillars of flame if you stand still for more than a thoughtful moment. Loot appears rather frequently, so it isn't too difficult to find a decent set of gear that compliments how you choose to play. A feature called the 'Loot Shrine' acts as an alternative to the typical store you'd find in the 'safe zone' of a dungeon-crawling RPG. Rather than buying and selling items, the game allows you to 'donate' all of your gold and unwanted gear for a chance at progressively better loot- the more you donate, the better the rewards, which come in the form of rare armor and weapons, extra stat points, increased inventory space, or other miscellaneous character upgrades. Although the game offers you three choices (typically one item and two 'other'), the choices are completely randomized, so you may end up finding some unattractive offers when you decide to cash out. I find this feature to be a refreshing change from the norm, and i've abused it quite a lot in my own time playing.The gimmicks that make FtD stand out from similar titles are it's trademark Adventure Creation Kit, and the titled battle against the Dragon. The Adventure Creation Kit(ACK) allows a player to construct a dungeon, then play in it against his own creation, or upload it to the server to share with friends or the community as a whole. The ACK is very user-friendly, and it's fun to play with. The design options that it gives you allow you to make maps of all sizes, or even chain multiple dungeons together to create a full campaign with multiple levels. The designer truly allows for an impressive amount of customization and creativity.Fighting the Dragon, as many would assume from the title, is an integral part of the game. At any time, provided your character has recieved a Dragon Scroll by completing a dungeon, you may challenge the dragon arena. The Dragon itself is extremely strong; with a massive, constant HP pool and tons of damage output, he's an extremely tough opponent, only killable with determination and lots of patience (and Dragon Scrolls). Each scroll you use gives you three lives to deal as much damage as possible to the Dragon, before inevitably getting massacred and sent packing back into the player-made dungeons. Fortunately, the Dragon's health bar is consistent through attempts, so the damage you deal in each battle will carry over to the next time. Each time you reach a certain point of progress(by consistently putting tiny dents in his health), you will get a shiny red piece of Dragon loot that has a very special effect, but will disappear after you've used it for a certain time. I find that these two features really do make the game a special one, and it allows the player to take a much-needed break from the constant loot grind.Overall, the game is put together well, and only suffers from a few minor bugs and glitches. The biggest issue I have with the game is a lack of balance and character development; aside from getting a new ability at level 5, 10, 15, etc., your gear makes your character what it is, and there is very little variance between two characters of the same class. Ranged weapons and kiting tactics seem to be the way to go most of the time, especially when the difficulty ramps up so quickly in most cases. The enemies deal a legitimately high amount of damage per attack, and some fights can cost the players a few lives before they can get a grasp on the situation. Aside from those few complaints, however, this is a gem of a game, would recommend to fans of the genre and RPGs in general.Appearance: 3.5/5, basic textures, mostly attractive, sounds get repetitive and could have more variety.Controls: 4.5/5, easy to pick up and play, mechanics aren't too hard, everything works how it should.Gameplay: 4/5, bugs are few and far between, the ACK is fun, character building could use more options.Replayability: 4/5, the ACK keeps the game fresh, but enemies get a bit repetitive.Overall: 4/5, a good, solid dungeon crawler with some fun gimmicks and extra tools to make the game unique.

								With the help of a robust, user-friendly adventure map creation tool and an already very active and tight-nit community, Fight the Dragon is an incredibly addictive social interaction unlike anything I've seen on Early Access.. or Steam in general for that matter.Even in it's earliest form it already has a massive set of tools allowing anyone of virtually any skill level to create whatever is in their head from dark mines to open snowing forests, the variety here presented only in it's first week is enough to give every aspiring map creator the ability to conjure up something totally unique and special from one another. And this isn't taking into account the almost weekly updates the game will be receiving, already one in it's first week adding two entirely new sections of props to diversify your creations with. In short, map making is extremely addictive, often time consuming, and in the end EXTREMELY rewarding.The gameplay itself is very fun and straightforward, almost arcade-y in a Gauntlet sort of way moreso than how modern grindy ARPGs of today play. There's already a great loot system in place that scales to your level (max 30 currently), with legendary and rare items to find that give you additional stat boosts and sometimes elemental attacks. The adventures themselves are all user-generated (outside of a small handful of high-quality maps created by the develepor to show off what you can make), which is awesome for both the person exploring levels and the people creating maps, because everyone gets a fair chance at having what they made getting played. There is one other mode, a really cool concept which the game gets it's name from where you fight a dragon in an arena with a ridiculous amount of health (millions). Killing the dragon in one, or even dozens of tries is impossible so you'll have to earn Dragon Tickets by completing Adventure maps created by the community in order to keep chipping away at it's health. There are currently no end-game rewards for the dragon that I know of (to be honest, it's so tough I don't think it's even been beaten by more than a few people yet) but it already has a leaderboard to rank you against other players based on damage done. I can't wait to see where this mode goes.These are only the basics really, the game has so much to do already and there's a lot more to come. If you're at all interested in creating worlds or playing other peoples' then check this out and come by the community hub, the community is very active and the developer is amazingly responsive to feedback and questions!

Early Access Review
								The recommendation is based on the alpha stage gameplay. The Good:I enjoy the conept of incorporating the gaming community into the actual creation of game content.  This means lots of diversity.  It also constantly improves the idea of a good ""map"": as one plays different maps from different users, his own taste for a ""good"" map diversifies and shifts.What's even better is that, there are quality maps.  Some maps you can tell the designer spent hours on perfecting.  The map creation kit also handles very well-- easy to grasp and almost anyone can build a map. The creation kit is also powerful enough to allow users to create very different environments-- a very elegant blend of simplicity and power.The game is easy to get into.  Jump into a game, and click on the bad guys. Key bindings are laid out clearly.  The gear is diversified, and your character changes appearance with each piece of equipment equipped. The loot system is balanced in terms of statistics, and it constantly poses questions like, ""would you sacrifice LUCK(magic find and crit chance) for damage?"" The bad: Combat... feels a bit slippery.  Sometimes it feels like youre walking on ice: as you take damage you slide around, and so do your enemies.  Your special abilities are limited.  You have only 4.  Worse, you don't unlock all of them until higher levels.  This makes lower level combat repetitive and at times, monotonous. There are also certain balancing issues in the game.  As you reach levels 10+, you begin to encounter enemies that can 1 shot you... even with gear deemed rare, extraordinary, and legendary.  (Gear ranks from junk, common, rare, extraordinary, and legendary.)The downside to incorporating the gaming community into content creation is that there will be inevitably faulty maps that are incompletable or maps that overreward you/ under reward you.  While I understand the developer has taken steps to mitigate such problems, the issues still exist.  I have encountered very hard challenges on maps marked as ""easy"".Multiplayer is bare bones.  You can join on players (though, I have NEVER seen more than 2-3 joinable games within the US at any given point in time).  However, you can't trade, share, or give loot.  BOTTOM LINE: I say hold off on this one.See what else the developer has to offer.  Right now, the game is still rough (of course, its in alpha), and still needs some tweaking.  With the features it has right now, it just isn't worth purchasing for 15 bucks.   "

												Gauntlet with a neverending array of levels at your disposal and that my friends is a good thing indeed. There's a big dragon that needs slaying that serves as a progress marker of sorts.Once you become strong enough to put out that fire in his belly... then you got to fight 2 dragons and a juggling bear on a tricycle. It never ends.			"

								Updated my review.Now after 16 Days of playing this i make a first review-update. As you can see in my profile i usually dont write much reviews but this game is a exception.The devs are pushing updates nearly every day. And every update brings new stuff for the players, like Items, new gameplay mecanics and so on. There also seems to be a community who making maps already, I played a couple of very well made usermaps.The gameplay, to be more specific, is a classic dungeon crawler. You have your hero, fight your way through the (usermade) adventures and get loot for that. The enemys stay dangerous so you will not reach the point when you can rush then levels without getting in trouble. Even with a nice shiny suit of armor a big troll can kill you with one or two hits. (Oh i really hate these trolls ;))For every adventure you finish you will get a access to the dragon arena, where you can fight a gigantic (i`m sure you know whats coming) Dragon! The dragon dont regenerate his health between the battles, so you can fight him between your adventures.The controlls work pretty solid, the graphics are lovely, and thanks to the usermade levels you will have an unique adventure every time you play the game.Ans that`s pretty much what it`s all about for me in this game. Having an new adventure every time i play.I dosent publish my own adventures for now, but im working on it. The editor works fine and making maps is pretty easy. With that editor you can create maps with exact the same features as the developer does. So theres no difference between user maps and developer maps except what the person behind the map-editor does.Well invested money for me, one of the best games i have in my steam library.-----------------------------------------------------------------------A very nice game. Lots of loot, traps and enemys. And (thank devs!) it`s not one of these to fast, to colourfull game that makes you headaches. It`s a very fun game and a nice mix of building you dungeon and explore others.This game is what i thought or hoped to get when i installed ""The quest for mighty loot"".I highly recommend this great game and looking forward for the next updates.

								This is the Little Big Planet of Hack and Slash RPGs.  Do not expect torchlight or diablo or titan quest or any of the other AAA hack and slash games with this one.  What you get is a quirky art style and a ton of bite sized adventures. ( Campaigns are incoming and will likely link together two or more adventures ).The main reason to get this game is the fact that the ACK ( Adventure Creation kit ) allows you to design and create a variety of adventures ranging from simple 1 room arena battles to complex dungeons with puzzles, switche,s traps, platforming, and locked doors that require you to get a color coded key - ( Doom anyone? ).I've only had this game for two days but have already created and published 3 adventures.If you want a hack and slash game that looks overly simple but has suprising depth and limitless content, pick this up.If you want to create short engaging little adventures that range from 5 minutes of gameplay to 30 minutes of gameplay pick this up.  The ACK is the easiest to use editor I have ever used.Oh I almost forgot that unlike most games, this one has a BOSS DRAGON that you need to earn scrolls to be able to teleport to the Dragon's Lair and try and defeat him.  He has persistent health and this is a must considering he has 1,000,000 health and the firs titme I fought him I managed to deal 50 damage total with 3 lives.  Second time I dealt 650 and that was after levelling up for hours! "

												The game model functions very well - controls, stats, loot, combat (for the most part), and co-op.  The premise of the game is to adventure in community-created campaigns, finding keys, unraveling small plots, looting better items, and making your way to fighting the dragon by collecting Dragon Scrolls.  It's almost like Shadowrun Returns, but without the developer-created campaign.  There are some REALLY good adventures to go on by the community.However, it's like finding needles in a haystack - the majority of GREAT community-created scenarios are far and few between.  Many fall short between amateur DMs and wannabe writers akin to middle school English class.  75% of the adventures you will partake in often have glaring issues like loot balancing, confusing or short level design, awful dialogue and spelling mistakes and more.  It seems like anyone can create a dungeon with 5 rooms, 50 potions, tons of easy enemies and enough loot to make the game not much fun.This game is AMAZING for DM's and really shines in the way of quick pick-up and random co-op play.  It falls short in the way that the majority of the content is shallow or just bad.  If you dig hard enough, you'll find gold though.			"

												I have really been enjoying Fight the Dragon. Because of the nature of the game, no adventures are too long.  It's fun, especially if you only have a few minutes, to play an adventure or two. I like the reward system where you use loot to take a chance on better equipment or other upgrades after your adventures.  The leveling system is nice because you don't seem to get too overpowered too quickly and the fight with the dragon, at least at this point, seems to be a big challenge. The creator tool is a lot of fun. It's easy to use and you can quickly learn to make a decent adventure. There are a ton of user-created adventures and many of them have been very good.  There are some good guides available.  The graphics fit the game nicely and are very reminiscent of Little Big Planet, MySims, etc.I think you'll really enjoy the game if you're in to RPGs, Hack n Slash and loot collection, especially if you can get it on sale!Edit: The more I play this game, the more I like it.  There are some really creative and fun designs being done. It works really well with my XBox wireless controller. I haven't even touched the dragon fight since the first time. I'm just having too much fun with the quick adventures.			"

								I generally don't write reviews but this game has me hooked!I'm a huge fan of open source and this game is exactly that.  The levels are designed by you!  The tool for map design is beyond powerful.  I was able to pick it up and know how to do just about everything there was to do.  The game is still in Alpha and yes it has bugs and exploits and still a fair amount of work to be done.  However the game play it offers and design posibities are simply wonderful.If you like hack and slash games with a unique 3d design that takes you back a few years and enjoy a community customization this is a must have.  Bravo ""3 Sprockets"" continue to evole this game and you will have a #1.			"

												Fight the Dragon is a user-generated action RPG, which can be good or bad based on the community involved in making the content. If you're looking for good content, I recommend NOT looking at the highest rated content because they happen to be the most bland and generic of them all. It makes me wonder how exactly they became the top rated in the first place, while unique and creative maps go completely unnoticed. This is because of how the game streamlines new content; it does it very poorly. There is a ""new content"" tab but its clearly filled with ""not new content"" because of the amount of ratings each map has, as if they haven't updated the new content tab since alpha. You just have to hope that your map falls under the ""local unplayed map"" pool that seems to be randomly generated for each user, since that is the actual ""new content"" tab, but this tab seems to only have like 5-7 maps at a time. I published my map yesterday, and as of right now, only one person other than me has played it. This game prides itself for over-saturation of content, when in reality, it's the main downfall of this game. You really have to sift through a lot of crap to find a few gems, or just give up and make your own gems that only you will end up playing anyway.Which brings me to why im recommending this game: The level editor.If you like creating your own levels, but are completely stupid and impatient when it comes to using editors (like me), then I highly recommend this game, because not only is the editor extremely easy to use, its also very intricate. You can do practically anything with this level editor. Every interactable item or prop you can place has its own programmable event tab, which you can use to trigger events throughout your level. Events such as ""When this monster dies, break down breakable wall"" or ""When player opens this chest, close X doors and spawn Y monsters in vicinity"". There are so many things you can do with this level editor, that you will spend so many hours messing with it and thinking of creative ways to use it. The only problem I have with it is that there's not a huge selection of props, textures, and enemies.Now you may be saying to yourself ""That's great and all, but hows the gameplay?""Well, the combat is a bit clunky and needs improvement... But LOOK AT HOW SHINY THIS LEVEL EDITOR IS!In all seriousness though, if you like to create your own levels, but don't have the knowledge or patience to use a professional editor, then it is well worth the money. The game itself ain't half bad either, if you can deal with a few bad eggs. "

												You might notice a Neutral Category and that is because sometimes due to the nature of the entry, the experience can vary from very good to very poor. Thus, it is there.Pros:+Pretty decent graphics, animations, and sound design+Level Editor+Rogue-like/Rogue-lite elements+Multiple Classes which allow for different playthroughs+Multiple Character slots+Lots of loot.+Multiplayer (I haven't tried this yet!)+Quick Playthroughs/Drop in/out features+Forever expandable, since there is a supposedly unlimited number of maps available (whether this is true or not in a few years remains to be seen)+Australian Developers+Did I mention lots of loot? There's a lot of loot.Neutral:=User Created Content=No Story / All levels are self-contained stories or designs and aren't cohesive.=Would be cool if there was a procedural level generator, however, given how complex the level editor is, I don't think this would be an easy feat. Not knowing the ins/outs of the game engine, I do not know if that would even be feasible.Cons:-Sometimes the character can get stuck on stairs and appears to have difficulty -Cannot attack enemies at various locations.-Enemies with Ranged Attacks (Bombs Arrows, Spells)  have an unfair advantage if you lack a ranged weapon leading to   some cheap death situations. Sometimes arrows will hit you even while you're moving.-Limited camera controls. It would be great if the user could zoom out a little more or at least add panning to the existing zoom and rotate.-Needs better transparency on some objects when your vision is obscured.-No proper graphical options, low, medium, and high, and still a framerate cap.

												Fight the Dragon is a micro ARPG with an action-figure aesthetic and a full-featured level creator dubbed the Adventure Construction Kit. From the clean and minimal UI to the condensed gameplay loop, Fight the Dragon provides a surprisingly rewarding experience in an adorable and cleverly-shrunken package. Think 10-minute-Torchlight II; heaps of random loot,  simple character progression, and tight hack 'n' slash combat. 3 Sprockets has taken the the staples of a genre it clearly adores and compressed them into a shining little diamond.

								Playing that game since the first Private Alpha build and I sure don't regret to have bought it!The idea of the game is really nice, a fast play Hack'n'Slash game for small to long play sessions. The look/style of the game and the characters look to be unique. (It also look like a bit ""Lego"" style) The gameplay is really interesting as simple, just attack monsters, find look, solves puzzles, fight tougth bosses, find more loot, upgrade your character, etc... Most of the levels are made by the community. Then the dragon fight is also really nice as it is hard and fun at the same time (and also really long, since you have to do it in multiple sessions because the dragon have 1Million HP) The game have a lot to offer and is replay value is really high!The Adventure Construction Kit is the main thing that made me buy the game, it is really what I always have dream to see in a RPG/Hack'n'Slash game: Being able to build your own levels/adventures in a simple easy way! The number of stuff in the ACK is really big and the dev said to continue to add more!The co-op drop-in/drop-out work really nicely and it's always fun to be able to play with a friend in the same room! The online mode is also really nice so you can also play with your friends but also with other people around the world!The Customisation of the characters is really nice, mostly from the community too, I found myself that it is a bit hard to create personalised skin/head if you don't have drawing skill. So in general you play levels made by the dev but mostly by other people, get loot, upgrade your character and get Dragon Scrolls to fight the dragon AND/OR also create levels how you always have dreamed or let your imagination free.I really recommend this awesome game and I still can't wait for more updates and props!Thanks 3 Sprockets for this game!(Note: Sorry for my english, usualy speak French, but wanted to make an english review)			"

												Disclaimer: I'm not terribly far into the game, nor do I love ARPGs as a genre. I was gifted this game by a friend so we'd have a game to play as a group, and as a result my experience is solely low-levels with 4 players. If we delve further into it and my opinion changes, I'll modify this review to reflect it.This game has a lot going for it. It has a bunch of small features that really improve the quality of life of the game, things I would have loved to see in other ARPGs. The amount of content being created for the game is awesome to see, and the loot system is pretty well done. That being said, I can't help but feel they really dropped the ball on combat and movement. Pros:The loot system in the game is fairly well done. Judging by a few of the items I saw, some late game items will modify playstyles significantly enough to justify tags such as legendary. I love that you have a reason to pick up all your trash. The loot alter is a fantastic way to deal with that, although I'm not sure what else gold is used for, and as a result it feels tacked on as a system for getting trash loot without actually picking it up. It's certainly convenient but feels underwhelming as a whole. I'm not sure how I feel about Dragon Rings, but it's not a bad idea per se.One of the best features of this game is the fact that the community creates content. To be honest not a ton of it wowed me, but there was quite a bit of it that was well done and as a result each run felt much better than a standard randomly generated run would.Cons:The game features an incredibly simplified combat system that gets repetitive, fast. It's not an issue by itself, but when coupled by the sliding, non-grounded movement the game just feels very poorly made from a design standpoint. It makes the game feel a bit fast and frantic, with almost no tactics involved. When you throw in a few more players it becomes awful trying to navigate through small areas due to player collision, which simply does not work in a game like this in my opinion. I can only assume most dungeons are designed for one player.On a similar note, the game's difficulty does not scale well at all in 4 player groups. We were picking ""extreme"" difficulty missions every time and I don't think any of us ever took much damage. The only deaths we had were when we had to commit suicide because we jumped into a part of a dungeon we weren't suppose to be at yet and couldn't progress, or we knocked each other off of terrain from collision due to latency issues. It also doesn't seem like there's a lot of actual content in world building. Perhaps some content is level-gated, but we were seeing the exact same sets of environments, enemies, traps, and levers the entire time. If the community is able to bring in new art assets to worlds, this will likely be a non-issue, but the core game feels lacking in diversity.Despite the name ""Fight the Dragon"" along with a tag for mutliplayer, you cannot fight the dragon with friends. It's just your standard ARPG run around getting loot game with no real bosses (at least that we've run into), which gets a bit boring. (to me at least, some people love that as a core)tl;dr - Fight the Dragon has a great core idea, and I'm sure a ton of people will love it. I just can't help but feel the simplicity of the combat system mixed with the weird floating/gliding movement is holding it back from being an actual great game.			"

												I really want to like this game. An instance-based multiplayer hack and slash with a built-in level editor and distributor is a great idea. That aspect of this game is done quite well. Unfortunately as of right now, the rest of the game itself is not. Character stats and mechanics aren't explained, and there is almost no depth to character development. Itemization is poor. Combat doesn't flow particularly well. Controls are iffy. The net result is a treadmill game with no story and no interesting rewards.			"

												Ran from the minotaur and stopped to heal.  He charged so far and so fast that it knocked me off of a cliff and I died - with full health.This is a fun little game that gives you thousands of hand-made mini-adventures to play and plenty of epic moments of near-death dungeoneering experiences.Only got 30 minutes?  Perfect, because these adventures can be done in 10-20 minutes.  The adventures have varying difficulties, so you can find a comfortable level and go have some fun.Got more time?  Give some of the campaigns a go - they have 3-5 linked adventures in each campaign.Feeling creative?  It has an easy to use level editor and you can participate in the community by creating and publishing your own level.Highest recommendations!  Give it a try!			"

												You know, telling your friends that you will go now and fight the dragon is not really advisable ;)Anyway, the game is really fun heheHonestly i was really angry at the beginning, not knowing that some stuff is really hard as well as the fact that my chosen character was just bad -.-But as soon as i got a deeper insight into the game i figuerd out, that it is a hell lot of fun.The dragon? Ignore this dude he isnt worth your time.Appreciate the awesome content created by your fellow FTD players!Or just create awesome stuff on your own!Well you gotta dungeon crawl and explore places and stuff, you can even invite 3 more players to wrek the enemies and solve riddles if there are any.Or just relax, while playing some really easy adventures, no need to take on the extreme stuff on the first day...Yeah you got 4 classes, FIghter, Fire Wizard, Ice Wizard and Rogue.One for killing and tanking, one for burning and AOE damage, one for freezing and one for stealth and traps.Fully customisable including, swords, axes (some throwable), hammers, spears (naginata bruh), wands, dual daggers/shortswords, ice&fire staffs, crossbows, shuriken, shields, defense spelltomes, helmets, chestarmor, boots, gauntlets and dragon rings (the big bad dragon drops dem ringz).Then there is the ACK - Adventure Creation Kit -EVERYONE CAN USE IT!!!!!!!!!!111!!!!1Its easy and mostly self explantionary, even more complex events and triggers can be set up with little effort.Sure you are limited in tiles and content, but THINK CREATIVELY!!!!If you do, you can create awesome adventures, which will be loved and admired by those who play them!Game visuals are all blocky and stuff, but it runs even on pretty old and on weak machines.Unlike some other blocky games, this one got actually some curves heheIf you think you cant be a good adventure dev, just look at me.I never thought i would get better than a 3k+ devrank but now i am @ 129 devrank o.OYou just need to be CREATIVE and release well thought and balanced adventures. Not just mass produce overstuffed loot&xp farm levels...Be careful tho, the community can report your stuff and the game devs will check your creations... and maybe ban it and block you from further publishing anything!Now buy the game, rock the ACK and round up some friends to beat all the adventures!

Early Access Review
								The words of the day: simplistic intricacy.Those two words sum up the whole of what Fight The Dragon (FTD) is all about.  At first glance, the core gameplay appears simple – and it is.  Upon a deeper inspection, however, the intricacies begin to emerge – particularly in its level designer, which I will go into more later. FTD is essentially Little Big Planet meets a simple overhead hack-‘n’-slash.  A number of community levels and a few tutorial missions await the player within this game.  The interface to select your adventure is easy to use and find what you’re looking for, and there is a search system that allows you to find a level that matches the difficulty you want, whether it’s a favorite of the community, or you can do a direct search for a specific title. The first order of business is to choose a character class: Fighter, Black Rogue, Fire Lord, and Ice Wizard.  Each of these classes has their own unique abilities and stats, which offers greater variety and opportunities to customize multiple playthroughs.  The appearances of your character can also be customized (to an extent) afterwards at your home base.While there are many options for combat in this game, the ones that will be used the most are the basic attack and a class-specific special attack (A and B respectively on an XBox controller, which I recommend using).  These moves are all you need if you employ a hit-and-run strategy like I do.  That’s the simple side of it; the more intricate side is that you can also block, dodge, and use another special move as well if you want.  But that feels a bit superfluous sometimes and the majority of your time will be spent just hacking and slashing with your basic moves.The game also provides ample possibilities for platforming adventures if combat is not where your interests lie.  Climbing, running, and leaping across chasms and lava appears simple enough.  However, doing it *well* takes  a little more attention and skill.  Then try doing it while some skeleton shoots arrows at you or a pyromancer blasts you with fire.  Or do it over lava where you have to think, “Okay, I have to time my sprinting right and aim perfectly or I’m gonna fall into hot burning lava and – dang it, now I’m dead.  Back to the checkpoint.”After a level, you can donate your unwanted equipment and excess gold to the Loot Shrine, building up enough credit to eventually earn a reward.  The more credit you build up before seeking a reward, the greater the reward.  It's a nice way to reward the people who spend time collecting what is often useless armor or weapons dropped in a level.But it is with the level editor that this game truly shines and brings to the forefront the reason FTD works so well.  Looking at a custom-designed level, it’s easy to assume that only someone who has played the game long enough and mastered the minute details could create something intricate and amazing.  At least, that’s the mindset I went into the level designer with. Boy, was I wrong.Within a matter of hours, I had created a level that involved a good amount of platforming and combat, tested it multiple times, and then released it to the community.  I had only played the game a few hours before to learn the basic buttons and get a feel for the game.  The instructions on how to use different components and how to connect cause-and-effects (i.e. kill this enemy, door opens).  Enemy stats can be modified to vary every time you enter a level.  There are also a lot of different options for what kind of level you want to create.  Various indoor and outdoor biomes are available, and you can mix and match at will.  You can create a massive level before you reach your “building point” limit, and that is half of the fun.  **To see the level I created in my first attempt, look up Necrypt in the level gallery.**However, there are a few points that should be addressed in terms of what this game does not do so well. Currently there is no way to rebind buttons on the controller.  Sometimes the button combinations to do something are not intuitive or easy (i.e. pressing RB and Y together to switch between primary and alternative weapons).Music tracks for the levels are limited to 9 arrangements that sound very similar.Sometimes when creating a level, if you accidentally enter “Event Picker Mode,” you can get stuck there and be unable to leave.  Let’s say you place an enemy and you enter this mode .  You have to select an object for it to be connected to, but if there is no such object around, you are stuck in this mode (hitting B does not free you from the mode).  Combat can feel extremely simple and not be too exciting after awhile.A few more options available in the character customization would not be amiss.All in all, Fight The Dragon is great fun.  The negative points I listed above are nitpicks at best, and they don’t interfere too much with the overall enjoyment of the game.  And as it is in Early Access still, I look forward to some of the features 3 Sprockets have yet to release.  But if you’re looking for a great game that is constantly growing in a community and bringing forth new features, take a look at Fight The Dragon.UPDATE NEWS:11/7LOCAL CO-OPHaving tried this mode with one of my friends, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  While split-screens tend to be too small to make out details clearly, having a two-player split down the middle wasn't terrible.  That may have been because we had a laptop hooked up to a TV, though.....One way that this mode would be improved would be to have the split be horizontal instead, giving a greater field of view for each player.  Granted, the reason that this was not done was to accomodate the vision lost by whoever would have the Keys or other information on their screen, but I tend to prefer seeing more side to side so I can tell what threats are around.Another annoyance (which may have been altered in an update just after this experience) was that two people could not be at the home base at once.  Which made the process of transfering goods into the Loot Shrine tedious because one person would have to use the Player 1 controller to drop off loot and money, then he/she'd have to return to the house and switch to the other player.  THEN the controller would have to be handed over to that person so they could do their transfers.  It doubled the administrative tasks needed before we could return to what we REALLY wanted to be doing: adventuring!DEVELOPER UPDATESI'm happy to report that I love the continued growth in content provided by the developers for this game.  Almost weekly there's a new update that adds more to the experience than the last and improves it.  More features for the level designer are being implemented, fixes are being made to some bugs -- all of this attention given to ensuring that this game continues to excel both surprises and delights me, and it makes me regret less and less that the DAY AFTER I purchased FTD there was a 50% off sale.Kudos to 3 Sprockets; you've done a great job with your game.  Now keep at it and continue to impress me more and more.**Review updates yet to be included/experienced:Online MultiplayerThe Dragon Fight "

												Thank you, Steam, because nobody else told me about this game. Cheap, cheerful, and often challenging, although turning up the difficulty while your character is low level might be an idea. It's easy to jump right in and make a map for you and others to play. You'll find out within a day or so exactly how well they liked it. Maps take about 12 minutes on average to play, and you can make a fun, good looking map in a few hours.My only complaints are: I wish I'd known about Fight the Dragon sooner and that it was more popular so that there'd be a sequel.

												Little Big Planet, 3D DOT HERO, Zelda, Diablo had a baby.And this is the result.You literally choose your own adventure. You can create your own adventure.To the lot of content 3sprockets provide, there's custom made ones.It knows how to deal with the useless junk you get in ""hack&slash "" games! It has a ""test your might"" mode where you benchmark your pro hero with pro gear against the dragon!An amazing game you can spend a lot of time, creating your own campaigns (or recreating other games ones! Just avoid Copyright issues!)... or playing them.There's content for every difficulty you can imagine. There are puzzle levels. Endurance levels. Epic campaign ""from peasant to king"" levels.The only ""minus"" side would be that it could feel a bit slow in movement or action. That's fine, it's not diablo 3 frantic clicking. But its still realtime!Would recommend a lot  "

												Not a lot to see here, and what the game does offer can be readily found in serveral other games that do it better and have more.I dont want to be a hater, but the game is really lacking in many aspects. Essentially a community driven map/mod platform with tremendously uninventive RPG elements.  Unrewarding gear, boilerplate combat, visuals that do not distinguish or impress.  Its not awful.  Its just not good.  Its on the bad side of mediocre, but it runs and works.  It just doesnt do much else.			"

												I rarely review something because it felt good. My first impressions always dictate if I will like a game or not. Good job to the devs, I liked everything I just experienced and I will play this game for a long time I think! Nice little dungeon crawler. No match to join online due to low community I guess, but you can grab two copies and play co-op with a friend, this is even better. Playing with an Xbox 360 controller was pure joy (you can even scale up the UI to play from the couch haha, little things). You can download little skins for your character from the Steam Workshop and even full adventures !			"

												Gameplay: 7.5/10Level Editor: 9/10Sound & Music: 6/10Replayability: 8/10VERDICT: 8/10To put it short, this game has one of the best and easy to pick up level creators I have ever played with. The combat on the other hand is decent enough and actually has quite enjoyable platforming and puzzle elements.The thing is that it won't be as interesting if you don't have an interest in the level creator nor have a friend who is an avid level creator. I really enjoy making levels for me and my friends to play together, so I indulge in that part of the game very much.Note that the game is still updating as I write this review!If I were to put it in bullet points, it would go something like this.Pros:+ Fun and simplistic 4-player dungeon crawling experience+ A fairly good selection of classes to play with, could use some more though+ Somewhat interesting rogue-inspired dragon main boss fight, accessible any time+ A unique and ever-expanding community driven experience+ Incredibly simple yet capably advanced level creator in the right hands, with lots to work with+ Well thought-out criteria for publishing an Adventure+ Randomized Loot System keeps finding loot interesting+ Some decent workshop support to make your character look more out of the ordinaryCons:- Inability to 'Fight the Dragon' cooperatively, even though the ability to feels implied in the title screen- Combat remains somewhat repetitive, particularly with the lack of variety in skills (updates may change this)- Enemy AI regardless of enemy 'difficulty setting' remains predictable (an eventual update, perhaps?)- Editor's Building Point and Difficulty systems somewhat strict, making it hard to create expansive and difficult single-adventure experiences- Editor only allows selection of regular and 'miniboss' enemies, no real boss-type enemies, resulting in massing enemies to create a sense of difficulty or dangerous boss-rooms- All enemies, logic nodes, and props handled on the same layer in Editor, creating some disappointing set-backs (I can't place enemies on top of destructible walls?)- Sound effects and music are somewhat limited- Needs a bigger community, join us!--- The Long Review ---To say it beforehand so that I can get it out of the way,I love this game. I understand that it is still being developed and I hope it has a bright future ahead of it.COMBAT AND GAMEPLAYThe combat is extremely simple with a simple attack button, use button, and skill buttons. There are also potions to use, whether healing or mana which can be found in chests placed by creators. The interesting part about the gameplay however, is that creators can incorporate platforming, traps, and verticality into their maps to build a more stylized playthrough. I appreciate a map that tries to put in a decent story, as well- seeing as the game itself at the core has pretty much no particular story in any way.Creators can also include switch, key, pressure-plate and enemy kill puzzles into their maps, making a level more than just fighting all the time. By nitpicking through the creator, I could even create these miniature cutscenes or sequences with whatever's available right now, too.This game has some super-simple and really effective drop-in, drop-out coop that takes no effort at all. Multiplayer really does make this game worth playing, and enemies try to scale in health and power.CUSTOMIZATIONCharacter customization allows you to choose from a variety of heads, and hair- allowing you to scale and position them how you want. Using the Steam Workshop, there are a selection of things there to make your character look more unique than the choices that are given to you by default (I love my pyramid head). If the community were larger, there would be such a great selection of things to turn your character into.LEVEL EDITORThe level editor is among of the best I've seen, while being easy to get into with many advanced things you can learn. The game offers many different kinds of tiles ranging from many different stones to sand to snow and etc. There's also a wide variety of props to help spice up a level design. Enemies with varying difficulty that can be placed in a level are varied enough so that there's enough to make diverse kinds of levels with different monsters to face- but more would be greatly appreciated.I won't go in depth, but where the editor gets fun is the inclusion of logic blocks, logic switches, gates, key doors and all that jazz. Utilizing the game's verticality also makes it more fun- being able to set up platforming areas or places that you need to jump or climb to reach. ABOUT THE CONSEven though there may be many cons in that list, I believe that many of them can be solved with future updates to the game, so long as it gets continuous support. Many people are still disappointed by the fact that you cannot cooperate to fight the dragon, though- myself included. Something needs to be done about the Fight the Dragon aspect of the game, but I don't think that's what makes the game special (even though it's the name of the game). The game however, is a little too easy overall and it'd be nice if there was more of a curve that isn't just putting a bigger handicap on.WE WANT MOREI would love for this game to be updated more and more so that level creators can make truly unique adventures between map-to-map- with things like tons of different enemies and dynamic environment objects like drawbridges, moving platforms, slippery blocks, catapults, water currents, rolling boulders and the like. Other things like the inclusion of friendly combat NPCs, vehicles, pets, and even tilesets would be great. I noticed a weapon label for each enemy in the creator, will we see enemies like Ghost Armour sporting a greatsword or giant flail at some point?There were more than enough times while I was in the creator where I said things like 'I wish I could do this' and 'I wish I could do that', but there just isn't enough yet to allow it. One of the biggest problems I faced while making maps was the building point limit and the difficulty limit, needing to add more potions or reduce/shuffle enemies around when I felt it was completely unnecessary takes up a lot of my time making a map. Campaigns do remedy this in certain ways though. Just give us more, FTD crew. I'm not expecting this to happen overnight, but we want more because we want to make even better maps for everyone to play- and I don't see anything wrong with that.THE PROBLEM AT HANDMuch of the problem remains in the fact that this game is fairly unknown, with none of my friends knowing this game even existed until I told them about it. Considering that this is almost a purely community driven game, this game needs to be supported by many people and this is a problem that may need to be addressed before it's too late.A WORD FOR THE FTD COMMUNITYThe last thing I can really say is that the community itself also needs to step up to the plate when it comes to making levels. There are many levels upon choosing quick-select that are simple hack and slash, very plain easy levels that aren't particularly unique in any given way. Being on a grand quest to fill out the map, I feel that using the quick-select is the best way to get that 'I'm on an adventure' feeling, otherwise I'd use the Gallery a lot more. I don't believe that this is something the developers can fix, but it would be preferrable to find some more of the great blood-sweat-and-tears adventures out there.FINAL THOUGHTSI really think that this game deserves more attention to bring out its true potential, and I want to see this game have a bright future because I think it has tons of potential to be expanded on. Buy this game- buy it on sale if you have to. Support the developers and contribute to the FTD community because there is the potential for something incredible here.			"

												This is a review of Fight the Dragon by 3 Sprockets games, an early access arpg on Steam.It is currently available for PC, OSX and Linux.The developers are planning on making it available on other platforms at some point. http://fightthedragon.com/Fight the Dragon is a Arpg-style game that takes elements from games in the Diablo or Torchlight series, and mixes them up with a bit of Little Big Planet as well as Minecraft. I've been playing arpg's of one sort or the other for many years-since the debut of the first Diablo game back in 1996 in fact. I've played almost every single game in the arpg genre. While Fight the Dragon isn't exactly like a traditional arpg due to its incorporation of things like puzzles and its lack of a main storyline I feel it more than makes up for it in its replay value as well as its customisability. It all starts with their Adventure Creation Kit. This is a simple to learn editor that allows players to create and share their own adventures. Players can also share their adventures or campaigns online. The game has Steam workshop integration. You can subscribe to custom character modifications that let you change your characters look OR you can share your own creations with others. Adventures (as well as gameplay) are also cross-platform. This game has a ton of replay value. There are over 3k player-made adventures, and more are added all the time. There's also four player co-op via internet OR LAN, and two player local co-op! Between single player content and multiplayer it means way more than your moneys worth. There  are features that haven't been implemented yet. Money has no use aside from the games 'loot sacrifice' system. Every player gets a loot shrine. They can add excess loot to get donation tiers. When you've donated enough items to reach the next tier you get to choose a random item of rare or better quality. It means your chances of getting something decent are good whether you accomplish an adventure or not. This game is challenging! It has easy maps but the real fun starts on medium. Maps aren't just about killing monsters. There are puzzles to solve as well. It means that no matter how many times you play the game there's always a new problem to solve which means less chance of losing interest. I think this game is worth the low price they're charging for it ($14.99, currently on sale (as of 12-10-14) for $11.99), and the developers are constantly adding great new features to it. I think this is a solid buy for any arpg fan or for anyone who loves a good hack and slash dungeon crawling adventure.			"

RPG'ish.the mechanics of melee attacks, mana/rage attacks, and movement seem like that perfect balance, so that you've got options and growth in what your character can do, but you don't have an overwhelming number of things that you can do that clutter controls and make gameplay fiddly.the comparisons are to Torchlight II, and that is a great comparison, a fair comparison, and a compliment to both games.once you start playing, if you have a mind and disposition for these things, you instantly recognize how the engine and the level editor are truly going to be best friends, and how creating levels for the engine is going to be intuitve and awesome for a fan with that creative bent.the browsing of fan content, and integrating that content into a given users play experience (the workshop/level browser) looks and feels like it could be awesome and literally a game changer for games using distributions systems like steam.it'll be interesting to see if the community driven content mechanic is able to seperate the wheat from the chaff so that players can get access to ""good"" levels, and robust, connected experiences.the content browser supports a number of filters that give some pretty good control to the consumer for finding the content from the community that meets good criteria, such as 'popular' and 'by a given author'.the engine and level development tools are designed to favor small experiences, which will make it interesting to see how larger experiences are serialized by level developers.with my limited gameplay experience so far, i have nothing bad to say about the engine ... i _really_ like how it plays, and i like the ""art"" and look and feel so far.the developer is taking a huge chance that the ""community"" is going to create good quality content that is going to make their game worth playing, vs. bad content making the game ""suck"".i'm a little worried about that part, but a) it's too early to tell, and b) i would imagine, if the developers are smart, that they might curate or produce enough of the content at some point, that the game could be played with _just_ that curated content and be complete and good.

												Fight The Dragon is, in its current form, very worth the money in my opinion. The level editor is fairly straightforward, and very nicely integrated in to the game. Because of the level editor, content never dries out, so there is always a new level to play. There will be the occasional bad level of course, because of the nature of user generated content, but even those can at least be enjoyed with good enough company.I would not recommend this game as strongly if you are not able to convince some of your friends to play it with you too, since that is where a lot of the fun comes from, but it is still enjoyable solo.The game is not without flaws, and in a lot of ways does kind of feel like it... hasn't REALLY left early access yet, despite recently transitioning to full release. But most of the issues at the moment aren't deal breakers (things like some equipment affixes not scaling well beyond the early levels), and the developers are still working on the game actively and are very interactive with the community, so I am not really worried about the issues all in all.

												By far this is my current favorite for a casual game. Lots of community-made levels and boy are they hard to finish. The community is relentless and unforgiving but I accept the challenge. I'll just get some more levels and take these guys on.When you're creating your own levels, it feels as though you're playing DnD which is a bonus factor for me.Overall, I love this game, good job to the developers and the community as well for such as awesome game. I see myself wasting a lot of hours in this game. Lots of replayability.BONUSSo far I have not seen any signs of a pay-to-win mechanism in this game and hopefully it stays that way.			"

												Simple, fun, old-school and rewarding. Best integration of a level editor into a game I've seen. Can be complex enough for adults or simple enough for kids. My thanks to the devs for adding the simple 'no blood' feature before launch -- something most players never see or use but will gripe about if mentioned, yet it allows me to buy copies for my kids (they don't like the blood, I don't need it and most who gripe about having the option aren't parents). Thanks.			"

Early Access Review
								Fight The DragonThe game play is pretty fluent and so are the animations.Some might call this a typical hack n' slash, and maybe I would agree... And that's not a bad thing at all. The whole game feel like a big love letter to the genre.You start out in your hub area, in which you create a new character and customize him/her (yes..there is a female avatar too).You can also use the ACK (the in game level editor) which will let you make small to mediumstories - Standalone adventures or whole campaigns, consisting of more adventures.This opens up a large community of player created content.Two adventures in, the game opens up for the loot shrine, and man is that good!!Besides the chest functionality we all know and love, the shrine offers something more...You go on the adventures and pick up loot, then sell all your junk loot to the shrine, whichwill fill up a bar. This will earn you four different tiers - Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum.Pick a tier and fill the shrine till you're there. Then chose one of three items or perks.The better the tier, the better the reward.Three adventures in, the game opens up the dragon mentioned in the title.This dragon has a ton of HP and it is going to take you a lot of tries to kill.Luckily, the dragon's HP is persistent, so you are going to shave it down little after little.Great game!

												TLDR: Very good game if you enjoy simple hack n' slash and like creating your own adventures.Pros: You can create your own maps and share them with the community. Almost all maps are created by the community. Map creation allows very complicated logic systems if you are skilled enough with them. Map creation is also very easy to get into. Pretty straight forward combat. Extremely random loot. You have no control on what you get. Devs are very active on steam forums. Most classes are fairly balanced but can use some work. Runs very smoothly. Looks like minecraft with tons of shaders and a very good texture pack. A helpfull community which is a great thing in a game where content is created by the community.Cons: Almost all maps are created by the community. Yeah this again. The reason is that some maps are just boring and not fun to play. Selecting a random adventure seems to select the better adventures. Slightly repetive combat. No real endgame other than getting better gear and creating epic maps. Fighting the actual dragon is not that rewarding and takes quite some time. Gold coins at the moment lack any use at higher levels. Enemy AI could use an upgrade. "

												Its been very seldom in my PC-gaming life that I have discovered a true gem of a game. FTD is such a game. I will break it all down into three parts: single player, online play ( multi-player), and creative. But first one thing that strikes me from the start: the graphic design of the game is such that it will ( or should) run on low-end computers. The visuals are, for lack of a better term- quirky. Its like a cross between Legos games and LBW with a dash of WoW. *Single player- In single player you go to an ""adventure"" screen where you can bring up an incredible assortment of maps to play on. It should be noted ( im guessing here) that over 90% of the availible maps are created BY OTHER PLAYERS. This is both a blessing and a curse: Player-made content is wide and varied. You may get a great and fun map; you may get one that was obviously made by a ADD 12-year old. If you enjoy a player-made map, you can choose to ""follow"" that creator. This is a wonderful feature that highlights other maps made by favorite creators. Very nice feature. * Multiplayer- I cannot honestly say I have much exp with this. Problem is that most of the games going are ""closed"" ( ie friends only). I have only been in one MP map and I got there near the end of the run. Overall it was ok. * Creative- Now THIS is the reason why I think FTD is easily one of the best games in years; The UI that is used to make maps is very user-friendly. I have exp making maps for other games and its usually a bad learning curve. With ACK ( the map editor) I was making a map within 30 min of starting. You can ""publish"" ( make availble to other players) your creations via a simple-to-understand vetting process. This process ( I assume) is used to keep junk maps from being offered. It works....most of the time.  You may still come across just plain bad maps. The bad side ( there has to be one right?)- The selection of enemy ( monsters etc) to place in maps are VERY limited. For a sword & sorcery game not to include enemy human casters? There are no, say, ""friendy"" men-at-arm NPCs to use. The list goes on. I can hope that all this will be added in future ( and free!) DLC.  Overall- Simple but effective combat system, graphics that are cute but not kiddy, an incredible creative tool, and MP options to boot. I hope the devs of FTD get really REALLY rich, because they actually DESERVE it! Rivetscore  9 /10  ** UPDATE++ July 21 2015 All of the above still holds true: I would just issue a warning for all those would-be story tellers out there; Don't bother. Want popular maps? The secret is to cater to the mouth-breathing imbecil players that want instant action / instant reward. Don't waste your time with characters, dialogue, set pieces...It will get you no recognition. Players today want ACTION. It bears saying that these same instant-action players will get bored quick and move on....to be replaced by more of the same.   I have been playing FTD since release and see much promise in the game; but the up / down voting system for maps stinks and stinks hard. I keep hoping the Devs will somehow wave the perverbial magic wand and set filters in place to furthur weed out what I call ""Crap Maps"" but it does not seem to be happening. Overall I stay with my original  Rivscore of 91/ 100  You have been warned!			"

Early Access Review
								There was a time that I loved supporting new games and to many times have I been burned when the developers all but stop with updates for months at a time. But this isnt one of them.Fight the dragon is an ARPG/Hack n Slash game where the adventures you go one are all made by the community. From dark forests to castles full of traps to long forgotten crypts this game has got it all. There is never a shortage of new and exciting levels to play. Be vigialnt though there are some out there who would put in exploit maps and unfinshed maps. The developers have stated they are working on a system that will find and block these maps. This game is early access to expect some unfinished or non-existant features. But that doesnt mean dont play it. Pros:*Maps made by the community means many hours of adventuring fun.*Plenty of loot to find.*Local spit-screen 2players / online 2-4 players co-op with lan rumored for a later release.*Want to make your own maps? Fight the Dragon comes with an in-game editor to create and publish a map of your own!The editor is easy to use and no coding or outside programs needed.*2 classes with more on the way!*Weekly and sometimes daily updates that does more than just fix bugs but add more contant.*Great and helpful communityHere are some do and donts for map creation. *Dont make exploit maps poeple dont like them and they will get blocked.*Always add the end game piece to ensure that its possible for a player to actually win.*Here is tip. Start with making easy maps. Most new players with have Easy maps shown to them before harder ones so making some great looking easy maps is a way to get your name out there as a great adventure maker!*When you play a map and it is an exploit or a map without a finish report it we want to keep the map selection clean and fun!I bought this game on a whim and I will never look back. I have to say that so far I'm impressed and cant wait to see more. The developer is constantly in the forums and actively replaying to suggestions, bugs, and feedback to ensure they are making the game for us to be played by us.I say get the game and enjoy the time you spend playing it but remember the game is in early access so if a feature isnt in yet or you find a bug dont go ranting off in the forums about it post in the bug section and it will be cleared up as soon as they can get to it.This is the best dungeoneering game I have come across as of yet and with time I'm sure it will be one of the best.Now lets hope for character skin mod support :D			"

												Finally an early access game releases, so many seem to live in perpetual alpha-state. Of all the early access/alpha games i have played this one is easily the best. The quest creator is fun and the community in general are quite a positive bunch who seem really creative. This makes for a lot of player-made content which is what this game is really about, it's about making your own dungeons/quests and playing others then giving them feedback to help improve their next venture or simply to say ""that was awesome!"".Its one of those games i put down and pick up again quite often, not something I could ever play for hours on end, but for 30 minutes here and there it works nicely.I certainly would not call it Little Big Planet meets Diablo though, more Lego meets Dungons and Dragons.Still, its a fun game and worth the price but i imagine a lot of people will get better value if they get thisn in one of the sales.

												There isn't a main campaign to play, so, to collect loot to build your character and kill the dragon you have to spend hours playing random community-created maps, which the majority consists of very bad designed, unbalanced and boring maps. There are some good adventures, but is like finding needles in a haystack. Also you wont find anyone to play online, so tell a friend to buy it or play alone.There is some annoying bugs. Sometimes you can't close a menu window and have to close the game by force (I just did it). The AI is incredible dumb, the enemies walks randomly, get stucked on terrain and objects or even just stop attacking.There are very few appearence customization options. The devs offers the possibility to edit and upload skins, but that's not much fun.I'm playing an ice mage and a rogue and it's just impossible to beat a level counting on ranged/magic weaponry, you must draw your sword/axe and go melee everytime, full armored. You start every level with your magic pool empty and no potions. There's no item shop, so you have to fight to fill the pool or scavenge for potions. I can't see the point to play a mage.			"

								A fun hack-and-slash game with 2 player couch co-op or 4 player multi online, a fair variety of enemies, a large amount of user-created maps and fun randomized loot, unique graphics, and excellent level scaling which provides a lot of replayability (or rather, to be exact... makes the game's challenge somewhat rather constant)Other fun elements of the game include a powerful dragon boss with 1,000,000 health, granting rewards for damage milestones, and a sacrificial altar that works as a randomized store to dispose of unwanted loot, an easy to use, yet with many different features implemented.As it seems like Steam Workshop support is on the way, there's not much else to ask for, the game is great as it is already, and very polished for an Early Access...

												I played the starter levels.. then the dragon fight arena opened up at my home...So I decided to take on the mighty dragon....And I died after scratching him for 69 hp out of his 1,000,000 health!Awesome game.  From being able to pawn a pile of loot and gamble on a 'dice roll' for something really good to the online co-op feature.Add in the insanely awesome level design editor where you can make an adventure to share with all other players, and you have a a truly great RPG gem of a game.While some people are calling this game ""Diablo meets Little Big Planet"", I don't see much Diablo here except for the massive random loot you'll collect.  In my opinion, this game is what ""The Mighty Quest For Epic Loot"" should have been.  This game is 10 times better then the Mighty Quest For Epic Loot with 50 times more control and creativity allowed in your level editor.  And this game allows you to play co-op as you adventure as well, and oh, yeh this game doesn't ask for any pay-to-win upgrades or perks as does Epic Loot.  So, if you've ever played Mighty Quest For Epic Loot, and enjoyed any aspect of that game, then this game is a MUST-BUY!  In my opinion, this is my first ever 'Must Buy' game I've bought and played on Steam, and with over 100 games to date in my library, that's saying something.  :-)Enjoy!			"

												This is the perfect game for when you only have 15-20 minutes to play a game, but you feel like playing an RPG.  Most similar games don't really have anything that you can actually accomplish in that timeframe.  Downsides:  The game needs difficulty of community generated levels to be voted on by the community.  I've already seen several community made levels that were very likely impossible marked as ""easy"".  I'm guessing this is done by trolls, but allowing people to just vote on how hard they thought the level was would alleviate that issue.			"

March 2015 Update.I came in to FTD around Alpha 2.1 and have been here ever since. It's worth saying that the game has only officially been out of Early Access since Dec 4th 2014 so it's still relatively new, It's also been upgraded to a stable Unity 5 version now.Sure, the Adventure construction kit is probably many peoples focus right now so there are more people making adventures than playing them, but as new game play features are released and improved that will help it shift back in to balance.It's a great little game with a very good community and an outstanding development team that are still constantly improving the game, openly communicating with the player base and pushing out regular content. These are the things that keep me invested in this game.------------------------------------------------------Early Access Review.Fight the Dragon, even in it's current early state this is a fantastic little Hack'n Slash RPG with the addition of a well equipped and simple to use Adventure Construction Kit (ACK).Right now the game is in Alpha 2.7 but is already surprisingly smooth and playable and I have experienced very few issues or bugs with the game or the ACK.Updates and patches seem to be coming out on a regular basis to fix existing issues and also add more tools and features, which tells me that the developers care about the game and are working hard to make it as enjoyable as possible.I highly recommend Fight the Dragon and I can't wait to see what the future has in store for this game.

												So this game is pretty fun, and I recommend it only if you have friends to play it with.  The gameplay is decent (if a little shallow), but there is no one playing it, ever. Also, slaying the dragon is a team grinding effort.

												Fight The Dragon is a simple hack and slash with light rpg elements and user created content that can be fun in short bursts for the right audience.PROS:-while simple, the graphics are quite colorful and charmingly cartoonish-frantic and simple combat is easy for everyone pick up-most adventures take 10 to 20 minutes to finish, meaning you can just fire this up and play one even if you're short on time-a good amount of different equipment options, all appearing on your character model when equipped-a ton of user created maps and campaigns to play-a nice and easy to learn adventure editor allows you to create your own contentand share it with other players-lots of user created character customization options in the Workshop-very fun in coop, also has a splitscreen modeCONS:-its simplicity eventually makes the game repetitive and hurt its longevity-fighting the dragon is actually pretty dull, you just go against it over and over (using scrolls given to you whenever you finish an adventure) slowly plinking its lifebar before it kills you-user created adventures vary wildly quality-wise: some are pretty unbalanced, a few might be broken and a good amount of them has bad english -the classes have not enough differences between themselves save a few exclusive abilities and equipment-enemy AI is pretty bad, I often saw them getting stuck on the environment or running in circles -enemy balance is a bit over the place, some have way too many HPs and/or damage-making kiting the only option-others summon way too many extra monsters-multiplayer is pretty dead, so you'll have to rely on friends for coop

Overall Fight The Dragon isn't a bad game at all, it's just a bit bland overall and perhaps too simple for its own good: the fact only one player in ten has ever reached level 10 with one character is pretty telling when considering the long term longevity of the game.Still, if you're looking for something simple to play every now and then and that won't take too much of your time this game is surely a good purchase at its usual sale price (3 to 5 dollars): it's basically a snack when compared to fully fledged hack and slash games but it works well enough. If you're looking for a good story, deep character progression and engaging combat you can safely skip this one instead. "

												This is an incredible game. The mechanics are fast-working, and the game has no lag. The lever creator software is simple to use, but also allows for an incredible amount of freedom. It is slightly tedious, but the adventures come out incrediblty, as long as you've thought them through. The hack-n-slash adventure mechanics are fun to play, and there is always a challanging level to play.With amazing skins and graphics, and an overall amazing playstyle, this game has it all. Two thumbs up!			"

												Do you want a simple, couch co-op ARPG that you can play with your friends, your kids, or your relucant girlfriend? If so, this is the game for you.With new dungeons created every day, and a rating system to keep the crap from making its way to the top, the replay value of this game is unlimited. Combine that with dedicated developers who improve the game on a regular basis, and you've got a recipe for long-term success.This game is an absolutely stellar value and I can't recommend it enough.

												Wow. Just wow.Very cute, quite in depth, fantasy game in which the community creates the content. Go on (and create) adventures that the community puts together using the basic and seamless level building tool, ACK, to level a charater, collect loot, and experience others' stories.ACK also has a rudimentary logic system, buttons, keys, and the like, allowing for you to make various genre of maps, such as puzzle, platformer, and quite demanding combat.Game play can be a bit heavy at times, as you have to wait for animations (such as swinging your axe) to play out before using other abilities. While this punishes over reaching, it can be a bit frustrating!Comes quite highly recommended!EDIT: Done messed up, you can dodge and block. My bad!			"

												*Edited my earlier comments*FtD is a blast to play but you have to pay attention to the details.  If you want to select which user-created content you are going to play you have to right-click on the tiles to bring up the gallery.  Pay close attention to adventure ratings as players are able to rate content higher or lower.  Also, pay special attention to the easiness of adventures.  I made the mistake of playing more difficult adventures which my character was not ready for.  But I went back and chose correctly for my character and skills and was able to finish with minimal deaths. :)FtD may require a few passes before you ""get it"".  Once you do, it's a hoot to play.  It's nice to be able to quickly run through an adventure.			"

												I cannot recommend this game enough. There is very little to complain about. Fun for short or extended play sessions. Progrssion is fair, and nothing is blocked behind a paywalls. No fun bucks required, just buy it, play it, the sky's the limit. It's everything that I wanted in Quest for Epic Loot, but didnt' get.First off, I feel like this game is like if Zelda, Diablo, and Little Big Planet. And like LBP it has something for everyone. if you like to play top down rpg's; you have an ever expanding selection of adventures. If you like to be creative, the level creatore is robust yet easy to learn. And, within those two categories' it has much to offer for the level of complexity that you desire.You could focus on being artistic or you can use it more like RPG maker. Designing complex events, quests, or puzzles. You could simply play a level or two and see the sights or you could could delve heavily into optimizing your stats. Play by yourself, with friends, or strangers.The online component is very intuitive. You can group up with friends privately or publicly. I haven't had any serious problems with lag. And, since it's all cooperative I have seen the least ill will playing this than any other online game I've ever experienced.I like thet there is some steam workshop support for character models. Instead of having to spend real money on fun bucks when I get bored with my appearence, I can just download a new one. It's touches like that that make me feel like I'm not being denied any content so the dev can weasel money out of me.Also to the devs' credit. they have a suggestions forum that they actially take into acoount when releasing updates. So if you feel something is lacking, they may actually improve on it itf it's a good idea.All in all, 9 out of 10. Worth every penny.			"

								A good start for pre-release, fun combat and nice looking graphics.You can make your own dungeons with a user friendly editor, and as far as I have seen most dungeons are user created.  There are those slightly annoying dungeons that have a stupid challenges like climbing up on the edge of the map to jump over props blocking the way, I don't mind tons of mobs, traps, keys and so on.  So do be aware that some people will create stupid dungeons.If you are interested in the editor it is quite nice.[This review is early and I may add more in the future]			"

First of all, the graphics are great ! the art is really unique and everything is made with lots of taste. Second, the music is excellent so are the sound effects. Three, the gameplay is really good too, u use w-s-a-d to move the character and turning the mouse around to face a direction, it's smooth and feels great. And i have a special ""coup de coeur"" for the blood effects, really awesome stuff. The game is in alpha but already so much content it looks like, you can create your own levels and there are achievements and trading cards too. But really, check this one out, trust me.			"

								INDIE/RPG VALHALLA!!!!!  This is a fun Diablo + Minecraft type of game that you can play with friends or solo. The idea of building your own levels normally means a HUGE time sink but this game allows you to spend a small bit of time making simple levels to fully laid out levels with your imagination as your guide. It's simple, fight through levels of enemies getting tickets towards an epic boss battle (A Dragon) where you can get epic gear. The Devs are fully invested in this game giving updates often and they aren't always just minor tweaks but full bug fixes/additions etc. I also haven't noticed too many bugs other than a few enemies sticking in walls etc. but it is minor and not game breaking.Right now you can play two types of characters (knight/Fire mage) with two or more to be added later. The controls are mappable (ie.. WASD/Arrow keys) and the game plays great and is a lot of fun! A must buy for any RPG player! You can only level up to 30 atm but that will change as the game additions flood in. This is one of my favorite games atm. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!			"

Did a couple solo runs and he is giving me a good challenge. Probably just need to level up some. Overall really fun hack slash and loot based game!			"

												This is one of those games that is special. It isn't perfect, nor is it amazing, but it's definitely special. The concept is simple, your typical Diablo clone (though it feels more like Gauntlet) with a bit of Little Big Planet. There isn't a whole lot of Little Big Planet influenced content. For example, the way you can customize your character is limited. You find loot and you wear it. The loot makes your character both look different as well boosts some stats, enable some abilities, etc. Little Big Planet wins hard by character customization. As far as level creation goes, it wins as far as I can tell. Maybe it doesn't win by content, for Little Big Planet wins hands down as far as content you can mess with, but this game wins as far as control to the point you can actually make some pretty fun quests.The gameplay is simplistic. You attack, you level up, you develop a play style, you get better, you attack more. You finish levels for loot, coins, and xp. Loot and coins can both be donated to a ""shrine"" in your home level (or pod, if you're thinking little big planet, but you cannot customize it like you could your pod in LBP). When you donate enough and then pray, you then unlock randomly options you can choose from such as a better item, stamina boost, health boost, inventory increase, etc. There is one thing unique beyond all of this, you're doing all of this for one major objective. You are leveling yourself up and grinding for better items so you can fight a dragon. Shocker, a game called Fight the Dragon and it's all about fighting a dragon. The catch is that it has a lot of health, 1 million HP to be exact, and your goal is to fight it and deal as much damage as possible. If you die, the hp doesn'treset. You can die and come back later, continuing where you have left off. This is a cool, interesting, unique game feature. Considering how low of a price this game is, the fact it still has a four pack, and how enjoyable it is, I'd say it's worth full price easily. If you want, you can easily wait for a sale where it goes nearly half off, which is an even more incredible deal. The game might not get 100 hours from me, but I'll get my money's worth.			"

												Note: As it stands, I can't really recommend it. I might play more later and this could change, but it is as it stands.Fight the dragon is your base RPG formula. Pick a class, fight monsters, get gear, level up; and eventually hit the key component: Fight the Dragon. I won't go about telling you what classes there are, cause like all RPG's there is the main variety. You got your physical, your magical, and your dexterity.What I want to get into the grit about is the gameplay. Playing the game feels a bit stiff or awkward in most cases, and it's mostly attributed to hitboxes. When you attack someone there's a good chance you'll hit them if you're so close to them you're clipping inside, but other than that you can seriously end up missing for stupid reaesons that can result in you dying very quickly.Even when fighting skeletons in the tutorial, I found several times that I'd take swings at them and watch my blade go through them with no damage done, but they do the same in return and actually manage to connect to me. There's also been times where I'd attack and it'd hit, starting off a combo. But wait! The enemy was nudged back a bit, so I miss the rest of my combo by a hair, letting me take more damage.The real struggle is with elevated platforms and ranged enemies. Did you know I honestly thought wraiths couldn't be hurt by basic attacks at first? Cause I'd get within breathing range and swing and they'd fly right through me without it connecting, but only after a few more attempts did I Realize they can in fact be hit. This was mostly because most of the time they were hovering above me just enough to have it not count.Which brings me to elevation. A platform that's short enough to the point where you can walk up onto it without a climb should not prevent me from attacking an enemy that my sword is going right through their ankles! And when you are on a map with ranged way above where the player cant reach? You can ♥♥♥♥ right off. Especially with custom maps that like using these types of enemies.That said, all the maps in the game are - aside from the provded - custom. This is the main key, and this naturally leads to some really unbalanced situations with custom maps, but dev maps are pretty reasonable for the most part.Suggestions- Make hitboxes a bit more reasonable. You can size it out even half an inch or more and it'd be an improvement- Lower health on ranged enemies. It's bad enough they sprint away from you at twice your speed- FIX BLOCKING. Seriously, that thing is bipolar. Even at maximum health, it struggles to do jack♥♥♥♥♥♥half the time. Sometimes it feels like you need to block, and sometimes it feels like that axe needs to go past it into your face. "

								Not played long, I play in short spurts, but what I've played I've enjoyed, the graphics are fun if functional, the loot is interesting, the developers do regular updates, which other devs should take note of, and the game is overall a lot of fun. It's simple but there's a lot of variety in the gameplay, it all ends up being hack slash loot, but they try to mix it up with puzzles, and mix the original maps with user generated maps. I really enjoyed this title, especially at the price point it is. The loot system is fun, and allows you to customise almost all aspects of armour, which all offer different varying attributes for your character.It can be too simple at times, but I think this is meant to be the little big planet of hack slash loot titles. It has nostalgic feelings of gauntlet, and dungeon crawlers. The graphics variety is nice, sound effects are adequate, but its he gameplay and the loot that keeps me coming back for more.Oh and that dragon, what a B*, fun as hell, but difficult too. There's plenty of updates that add more and more items, more loot, more enemies and so on. The fact that it has a very simple interface means that creating custom user generated levels with the tools at hand is not a difficult feat.All in all I really really like where this game is headed, and would definitely recommend it amongst the recent crop of Early Access titles			"

												This is a great game which brings a bit of nostalgia as it resembles the oldschool Legen of Zelda game. You don't need realistic graphics to make a great game. This game provides hours of entertainment since a lot of the dungeons are user created or randomly generated so you'll get some imaginative dungeons from some creative users. It has your typical RPG elements with different classes (Warrior, Rogue, Ice Mage, and Fire Mage), loot drops, and stat points as you level up. I've been playing for about 65 hours and it still keeps me entertained every time I play it. A difinite buy for the price.			"

												This game is freaking fantastic! I bought it almost as after after-though since I do like Diablo, but I'm not a huge fan of Little Big Planet... So the description threw me off at first. If you have any doubts about the game, check out some videos on You Tube, they'll give you a pretty good idea about the gameplay. It's a great game and lots of fun... :)One other thing that threw me off: There is no selling of loot in this game. I thought, ""What good is a game with loot if you can't sell it to buy better gear?!?"" But all is well... This game has a very unique system whereas you ""donate"" your gold that you pick up as well as items you decide not to keep. Yeah, that sounds like fun, right? But what you get in return is awesome... The gold and each item has a value and as you donate more, you increase in level as to how good of an item (or special skill or whatever) that you get in return when you ""pray"" (in other words, choose to cash in on your generosity). It works very well in this game and is easy to get used to. Very inventive!I haven't built any levels myself yet... Just been having fun playing levels that other folks have built... And I've already come across some great ones! Very, very cool, and lots of fun! Been playing with an X-Box 360 controller and it works great. It's definitely a pick up and play game, but I can see I'm going to get hours sucked out of my life with this one. Definite Two Thumbs Up!			"

								After playing this game for some hours I find it quite enjoying. Though there are still some few bugs, it plays great, sometimes it doesn't feel like an early acces game at all! I use the feature to just click a tile and it chooses a next adventure for me. This way you never know what you are going to get and it can be a surprise in a good or bad way! One of the very fun parts of this game is that as a user you can create your own adventures, so there are some great user created maps out there! Also some less fun, but you can delete those and play the other ones. You also get a notification in case the world map gets an update, and you can play the map again. After completing the map, you can rate it to the user and tell him what you thought about the map. Like a normal adventure game, you run around killing mobs for loot and money. There are different types of loot as in other games, and you can equip your character with with loot designed for his class.

												Probably one of the most charming and innovative little games i have ever come across. Fight the Dragon allows it's players to develop an RPG style character while at the same time, building their own worlds/levels and even allowing you to share your own and play other people's levels. The artwork style is very very attractive and the game runs great. It will take anyone a little while to grasp some of the mechanics of the level builder but within the hour you'll be cruising along setting traps, spawning trolls and building towering castle walls. The building style is essentially Minecraft but with a blank canvas and on a much grander scale. Sadly however the community hasn't really kicked off as of yet so youre looking at only 1500 content creators. 9/10 and i hope this game gets more publicity.			"

												Alright, so I just spent the last forty hours building characters, running modules, and eventually creating my own... and that was only in the first six hours.     I've actually worked on industry RPGs and found the design engines too technical or too time consuming to put forth the efforts to make anything of my own.  The beauty of the editor here is that it's so user-friendly it's ENJOYABLE to operate, ""and that has made all the difference.""  Gameplay is simple but engaging and the interface to switch items between characters works perfectly with the altar to donate unwanted items for better ones.     The community has been friendly, helpful, and imaginative in their own designs.  The voting community is firm but fair for exploits and grinding modules, but the ability to update easily allows for quick edits and upgrades.       Keep an eye out for my work, I'm hooked!			"

Early Access Review
								I love this game thus far! I've never really written a review but I have loved this game since I saw it, then bought it, and played it.The Good!-Creative level disign-LOCAL CO-OP! (Wish it was 4 player local co-op though)-I love making maps for friends to run though!-Basic controls (Xbox Controler) for beginers to games (my grilfriend) to play-Entertament in short bursts. Great for casual gamers that want something to do between work, dinner, spending time with family and sleeping.-Awesome artstyle I love that it's not trying to be real!-Traps are to be feared for once! (Unlike most other games... Looking at you Skyrim..)-It's a Rouge like if it wants to be but for the caual gamers there are check points!-YOU WILL DIE! AND ITS FUN AND OK!-When you die your body stays where it died even when you respawn. Gives the feel like an actual adventure died!-You can make a story when you make a map! You make the NPC's stay want you want them too!-Naming bosses is awesome-Killing monster A to open door A or pulling a lever is a cool idea! Makes you feel like a map maker!The bad!-Keyboard and mouse gamers bewear! It's annoying to have the camera angle changing buttons( Q and E ) so close to the moving buttons (W S A D) because in the heat of combat I want to strafe but end um rotating the camera and jumping in lava or getting my face smashed in my an oger or minitoar.-NO FOUR PLAYER LOCAL CO-OP? Come one Dungon Defenders did it really well! Get on it! I have roommates!-Can't play it for more than a few hours (2) because you get board. (Unless your making maps.)-Needs more monsters to fight!-Needs a better loot genorator-Whats gold for?-Fire mage class is OP AS ♥♥♥♥! (Hoards of monsters bewear!)-Better sound efects. Very basic.Overall!8.5/10 Worth the buy and hoping only more to come as it develops!			"

												Hack and slash RPG with focus on community-created maps. Fun to play with friends.The strong point on this game I think is the community maps--unlike Torchlight II, you can play the custom maps as soon as you finish the first level. The custom maps are very rich in varieties--ranging from simple hack and slash ""kill the boss"" map, to puzzle and crime investigation and campaign map. The great stuff is the community collaborates together in those custom maps, creating a series of maps with sequencial stories.Here are a few examples of those:


Advent Calendar 2015 
A Guide for Fight The Dragon
By: Astranon

			Celebrate the Christmas season with this collection of wintery adventures. Completed as a community project, this merry bundle is a gift for all to enjoy.		


http://steamcommunity.com/app/250560/discussions/3/412446292756896658/It's a pretty fun game to play with friends, but it should be noted that the game itself is pretty barebone: albeit having diverse loot (which gives you some different ways of combat), there is no skill tree. You have skill progression but there is no branch. So with only four classes (Fighter, Rogue, Fire Mage, Ice Mage) there aren't much abilities to be invested in. Also, there is no main storyline as the game relies heavily on custom maps.If you want a quick no-brainer hack and slash with very diverse levels and have several friends to play with, go get this game.

Early Access Review
								A highly enjoyable game with lots of potential. This review is based on Early Access: Alpha 2.1. The concept of this game is simple, explore an array of user generated dungeons to acquire equipment and improve your character, currently only the Fighter & Fire Lord are available to play.The games combat system is simple and well defined, though I am not entirely comfortable with the controllers interface, I found myself continuosly trying to open( X ) an enemy rather than attack them. Perhaps allow for controller remapping, or provide a map that uses the Left/Right Triggers for combat?Enemy characters look exceptional and are initially enjoyable to slay, however after a few levels I found myself killing the same monsters with little variance in their combat tactics, most monsetrs operate on a run towards player and attack strategy.The game provides a swathe of equipment, with some rather enjoyable names, running through a dungeon can easily see your backpack being full of primarily junk items which you don't seem to be able to sell anywhere. In fact you can accumulate money but I'm not sure where you spend it?Dungeons can feel slightly bland with monsters only being used as the main challenge, hopefully as users become more familiar with the map-editor and the editor provides more tools to create unique set-pieces that provide memorable engagements this will be satiated.Overall I found the game exceptionally enjoyable to play, but as it is Early Access lacking some of the components that could make it a truly great game. I look forward to seeing more from the developer, 3 Sprockets.			"

								A must have game and deserves a place amongst the greats in the history of gaming.Fight the Dragon is thoroughly enjoyable hack 'n' slash adventure that is supprisingly suitiable for both casual players and entheusiasts.Game sessions are divided into mini-adventures where you enter a perilous dungeon to conquer foes and discover epic loot.The mini-adventure style combined with reams of user generated content, creates the right balance of endless game play while still producing a great sense of accomplishment and progress as you play the game.This is a brilliant must have game.

												Another game that offers an addictive building mode, I played Fight the Dragon pretty heavily when I first got it. I became obsessed with the dungeon creator mode. I had even made the top 100 list at some point, which was pretty cool. After I created my King George dungeon, I lost interest. That's par for the course with me, though, and not a complaint about the game. I play obsessively until I've had enough, then break for a while. But if you like games with creative modes, then you'll probably enjoy Fight the Dragon.The game has more to offer than just the creative mode, but that's what I was there for. :)			"

												I can only tentatively recommend Fight The Dragon as it stands right now.The game, when it behaves, is fun. Slashing or blasting your way through adventure after adventure is addicting, whether you're running through a new one or coming back to an old favorite for the thirtieth time because it's solidly made. The rewards for doing what the name of the game asks of you are nice, thought the timers are a bit irritating. The Adventure Creation Kit works just fine, as well. Which it should, because that's where Three Sprockets seems to be putting all their attention.Some weapons refuse to connect. The greatsword is the perfect example; the first two swings tend to miss. A lot. Even if the swing looks like it should have bisected your target. The axe also tends to catch air if you put it half an inch to the side of where the axe thinks it should be. Using these weapons WILL have you taking unnecessary hits. Projectile hitboxes are also an issue, with staff bolts impacting the guy next to your target, or the auto-target clinging to a mook because it happens to be a foot closer to you than your target.Then there's the platforming. It's weird, sticky, and slide-y. Relatively flat levels won't have the issue, or at least it won't be that noticeable. But, considering that the game is pretty much all community levels - and I won't be speaking to their quality here, it's not the place - there are going to be platforming challenges, even if the level description doesn't advertise it.Tip: ANGLE THE CAMERA.Make the jump straight forward. If you don't, there's a good chance you'll just 'walk' on the edge for a bit before the game gets bored and bounces you off into the abyss. Simple things like stairs can either be a little flavor added to a level or a fragmented turd unceremoniously pinched off from the♥♥♥♥♥♥of the Antichrist. You will - WILL, it's a guarantee - see your character fling themselves off into empty air because you turned around on a cliffside and got too close, or be attracted Nathan Drake-style to a climbable ledge precisely when you don't want to be.If Three Sprockets fixes the above - come on, guys, combat and movement are only TWO-THIRDS OF THE GAME - then I can fully recommend Fight The Dragon. As it stands now, only get it if you can handle the game not doing what you tell it to.			"

 Early impressions and a very cautious recommendation this is an early impression of fight the dragon, as such this ""review"" may change over time. however most if not all the mechanics of the game have been shown to me, and i'm really just playing through user created content now. This early impressions does not include co-op or the level editor, this is based purely on the single player experience Fight the dragon is a Community driven hack n slash RPG with tons of loot, played in an isometric top down sort of style. The main goal seems to involve level grinding up to attain better loot to fight the dragon, to get more loot so you can level grind more and eventually beat the dragon. This game has been quite a bit of fun to play so far however it becomes pretty repetitive pretty fast. I've put together a bit of list based on what i've seen so far and then catagorized them into a pros and cons sort of list. PROS  Nice, sleek, cute graphics works great with a controller (in fact i think i'd recommend a controller for this game) Tons of loot  A lot of levels to play through (i'm talking about over 9000 levels, though most seem to be beat-able within 5-10 minutes; which is a good or bad thing depending on your point of view) some nice puzzles and level design (depends entirely on the content creator) content seems to entirely come from the community, which is rather nice CONS  so far death has only come to me through sheer overwhelming numbers or falling off the map the combat system is very repetative, you have your normal attack, strong attack, dodge and about 4 magic spells (3 of which are unlocked through level progression), there is a bit of variety though with 4 classes to choose from but they all have what is mentioned above in terms of combat enemies are pretty much all the same and act the same except for a few speciality monsters (they just tend to run after you or if they're ranged they'll shoot at you however they always miss if youre moving around) there's not much to say in terms of combat tactics other than just kiting to stun and then using magic, you also have health and mana potions, but there's no in-depth, immersive combat to speak of. level progression seems rather slow overall combat is lack luster, it's enjoyable at first but because of its rather simple combat mechanics gets old rather quickly. Conclusion Fight the dragon offers a neat little hack n' slash supported entirely by a community, it offers a ton of loot and levels to play through. The game suffers from shallow repetitive combat that brings the overall experience down to knee deep level grinding while hunting for better loot to slay the dragon.overall i would only recommend this game if it's on sale due to it being rather repetitive in nature because of it's combat mechanics.

												It reminds me like Diablo 2.. You kill stuff, open chests and get items. You also get experience and your little ""Main Menu House"" gains new areas like a Loot Shrine and a Dragon Arena.. The loot shrine lets you ""Donate"" you gold plus unwanted items so (If you save up enough) you can claim an amazingly better item :D! It also has an adventure creator so you can make your own adventures and/or campaigns! It really is worth more than the price listed to be honest. It's a must own if you are into these types of games!			"

												As someone who purchased this game for about $3 during a sale, I have to say I'm very happy with it, as such, my positive recommendation is based on a sale price - I can't speak the value of full-price.Despite this, just look at the list of features this game provides. Online and local co-op, as well as fully customisable characters and a plethora of user-generated content. You'll basically never run out of stuff to do. Playing Fight the Dragon with 4 friends is honestly a treat, and the map creator is fun and extensive.Really my only gripe with the game is that as of the last time I checked you can't fight the eponymous dragon with friends, as it seems to be a strictly single-player experience. All in all a great game which is a steal if you can get it as cheap as I did.			"

												----------------------------------Personal opinion-------------------------------------------If you are in doubt about this game I’ll resume to you what it is in just one phrase: ""FIGHT THE DRAGON HAS EVERYTHING YOU COULD EXPECT OF A GREAT AND EPIC GAME"".We could see around the steam thousands of indie games being abandoned and the creators just do not give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about their customers. They just gave it up and we players who paid for the game… you know. But anyway, in this case the game feels extremely the opposite, the creators look extremely friendly and attentive to the community, I always seens SeonR on the forums answering the guys and giving help to them. They do updates every week, not great ones but they’re always improving the game. I also added him and he just accepted and I was just like: lol? Seriously?Yeah! They are “the guys”, if you still not believing me, go in the forums and check for yourself!----------------------------------------Technical points---------------------------------------Overview in topics:- Physics looks perfect and really well done. (10/10)- Graphics. (10/10)- Key bindings. (8/10)- Fun. (Over 8000+ haha)- Overall gameplay. (9.5/10)- ACK Maps editor .(9.5/10)*They will need some time to do more props andoptions to make your own dungeon/adventure/campaignand of course do some opmitization in the commands. But there'snothing to reclaim about, it works fine and fulfills the purpose letting youto create great and epic campaigns/adventures.- Music (3/10)This is the only thing i've to reclaim about, there are no much options of music and it turns sickening over the time, but as it was released few days ago and as I've seen, the game creators are VERY, seriously VERY COMPETENT and active in the forums solving troubles, doubts and any other kind of issues. So all you need to do in this case is give them time, that's all they need.			"

Early Access Review
								Short version- Found a cardboard box, wore a cardboard box, got smashed by a dragon. A++I don't do reviews, but I feel a bit compelled to do one here because this game really could use more press. This is probably one of the best independent developments I've played, with (as far as I know) an almost entirely novel premise, given that  nearly all the content of the game will be community generated.It's already very fun in its current state. The mechanics are simple, very easy to pick up if you've played any recent isometric action RPGs. The controls are reasonably intuitive, and suit controller based play particularly well (although keyboard and mouse is perfectly viable). Combat is reasonably challenging and satisfying, with slightly more dependence on reflexes than other similar games. There are only a few fundamental puzzle mechanics at the moment- switch operation, pressure pads, key hunts and (interestingly) an autojump mechanic that is based on terrain height. That last mechanic, while seemingly restrictive, actually leads to some interesting puzzle design, and I've already seen it used quite well in some of the player made content.There's the odd bug or ten still, balance is a bit whacky, and some of the content that does need to be developer created (such as classes and items) is a little sparse at the moment, but this is both a great indie development and a very good quality early access in my opinion.

Early Access Review
								The selling point to Fight the Dragon seems to be that it's the Little Big Planet of Hack n' Slash games. Sadly, if anyone really believes that statement, then they clearly don't understand what LBP is.The game itself is very bare bones and is very far away from having the complexity of LittleBigPlanet 1, let alone 2. Yes, it's currently in Early Access, but I am not seeing any promises of seeing any real depth being added to the game by the time it reaches 1.0.The gameplay is shallow at best. Sure, you have 4 classes and several abilities to boot, with both melee and ranged combat, but it's still just the bare minimum of what can be considered gameplay. After the first 5 levels played you WILL have seen 90% of the replay value this game could possibly offer. Hit enemies. Back off a bit to counter their grouping up on you. Hit them some more. Repeat forever. Activate an AoE skill once in a while not out of necessity but just for the sake of changing things up. So that's the gameplay aspect. But what about the user-created-content? Well, it suffers from two things in particular:1) The shallow, repetitive gameplay directly affects custom content. Simply put, there's only so little you can do with the creation tools that will make your time worthwhile, and those are mainly cosmetic things like the visual design of your map or the story/dialogue paired with it. 2)There's very few Logic-systems in the game to work with, and this is what separates this game from the likes of LBP. You are handed the tools to make a top-down hack n' slash dungeon and nothing else. You are creating maps for one very specific game. In LBP, you have the ability to create interesting platforming maps, combat, cutscenes and puzzles limitied almost entirely by your own imagination. You can make a map with a working Chess game complete with a functional AI who can Check-Mate you. Fight the Dragon doesn't even remotely come close to having that level of depth.Now a game isn't bad just because it's not LBP. I simply bring that up because it seems to be somewhat of a slogan for this game, and it's wrong. This game gets a thumbs down because it's shallow. Gameplay becomes boring in a matter of a couple hours and if you're a fan of user-generated-content, you've probably played/used numerous other software that puts this game's Editor to shame already.For now, this is being uninstalled for me, but I'll follow the developer to see if they have anything substantial up their sleeves. The only possible way I can recommend this game for now, is if you intend your young child or sibling to play it, as they will likely have the attention span required to have real fun with this game, due to simply not having experienced anything better.

												I can't say I didn't know what I was getting into here - the game is very clear about having a great deal of replayability due to user-created levels. However, I expected there to be more developer-created levels than the few you have access to. The developer levels seemed to be more professional and balanced than user-created maps, which can sometimes be sloppy and disjointed. Additionally, I bought the game because of the co-op feature, and then found that I could only ""Fight the Dragon"" in single-player. Quite a disappointment. I don't think that the game is objectively poor - a lot of gamers love user-created content (Mario Maker, Little Big Planet, etc.). However, the grab bag of quality just doesn't appeal to me.			"

								I can see what this game will be when it's finished, and very much look forward to playing that. As it is at the moment, however, I can't recommend it. There are a lot of short mini levels available to play, made by the community as well, and the level editor is definitely fun to play around with - when it saves. The main problem I find is the difficulty. It's ridiculous. You can go along quite nicely beating up this that and the other, then you come across something else and it kills you over and over until you lose the level. The difficulty spike between the ""normal"" mobs and these is huge. When this issue is addressed, still in early access or not, I could easily recommend this to waste away the hours.			"

												I just bought this game because it was on discount and i thought it was some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and short game that i could just quickly play through when i get bored.BUT!I was very wrong! This game takes time and it's actually really fun!But it gets boring after a while if none of your friends play the game, it does have an option to share your current session so random players can join you.You have 4 different characters to choose from, all of them have multiple different skills and playstyles. You can also make your own maps to play on or share for others to play, you can also play the adventures that other people have made. The maps are often quite big and have multiple areas that are quick to explore with other people, which is why i recommend to play this with friends!I really like and recommend this game!(The first people to see this are probably my friends and this is a message only for them!)Guys... Please... someone buy this game so we can play together! It's boring to play alone!(The first people to see this are probably my friends and this is a message only for them!)			"

												I didn't expect to put so much time into this game when I opened it up. I didn't even know where I got the game in the first place. I've only been playing for less than a week and I recently checked my playtime and I was surprised to see that I had put over 40 hours into the game. I don't plan on stopping any time soon either.The game is a simple hack and slash with very basic mechanics that do tend to get repetitive and boring and somewhat tiring. I've only played the rogue with a crossbow so I can't speak for the rest of the characters, but I feel like they'd be pretty similar as well. You just kite everything until it's dead.The level up system is also very basic and pretty standard for an RPG. There isn't a huge variety of looks for weapons and armour, or even names as far as I can tell. Actually customization for your character includes different types of hair and clothes but not much else.The focus of the game is obviously to kill things, beat levels, and get stronger, like most other RPGs. But the main focus, and the selling point of this game in my opinion, is the user created levels and the level creator. The level creator is is very easy to learn and use (might take a little bit to get used to though due to the control scheme) and is capable of creating some very detailed and deep levels. I've spent most of my time making my own campaign and I'm loving that I can bring my stories to life. There have been multiple times where I'd queue up the spawn of many different entities and actions and I very much expected the game to either freeze or crash but I haven't seen even a drop in FPS. It runs surprisingly smooth. It's also very fun playing other people's levels and seeing what kinds of things they've come up with.All in all, the game looks and feels like it's in its early stages. I don't know whether or not it is or if there are plans for updates but it doesn't matter to me. What is displayed now is enough to keep my attention for hours and more being added in would only be a bonus.Great game.			"

								     I tried to hold off on buying this until it was further along in production, but I caved within a few days of discovering it. I have to admit, I was a little disappointed at first. There are some key features missing, e.g., a ""loot shrine"" to sell/buy goods, customization, etc. I also noticed a lack of music and sound effects (I'm not sure if this was due to a bug or not) sometimes while playing. The bugs are few and mostly managable, with the exception of one that somehow disables the ""use"" button. Of course, all this is to be expected in an early access game, and, to be honest, this is probably the most enjoyable early access game that I have played. From what I have seen, the developers are dedicated and very efficient with their updating of the game. If you're on the fence about it, but love the hack&slash and RPG genres, casual games, the idea of an easy-to-use adventure creation tool, and watching a game develop, go for it.			"

												Are you dying to have your thirst quenched for a solid  RPG hack and slash?  Look no further.Simply put this game is like gauntlet met diablo with a comforting playful art and combat style like torchlight, and a level creator that is as simple as minecraftDo you and your buddies think some hack and slashes are too easy? are the waves of monsters just not tough enough for you? GOOD! look no further-- get your crew together making maps in only a few hours with as many enemies as you can handle, with tricks and traps to kill each other, and hidden treasure to share with the adventerous! The community for this game is great, the devs are incredibly friendly and helpful and listen to their fans, and as it stands this game is a fun family game- weekend game and even a fun single player experiencehope they keep up the good work and possibly add another class or 2			"

												Kinda simplistic, but incredibly addictive. So far, loot isn't really that exciting, mostly +1 stat and just completely random defense/damage (both min-max values) - but I didn't get any legendaries yet, so yeah. Sometimes lower level loot is considerably stronger than higher level for some reason. Still, you'll go ""SHINY!"", especially when picking loot shrine rewards, which'll make you grind and grind and grind and grind just to sacrifice all the crap.Gotta say, the whole idea of including a level editor and making the community build most of the ""adventures"" was brilliant. I think there's nearly 7k levels right now, so you won't get bored easily, as long as you won't get sick of the mechanics for some reason (things work fine, although sometimes you have trouble getting to tiles slightly higher than the current one, which is annoying).Too afraid to fight the dragon yet~.

												This game is really great. I just played it for a week with some friends but it's really addictive.I found out about this game by searching on the web. But I have never heard of it before.Unfortunately it's a little expensive (i'm one of those who do not buy for more than 10€) but if you get it in a promotion or a pack of 4 it's totally worth it =)Dont hesitate !! The adventures are endless !!!The dragon is really a tough one, it has like 1 billion hp lol, so you need to do it step by step. Don't be afraid, you'll just die a thousand times on it :p (but it'll not regen its hp so that's how it dies).Please come join us in these amazing adventures !!!			"

								This game has a lot of potential. It needs a good community to survive, but I think it might work. The element of playing user generated maps all the time is definitely thrilling, and even though some maps are a bit blank and raw, there are others who build maps that are so clever that they really make you want to try building them out yourself.Plus the game mechanics work quite well overall, the design is cute and it does not take long to get the hang of all the game has to offer, but especially with the map making there are basically unlimited possibilities.

												What a good idea. The best part of this game is the intuitive level editor that fully supports a controller. Create a level from the couch and run through it in local co-op or share with the world. Great monster and loot system that they seem to keep expanding. And of course the ""fight the dragon"" idea is pretty great. Dragon has a million HP and your damage is cumulative, so keep wacking away at it.			"

												Having buoght this on sale for about 2 euros, I feel like I owe these guys a positive review concidering the 100+ hours I've spent on it.In the beginning it was kind of slow to get into the game for me, a tip I'd like to share:Start with the fighter class, it's good to level up with.Creating maps are very fun (and time consuming, haha) and you can do pretty cool things with the editor.What I like the most with this game, in addition to the editor, is the combat and gearing/levling your character. You have alot of freedom and the combat is pretty deep and challenging.A little problem though is the lack of challenging content. After reaching max level and beating the dragon I've not been able to find alot of challenge among user created maps. But I'm trying to do something this by creating my own end game maps, hope other players will follow. Controls with keyboard and mouse is not the best in my opinion, but gamepad works great.Community is small and friendly.Give it a try!			"

								Fight The Dragon is currently in a freshly started Early Access phase, but oh boy, it already has so much potential. The editor is easy to use and there's already a big variety of levels for everybody to play.The Online Coop works just fine and until now I wasn't able to spot any major bugs or anything game breaking. All in all it's fun to play alone and also with friends. I completely appreciate the splitscreen option, which is always a big plus when it comes to multiplayer!At this point a little something about 3 Sprockets and their way of developing that game. Of course everyone is a bit critical when it comes to Early Access games, but this small team of developers has the fastest way of releasing updates I've ever seen for a game. I'm speaking of 3-4 major updates in a single week!So yeah, great game, awesome developement team (they didn't pay me for this :D) and worth the money!			"

								This game is alot of fun. More Gauntlet than Diablo. The user made content is where this game will shine.There are hundreds made by the community that intergrate with your game. Levels that are rated well will remain playable for others while others that do poorly will see less playtime. It is a well polished experience in both playing and creation cant wait to see what is added to this. If you love hack and slash. Or creating diablical levels for others to survive this is your game. and as a side note dont think you will be able to post something unbeatable. You MUST complete your level for it to post.			"

												Good game, but you get powerfull way to quick and can kill the dragon within 6  hours of purchase and you can also just kill the dragon straight up at  lvl 30 with no deaths in about 1 hour. Granted i had all legendary gear  at level 30 and the black rouge is just op with his/her invisiblity (buys you heaps of time for stamina). Other than that great game. No bugs or glitches that i could find (Excluding the auto jump, that needs a little more work, bugged out every now and then). . Just a side note EPIC GAME WITH FRIENDS!!!!!. 4 player split screen rocks.			"

												I give a very HESITANT Thumb-up. I'll explain.I can't really judge this as a game, as much as I have to judge it as a toolbox. And, as with any game where you hand the keys to the kingdom to the playerbase, only about 1 in 12 actually knows what they're doing. :(In Fight the Dragon you're given a battle arena against a red dragon with 1 MILLION health, and told to go questing from map to map to build yourself up and fight him. Any damage the dragon takes is cumulative, so even the 2 points of damage you do to him at lvl1 will stay.So, you leap from player-made map to player-made map, fighting monsters and finding loot. As I said, most folks should not be given the tools to make game levels, as they don't know what is appealing, what flows well or even what looks good. I found myself with serious respect for the real industry after playing 50+ maps (there's an achievement for that), and only really liking about 8 of them.But back to the dragon. Each time you finish a level you get a dragon ticket/scroll, which gives you three lives to fight the dragon in the special arena. As I said your damage sticks, so you run in and do as much damage as you can before he freaking annihilates you. Most battles last about 30 seconds, even with three lives. So you chip away at him over time as you level up Just remember:-Fire Resist does NOT work on the Dragon-You CANNOT bring your magic rings, arguably the best items in the game.-Almost all the dragon's attacks have major push-back, so good luck if you're a melee characterThe dragon fight is VERY unfair, and if that is the focus of your time in this game you're going to have a bad time. Instead, I spent my questing hours in search of a good map that felt like a real video game level, and not just something a 9 year-old threw together to mess with people. Not all levels are created equal, and it comes with a thumbs up/sideways/down function, and the ability to leave a comment on the level itself. I blasted a LOT of bad levels, trust me, and praised a few good ones.Fight the Dragon is a cute rpg toolbox, but if you judge by the player-made content, not an especially good game. Get it on sale for a quick distraction, but this is not something to devote to.TL:DR Version:-Dragon has 1 Million HP, you chip away at his health over many attempts.-Dragon fight does not respect fire resistance, magic rings, and allows you no health/mana items.-Dragon can kill you three times in under 40 seconds, burning your Dragon Fight attempt currency.-All the levels outside the tutorial are player-made, most of them are really bad.-Cute, addictive, but not something you're ever going to finish. Only the INSANE will grind away the hours to ACTUALLY slay the dragon.			"

												Fight the Dragon is, in my opinion, one of the coolest game ideas that I have seen, and for the most part it is executed extremely. I originally bought this game in early access and was able to watch it grow, and grow it did. In FTD you create a character, choosing one of the four classes: Rogue, Fighter, Ice Wizard, or Fire Wizard. The classes themselves each have a unique feel to them and it is fun to check each of them out. There is a decent amount of abilities to choose from for each class and they all seem pretty fun to use. You can customize your character with the in-game models provided or you can download new, unique models from the Steam Workshop. Where the game truly shines is the ACK - Adventure Creation Kit. This allows anyone to use all of the assets in the game to create their own unique levels. Obviously some adventures turn out better than others, but there is a healthy amount of extremely creative individuals making adventures that are truly astounding. You create everything in your adventure from NPCs and their dialogue to the landscape and buildings. The most creative individuals have weaved some of the coolest stories I've seen in their adventures, and when you complete them you can even follow the creator to be updated whenever they create a new adventure. There are also measures to prevent creators from making adventures that just give you massive amounts of gear or treasure without doing anything, which is a good thing (why exploit a game, the point is to play and have fun)! Writing about it simply doesn't do it justice and it must be seen by your own eyes. Not everything in FTD is perfect though, in fact one of the largest parts of the game can be quite buggy and frustrating - the combat. You can play the game with a controller or KB/M, but when playing with either I still encounter many enemies that I simply swing at them several times without actually hitting them, even when they're right in front of me. This can lead to some VERY frustrating experiences. On one of my own adventures I created I ran into a bug where it was impossible for me to kill an enemy, and eventually I ended up being pushed off of the map. Reading other reviews it seems I'm not the only one that has had problems with the combat. Aesthetically the game isn't astounding, but the landscapes can sometimes be very pleasing. The soundtrack again isn't amazing, but there are a decent selection of tracks - you can even choose which will play in your adventure. Even further you can set ""triggers"" that will cue a certain track when an event happens (the ACK is amazing)!After logging 50+ hours in the game, and trudging through the frustrating parts I do have to still give it a thumbs up. The developers do pay attention to the community and they try and fix bugs pretty quick. Hopefully they will be able to fix the combat eventually, then this game would be a masterpiece, but for now I have give it an 8/10.TL;DR Game is really good except for some frustrating combat experience. Creative minds will enjoy making adventures.			"

												I love Fight the Dragon!  I didn't think I would like it as much as I do.  I became addicted right away.  With almost all the levels being user created there is a ton of creative adventures to go on.  As more people find out about the game, more adventures will be made and there will be a seemingly limitless amount of adventures to explore.Creating adventures is quite simple and intuitive.  I made my first level (Rendlehelm Forest) within a few hours and it has some pretty cool features and looks pretty good.  The Steam Workshop items add a lot of options to the character customization, and I expect the options will get even better as more people make more complex pieces.The gameplay is very fun.  Old-school hack & slash with light RPG elements mixed in.  It is so simple yet so fun that I can play this with my young son, and my wife enjoys it too!  It's complex enough though, that I could easily play this with my gamer friends for hours and have a blast.The dragon is a lot of fun to fight too.  At first it seemed hopeless because the dragon is so powerful and you do so little damage.  However, as you level up and get more powerful you see the health finally start coming off in larger chuncks and you really feel like you are accomplishing something.  It's also really cool that it starts at 1,000,000 hitpoints and the damage done to it persists.  Talk about epic battle!  I'll be fighting this dragon for months.I highly recommend this game!  The more people that play and contribute the better it gets!			"

												Great game and for its state in development only a few bugs were found but it was mainly tiny animation glitches that looked funny and this is a EARLY REVIEW OF THE GAMEThe games concept is great like they said little big planet and diablo Its diliverd well with a easy to use level creating system and online and offline missions made by community memebers nowit might sound awesome but there are still some bad or still in progress levels but then there are always those really cool origional levels and if you think a level needs work well you can leave comments for the creator to see or if the level is offenceve you can report if needed and of course there is a dislike and like and meh button The game is great no lie its diliverd greatly and may need some work on the animation glitches but its still a great gameNow you can get a lot of loot not just a few but ALOT WAY TO MANY XD but you can turn it into donations which later on those donations can get you some sweet gear and lets get to the dragon its a boss really really strong but you can only solo the boss and cant fight it with your friends wait waaaat? theres a reason because everytime you damage the dragon it leaves it permenently because the dragon has a lot of HP and your suppose to fight him multiple times to acctualy kill him and trust me its gonna take a long time but for every 500 damage you do to the dragon you get rare gear that can only be used for a set  amount of time but is a great boost I mainly donate them The game itself is all dependant on community no lie and please please add fighting dragon online i know it probibly is not possible the way its currently coded Graphics are cartoonish which i like it fits and sorta blocky and wait theres workshop mmmmmm You know what this means POTATO SUIT AWAY and creating your own armor or well skin as i may say for your hero then crying cause armor blocks it. Then the replayability come on come on its a community based RPG where the people make the levels i think we know the replayabilityNow this is one of the few games that might leave early accses seeing how much they work on it and get progress done and i am happy to auction a copy for myself because iv been looking at this game for a while  and they hade made progress well if you look at it as a developer they made progressSo 8/10 great game hope its final realease happens and may the hack and slash gods be with you :D			"

												6/10Pros:- Decent release. Not many bugs and devs are constantly working on and fixing.- Steam workshop and customizable content.- The developers are active and give feedback.Cons:- Limited content and customization of content, it is gradually expanding though.- Limited multiplayer options. 2 player local split screen only but 4 player online.- The ACK(editor) lacks function when trying to make content specifically for 2+ players as it requires completing a test-run with only 1 character in order to publish.Other:- Graphics are dated/indie.- Multiplayer is split screen not shared screen. This can be a pro or con. Personally prefer shared screen and helps keep party together, but it is a personal preference and doesn't stop me playing.			"

												This game is just realy realy funny. You can spend alot of hours at playing this game. And the best thing about playing it, you can do it whenever you want. You just start the game, play an adventure and quit again, if you feel so. On the other side, you can play it for a looong time if you want so. Adventures are finished very quickly and everytime afterwards you can look at your new cool stuff and change equipment. The restloot isn't useless at all, you can put that into a lootshrine and transform multiple scrap parts into a much better weapon or an armor.And if you've got what you want or feel like you're pretty experienced now, you can start creating your own maps. You can do a whole campaign with up to 5 Levels or just create a single adventure. You can do alot of cool stuff with this editor and it isn't that hard to use, even if it looks like. There's a leaderboard for creators of adventures, so if you want, you can try to be the best adventure developer out there haha.So afterall I could recommend this to everyone, to people who doesn't have too much time and to those who have. To fans of editors etc. Go ahead and buy it, it's worth it!			"

								This game is great! At first I saw this and although the reviews seemed good, it just didn't seem like something I'd enjoy playing. Then I started playing it. This game hits so many of the right buttons it's fantastic. You want dungeon crawls, they got that. You want loot and charcater progression, of course they got that. You want a sandbox and build stuff, yeah they got that too. You want to play online with your friends, they got you covered there as well. I mean I have bought games for each of those reasons alone. To find a game that does all that, looks good, plays well, and has a great dev team...I don't know what your waiting for.  Oh are you looking at the User Created Adventures and thinking, ""oh great a few good levels then a bunch of crappy super easy loot runs, and a ton of super hard death trap dungeons."" Well let me stop you right there, because thats not the case at all. Most of the user created adventures I've played were very well balanced and a lot of fun. And using the ACK to make adventures is easy to learn and fun to play around with.  Now if your one of the many people on here that gets scared when they see ""Early Access"", don't worry over it. Honestly, you won't notice until update time when they add stuff. Thats right I said add stuff. More monsters, more ways to build adventures. So don't let the ""EA"" on the game scare you off.  In summery, great game, lots fun with a ton of variety.			"

YouTube™ Video: Fight the Dragon Alpha Review 

			Views: 3,487		

			Yeti's first game review is of ""Fight the Dragon"", a hack 'n' slash RPG with an emphasis on user-created content developed by 3 Sprockets, the team behind Cubemen.		

Fight the Dragon, even in its alpha state, is incredibly loaded and full of potential. The major RPG character archetypes aren't yet introduced as you only have the sword-and-board warrior and a fire mage, with a frost mage currently in development. The dungeon creation is incredibly simple yet powerful, allowing you to create nearly any environment and setup the details such as enemy patrol routes or which combinations of levers open a door.There are a couple dungeons created by 3 Sprockets, but they're mostly tutorial levels. The gimmick here is the user-created content. Dungeons created can be published and thrown into the pool of user-generated content, randomly chosen for an adventurer. There's filters you can set to get the newest dungeons or the highest-rated dungeons, and you can even set up a list of favorites.If you're afraid you'll ""out-level"" a dungeon, don't be. Difficulty and rewards scale with your character so you'll always get enjoyment out of your favorite dungeons. Now, you might say ""Hey, if everything levels with me then how do I tell I'm really strong?"" Cue the dragon.The dragon is a premade dungeon (bascially a door and a platform surrounded by lava) for you to head into from your house very early on. The dragon's health is absolutely insane - the chances of defeating him in one go are nearly impossible. It'll likely takes hundreds of attempts across all of your characters. The dragon's health never resets, so eventually you can defeat him, and as you try to your progress is logged. You're ranked against the world and ranked against your previous attempts, so you can see just how far you've come.I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in a dungeon-crawler. Diablo, Gauntlet, Torchlight - you name it, this game ranks right up there with them, even in it's alpha state.			"

I recommend this to anyone looking for a casual-hardcore multiplayer experience.			"

								The game is based in a 3D Realm which is of the Dark age enviroments.It features map creation and the possibility to play others maps.The best features of this game are to be able to go to any map you would like and roll the dice to have a chance at a random level to be loaded.Personally, i made my own map. Hardest map in my list atm.Once published, i rolled the dice twice and it was on my list.The map creativity is limited to 7000 and it makes it hard to make big things that most people wanna make.Why i recommend this game?Its fun and easy to play (Mostly with controller) for the PC players with a keyboard and mouse, your going to strugle alot.The game will blow your socks off when you find yourself fighting a Dragon, or Ice Elementals.It will be hard and easy, but will be worth the dollars you spend.(Currently still has bugs, but if it ever gets completed, it will be a great game and possibly get 1.5 Million sales, and possibly more!)Good luck choosing! and may the odds forever be in your favor.

												This is the best adventure-design toolkit that I've ever seen. In the following year, I purchased several other AAA games that promised the sky, and didn't even come close to the feature set from this indie title.  That's because the studio focused on what was important - the tools, and let the community build the content.			"

The inventory, loot, xp, loot shrine - ""store"" basically, did NOT leave a lot to be desired. Despite the simplicity, the mechanics are satisfying.

												Okay, so I love the fact that the levels are user made.  I love the nuanced fighting style with dodges, blocks , and stuns (making fighting more than just pumping out spells or spamming the attack button).  The graphics look great but are a llittle cartoony in my book.  I love creating little short stories for missions.  I've just put out an easy called ""kill Jill"", where Jack was pushed down the hill by Jill after the poisoned water in the well turned her into an evil creature.  And I have a medium one called ""Ruin Runner"" where you've been sent to rescue a woman from a bunch of criminals, and end up getting caught up in a treasure hunt in an old abandoned ruin.  And right now I'm working on one (don't have a title for it yet just search for creater named Dyztanz) where a town is overrun with evil when a hell gate opens up in a nearby mine.  That one is likely to be hard because it is so long.  It's a full fledged story with events and a big finale.Where was I?Ok, Pros...nice to look at.great fighting system.diverse character classes,Level creater is intuitive and easy to learnSome of the user created levels are innovative and brilliantFighting the dragon is a great little side game.Easily worth the money and more.(note I haven't even tried multiplayer yet)Consa little cartoony for me.some of the player created content is terrible and poorly thought out.the level creator could use more optons (more diversity in the npc types and enemy types)  That will probably be resolved over time as the developers are still adding contentIf you make a level with any sort of depth and length it is going to be labeled medium, hard or extreme, and unfortunately it seems that everyone goes for the easy missions.I have to work and cant spend all day playing and creating.pudding is better than yogurt.You haven't bought it yet.If you like Diablo style hack and slash, and have a controller, or you used to be a dungeon master and love creating adventures then this is a game custom built for you.

												If you're looking at purchasing ""Fight the Dragon"", you are making a pretty wise investment with your funds.This title is a dungeon crawler, similar to the games like: ""Diablo"", but with a more light-hearted look and feel to it. However, there's a bit of a different twist to it. For, while you'll start off playing some basic developer created levels, to get aquainted with how the gameplay fully works, you'll soon find that the rest of the game is playing stages that other users have designed.This aspect, in itself, gives the game massive amounts of replayability. As there are new maps (and even campaigns!) being created, by people around the world, each and every day.But, sometimes, we don't want to play other people's levels. So, alongside the gameplay elements of this title, there is also a built-in level creator (Which you probably already guessed at, thanks to the above statements). And, my god is it a good one!The level creator gives you massive variety on what you can build with, and every tool that the developers used when making their stages as well. At first, it will feel a little overwhelming, as there are so many options to choose from, when looking at the blank canvas. However, the tools provided to you are so easy to learn that, as you practice (and play around) with them, you'll find yourself becoming more and more adept, and soon will be making stages that even the devlopers would be jealous of!All these good things said though, there are a few issues that I do have with the game.1 - The difficulty to this game is pretty low, once you get a single good weapon and piece of armor. Allowing you to solo ""Extreme"" difficulty stages, with little problem.2 - You can not fight the final boss (aka: the Dragon) in multi-player. Though, this was likely due to coding reasons, it still takes away a little bit from the feeling of an adventure, when most of the time, you're going to find yourself fighting through levels with your friends, or random allies.3 - The soundtrack isn't that varied, and is limited to maybe a total of 5 or 6 different tunes (Though, what little tracks there are, are still amazing).Despite these small issues I found with the game, ""Fight the Dragon"" is still an AMAZING game! One of which you'll find yourself putting many hours of your life into, just as I did when I played an almost non-stop 24 hour spree of the game.Yes. It's THAT addicting.Final Score: 8.5/10			"

												Well....The game is simple enough and is kinda fun. Good maps are few but there is alot of maps as well as you can play your own maps (the assets are really small but hopefully they will grow). I would not say this feels at all like Diablo maybe more like a beta Torchlight...but the game is fun.My issue is I had to reinstall OS. Well turns out characters are saved on local computer all my characters are gone now 2 of them were max lvl and had inventory maxed and all the gear I had gone poof..... So I'm gonna give it a thumbs up cause the game its self is what it says it is a fun little game. Just beware of backing up your char info if you have to reinstall. If you use Steam cloud it might not be an issue but I do not so others like me just beware. The game feels like  that sorta stuff would be saved the same way your custom maps would be (yes they are still there). Anyway pick it up on sale its an ok game.			"

												This is a great little game! I've had a lot of fun with it so far. It's a very basic little ARPG with simple graphics and gameplay, but it manages to do a lot with a little. The simple graphics are charming and the simple gameplay actually has a surprising amount of depth once you get into it.Most of the adventures / maps you will play on are created by fellow players! There are tons of maps out there, and players are creating more and more each day. A lot of them are really fun!Adventure creation is where this game really shines. It comes pre-packaged with a very very easy-to-use adventure creation kit (ACK). I never like to even attempt to use these tools when they are packaged with other games because I am a re-tard! But this game's kit is so easy to use even a re-tard like me can create and publish adventures. It really is an awesome little kit.Is this game a Diablo killer? No way! But at $10 or whatever I paid for it, it is an excellent value.			"

												Fight the Dragon is beatiful little love letter to Diablo with its own unique charm.Is what I would say about the game if I needed a catchy hookline to reel people in, because they expect a well written review. Seriously though FtD is a very nice experience in the field of Dungeon crawling and with community creations/randomly generated levels it stays entertaining.You get 4 different classes, 1 of which I have personally played, that probably bring their own style of play with them. From what I have seen the melee battling is dank, albeit a bit strange at first due to the controls being built around your mouse cursor. (Sidenote : I'd like to be able to use my extra mouse buttons in the game, but I sadly cant)I also have yet to play the co-op mode of the game, but I am certain that it only adds to the fun.Fight the Dragon is totally worth a buy, especially if you're a fan of the already mentioned Blizzard title Diablo (or the much better and underated Dungeon Siege series excluding 3 Square why do you hate DS?)Now, if you excuse me, I have a Dragon to fight.Get it? Its the title of the game.			"

												Fight the Dragon is a remarkably fun little hack-n-slash that reminds me of the Gauntlet reboot, but it's actually fun and not quite so soul-crushingly repetitive. It's a lot of fun solo and truly great with a few friends. The mod community seems to be split between adventure level creation (which is awesome), and cosmetic adds like outfits. Both add a really great element of fun and replayability.When I got it the game was $6, and it's worth every penny. For the $12 standard price I think it's a decent game that you'll enjoy if you like this genre and you have a couple friends to play it with.			"

								Great game! Very smooth gameplay, I would say a mix of Zelda and Diablo. Have not tried out the creation kit yet, but licking my chops to get into it. Large mix of items, and depending on the weapon and/or shield equipped, you have different attacks. Definately a solid start to the game, and I am very very excited to see where it leads!			"

								I always like supporting Early Access games that have very active developers. FTD fits that bill, the developer is very active in the community and releases updates regularly. As for the game I picked it up on sale and I have been thoroughly enjoying it. I ran through a few of the included adventures and then set about creating my own. I'm looking forward to when the developer adds campaigns. The level editor is very easy to use and get the hang of. You can have a basic level built and ready to go in a matter of minutes.The combat is less advanced than your typical hack and slash but it's thoroughly enjoyable. Just don't go in expecting Diablo level of combat.I'd say it's the ultimate dungeon crawler as you and the community should provide an unlimited number of dungeons.			"

								This is an easy to play game, fun and nice, which reminds me of Darkstone by the possibility of creating our dungeons, with a plus for the sharing of them between the community. At least 95% of the user-made levels I played were balanced.There is a lot of grinding and farming involved if you really want to face the poor dragon. But this is nice, who would want to win a game in a few hours?			"

								I do reccomend this game to anyone who loves builders, things like garrys mod, space engineers, robocraft and the likes. There is plenty to work with in the map maker to eat up hours of your time and enough variety that you'll want to make every concievable type of map your head can come up with.I like the simplicity of it but it can get a little awkward at times when camera angles start to get in the way because of construction work and the lack of a multi level building mechanic at this time is a shame. However the map maker is a solid builder and even I found it easy to use.gameplay is just as simple and enjoyable but camera rotation can get a little annoying when you're in a big brawl and unless you spend a little time observing the game it can be a little difficult to understand the leveling mechanics. Honestly I still havent fully found everything on this yet but thats my own fault for jumping straight into the builder.so as a rundown.PRO's: simple, looks good, easy to control, vast possibilities for inventive maps, replayability due to community contributions.CON's: awkward camera movements, confusing insight on character mechanics (leveling, ability use, potion use).I've had this game a few days at the writing of this so I have yet to fully see everything it has to offer but this is what I have observed so far.

												Fight the Dragon is a remarkably fun little hack-n-slash that reminds me of the Gauntlet reboot, but it's actually fun and not quite so soul-crushingly repetitive. It's a lot of fun solo and truly great with a few friends. The mod community seems to be split between adventure level creation (which is awesome), and cosmetic adds like outfits. Both add a really great element of fun and replayability.When I got it the game was $6, and it's worth every penny. For the $12 standard price I think it's a decent game that you'll enjoy if you like this genre and you have a couple friends to play it with.			"

												I received the game as a gift on Dec 26th. In 6 days I've been ""in the game"" for over 67 hours. The majority of the time I was in the creation tool building dungeons. I've created a couple of ""adventures."" Playing other peoples' adventures is fun, but being able to create my own is a new kind of enjoyment. There's a point system in the creation tool that limits you from creating too big of an adventure, but you could always split them up into campaigns if you wanted to go all out. I haven't done campaigns yet, so I can't speak about them. For such a strange little game, it's quite complete. Maybe if they had a few more classes? Hopefully they'll work on that, but they're still working some bugs out, so maybe they're still feature locked.			"

								Propably one of the best early access games I ever player.Since I buyed it some time ago there were tons of updates and new content. The community is quite active (considering it is early access!).Play it with your friends to maximize the fun and gaming experience.By having the possibilty to create your own adventures and share them with the public you get the feeling of being a small part of the game itself. And of course you can also play your or your friends maps together.There are a few maps, generated by the programmers to help new players but you will most of the time enjoy maps created by other players.So if you like bashing through almost random levels and exploring dungeons created by users or generating your own adventures and levels you should give ""Fight The Dragon"" a try.If you expect a story-based rpg where you don't have (or be able) to enjoy your own interpretation of a story or a realistic adventure you should not buy this game.The story, as I said, is created by the user and you will see by the looks of the pictures that for instance the fighting system is not comparable to the one of for example dark souls.

								Fight the Dragon is a  very nice mini-hack&slash game where you play through several maps that have been created by the community. And I have to say that there are some really nice maps that are fun to play. But there are also maps that aren't thought out so well. But you (and the rest of the community) votes on the map and you can decide to only play maps that have a high community rating. Some people have really interesting ideas for their maps so this game never gets boring.If you expect a storyline in this game, you won't find any because this is not about long-spanning adventures but more about dungeon-runs that do not take that much time. So, if you have a busy life, it's easy to fit in a FtD session inbetween your busy schedule.The level editor is also very nice and intuitive. It's really not surprising that the number of maps for this game has exploded.So, who should buy this game? You should buy this if you like-Hash and Slash games (like Diablo)-Looting and equipment management.-Building your own maps/dungeons and share them-Multiplayer gaming with your friends-fighting hordes of monsters with weapons and spells-solving puzzles (in some maps)Things you might expect but that are not there:-Skilltrees. Each class has a fixed set of abilities that unlock at specific levels-A storyline. But future updates might allow map creaters to link maps to create more epic adventures-Item trading (but you can drop items ingame for your friends)-Always a dark atmosphere like in Diablo. Some maps are dark and menacing, but sometimes the overall visual style is a bit too non-threatening. While the graphics are not as spiffy as in Diablo, I think 3sprockets has done a good job with the visuals.A note for Linux users: There is a thread in the game's forum about systems that are capable of running the game. I'm playing this game just fine with Intel graphics. So check out the thread to see if someone with a similar computer managed to run the game.			"

								                                    I don't normally write reviews but for FtD had to make an exception.   I know a fair amount of people dread early access games, but the devs working on FtD have something special going on. They are straightforward on what the game is and what they intend to do. They listen and respond to the community and have implemented things that have been suggested. They just have a generally nice vibe about them that is enjoyable.   The game itself is lite RPG: the stats won't blow your mind and the gear slowly scales as you level. There are 4 skills per class and 4 classes also a level cap of 40 at this moment. Online/lan/splitscreen local multiplayer arleady in the game and supports the use of controllers. The Hack and Slash elements are well implemented for an Alpha build and is in a very playable state. There are still some bugs to be ironed out and features to be added in but saying that the game still is a ton of fun.  The best feature I would have to say is the ACK (adventure creation kit). I have spent at least 1/2 my time playing this game in ACK making adventures. There are still a lot of features to be added like more monsters and more triggers (atm it is only implemented for weather effects) but you can still make some decent adventures given enough time and effort.This game seems like it's flying under the radar but I highly enjoy the game and highly recomend it. It has a lot of potential and looking forward to it! "

												Fight the Dragon is a hack-n-slash RPG-lite. The game is centered around custom-content. Things like custom heads, hair, and levels. The customization only goes so deep, though. This leaves custom levels feeling shallow.The game has a large identity issue. There are several poorly explained and poorly used mechanics that are only there to make the game feel more like other games. For instance, some weapons require you to have a certain level to equip. This is fine and good, and it fits the gameplay very well. The game complicates this by adding skill-points that you unlock everytime you level up. This would be fine if it gave you more than 1 skill point per level, but instead your left with a restricted and overly complicated leveling system. It ruins the flow when you pick up an awesome weapon, only to find that you don't have high enough Luck or Strength to wield it.Combat is your traditional ""Click-Click-Click-Heal-Click"" style of combat. It has the illusion of deepness, giving each class unique heavy attacks. These heavy attacks all boil down to about the same thing. You throw something, and in a second or two it explodes. Not a very original combat system, but it works well.Customization is a mixed bag. You can customize the textures of your body, head, and hair. Basic stuff, not very hard to grasp at all. For more advanced people, you can customize the meshes of only the head and hair. This frustrates me a bit, but it doesn't really affect my view on the game.The level editor is frustrating as hell. The controls require you to forget everything you know about good level editors, because none of it transfers over. Basic stuff is just omitted for no reason. Overall, the game is fun. As of writing, I've put in about 4 hours into the game. 3 of which were spent on multiplayer. It's a little boring, but if you get it on sale it isn't bad.			"

												Pretty decent dungeon builder and loot hording simulator with a nice visual style and the potenial to become something really really damn cool. A lot of minor issues exist such as problems with controllers not always working, a some what clunky combat system at times and a dodgey jumping mechanic that doesn't always jump and can quite frankly go ♥♥♥♥ itselfBeyond those issues however is plenty of loot, four player action, some decent customization thanks to the Steam Workshop and the very much appreciatied option to toggle visbility on my armour, so the fact that my helmet clashes with my boots doesn't trigger my autismMost of the real isse one might have with the game will come from playing the maps of random folks, as like with similar games where player generated content is the bulk of what you will play, you are likely going to end up with a lot of old tat. The genuinely bad levels are quite far and few between though, and there exists more good, competant levels than turds shaped like corridors full of bulky enemiesFinal word: Game is♥♥♥♥♥♥because I can't apply instant death spikes to any and all surfaces of my dungeon. ♥♥♥♥ you 3Sprockets			"

								This game is very addicting - I played it for 8 hours the day I bought it. Unlimited amount of user creator maps. I got to level 20 just off running around with a friend. The gear crafting system is pretty neat, although could use a little more work with making the class specific weapons/items (I have a rogue and got 1 decent rogue only item in 20 levels). I just finally tried the editor and I LOVE it. There is still more to be implemented but what is there now is done very well. Making levels is pretty straight forward. There is a little more UI work to be done too, but mostly they just need more time for more content.9/10 for Early Access gaming. It also looks like they update pretty regularly, which is promising for early access.			"

I would absolutely recommend this game for anyone who loves Role Playing Games and wants a new taste of adventure.

Though it is online, expect 1-2 servers to be open for the most part. *I have never gone fully online before.*-The game is a BUILD YOUR OWN ADVENTURE, it is not made to be perfect nor are the players.

												After I became intrigued about this game when I heard it was like Little Big Planet, one of my favorite PS3 games. A few questions later and I bought the game. Now 4 hours into the game I am proud to say that I bought this game. It is fun, unique and ""never ending"" but I'll get to that later. You create your character from one of the 4 classes. You can customize their skin and even customize it with some cool skins made with the steam workshop. After you do that they drop you into the hub where you will spend a lot of time ""praying"" to the gift gods and managing your inventory. From here you may go to online mode (multiplayer), go on an adventure or battle the dragon which requires a dragon scroll. Once I beat the developer made levels it started to put me into community made levels which made me nervous but it turns out that the devs don't like garbage levels polluting their game. Which is good. At this point I realised that this game is ""never ending"" because you can create your own adventures or play other adventures after you played the developer ones.The level creation tool deserves more credit than it gets as you can do a lot with the triggers and events. Sadly I have not tried to play this with multiplayer so I cannot give a review on that.Pros:Lots of good unique levelsLevel editorCharacter customizationNice graphical feelCons:I can see how some people can find this game repetative.Games this is similar to:Spiral Knights and (barely) Little Big Planet. More so to spiral knights.			"

								Ok I think this is the first review i've ever made so make note of that. This game I feel has crazy potential. It's even very very f'ing fun as it is. Multiplayer can be a touch buggy (players jumping about or lagging in general) but still very playable and even the bugs can add to the enjoyment a bit. In my personal opinion the thing that is going to make this game boss for years to come is that the community is the ones making the levels. So instead of developers (i love you guys don't take this the wrong way) demanding more and more money for dlc's . It will be the die hard players of the game that keep adding content. From the easy levels I played this is far from a bad thing. The levels all kick♥♥♥♥♥that I've played so far and they keep saying they will continue to add to the editor and make it possible to combine adventures for campains.. That's sick news.Wait what kinda review is this ? Ok the game kinda feels like lego diablo. If that game actually existed. Hack n slash but with lego style guys to run around with. It's in testing so the amount of stuff you can do/have is limitedSo far gold and stored items don't do a whole lot but they boast to have a loot shrine in the future that you trade that stuff to the loot gods that rain down good gear on you. I've fought the dragon once and he's a beast. I'm lvl 4 so I died almost instantly but being able to fight the main boss right away is key! I'd love to see future things done with this dragon. Also I noticed the levels are the same difficulty if I do it alone or with someone. Not sure if that will stay forever but it makes a big deal because some say ""easy"" and they are easy with two people but hard aloneok i'm rambling totally worth the 14.99 if you get in on sale no brainer. I hope they actually finish this one day because the implication of the players making the lvls is amazing people have so much creativity and the levels so far are wicked. One love			"

								Fight the Dragon is a fun little hack n' slash with very basic, Gauntlet-style gameplay. The game is entirely built around player made levels and designed to be played in short bursts, with each level lasting 15 minutes on average. The four available classes are differentiated by each having 4 abilities (in addition to basic attacking), as well as some unique weapon types that are only useable by certain classes.The lack of combat depth may turn some people off but it comes down to personal preference. The adventure creator is easy to use and offers a lot of freedom, with more content being added on a regular basis. At the time of this writing, they've even begun adding a logic system to the creator as well. The game is great for picking up and running through some adventures in your down time where as making levels can keep you busy for hours on end.FTD isn't perfect and has it's issues. The entire game's entertainment value relies on the quality of maps and the variety of tools available to those who make the maps. That being said, the devs are very attentive and really seem to care about making the game better and better. They listen to community feedback and continue to polish and add to the game, pushing out great patches on a quite regular basis. Overall I don't see much to complain about. The game is a fun little gem to spend time in and has the potential for a lot of replayability. I look forward to seeing FTD grow and hopefully its community will as well.			"

												FtD is a neat game that provides a novel take on the classic aRPG adventure.A few things:It needs more players and some server stability fixes.  More enemy variety would also be conducive to improved gameplay for everyone. It would be more fun for a lot of players if the dragon aspect were incorporated within online play.  As it stands right now, the game instances item drops so that every player can pick up everything on their screen without stepping on anyone else's toes, but the arena dragon remains a singleplayer only experience.And finally I would prefer some more action-oriented standard attacks for the mages, as it seems like fighters have all the fun.

												I give this a thumbs up, but only because it is priced at about the right level for the content you can expect. In terms of gameplay, you work your way through hack and slash isometric maps, collect gear and loot, which you either equip or exchange for stat gains or better gear. Completing maps earns you tickets to ""Fight The Dragon"". The maps usually involve a lot of clicking and running, as well as puzzles revolving largely around pressure pads and levers hidden within maze-like environments. Fighting the dragon is simply an arena against a boss. This is reasonably fun for a short period of time, but it has little longevity. The best part of the game is the creator, where you can design and build your own maps and campaigns. Despite the limiting graphics, there is actually a lot of freedom to build from the ground up, create relatively complex puzzles and interesting environments. Unfortunately, as always with these games, the maps you produce tend to get lost amongst a lot of crap, or go unnoticed beside those few early maps that received ""thumbs ups"" so show up in most people's searches.     I give this a tentative recommendation. It is fun but has little longevity.			"

												Fight the Dragon is a community driven hack n' slash rpg created by 3 Sprockets, where all the maps are created by other community members using the built in adventure construction kit. Playing as one of three classes, (warrior, mage, or rogue) you can team up with up to three other people, or head in solo and delve into trap filled dungeons,  explore haunted ruins, save a beloved tavern, or any of a hundred other ideas your fellow players can devise.  All so you can gather loot and  gain power in order to defeat the ultimate of all bosses - the mighty dragon!Over all the game is incredibly of fun,  with tons of replay-ability in the form of  user-created maps. You have the ability to create/join a random pick-up group, if you don't have friends available to play with, and in my limited experience the game does a pretty good job at grouping you with similarly leveled characters. The game can be played with either keyboard and mouse or controller; I recommend using the controller to play, and the keyboard and mouse to create maps with, as the controls in the construction kit felt a bit clunky to me.My playthrough of a map:

												Okay, so I love the fact that the levels are user made.  I love the nuanced fighting style with dodges, blocks , and stuns (making fighting more than just pumping out spells or spamming the attack button).  The graphics look great but are a llittle cartoony in my book.  I love creating little short stories for missions.  I've just put out an easy called ""kill Jill"", where Jack was pushed down the hill by Jill after the poisoned water in the well turned her into an evil creature.  And I have a medium one called ""Ruin Runner"" where you've been sent to rescue a woman from a bunch of criminals, and end up getting caught up in a treasure hunt in an old abandoned ruin.  And right now I'm working on one (don't have a title for it yet just search for creater named Dyztanz) where a town is overrun with evil when a hell gate opens up in a nearby mine.  That one is likely to be hard because it is so long.  It's a full fledged story with events and a big finale.Where was I?Ok, Pros...nice to look at.great fighting system.diverse character classes,Level creater is intuitive and easy to learnSome of the user created levels are innovative and brilliantFighting the dragon is a great little side game.Easily worth the money and more.(note I haven't even tried multiplayer yet)Consa little cartoony for me.some of the player created content is terrible and poorly thought out.the level creator could use more optons (more diversity in the npc types and enemy types)  That will probably be resolved over time as the developers are still adding contentIf you make a level with any sort of depth and length it is going to be labeled medium, hard or extreme, and unfortunately it seems that everyone goes for the easy missions.I have to work and cant spend all day playing and creating.pudding is better than yogurt.You haven't bought it yet.If you like Diablo style hack and slash, and have a controller, or you used to be a dungeon master and love creating adventures then this is a game custom built for you.

Before ever actually playing, I spent 8 hours building a campaign, then finally got around to playing the game. The inventory, loot, xp, loot shrine - ""store"" basically, did NOT leave a lot to be desired. Despite the simplicity, the mechanics are satisfying. This game is a great example of how a non-AAA looking game can blow you away. Heck, could this be the next Minecraft? We'll see.			"

												Haven't had time to play a lot recently but great game! Fun playing split screen with friends! Most maps are made by other players and third-parties which adds a lot of diversity and unlimited replayability. Haven't put in enough time to kill the dragon yet....			"

												Fight the Dragon is beatiful little love letter to Diablo with its own unique charm.Is what I would say about the game if I needed a catchy hookline to reel people in, because they expect a well written review. Seriously though FtD is a very nice experience in the field of Dungeon crawling and with community creations/randomly generated levels it stays entertaining.You get 4 different classes, 1 of which I have personally played, that probably bring their own style of play with them. From what I have seen the melee battling is dank, albeit a bit strange at first due to the controls being built around your mouse cursor. (Sidenote : I'd like to be able to use my extra mouse buttons in the game, but I sadly cant)I also have yet to play the co-op mode of the game, but I am certain that it only adds to the fun.Fight the Dragon is totally worth a buy, especially if you're a fan of the already mentioned Blizzard title Diablo (or the much better and underated Dungeon Siege series excluding 3 Square why do you hate DS?)Now, if you excuse me, I have a Dragon to fight.Get it? Its the title of the game.			"

Early Access Review
								Out of my collection so far this is probably my favourite game on Steam.Currently in Alpha 3.9 at the time of writing this is a game that is constantly getting better. It still has a few features that are not active yet and some areas that could be improved... but that is what you would expect from a game in the Early Access area.The Great things about FTD, which is picked up by a lot of players, is that the developers are spending a hell of a lot of time taking feedback and ideas from the community and using it to add to and improve the game.The game itself is a fun hack and slash RPG with multiple classes and User generated levels. SOme of which are absolutely fantastic. If you are sitting on the fence about buying this game (like I was) trust me and just buy it.You wont regret it.			"

Early Access Review
								First a quick result: 8.5/10, the game is definitely worth the price.  FUN to play both in SOLO mode and Multiplayer mode.The game looks promising, has a few glitches but I am literally still suprised as many other early access games have many glitches and options ingame are limited.The main idea is go on adventures to gain dragon scrolls, loot and xp to get enough power to defeat THE DRAGON SOLO.Fight The Dragon is still in early access but still manages to impress me in many ways. Firstly, the game has a variety of skills and classes such as a firelord, fighter. It also has a variety of weapons, armour and special skills that requires you to be in a specific class BUT NOT TO WORRY SINCE YOU CAN CREATE MORE THAN ONE CHARACTER. The leveling up mechanics is impressive and it makes sure that gaining XP isn't easy nor hard. The system it uses to go on adventures(or dungeons) is all based on other player's creation. EVEN YOU CAN MAKE A MAP and have it featured.The cons are the few glitches and the servers are generally mediocre and you cannot host locally YET. THE GAME GETS MANY PATCHES( 0~90 Mb) and everytime there's an update, I get more impressed. More features are still being developed, so expect the game to get more interesting and fun.IMO, it is worth the money and future looks promising :-)			"

												I read mixed reviews about this game but they mostly related to challenges getting other people to find your user created content.  I can see this would be frustrating but it isn't a show stopper.  The game itself is addictively fun so far.  The controls are a little clumsy but nothing too bad (I don't use a controller which might help).  The Loot/prayer concept is clever and gives meaning to all the crap you find when adventuring.  Overall I recommend this one.  (I will update this review if I change my mind after I have played it a while)			"

												I generally don't like hack'n'slash games, but this one is really good. The best thing about it is that you never know what lies ahead, because the game comes with enough player-made maps to never play the same map again and still spend hundreds of hours playing it.It could be better only if it had co-op...wait, it has! It's really easy to connect with your friends and explore dungeons together, which is even more fun, I wish we could kill the Dragon co-op too (dragon killing is solo-only activity currently).So the game is 100% worth the money (and is far more entertaining than, say, Diablo III imho).

												I can't help but love Fight the Dragon.It's Diablo without the hassle. It's a game with core mechanics so simple you can understand them within minutes. It's you and some friends wading through a challenging adventure which likely none of you have seen before.If I wanted a deep fantasy RPG with strong characters and a thick plot, I'd go and play Dragon Age. What we have here is something very different – a game that you can pick up and play without all of that traditional RPG baggage. Grab a few friends, hit 'random level', and give it a go. I challenge you not to have fun.Read my full review here: http://www.hookedgamers.com/pc/fight_the_dragon/review/article-1386.html "

Pros+great adventure creator+can play with friends to beat dungeons+great community+fun to play in general+endless content, you'll always play on a new map/adventureCons-sometimes you'll get crappy adventures since they are community made and can be randomly given to you to play.-I feel like there isn't enough variety in the classes, and you can only play as human (unless you use mods)-movement doesen't feel so fluid-dead online, nobody plays online so you'll need to get some friends "

												Despite all of its flaws, this is still one of my favorite games to play with my friends. There is so much fun to be had just exploring and plundering the various missions and dungeons that people have made for this game, ranging from open-world style exploration minions to dungeon crawling and boss rushes. The level editor is simple and easy to use, with the ability to build story into them with NPCs and whatnot giving the game ridiculous longevity.The game isn't perfect, though. The UI takes a little bit of getting used to, and the combat is pretty lacklustre. Not to mention the game's survival is dependent on the support of its player base.TL;DR version:Pros:- Lots of variety in levels- Great to play with friends- Finding new loot is addictive and exciting- Good variety in the different classesCons:- Combat leaves a bit to be desired- Can't easily search for specific levels to play with friends			"

												~ bought it in sale for 2.39€ instead of 11,99€ ~TBH i don't know if i'd have paid the full price without having it played before, but now after i played it i'd pay the whole price!i didn't play it THAT much yet( 18.06.2015) but for sure i'll spend alot more hours on the game !the thing about the game is it is infact community created, and from what i've played by now all the adventures/campaigns which are user created are fine, some more some less.so the game ""lacks"" a skill system since you just choose out of 4 classes which unlock 4 Skills as you level up.You have a main attack with every class and a secondary attack.IMHO it's fine this way, you don't get the feeling like it should have a complex RPG-Skill System/Tree as other games do.then there also is steam workshop! you can basically be everything you want(in humanoid shape)so all in all i'd say the game is a solid 9/10 :)cheers ~			"

												There's nothing really to add more than anything that has been said, but I just wanted to give my props to the developer for creating such an astounding fun game.  The beauty is that it never ends.  Players will be designing adventures for this game for years and the dev keeps adding more elements to add into our adventures.  I haven't gotten the opportunity to design an adventure yet, but I'm almost certain I will in the future.  While it does play a lot like Gauntlet, it's still very unique in its own way.  It's a hidden gem that's going to stay installed in my library!			"

For fellow playersThis game is worth playing if you enjoy any sort of fantasy hack&slash. Gauntlet* and Hammerwatch are the comparisons that come to mind. WIth community driven content and online multiplayer, the re-playability of this game is very high. It's not without it's bugs or faults, but the developers are also active on the forums and within the community; They are quick to address concerns the playerbase has with the game, replying frequently to questions posed by the community. The Workshop content is also a nice touch, allowing much more customization of your character than offered by the vanilla game; Levels, though, are found in game and not on the Workshop.The editor is simple and uncomplicated (as much as an editor can be), but don't expect to be able to do too much with it. There are some nice adventures out there, but this isn't Little Big Planet. It does what it says on the box, and hopefully the devs add more to it as time goes by (and I believe they are?).Play this game with a controller as playing with the keyboard requires a bit of hand contortion, or quick relfexes and finger accuracy, to access all the controls.*: I've played classic Gauntlet and Gauntlet Legends, but not the newest remake on Steam. From what I understand, though, it is still an apt comparison.For the devsWhile I assuredly like and recommend this game it definitely needs that something more to make me love it.Difficulty indicators on the world map don't appear to mean a damn thing; I've played Easy maps that overwhelmed me right out of the gate and I've played Extreme maps that were a cakewalk.I really wish you could read the description of a level before starting it.Ranged enemies are a balance issue and when more than 2 or 3 are nearby it almost takes the fun away.I also wish the editor was a bit more robust. You can't move props you've already placed, instead you have to delete and remake them. Variables and flags would also be a godsend, especially if values could carry over between maps in a campaign (Imagine if later maps could be changed depending on choices earlier in the campaign!). It could also use a bit more variety: pressure plates that don't have large skulls on them and are easier to hide, a variety of switches (perhaps even hidden ones, like wall sconces or torches), pressure plate triggers that aren't barrels... Things that allow the community to really dig their nails into and get creative with. Right now it all feels a little cookie cutter.			"

This is a fairly fun, albeit generic, multiplayer dungeon romp. It gets serious points for player made levels, and well done multiplayer. Essentially, anybody can host a game, and it is easy. There is a 'hub' where you can store items and manage your player's stuff, which is really well done. You then venture out into the world as a team.Pros:+Very customizable characters+Fairly tight controls+Crisp graphics+Great controller supportCons:-Feels really generic as far as textures and levels, but I assume this is what you get when custom level building is so easy-Music is meh-There should be an option for larger text when playing on your television - currently its way to difficult to read from the couchIf you have friends that are into RPG dungeon romps, you can't go wrong here.

												Updated:Same beef as before, too few ways to regen health.  Unless you want to take a hit to your XP of course.No way to purchase potions, and any potions you gain are removed at the end of level...Loot mechanic is not condusive for random potions, considering:1) In order for chests to have more than gold, you have to kill things2) If you have nil health, hard to kill thingsPunishing health loss with lack of regen, is a time sink not a mechanic.  It gives the ""air"" of difficulty, when all it ends up being is a no-win-scenario.  (And yes, taking xp away for health regen is a punishment)1337 I suppose is the response to my review.  Back to Torchlight IIWill change to recommended though, since it was/is quite fun other than potion issues.			"

												I got this game yesterday because i was kinda getting bored of Minecraft now that i've been playing it for a few years. I'd say I made the right decision picking this game out. This is the very first hack 'n slash game i've ever played and it wont be the last! There are not many adventures yet but i dont really care. This game is REALLY difficult so dont ever get used to winning. There's also a level editor that's pretty cool, even though it's advanced. I haven't tried out the multiplayer yet so I can't say anything about that except that it sounds awesome. But although amazing, buggy. Very, very buggy. Most of the time when I die, a litterally fly backwards until I hit a wall. Somtimes I even fall into oblivion. The enemy AI is just as bas as the bugs. There was this one time where an enemy kept on walking into a wall and never stopped even when I was behind him. So I just kept backstabbing him until he died. But even with the bugs and poor enemy AI, It's great game! I'd give it an 8/10.			"

												needs MORE things to make it feel truely epic, needs more classes, skills, and enime types, as well as new blocks, outfits, and traps. Also. please make a higher placement limit. As the game stands. it feels a bit lack luster. Its a great starting point for a game with this kind idea, dont get me wrong, i love how it works, but it just needs more of what we love about it. adding in just say, 10 more enimes, and 10 more mini bosses, or 3 or 5 actual bosses would help a little. but as is. I can't recomend this game. After about 3 to 6 hurs you've akready seen all there is to see, in most of the combos that there are to see. :<			"

												I'm in love with this game, and I had no intention of buying it. I trader just offered this game, I never heard of it, so I looked at some lets plays and I accepted the trade. I was gonna keep it for profit but I really wanted to play it, so I added it to my library, and I'm glad I did. Go trough hundreds of user generated levels, get some dragon scrolls and once you think you are ready, then you can fight the dragon, hence the name.Don't Worry, you don't need to kill the dragon, I don't know if you need to last long enough or do as much damage before you die, but whatever it is. You get good reward that can only be obtained from fighting the dragon. I'm sure you get the best rewards by killing the dragon, but I'm only level 6. That will take HOURS before I can kill it. The user generated levels are great. There are 2 categories. Adventure and Campaign. Campaign is just like adventure but with more indepth story and multiple levels.The only negative thing I can say right now is the multiplayer.. If you could call it that.  There are barely anyone online (about 0-4, in a good day), and most of the people online are level 60+ and as beginner, that will completely remove the challenge and fun from the game. Luckily, when hosting your game, you can put a minimum and a maximum levels that can join you, but no one would join because there are almost no people online. That's not the devs fault though. ITS YOUR FAULT FOR NOT BUYING THIS GAME!! BUY IT NOW!			"

												Wow.My first look in this game felt like it would be ""lego-ish"", if that makes any sense. Turns out it wasn't. Just like promised, Diablo and LBP combined. It has the classic Hack & Slash feeling in it, yet making it fun to play as there's so many player-made maps, and most of them are fun to play.Every class has it's own unique skills and abilities. They are quite balanced, except for the Fighter. The game is heavily based on ranged combat (i'm not saying that CQB would suck or anything) mainly because when you have to fight even a little bit bigger groups they do alot of damage to you if you try to melee them. CQB works quite well against single enemies, but ranged weaponry is more effective against groups and bosses.Overall, i'd say this game is awesome and fun to play :)			"

												I got this game yesterday because i was kinda getting bored of Minecraft now that i've been playing it for a few years. I'd say I made the right decision picking this game out. This is the very first hack 'n slash game i've ever played and it wont be the last! There are not many adventures yet but i dont really care. This game is REALLY difficult so dont ever get used to winning. There's also a level editor that's pretty cool, even though it's advanced. I haven't tried out the multiplayer yet so I can't say anything about that except that it sounds awesome. But although amazing, buggy. Very, very buggy. Most of the time when I die, a litterally fly backwards until I hit a wall. Somtimes I even fall into oblivion. The enemy AI is just as bas as the bugs. There was this one time where an enemy kept on walking into a wall and never stopped even when I was behind him. So I just kept backstabbing him until he died. But even with the bugs and poor enemy AI, It's great game! I'd give it an 8/10.			"

As the game stands. it feels a bit lack luster. Its a great starting point for a game with this kind idea, dont get me wrong, i love how it works, but it just needs more of what we love about it. adding in just say, 10 more enimes, and 10 more mini bosses, or 3 or 5 actual bosses would help a little. but as is. I can't recomend this game. After about 3 to 6 hurs you've akready seen all there is to see, in most of the combos that there are to see. :<			"

												Despite all of its flaws, this is still one of my favorite games to play with my friends. There is so much fun to be had just exploring and plundering the various missions and dungeons that people have made for this game, ranging from open-world style exploration minions to dungeon crawling and boss rushes. The level editor is simple and easy to use, with the ability to build story into them with NPCs and whatnot giving the game ridiculous longevity.The game isn't perfect, though. The UI takes a little bit of getting used to, and the combat is pretty lacklustre. Not to mention the game's survival is dependent on the support of its player base.TL;DR version:Pros:- Lots of variety in levels- Great to play with friends- Finding new loot is addictive and exciting- Good variety in the different classesCons:- Combat leaves a bit to be desired- Can't easily search for specific levels to play with friends			"

This is a fairly fun, albeit generic, multiplayer dungeon romp. It gets serious points for player made levels, and well done multiplayer. Essentially, anybody can host a game, and it is easy. There is a 'hub' where you can store items and manage your player's stuff, which is really well done. You then venture out into the world as a team.Pros:+Very customizable characters+Fairly tight controls+Crisp graphics+Great controller supportCons:-Feels really generic as far as textures and levels, but I assume this is what you get when custom level building is so easy-Music is meh-There should be an option for larger text when playing on your television - currently its way to difficult to read from the couchIf you have friends that are into RPG dungeon romps, you can't go wrong here.

								Early Access Review:First let me point out that Fight The Dragon is fun and addictive. Once you start getting some better gear and how the game plays, you'll be hooked for hours.In a nutshell, Fight The Dragon is an isometric ARPG where you hack and slash your way thru bandit camps, dungeons and graveyards. You pick up loot and level up your character. But that's where the twist of the game comes in. These levels you'll go thru are user-created, which means other players like yourself, created them. Level creation is another aspect of the game as you are given the ACK(Adventure Construction Kit) which allows you to design your own level, may it be a pillaged town or a dark and gruesome dungeon. ACK works like a 3D modeling software. There are a lot of tools that you can play around with and you can design the dungeon to your own liking, and I mean a lot, you can put traps, enemies, build rooms, put up decorations, set up puzzles and many more, the sky is the limit. This on the other hand have a downside to it such as other players tend to make troll maps.The leveling system of the game is the usual as you get experience points from killing mobs and bosses, and the equipment system is typical. On the other hand, they present these systems with a clean and sleek designed hud which is a good touch and a great help to user experience.You can replay old dungeons if you wanna grind to get better gear and experience as everything follows to your level. and same with new characters.And with the title, you get to fight The Dragon ofcourse, after you level and gear up, there's a seperate instance where you can go in and fight The Dragon. The Dragon has huge life points but damage carries over even after death. This is a great way to see how much damage you can make and see the improvements of your new gear. As of the moment though, defeating The Dragon has no rewards yet, but this is understood since the game is still in Alpha.On the side note though, the game feels it lacks sounds as if you turn the music down, you won't really hear anything other than the ""thud"" that your weapon makes when it hits an enemy, which to my opinion also lacks kick.Overall, Fight The Dragon is a must have title for fans of the genre and dungeon master sims as well. I personally will follow how the game progresses and hope that it's for the better, With 1418 maps(and counting) and the ACK, you'll be amaze how creative and very imaginative other players can be. You'll surely spend hours with Fight The Dragon.			"

								To the Dev's,Guys, we need a way to respond to feedback in-game from players who've run through our maps.  Also, the search mechanism for choosing adventures needs work.  There have been several complaints about not being able to search for maps based on user defined tags.  Further, it seems only the top rated maps are visible to players when they're searching for adventures to run.  How can an adventure rise to the top of the ratings if no one can find it?  Please fix these issues so that we are incentivized to continue adding content and telling our friends about this, otherwise, gem of a game!Respectfully,The Rebel Raven			"

								What makes Fight The Dragon really special - and the reason I purchased it - is its adventure editor (i.e. level editor). If you have always dreamt of building small fantasy adventures, this will be your dream come true. It is so intuitive to use that anyone can be super creative with it, regardless of your techcred.As for the game, it is a cute ARPG that may satisfy those who have always wanted to try that kind of game withouth delving into (insert your favourite ARPG here). It is pretty basic but fun for 10 min sessions.But, really, it is the editor that makes it. It will be interesting to see how much power and flexibilty we get when the game releases, without loosing the amazing accessibility.Now if you'll excuse me, I will jump back in and build one of my most memorable Dark Souls moment and get fellow players to suffer through my levels, but in more blocky form.

Fight the Dragon has some fantastic potential with user created dungeons that are easy for anyone to make, while providing a decent amount of complexity into it, and it is clearly made by developers who have a passion for the genre. It has a few minor problems here and there, but nothing too major and it is shaping up to be an absolutely fantastic hack and slash RPG.Would recommend to anyone who is even remotely interested in this genre, as it does SO much right and is so much fun. Hope this helps you make an informed purchase. :)			"

								If all you could think about while slaying your way through Diablo, Dark Alliance or Torchlight was, ""I wish there was a game that let me make my own dungeons and adventures,"" then this is the game for you.Well, sort of. Fight the Dragon is made for dungeons that take less than a half hour to complete, and the terrain and dungeon-building tools are very Lego or Minecraft-esque. They're still smoothing out the combat (which takes more cues from Gauntlet than modern ARPGs), adding more tilesets and enemies, and developing more classes. But it's a thoroughly pleasant experience for an Early Access game. The dungeon-building is intuitive and well-developed, even at this stage. Updates and regular and substansial, and the developers respond to player feedback. Highly reccomended, especially if, like me, you enjoyed the park builder in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater or the dungeon builder in Neverwinter more than the actual game.			"

								Great little game so far! At its heart, it's essentially DnD, as all of the adventures you play are made by the community, which all are unique in that you have freedom over the entire layout, theme, loot locations, and even NPC dialog. Even better, you can tag along with friends and adventure together, everyone getting their own loot drops.You can choose from 4 classes at the moment: Warrior, Fire Lord, Ice Wizard and Black Rogue. You obtain experience and levels and loot as you play through random adventures made by your fellow players and friends. The ""item vendor"" is actually a ""Loot Shrine"" that you offer unwanted items to, build up points which slowly fall into higher and higher tiers that grant you better and better items when you ""pray"" to the loot shrine. On top of that, it's also your loot stash (ie. cross-character).The ACK (Adventure Construction Kit) is quite easy and effective to work with, already supporting Environment Effects, Time of Day, water/lava/mud, copy/paste (but not undo yet, sadly), with things like music, mutators and map triggers all on the way! The current set of assets isn't overwhelming, but not completely barren either. It also has fledgling ""room-over-room"" support in the form of some pretty basic bridges, which will hopefully be expanded as time goes on.In summary, I'm really liking this game so far. Given the fact that the adventures are entirely community made, there's always something new to do, and more loot to find!			"

								After about 6 hours of playing the game, i think i have a pretty decent feel on where it stands and how it works ^_^This game is 99% user created content and that can go both ways. your experience can either be fantastic or dreadful depending on the community maps you get. In MY experience i have had very few maps that i hated and quite honestly most of the maps are actually really good!lets get into the pros and cons!Pros:-easy to use level creation kit-game is great for both short and long play sessions-will have steam workshop content in the future (ie skins and other customization features)-very fun multiplayer-its gauntlet meets little big planet!Cons:- the movement can be a little odd to get used to at first, it feels rather stiff- the evasion mechanic can use some work as it will NOT interrupt your current attack. your choice is either tank to deal damage or evade to do none- spell casters in the game still feel like melee classes, this here is a huge problem for me because it makes it feel like the game caters to more tanky characters (ie warrior)-some levels you recieve are outright horrible/cannot be completed (however you CAN delete the map, exit, and block the creator/map from showing up again!)All in all, i would say this game is a must buy if you were EVER a fan of gauntlet or little big planet. you are given a lot of freedom with the in game creation kit, and with the steam workshop and further development i see a real gem on our hands.As long as they sort out that evasion issue and make the caster classes a bit more diverse, AND add some more creatures and tile-sets to the game (or at least allow us to via steam workshop) this game has insane potential. 8/10 (score can improve with further development)			"

												Like ARPGs like Diablo, Torchlight and Nox? If so, then you might enjoy Fight The Dragon.The levels are mostly designed by the community. This is actually nice because there will always be something new, unlike the other games I mentioned which have pre-set designs.Pros:- User generated levels- Typical hack n' slash loot fest- Fun solo, with friends or with randomsCons:- Not as in-depth as Diablo 3 or Torchlight- The skills each characer get are pretty lacking; nothing to write home about- Since it's user created content, users can just create a world full of chests, and shut off the enemies (unable to attack you) to get free loot and easy exp.

								The game is at it's core a Hack N Slash game and it's done quite well.Though I feel the focus is put where it's needed most, the Adventure Creation Kit and it's obvious.It's easy to use and after using it for the first time, I published by first map for it ""Razghul Crypt"" and I continued to change things about it that I didn't like about it.And as time has gone on, I've gotten better with using the ACK and published several other levels and even made a campaign all within the space of a week.And as it stands I enjoy not only making content, but playing other peoples creations as well.2/10/15There have been several incredible improvements to the editor with being able to set up better puzzles and a few more enemy types each with their own use.When I originally had created this review I didn't expect much work to be put into it, but I didn't care at the time because I enjoyed making levels for people.But now, I'm not as active as I previously was with updating and creating levels, but I check in every so often to read comments people leave on my levels and see where I'm placed on the leaderboard.

												Playing as a warrior is so dreadfully dull that I'd rather go play a sports game, and I haven't played a sports game of my own volition since probably Tecmo Bowl on the NES.Pros:-Workshop support-Multiplayer (didn't try it, though)-Create your own contentCons:-Base content is dreadfully paced and not very exciting-Weak character creation options without utilizing workshop content-Terrible interface; the inventory menu is one of the worst I've ever seen-Terrible controls for most aspects of the game, including inventory management-Terrible tutorial expalining how things like the shrine work (I'm assuming I can only donate once an adventure)-Combat (at least for warriors) is mostly just clicking in place until you or your aggressors are dead-Aiming in combat is kind of wonky, and the animations don't really adjust mid swing, so you're often swinging at air-Jumping and climbing is cumbersome at pointsFinal Thoughts:Why would you put a station (a backpack) near your house to access your inventory? It literally just hits tab for you. You can access your inventory anywhere, it just doesn't look like one. Just play Diablo, Torchlight, Minecraft or anything else.			"

And if you're up  to the challenge.. there's always the dragon waiting to destroy you. Super fun all around goodness.			"

												I have played about 5 levels so my opinion may not be totally accurate, but I already got a decent grip of how the game works.This game is great when got during a sale (my case). It's relatively fun, the community creation aspect and etc is a big plus, but the combat is kinda clunky for a Hack n' Slash. I found myself waving my weapon at nothing at many times, and the play with mouse + keyboard seem much worse than with a controller, I think a controller recomendation should be there. *However if you press the movement keys on the same direction the mouse is pointing at while striking, it does seem (at least seem) to improve accuracy.Also, despite having quite simplistic graphics, I have both a gaming computer and a notebook, and I found myself shocked to notice that the notebook couldn't run above 30 fps, actually not even above 20. It's an i3 with 4 gigs of memory, and the video card isn't really great, but it plays Dota 2 really well with almost moderate graphic settings. Not being able to run this game just seems... wrong. * NOTE I put the game in the lowest settings and now things are pretty smooth, at least with small mobs so far, but to me it is still weird that Dota 2 on some average aspects still runned smoother. Anyways at least you will probably play the game decently with just a little better than minimum specs.*Anyway I'm not sure if I would recommend this game for full price, but if you are looking for a new way of experiencing old concepts from action rpg-like games, this one will probably keep you entertained for quite some time. I just wish the hitboxes and optimizations were, (I may be wrong here but that's how I felt) better. Still, I think I found myself a new timekiller.			"

												As a game I can not recommend this.It sounds good, and there are tons of maps.But: it feels more like a sandbox-title.... with a bad camera, clumsy controls and odd hit/collision-detection.And no storyline, just ""random"" maps, with some Steam-achievements thrown in.Yet somehow not rewarding at all, as there is no soul to it.I find it hard to find any feelings for that title. It is just: Meh! (in a bad way)However, one might find it entertaining for some hours running around and killing every creature on any of the (endless) maps.If you are into grinding, keeping a clean and sorted inventory (selling the bad stuff) .... this ""game"" provides plenty of that - with bad camera, clumsy controls and odd hit/collision-detection.PS: Did I mention the camera?!

								First time I'm writing a review, and I got to say this game is really value for money.Mechanics are not very deep, but its simple and addictive. Tons of reasons to keep playing:1) Loot!2) Level up to be more powerful, and wear better loot with higher requirements!3) Donate Loot to the Shrine to earn more loot!4) Earn dragon scrolls to chip off the Dragon's health. Even if you can't kill it, you earn rewards along the way5) You want to grow more powerful to continue killing the Dragon			"

								I try to keep my fascination with video games under wraps..it's such a loaded topic it makes religion and politics look positively benign. Some things are just too hot to discuss on social media.And as much as I love dungeon crawlers and space games, I have to admit they usually don't hold my interest. World of Warcraft was an exception, but after leveling five characters to 80 my heart just wasn't in it any more.I like to MAKE things, not just play with things other people made..no matter how cool they are. No dungeon crawling fulfills me like painting does, no space battles are as challenging as writing a good song.With Fight the Dragon that may have changed..This is a game that you make yourself.Sure, there are hundreds of levels already made, but you have access to the exact same editor the developers use. Build your dungeon brick by brick. Devise devious traps, puzzles, and mazes. Populate your level with enemies ranging from fire beetles to skeleton archers, each with their own behavior and AI.Make pools of lava, poison, or mud. Rivers of water and bridges with trapdoors. Gates that open if you find the right key. Pressure plates that trigger walls of fire. NPCs that guide the player along their way.Then when you finish making your level, you can publish it. Your level will be played and voted on by other Fight the Dragon players around the world.It's much more fun to make a game than to play a game, and if your kids are into games but you worry that it's not an intellectually stimulating pursuit, you might do well to buy them a copy of Fight the Dragon.And if you're like me and tend to like the idea of games more than games themselves, buy it for yourself. Spend a few hours in video-game legoland and I'll bet you'll be as excited as I am.We finally have the keys to the castle!			"

												It's not bad, but its very simplified and basic. There is not much customization there is like 10 monsters in the entire game so every level seems the same with the same monsters. The feel of the game is good but again lacks in customization when it comes to building your character 4 different moves per class and only 4 classes so there is 16 different moves in the entire game. the game is great for kids around ages 8-14 prolly. but any older than that and im sure you will find it very repetitive fighting through levels killing rats and skeletons. i give a 5/10 for effort			"

												As a level editor, Fight The Dragon is excellent, with simple, easily understood UI and an intuitive map editor.As a diablo-style RPG, the game severely lacks content, story, or skill progression.  It's too easy to find levels that use every monster/mechanic in the game, which leads to everything afterwards feeling repetive. So after 4 or 5 levels or shooting/slashing mobs, collecting keys, and placing barrels on switches to open doors, it gets quite dull. If you're looking for a chance to make your own (short) RPG dungeons to show off to your friends, this is a fine game to pickup.  But, if you're looking to play through a MP adventure with friends, well, you're better off sticking with games that advertise their game, not their editors.			"

								What's there to say about FTD? Well I can tell you it's nothing bad. This game is totally worth th $15 asking price. It's a solid ARPG and the ability to build your own adventures and share them with the world is a fantasic feature that ot only works well but also adds a level of replayability not seen in most games. With an awesome devlopement team that's pushing updates pretty much weekly to add content and fix bugs as well as listen to player feedback I see this game going places. So buy the game, grab some friends or go it solo. Either way you will not be dissapointed!			"

												Fight the Dragon is a endless game with endless possibilites, the armour, weapons are very dynamic, and there are even some funny ones, for instance using a barrel as a chestplate. If you want something different, there are hundreds of levels that you can choose from, you can even pick the same level you have played before, I have not experienced any problems with glitches, lag, or problems connecting to friends. I give this game a 10/10 because its fun, its not repetitive because i can choose from hundreds of levels, this game has a good sense of humour, and with friends it is even better. I hope to see a healer and a archer with the new updates to come. If you have a little bit of money left in your steam wallet, you must buy this game, even if you are just by yourself playing it, you will have a blast playing Fight the Dragon.			"

												It's a dungeon crawler type game where everything scales to your level. Enemies gain health and damage as you level up; you gain health and damage as you level up; the higher your level the higher quality gear that drops; the Dragon hits harder the higher level you are... everything scales with your level. The only variance in this game is the difficulty category of the map. Easy maps will always be easy and hard maps will always be hard... end of story. The loot and xp grinding gets old and tired when your reward is basically a higher number and new loot to grind so that you can pass through levels with the same ease as you could at your prior level. Good for a couple hours of entertainment, but once you realize you aren't actually getting stronger it's stale.			"

There are different monsters and RNG loot, cool! But the game lacks in difficulty, the game is a steamroll after level 5 and gives no challenges, this is a huge issue in my eyes. Also when creating maps you are limited with height options, making mountain maps impossible, and maps are made to be linear, limitations are bad in my opinion, and mob creating is also pretty lame, you cant create cool bosses with high health and damage, and the skills for bosses are lacking because there are none.If you want a cool game for 2-5 hours this is it, but for more its impossible. Need a lot of polish and tweaks to be a good game.			"

												This game gets boring after a while. There's a few hillarious bugs in the game that made me laugh my head off, but that's basically the best part. There are some very challenging and fun dungeons, but most of them are easy as heck, even though they shouldn't be. Why? Crossbows. You basically just need a crossbow and some decent juking strats and kiting strats if things get out of hand, because crossbows can stun enemies. They're basically unbalanced. Also, Fighting the Dragon is kinda boring. It has 4 basic moves that you can all dodge easily except for one of them, and 2 op abilities that can half shot you at level 15ish that you can dodge easily. There's also a bug that you can get while fighting the dragon, maybe in dungeons too. If you stand still and just use basic attacks, the dragon will keep attacking you until you get down to 1 hp. Then, for some reason, the game shows the dragon doing damage, but it actually doesn't and you become virtually immortal unless you use a heavy attack, special move, or you do a dodge roll. It's fun for the first 15 hours, then it gets boring.			"

												Note: Reason to why I have so few hours into the game will be answered also in the review. Firstly the game goes the easy ( read: lazy ) route of block-graphics ( Minecraft-inspired ). If you hate it then I think this game is not for you. I personally don't like it, but can handle it if the game is good. This seems like a nice concept: Hack-n-Slash game with community content and custom dungeons and LOOTING!!!! So what we look for in this game is how fun it is to LOOT, how fun the classes and their development is and how good the combat feels. Let's see how it fares. In those 3 aspects.Looting in this game seemed quite decent. I mean you get frequent chests, you get monster drops and ""higher-value"" chests and also something like a ""boss""-drops. The system where you can ""donate"" junk and gold to shrine to ""pray"" for random good items for various slots is also a nice gamble and adds to all of the Gearing up aspect of an Hack-n-Slash.The combat is where the game falls flat and by a huge margin. By no means is combat any fun. The hit detection is abysmal. I feel this game has worse or more difficult combat than Dark Souls for PC and that game aims to be difficult and challenging.  Half the time you will be missing the enemy because you're not facing them, that's okay... half of the time when you are facing the enemy you still won't hit it, because your cursor is slightly off! Now even with everything angled right the hit-boxes are drunk and sway around the actual model. The classes... You have 4 classes ( 2 mages, a warrior and a semi-warrior )... All of whom mostly swing their prefered weapon, at least at the early levels. Now I want you to pick ANY 4 heroes/champions/classes from an MOBA game and imagine having a GRINDING RPG game built around them... you have 4 abilities that hardly ever improve or feel different for all of the gear grinding and loot farming. I said 4? Yes that is if you play with each and seperate one, but mostly you'll be stuck with ONE.I might have a bit biased oppinion, but that's what this god-awful combat system got me to. I have few reviews and generally prefer to write pleasant and good ones about games I like, but for me to write a negative one, the game seriously must SUCK. I understand that the game is popular amongst some of you people, but so is Minecraft... and hell if I knew why.. "

												The ACK system is garbage with screwy ratios and a shackle system put on the map designers to keep the game from reaching a difficulty higher than something my 8 year old can handle with a level one character.The game in its current state is fun for a little bit until you realize how hard the developers have tried to keep the game from being a true hack and slash experience.

Product received for free
												5/10. Room for improvement. For now, get it at a discount.Simple hack and slash game.I wouldn't quite compare it to Little Big Planet or even Diablo. More like Gauntlet with shareable custom dungeons.Controls are clunky and character animations are not very fluid, making the character feel unresponsive in a bad way.Moving up/down ledges is awful, i.e. the auto-jump/climb mechanic does not work well enough at all for it to be anything short of annoying 100% of the time. Feels forced.I should be able to dodge up small ledges without hitting collision. Makes dodging useless unless you are on perfectly level terrain.Walls and other geometry obscures your character too much, making it hard to see things in some levels.Camera seems far too limited for no real reason.The naming scheme for items rarely makes sense.Graphics are okay, though generic.The UI, though styled nicely modern, is not very intuitive. I did eventually get used to it.Game speed seems to be tied to framerate...? smh...			"

Early Access Review
								Honestly I think this game has a lot of potential. It needs a lot more additions in the form of character customization and customizations features.Would be nice to see a wide arrary of classes as well. Looting system is pretty solid as it is BUT types of loot themselves could be improved. Would also be nice to see a way to ENCHANT items. Needs more enemies and randomization of types and looks to enemies too I think. But this game has a lot of potential. Is it worth the $15 price tag? Honestly no, not at this point: not now. But if the developers of this game stick to it I bet this game could turn into something really fun and unique.			"

												Could have been better pretty much sums up this entire game. I get more fun out of watching rich white ladies grass grow, than playing this game. Fight the Dragon is a good idea let down by poor production values, sub-par gameplay, and ugly graphics. It tries that whole voxel look, but everybody and their mom look like disformed lego people.  I get that this is an indie team, but the excution could have been better. Combat is a joke. (like the asking price of $15) it feels weak, slow and unrepesonsive, blocking is pointless, there is very little differences between classes,and there's barely a community, which something a game like this needs to stay fun and intresting. People confuse me by saying that this game is good, but hey people enjoy Postal 2 and Fable, so i guess it's somewhat understandable, in stupid way. dungeons are like potato salad alright to look at, but when you get into it you feel cheated, dissapointed, and upset, I played a player made dungeon and it was leagues above what the devs created, because it was acutally fun, and that's sad. There is nothing that great here, everything has been done better, by better games. It needed more time, and money, and it's a darn shame it didn't get it.  I hope another team picks this idea up, and does it better, cause it honestly deserves better. -2 out of 10, at least it's fun to uninstall.			"

												As fun as this game is, I just can't reccomend it. It heavily relies off of community submissions, which can be a good and bad thing.

												UPDATE:Perhaps I was too harsh in my original review and now I feel bad about it. The game is fun in co-op and has a very neat idea. Some things can be improved upon, but overall I had a fun time playing it. It can get a little repetitive, but it is up to a community to create fun maps for it, although tools provided need a little work and I would LOVE to be able to put more stuff in adventures, right now it is kinda limited.My initial review was negative and posted after I spent almost 3 hours creating my own adventure and focusing on details only to find out I ran out off points without implementing even 1/3rd of what I wanted and never being able to publish it, because the albeit much needed anti-grind system is flawed in thinking I made an impossible challenge of puting too much traps and enemies in my adventure. Which bummed me out, cuz the whole idea of my adventure was about hard and challenging castle inspired by Dark Souls that can't be rushed. Fighting 2 bosses at a time, running under heavy ranged fire, carefully walking around traps. I've put a lot of effort in it, but ultimately couldn't published it and that really bummed me out because of the time spent designing.If you're creative type and want some good time with friends in coop in a simple game, this game might be what you want.Although creating mode is limited, there are still vast variety of adventures that can be created. I really wish you can let your fantasy run free and produce massive and detailed maps with lots of enemies and challenges, so player can sweat a little. But I realise this is not exactly a game about it. It is more simple, more relaxed and easy paced hack'n'slash game with basic controls. It's more of a kids game perhaps.Whatever the case, I am canging my recommendation, because I feel like I've been unfair in my initial review.OLD REVIEW:Right now it is really boring, super simple battle system, ui and controls for creating your own adventures are HORRIBLE, I am fighting with controls more than designing, new adventures are hard to find, it's very repetative, you can't customize your map after you've put adventures by a developer without completely erasing all of it (which is so sucky, i would've created it differently if i could). You can't create really large adventure unfortunately and very limited in your resources, and anti-grind system is flawed as hell. Hey, dude, you have too much enemies, okay, I am putting more potion chests and checkpoints -- nope, too many potion chests. WTF? Just let me create what I want, not what you feel impossible to complete. Yeah, I have a room filled with rats, but thats the challenge I want to face. Really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.			"

												This game as it is, most definitely worth the 11 dollars I paid,  I dont even like this kind of game, I dont know why I bought it really, I am more into games like Skyrim, Fallout, Metro etc. I guess I got this game because it looked like something that could just be a fun game to play in short sessions and not have heavy decisions to make or mods to install .. What I have found is that I LIKE THIS KIND OF GAME! well this one anyway. The game is simple at face value, run around smashing stuff pick up loot, sell loot, go smash more stuff get better gear THE END.  But theres so much more, an intersting trade sytem that allows you to trade all your useless junk you found for a chance at better gear or stat points. A great dragon with a million health to try killing, and best of all, the real shining star of this game, the level editor, lots of games have level editors but I dont think any have implimented them into the game so seamlessly as this, build a level ( I can barely install windows and I managed to build one) publish it and presto there is quite litterally endless content to play that will keep leveling up from feeling like a grind. Vote levels up or down, favorite and subscribe to you favorite publishers.... great potential here. If a level is too tuff : no problem come back later and try again I LOVE the non linear approach to the ""adventures"". and the fact that most range from 5 to 20 minutes is nice, digestible chunks !As far as being early access there are a few quirks that could be smoothed out but nothing more than minor annoyances, seems totally playable to me.Anyway, this was a total surprise find for me and I recommend this game !

High HP are no help, as the fire damage scales with HP and not with level. On the other hand, lots of stammina is very useful, as dodge rolls seem to be the best tactic against the dragon. As the rogue has good ranged weapons, high speed and only takes half the stammina to dodge, he might be the optimal choice for fighting the dragon""-Reedo			"

												Game looks amazing at first, but then it rapidly become boring. And here is why:- it has bugs (option ""Suicide"" here is for a reason - you can stuck in terrain);- it's not polished, there are so many small things which prevents you from loving it;- it's not balanced, you can get uber loot from easy map and then bag full of crap after beating extreme;- there is no point in difficulty, you MUST choose the easiest, that's 50% exp, while maxed difficuly only 3x times more exp but with 10 times smaller chances to finish it, nobody care if you beat map with 0 lives, but making single failure on unknown map is too easy to spare any available life, simple math: run 3 new maps and get 3x50% exp easily -OR- run just one map, but die first time on unkown trap, die second time due to unexpected trigger spawning monster behind, die third time because of no potions left for last boss fight, which makes it total 0 exp and no loot?- UI is terrible, the guy who invent inventory is either idiot or he never himself played this game, no map, terrible idea with running between adventure/multiplayer game/switching hero and most often visited stash/altar;- lack of information, there are no clues what which stats gives in order to choose between them, tutorial message are very few (to give you an example, just few minutes ago I discovered the purpose of gold in this game.... after 13+ hours of playing....  not going to spoil, good luck in discovering if you are brave to buy this);- loud statement ""community driven"".. sounds like ""we made map editor, we sometime add new graphics, go make us reach"";- multiplayer is fantastic!, you will enjoy it as much as I did.. once.. to never try it again.All-in-all game is a fail with dated graphics, crappy mechanics and poor UI. Not recommended. You want teamplay action with puzzles and hordes of enemies? Then buy Gauntlet and not ""Fight teh dragon you will never be able to beat because game is boring"".			"

												A simple hack and slash with lots of loot. It's fun, easy to get into and you're always finding stronger and better gear. Best part of the game though is the map creator that gives you the tools to make your own maps and such. Maps are uploaded and everything you play is user generated by other players like yourself. I'v spent more time making levels than I have actually playing. It's a cheap game with infinite replay value!			"

Early Access Review
								This is a great start for a game!  It's a fun idea, the level creator is INCREDIBLY easy to use, and game play is pretty fun.  I like the concept of the Dragon itself!   The only thing holding this title back right now is a lack of content.  Most of the building materials are simple palette swaps of each other, or slightly different brick types.  There are seriously only like 15-20 different enemies in the whole game, and a handful of weapon/armor models.  The core of the game is there.   The devs either need to start cranking out CONTENT.  Monsters, dungeon types, objects, set pieces, etc.   That's when the game will really start to shine.  Or?  Open up the creator to let people create and share their own objects like people who mod The Sims!Also, combat.  PLEASE put more work into combat?  Combat is literally hit-for-hit, without any kind of elements, resistances, or any sort of strategy or depth at all.    I recommend this game because it shows promise.  It's definitely not done yet, and in its current state it's playable but pretty disappointing.  But there are some really awesome ideas here, and I think if they keep churning out content, this could be a phenomenal title.			"

												Fight the Dragon can be categorized as a grindy RPG game, and that's pretty much it.Unless you have a group of 3 other people to play this with, don't bother playing it by yourself. It's pretty boring and extremely grindy, and there isn't much of a playerbase anymore.  (No online games in the lobby ever, so it's SP all the way).I'd recommend it if it's 5 dollars or under, but anything over that and just nah. It's way too grindy to be good. It takes me 3x8hours to level up 1 level after level 6.tl;dr: buy it on sale, don't buy it at full price if you don't have 3 more people to play with all the time.			"

												MIndless, boring, and for little kids.  The game image says Build, Explore, Battle, Loot... lets go over this...Build: build a level that no one will ever see or find or play.Explore: there is zero exploring of anything... you play a level, a short level that has nothing to do with exploring anything.  You just go through the level.Battle: Battle, or mindlessly click the lmb with zero strategy or skill needed? ... the latter.Loot: This is the only one they got right, yes, there is loot.This game is beyond terrible.

												In spite of the charm and solid build-your-own foundations, it loses luster very quickly. Spread too far and too thin which is ironic for a game that wants you to do 90% of it's level design and the interface is sticky, if you're that into the runaboutypointandclicky gameplay but have already bought and completed the Diablo and Torchlight series' then sure give this a whirl but otherwise look into those first.

												Fight the Dragon can be categorized as a grindy RPG game, and that's pretty much it.Unless you have a group of 3 other people to play this with, don't bother playing it by yourself. It's pretty boring and extremely grindy, and there isn't much of a playerbase anymore.  (No online games in the lobby ever, so it's SP all the way).I'd recommend it if it's 5 dollars or under, but anything over that and just nah. It's way too grindy to be good. It takes me 3x8hours to level up 1 level after level 6.tl;dr: buy it on sale, don't buy it at full price if you don't have 3 more people to play with all the time.			"

												I wanted to like this and was drawn in by the positive reviews.  Sadly, it feels VERY casual and easy, bland and boring; maybe good for younger players.  It was only tolerable for about 1 hour and then I wasn't having fun.  Don't expect any class depth.  Character movement is slow and unfulfilling.  There is virtually no story.  The player model looks like a cheesy cross between a Mii and a Lego guy.  Ultimately, there is nothing to draw you in and I found very little reason to keep playing.  Trust me when I say that the reviews here on Steam make it sound much more fun than it is.  I'd recommend passing for now unless you're in it for the level editing or something.			"

												Im really dissappointed in this game.  it supposedly is ""controller compatible"". Unfortunately, that is not 100% correct.  movement and camera panning work as expected, as well as attacks and special attacks. However, the start button somehow got mapped to the right trigger as opposed to the start button on the game pad.  This is annoying since it is supposed to be the sprint button.On top of the mapping issue, there is no way to access the the right side of the ""donation"" menu from your controller whilst in the loot shrine (at least not that i have been able to ascertain).  The only workaround is to switch from game controller to keyboard and mouse.  I feel like im being punished for what should be a pleasureable experience. Afterall, a dungeon crawler is all about reaping the rewards found in the myriad dungeons you visit. While I fully understand the concept of minor oversight, game controls are integral to player enjoyment.  I feel like the option to map button inputs in game would have been a marvelous option. However, since that is not the case and i am  digitally flogged for attempting to sell my loot, I cannot recommend this game in its current incarnation.May the devs hear my prayer, and the game gods embolden their action			"

												TL;DR: The level editor leaves a lot to be desired, and that was the one feature I wanted the game for.  The gameplay on its own sucks, but the loot system is decent enough.  Of course, even the loot system has its issues.The rest of the review:It's an Early Access experience, so I wasn't expecting much polish.  There's no content to the story, you just fight the dragon, hence the title.  I was OK with the lack of built-in content, because I thought I could play some user-created content that would actually be interesting.If you're buying the game for the level editor, stop.  The level editor sucks.  It isn't intuitive.  It has the beginnings of a logic editor with entity links, but you can't really make anything worth playing.  You can't have interactive dialogue with NPCs.  You can't have multi-floor buildings (well, you can if you're very clever with the bridge objects, but I think that's a glitch).  You can't make endless arena maps.  You can't make maps for Steam Workshop, the maps are built into the game instead, so your Steam profile doesn't get to display your map creations.  (Yes, you can make and share skins but that's not really interesting to me.)  Overall, it is just too limited and offers very little in terms of customization.If you're buying this game just to grind loot all day, have fun.  The loot system promotes replaying missions as efficiently as possible, only focusing on opening chests rather than fighting enemies.  You can build and play your own levels and just place all the enemies in a secluded area, away from everything else, so if you're after loot, I don't think you'll have any issues.			"

												Wow!  Boorrring. This is the only review I've posted.  This game is like a slower version of spiral knights. The inventory system is simplistic and may appeal to some. I don't like it. I like ""bag"" systems where I can see everything. This is an item system where you can't see what you've picked up unless you click on your equipped items.  The adventures are slow and simple. Not very engaging at all and seem geared to 1st time players of the top down system.			"

												There's some kind of freemium-esque system where if you die in a dungeon you lose all the loot, exp, skill points, etc. you earned up to that point, and re-playing the dungeon doesn't guarantee the same loot will drop. You could go through a dungeon for 30 minutes, earn a flaming longsword and 3 levels, and then trip over a beetle and lose all of it instantly. There's no way to improve if you can't flawless complete each dungeon with no error whatsoever. Basically, to get good you have to be good already.			"

												More Impressions @ TheVideogameBacklog.com(Early Access Impressions)With random adventures waiting around every corner, Fight the Dragon looks very promising. The aesthetics are rather basic, but the focus is on the adventure and challenges that you’ll face when you go out to level and gear up. The ultimate goal is to go and “Fight the Dragon” (what else?). Whether you’re looking to kill the dragon or just do some damage to him he’s got plenty of health do deal with.When you go out to adventure, you’ll play random levels as you pick which spot you want to go to on the over-world map (or at least that’s the best way I’ve found to describe it). You can replay levels already completed, but you won’t get a Dragon Scroll for completing them. (They allow you to fight the big jerky dragon.) You’ll get levels created by the developer (3 Sprockets) and those created by other players. You do get to vote for which maps you liked after you’ve either beaten them or been defeated by them. So far I’m in the dark of how I want to vote on some of them due to the content in them. I know that certain aspects of them are good, but if I don’t appreciate them, well… ah who am I kidding, thumbs down! After all, if you don’t like it, you don’t like it. (I like the neutral thumb more.)The best part of Fight the Dragon for me has to be, hands down, the level editor. I’m enjoying the heck out of the editor and I started by trying to recreate levels from the N64 game Goldeneye. I’ve since stopped doing that since Fight the Dragon doesn’t support multiple levels. Without having ability to create a second floor, my creation of “Not The Facility” has been halted until further progress has been made on the editor. I’m sure that’s something they may add in later. Maybe I’ll be able to make taller maps as well. As of now, you can only effectively make a tall one floor house. As for a beginning setup for crafting your own adventures, it works well enough for making dungeons and outside areas. If you’re willing to work with what you’ve got, there’s plenty of tools at your disposal to make some fun adventures for you and other players. At the very least, I would appreciate the ability to build higher even if I can’t make a second floor.There has been a few levels that remind me of what I’m not appreciating with some games lately. There’s been a fad with making games super difficult to bring back the “nostalgia of the olden times”. Some of the levels presented include way to many traps and junk that you’ll almost need prescience to know where to go. Can’t anyone remember when you just had a fun adventure and it wasn’t horribly difficult? I remember some games being difficult, but I don’t think many of those devs went out of their way to get your goat.On a flip-side, you have the ability to follow creators of your choice. It makes it a little easier to find an adventure you’ll probably enjoy more. However, I still recommend going on random adventures since that’s probably where the most fun will be, not knowing what you’re getting yourself into. You may even find yourself on my level. I’ll make more. I’m pretty happy with how the “Tunjair Desert” map turned out. Since I like to be satisfied with what I make, I’ll be taking my time and not rush anything.Score: Support This Title!With the level design loosely reminding me of Minecraft, I felt right at home creating levels. Sharing them is super easy too. There are limits to what you can actually design, but with time they may open up some options with height or creating second levels. The levels created by your fellow Steam people can range from (as much as one would expect) bland to fun to “What the …?” The fact that you can favorite designers of your choice makes it easier. It’s rather fun to play through and that stupid dragon is just begging to be stabbed. Fight the Dragon is definitely worth supporting.			"

Roll dodging is unreliable and frankly unnecessary (bad default difficulty tuning).Pass on this game, but if the developers take what they learned here and make another game, it could be great.			"

												The core of this game is actually very solid. It has a good loot system, good mechanics, good enough graphics, combat works well, the dragon concept and loot shrines are great ideas and even the spawn system is spot on. Unfortunately the game just doesn't go far enough to remain interesting. There are only 4 classes and each class has very few abilities and there really isn't much of any customizing to them. The loot shrine is a solid idea but it left me wishing I had something else to spend my gold on that was more interesting. The adventure design system has a really solid core, but unfortunately is just so limiting to what you can do with it that every adventure you play feels exactly the same.Overall it's a game that gets many of its core ideas right, but the lack of ""more"" to it just leaves you bored with the game after a short time playing it. That said, I'd love to see a Fight the Dragon 2 if they really expanded out on the character options(D3 and Torchlight 2 level), adventure tool and added in more gear gambling options.			"

Early Access Review
								Great game and concept, looking good so far. It's still got a few quirks here and there though, and a very VERY punishing level cap at lvl.30. This is most likely a temporary cap, unless he wants people to stop playing the game. Will update once the game gets completely playable, once there's no level cap. Until then, go watch some youtube meanwhile. 7/10, Don't buy yet.EDIT: To avoid confusion, the game isn't bad. It's just short-lived with the lvl cap. If you like spending hours reading text, playing player-made content and solving puzzles, go ahead. If you're a min-max'er you'll be coming to a halt pretty fast though, as the lvl-cap is so low. Personally, I CAN see myself playing this game a bunch if there was no cap on it. But as the Dev replied it, it will be raised in future updates. I do reccomend the game itself, but not it's current state of replayability. I reached the cap in about 4-5 hrs, for what.. 14€? Again, I will change my review once the cap is raised/removed.			"

												Fun the first hour.. then it started feeling repetitive. And some dungeons are just too unbalanced. Had promise - but it fell short.And don't even have me started on the insane out-of-view range off enemy archers..!! Jesus.			"

												Eh, it sounds like a blast, but in all honesty it's kinda rubbish.  Grind the f out of your game, and pray for good loot.  Literally you pray for loot.  Pretty cool system, but the rest of the game, just doesn't feel like much fun.  Thus, I got bored.  Doesn't really compete with other games of the same price.			"

												Casual (only 4 skills per class, also 4 classes and 4 stats) ""slasher"" with user generated content, made by kids, cubism graphics and poorly optimisation (i think, it still draws invisible voxels, cuz of high fps but overheating). Actually nothing to do here, if u r fan of diablo-like games - its only another casual♥♥♥♥♥♥from early access			"

Early Access Review
								A no doubt creative project/game with an interesting concept which suffers from horribly boring gameplay.In it's core, the game is a basic (and by basic I mean REEEEEEEALLY basic) hack'n'slash style platformer. Feeling like a mix of cheap arcade platformers and a cutesy-minecraft graphics version of Diablo.Fighting comes down to just slashing away, doing the one or other dodge against bigger enemies or occasionally using a special or heavy attack. Every 'class' comes with slight differences, but I didn't really feel any different when playing as Rogue or Fire Mage.The main selling point of the game is it's 'infinite level content' by means of providing a level editor. However, after playing a few hours, I've already seen and beaten + figured out simple patterns of attack to take down all of the ~dozen enemy types the game has to offer. And here is exactly the issue: Providing players a Level Editro does NOT give you instant 'ininite content'. It just gives you infinite variations of the exact same 15 enemies placed on the same 30 tilesets. If the game would have given me the possibility to pick enemy core animations, then add in my own values and special modifiers, that would have been interesting... but like this? Boring and EXTREMELY repetitive.Not to mention trivially easy (even when I accidentally entered a high level map with a level 1 mage. Took some more kiting/time, but that's it).The concept of the dragon arena is nice. And no doubt, the dragon is a heck of a boss. But that alone does not motivate me to grind through the same enemies hours and hours to come just to beat that boss.Overall, I'm VERY disappointed with the game, even more so because it's not ""This is a very early access and lots is to come"" but a ""It's nearly finished and very playable"".Rating: 2/10Your money will get you a better hour ratio in ever other game.

												I like what they were going for here, sort of a Little Big Planet meets Diablo sort of game. But clunky UI, not so tight controls, and a VERY unintuitive level editor makes it fall apart. With better tools for making your own adventures, I could see this being a really solid title, but right now I'm struggling to find the fun in it.			"

												was pretty bummed this doesn't use basic commands like ctrl-z, y, c, v, etc... to redo, undo, all sorts of stuff like that.  I don't like to learn new ways to use programs I already don't know anything about, that's why universal commands are used in professional software as a basic necessity, all the way from programming to creating music to websites.  I would strongly recommend if the developers read this to possibly consider something of the sort, i'm not saying your game is horrible, but it's simply that most people who really cherish their freetime and still put energy into something like this - don't want to learn an entirely new system of commands if they have to dig them up everytime they want to use them.If there was a transparent commands display.. or even my earlier recommendation to use simple ""MS Paint"" hotkeys for basic universal commands I for one would change this review to a positive - but who cares, I feel like a YELP reviewer.

												The good:* The game looks very nice. Models and textures are really nice and consistent. Sounds are also good. The GUI, while not particularly intuitive at first, looks great and is very responsive.The bad:* By default the game window was not created properly. I had to edit the configuration file (after stumbling across a forum post) to get it to a window of a reasonable size.* Gameplay is basic and repetitive.* My first character wasn't saved, apparently because I didn't exit the game properly. This wouldn't be so bad if the starting levels were not the same every time.It's entirely possible I am not the target audience for this game. The gameplay seems more aimed at a young gamer though the interface and controls are not that simple.			"

Posted: November 15, 2015
												Firstly I would like to just say that I got this game while it was on sale in a 4-pack for a total of $15-20. I believe this is a very good game and the fact is that the game is good. However, I do not recommend anyone buy this game if they are looking for games similar to what I've been looking for. To elaborate, I am looking for something medieval-like ,  something rpg-like with dungeons and new loot to find,  something challenging and fun at the same time, and most importantly it has to be  multiplayer co-op  for at least 4 people. In the months I've randomly searched when I decide to delve into the steam market I've found many games that seem almost perfect but don't have multiplayer or are too expensive for the time being. I am going to prove to you that there are better games than this that you can get that have these elements and some are even cheaper. Read on and I will explain.... This game is fun at first but the problem is the fact that it is based on you and your friends taking on random dungeons created by players. I marvel at this idea; it is brilliant. The issue is the fact that they are in fact players, that causing the obvious problem that not every dungeon is good. I am not exaggerating when I say that some dungeons I and my friends have went on are just garbage. I've spent more than 20 minutes on a dungeon with a friend when it should've taken about 5 minutes to complete. You might be thinking ""Oh, that just makes it more challenging"" and you'd be right, it took a long time to simply figure out that while on the inside of some castle wall (I know what you're thinking ""Oh! Castle wall!!! That's so cool"", this was anything but an actual castle.) we had to climb a ladder that was against the inside of the wall which happened to have a small house (not a shack, A HOUSE) which when you go inside seems to have nothing. Then you find out you have to go in a cellar there which we didn't discover existed till after killing everything on the ""dungeon"" (it was more of an outside area) and the only major difficulty was figuring out what to do. Mind you that this was not meant to be a puzzle, it was just bad mapmaking. You were presented with the area for this house right after you kill the things around you when you spawn. The point being is, if you expect anything as great as in the trailer video, I have not found it or even experienced anything that great. I will admit the game is fun, but what I'm trying to prove to you is that there are  BETTER ALTERNATIVES to this game if you are looking for similar things as me. Better games for you and a group of friends to try that I've played or intend to play in the future:  Trove: It's on steam, it's free, it's a 3rd person MMORPG with a bunch of fun classes like swordsman, archer, ice mage, pirate. There isn't PVP it's PVE oriented, and it has a ""minecraft-esque"" atmosphere. It is a voxel game which I'm normally not into but it's pretty good. Also, despite it being an MMO it does require aiming and you can dodge attacks if you jump and such, it is not lock on and just press a button to kill things like a lot of MMO's. Whenever you and your friends are near each other you all get xp despite whomever kills a creature and you all get your own specific loot drops that only you see, when you open up chests, that are based on your class. So there are no arguments over splitting up loot, you get the same amount of loot and xp with a group as solo-ing. So it's better with friends, you level up faster that way. There also are bosses at the end of dungeons. To sum it up: As my friends and I describe it, it is basically Fight The Dragon But Better. Sky Saga: Currently in alpha and free. It is not on steam and does require a key that you get when you sign up for an account on their webpage and email you a key. It is an MMORPG and very, very. similar to Minecraft in virtually every way except it's less about the building and more focused on getting quests by talking to npc's at the hub and you go on adventures. You might have to get an item you've never gotten before and bring it back to the hub, or just go take on dungeons and they do have somewhat difficult bosses in dungeons. I was co-oping a dungeon with a friend and they left for some reason and I was stuck with half health and found a boss and basically just ran out of the dungeon cause I couldn't take him. It was this big dude who had a giant lance or something and would swing it at me. To sum it up: I don't know when they will be releasing keys again as of this moment though, but definitely check this out and make an account if you're interested in playing in the future. Also be sure to check your ""promotions"" tab in gmail if that's what you use, it got sent there for me.Secrets of Grindea: This game I have not played or own yet. But from what I gather it is multiplayer with up to 4 players and basically a top-down RPG with monsters and boss fights. I don't know what else there is but it appears to have the elements I'm looking for in dugeon style games. It is currently $15 the same price as fight the dragon. So if you don't want to at least try the free games I mentioned and you do want to spend money still. This game is most definitely an option. To sum it up: Same price as Fight The Dragon but probably better.In Conclusion:Look up any and all of these Games and if you are truly looking for the same elements I sought after, you will not be disappointed. And if you are, you will be even more disappointed by buying Fight The Dragon. I release this review to help people like me get the best game possible for them and their friends. Good luck all and have a great day! After all you are on Steam! :)			"

												I decided to rewrite my review of FTG, being that the negitive reviews frustrate me. This is, to me, an absolutely great game with a huge amount of replay value. Get some friends on and get ready for a pretty good few hours. The negitive reviews that I saw were written by people who had less than an hour spent playing this game. To me, thats pretty bs to claim that its all grinding, and that the combat sucks. Ive played this game since pre-alpha and have watched it turn into something awesome, with map creation getting better every update. While its not the best rpg out there, for the price and enjoyment I got out of it, it was definitly worth the full price of 14.99.			"

												So, me and my FOUR year old picked it up (I needed something decently ""kid-friendly"" with LOCAL Coop and Controller support).TL;DR: Not 100% Coop. Very misleading. As you cannot fight the dragon with anyone else.Pros: Loot system, easy combat system, plenty of adventures, there's a dragon you can chip away at for awhileCons: The too easy combat system, TOO many crappy/unbalanced (especially some of the ""easy"") adventures, you can't take anyone with you to fight the dragon. Gold has no use at all other than donating (so why even bother having in the game? Not very meaningful gameplay there)I really think that if they just had some other use for the gold, and allowed coop for the dragon, and cleaned up the combat system, this would be an easy 90%+/Gold game if everything had some meaning. Otherwise, me and my four year old enjoy running around pointlessly and killing things together...Good luck on Pacman, hope that you learn from your mistakes on this one. "

												Played this game for a couple hours. First off, the idea is cool. Have players make levels for you to complete, you run through them, get tons of loot, ""craft"" new loot, rinse and repeat.What actually happens is people put out broken levels, that wont work and then you get stuck on one for 30 mins, and if you dont complete the level, you get nothing from it. All experience, loot, etc you gained, gone. So needless to say this game got old and overly frustrating much faster then I though, and I stopped playing. So don't buy this game until it is either polished to be playable.			"

												I bought this game for myself and some friends because I thought it would be a lovely, quirky game to play. So far I have been nothing but frustrated by the gameplay. Don't get me wrong, it isn't all bad and I do enjoy it. I just find the levels so difficult to complete that it takes the fun out of it for me. The drop items are quite fun, but unless you play a higher difficulty they are crap. The enemies are well animated and create a diverse and dynamic game, unless you play at anything over the easiest difficulty then you get swarmed and die, a lot. There is a good online element as you can play senerios that other members have created, which can result in some interesting storylines. However the game is so difficult to complete that I just cried and now have no energy to try again.Play it if you enjoy a challenge and can actually overcome it. Don't play if you have any tendency to rage quit like I do.			"

												This game had a lot of potential and when I saw it during a sale I thought why not. I bought the 4-pack for me and my friends for about 8 USD, and found the fighting aspect of it was pretty terrible. I have not tried the building aspect of it and may try to just to see what it is like but the battle mechanics are just too easy. The controls are mediocre and it just feels like you're playing a game for children. I will say there are a few things that I can give for it is the art style of the environment. It looks really nice and the textures for the levels made by people look finished and nice. But the character models seem a bit stolen from Roblox. Lastly, if you have a friend or more playing with you the game will be so increasingly easy that you will not die.			"

Early Access Review
								Interesting game. To my oppinion it's too focused on player generated content, which isnoticable when playing a map. The gameplay is bad to my oppinion. It feels like its made for a controller instead of mouse and keyboard.You can play a dungeon master however and create scenarios for other players to play and rate.Being in early access, it still requires a lot of work. You can't make a campaign yet. And claiming to give you a sort of DnD experience, it will have to improve to achieve this.They do have a good mapping rule system.A user cannot create content for more than 7000 points (at this moment).Other than that, there are rules about monsters and reaching the finish.This is further fortified by the fact that the designer has to complete his/her map at least once before publishing!However this could bite the concept in the♥♥♥♥♥if big over-arching campaigns will be made possible.Pros:- Promising concept- Campaign in the future- Maps get rated- High customizability in mapsCons:- Bad gameplay- Shallow at this moment- unintuitive editorI do suggest to eventually get it, however at this moment it is a gem in the making.

The hit boxes on all the enemies is just so bad I had to quit half way through the second dungeon I went into.  They can attack you straight on while you slash away, but only the enemies do damage.  You occasionally can get a hit but definitly needs fixed.			"

												More of a kids game than anything an adult would want to play. Combat and controls are console like, simplistic and dull...I tried to enjoy it but it was so boring and the content was dull..If the content was harder and the controls better it could be a good game but it misses the mark... Unfortunately :/			"

								This game?  Pretty terrible as of 11/9/2014Developer is snobby and has an extremely narrow view for how he wants the game to be, in spite of it being a game that relies on player-generated content.  Such douchery.  Read a bit in the community discussion and you will see he is very two-sided and arrogant.  Don't give your money on a whim, wait and see if the finished product has more potential.The combat is extremely dry, sluggish, and requires less skill and more button mashing and potion consuming.World creation is very constricting, thus turning a game that people should be able to play the way they want to into a game that might has well have been fully created by the devs.UI/inventory management needs work.  The minimal look of the UI is awesome, but the functionality of it is lacking.Art style leaves much to be desired.  I understand this is highly subjective, but it just seems uninspired.			"

Early Access Review
								A potentially interesting hack and slash where you can use the included editor to create new content.Positives* I like the editablility.* Graphically the style is nice, although seems to be inconsistent on whether it is supposed to be cartoony or realistic.* Has single player and can supposedly be played offline (i haven't confirmed).* Good that levels are short so you don't get stuck being unable to save. Although, would be nice if you could save outside of levels (doesn't seem possible).* Got better once my character upgraded. Initially it was very tough going. I assume this is tuning that needs to be done as part of the early access.Negatives* Game seems very slow. My computer can run Just Cause 2 and Skyrim at high resolution very smoothly and this game is really laggy at the average settings to the point of giving me a headache.* The controls are not very tight at all. There are long delays while attacking, no indication if you are ""selecting"" the monster as you try to attack which leads to a lot of misses (or being low level I am suppose to miss a lot, hard to tell), and the jump mechanic could use some work.* The content is very sparse. They seem to be entirely counting on users creating most of it.* The UI is bewildering and the style doesn't match the theme of the game at all. Little things like Esc not exiting out of inventory or back up a level (you have hit tab again like TV menus), somethings can only be done in certain situations or at special locations like checking your inventory. Took me a while to figure out that the box with a number and a flashing plus was stat increases but that you have to click on the individual stas to upgrade them.* Thief doesn't start with a crossbow/bow? Seems wierd if they are going for the guantlet feel. Also, the loot drops seem to be giving me weapons for a fighter (swords, axes). I was only able to get a crossbow from the loot shrine.* Difficulty ratings are ocassionally wrong, even in the official maps. The Ice pass is definitely not ""medium"" having beaten several official ""extreme"" levels. * Bugs, i think? Somewhat expected with an early access game, but simple things like having a strength of 1+1 (+1 due to item boost) doesn't let you equip a weapon that requires a strength of 2.Overall not great based on the cost compared to other games at the same price point. That is somewhat expected with an early access game, but the developers keep talking about how playable it is, so ... I can't really recommend the game at this time. Perhaps as it matures it will get better.			"

Early Access Review
								[After having trouble getting started, the developers got involved (in Steam community, I like it) and helped me out. Turns out the issue was the user and not the programming, sorry. Maybe that information should have been made more public? In my defense, many Linux ports are just broken, it's getting tiresome, luckily devs were on the case or I might have missed this indie gem!]Experience on Linux:+ Works.+ High developer interaction, even in Steam community. Good!+ This IS indeed the way to showcase a new game under development on Linux.The game:As expected in early access, a few key features are missing regarding controls, but it seems the devs are keen on making this a good game so we may see lots of polishing up in the near future.The game itself isn't what top end console gamers would consider good looking, but I like the artstyle. It reminds me of Egoboo (obscure title) and has that adventure feeling Neverwinter Nights used to offer. This game also has a top down platformer mechanic, much like some Zelda titles, but combines it with deeper RPG elements that we are all familiar with (XP, levels, character development, items, etc). The music is very good, it sets the tone of the game perfectly.All in all, the game delivers on every point of my expectations. If you like adventure, magic, treasure and dragons, this is your buy. Oh, it also has the number one RPG enemy: rats!Score:3/5 (still early access, with all the features in place I bet this will be a high 4 or even a 5)			"

												I bought this game during the Steam Summer Sale, figuring if I didn't like it I didn't spend too much money on it.I fired it up and played a little while, figuring out the combat and loot system, as well as trying out the random and player-made adventures.  The next thing I know, 6 hours had passed and I still wanted to play more!THIS GAME IS FREAKING AWESOME!Fight the Dragon is an action hack-n-slash RPG, but one like no other you've ever played.  Sure, you get stat upgrades, tons of loot, and you fight strange mystical creatures.  FtD, however, has something I've yet to see in any other game - player made adventures!  Thousands of them, too, for hours upon endless hours of replayability!  Add to that the four unique character classes, and you're getting far more than your money's worth from this title.My personal rating?  The graphics have a cute charm to them, and while the controls can be a bit slow or clunky at times, they're very manageable.  The gameplay and replayabiolity is where this title truly shines, however.  I can see myself sinking 100's of hours into this one, and maybe even creating a few adventures of my own!  9/10  This game is PURE GOLD and worth every penny (and then some)!  Pick it up - I promise you won't regret it.			"

TL;DR+15(GOOD) / -119(Noooot worth it) - would you buy this?:::::::::::""EDIT : DEVELOPER MADE CONTACT , GET ME THE PRESIDENT !"":::::::::::Hehe, true, Seon. But I want moooore~I know it's asking a lot.. but that's what some people do.A lot. A lot. A lot. But not too much, that would make it confusing. Well, maybe even just a tiny bit would be enough for me, that is; if it is to be a very simple game. But then; we might expect it to be ingenius - which is harder to accomplish. Anyway, I really liked the idea of the game (because I like dungeon crawlers 'n♥♥♥♥♥♥, but the result up 'till now is less than attractive. This is more, but still just a review which holds little weight. I want to see more intricate adventures.. more exciting adversaries.. and definetaly more boobs. No, I jest.. boobs are for babies, everyone knows that (so what are you doing with that cow milk, sur?). (/w TL;DR a bump below)Asking players to develope your missions, our missions, is demanding of us that we create a community of creative interaction.. we need tools for this, good tools, quality tools. Like, for instance in-game forums and chats (private and chatrooms) to play more socially, create more socially. Why? Because even if this can be played solo, you don't want to play solo at all if you're a ""maker of maps"" (yes, titles should also be awarded!). The logic behind this is simply that you make maps for others to play them (which means you have humans and no AI's in your mind while painting)! - <b> TL;DR :: Give players a method of finding Allies (other than seeking a dungeon party). Friendlists / Guilds / Factions / Global Chat etc. </b>:::I hope it atleast sparks some interest in these developers, 'cuz I love myself very much and that would be awesome:::I bought 3 or 4 copies of this game, I think.. and when I show it to people they cringe, seriously.The fact that you can get different abilities (right button) with weapons is great, but there needs be a few more ""chance on hit"" things to force happiness. There also needs to be other joys than the mundane farming and crawling. I am saying that there should be more abilities that boasts a lot of ""wow"" (not the game), and more of a intelligent dungeoncrawler gameplay. There needs to be variations unknown, more patterns to crack and more playstyles to adapt to, with occasional highlights of some kind.I like the idea of having super hard maps which in the end give you something really special and valuable - achievement / title / unlockable. Why? Why ask why? Should you really why my why? Why would you even why that?Like more bosses than the dragon, pal. Pal, I already requested this.Some chain stories that you can follow would also be nice - with an end reward. F.ex:You may create chain missions through the map maker - allowing you to chain many dungeons with eachother, summarizing the points of them at the last level (or last played level with the option of taking a lesser reward early - for the impatient). In the ""quest/mission selection screen"" (picking levels) you may follow a chain quest by some simple means. At the end of this event, or when you choose to give in, a chest of some sort appears at your home/base/whatever - or a random evil muppet takes your candy (boss fight!) and leaves you with a princess (you don't need boobs - ""where's my kale chips, muppet!?"") and so you chase it.There are so many things that  should be done - but what the maker makes of this game, only Psyduck and future players can tell._______________END TRANSMISSION_________________:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Psst;I mean, I have a lot of ideas, simple and perhaps contradictionary to what the developers are trying to accomplish here - but alas, I have no influence in these matters anyway, so I might aswell influence those who wish to buy the game.

Early Access Review
								I have been playing games since i was old enough to hold a controller and this is the first negative review i have ever written. This game is absolutely not worth $15, the graphics are actually worse than runescape back when it was 2d. The limited monsters are repetitive and the entire strategy of the 10 or so levels i played was pull as many monsters as possible and spam abilities, run around until stamina regenerated and then respam abilities. Items didn't even feel like they were worth picking up and as long as you can run in circles and right click you can beat almost all scenarios. The two available classes shared abilities and it didn't really feel like there was very much thought or diversity put into them. I would seriously recommend waiting or just never buying this game unless a winter sale puts it up for $1.99.			"

												It's a nice little ARPG that focuses on user-made maps, and there are some really good ones... as well as really bad ones. You start in your central hub where you can create custom maps, pick and customize your character, change skills, sell loot to obtain various rewards, choose an adventure to embark on either solo or co-op, or have a go at fighting the dragon for special gear.For me the biggest chunk of fun i got out of the game was the editor. Think of it like Portal 2's in-game editor, it's simple, intuitive and user-friendly, if somewhat limited in certain aspects such as enemy variety.The only real problem i have with this game is it doesn't get updated often. Even just adding more content to the editor would go a long way to making the game feel larger and richer to both mapmakers and players.I recommend this to the more casual ARPG fans, and even more so to anyone who likes being a mapmaker without having to deal with overly complex editors.

												This game is a lot of fun. It's one of those games that I'll play for hours on end, then stop for a few months only to pick it back up again to explore the new content. I'm enjoying the progress that the developers are making, and definitely recommend this for anyone that enjoys/enjoyed games like Gauntlet.I also highly recommend using their adventure creator. It's a lot of fun, very intuitive, and simple to use regardless of your personal experience with design. You can make extremely simple adventures or go for something more complicated - whatever suits your fancy.My only qualm is with the overall content of the game. Would love to see some additional assets for adventure creation, including monsters, props, textures, environments, skyboxes, etc. There's a lot that could be expanded upon here, and I'm sure that they'll keep adding features to make adventures more exciting to play - and to create!

												So let me start off by saying when I first started playing, I actually had my doubts about the game. I kept dieing, kept getting loot I couldn't use due to class or level etc. Was driving me nuts. So I farmed a little on the beginner levels then went looking for other *easy* levels to enjoy. I like how the community is the one to create a majority of the content. Keeps it fresh and there are some extrodinary levels to play. Havent really found a *bad* one yet, just some i liked a lot more than others. Even attempted my own creation and while short, was still fun to make and play it. If you're struggling at first, give it a little time and it does get better with some gear and levels.			"

Truth is, I just do not.The game works pretty well, and you can even use the editor with just a gamepad.  The combat is only okay.  There has always been something about it that just feels stiff..I guess I shouldn't complain, I got my money's worth in play time.  The funnest part is using the editor.  I made one level and published it that took quite awhile, but I didn't want to make another one because there aren't enough assets to make it very different.So that's the overall problem.  Each level feels the same because they all draw from the same small pool of assets.  For example the game only has about 20 monsters or so. Quite a while back the devs said they agreed with this and planned to add lots of stuff but they never did.  The workshop could be a solution to this, but it isn;t because you can only skin your own character, that's it.They continue to to update the game a little bit here and there, but I think they consider it mostly finished.  It's not all bad I just wish that the time I took to learn making my own edventure could be rewarded with inspiration to use it more and create many more levels.  I feel like I wasted my time with it and hope to save some others from maybe doing the same.I think the 10-13 age group could maybe like it a lot.  Hard to say, the learning curve is a bit high with the editor.  It never really caught on for my 10 year old either.			"

												This game has a lot of potential. The levels made by 3 sprockets are pretty fun, but the rest of the community levels are hit or miss.The biggest problem I have with the game is the clunkiness of the combat. It feels like the enemies are hard to hit. I often miss when it looks like it should hit, which becomes very frustrating. This issue, combined with the poor placement of checkpoints in many user made maps made the game feel like a chore.			"

Its so funny and amazing! Also a suggestion. You should add PETS! PETS PETS PETS! That would make the game 10x better! But still a super fun and fantastic game!			"

												So, me and my FOUR year old picked it up (I needed something decently ""kid-friendly"" with LOCAL Coop and Controller support).TL;DR: Not 100% Coop. Very misleading. As you cannot fight the dragon with anyone else.Pros: Loot system, easy combat system, plenty of adventures, there's a dragon you can chip away at for awhileCons: The too easy combat system, TOO many crappy/unbalanced (especially some of the ""easy"") adventures, you can't take anyone with you to fight the dragon. Gold has no use at all other than donating (so why even bother having in the game? Not very meaningful gameplay there)I really think that if they just had some other use for the gold, and allowed coop for the dragon, and cleaned up the combat system, this would be an easy 90%+/Gold game if everything had some meaning. Otherwise, me and my four year old enjoy running around pointlessly and killing things together...Good luck on Pacman, hope that you learn from your mistakes on this one. "

												Fantastic game. Been looking for something like this for a long time. It's a hack and slash, but you can also go (ice or fire) mage or rogue (range or daggers). Maps are made by users and are of very good quality usually. There's a rating system, so it should get better over time.However, since the beginning they never fixed the main problems. Controls, poor vision, auto-pickup not working properly and most of all the Crossbow doesn't work properly and it's my favorite weapon.If you start shooting while standing still it has normal rate of fire. Usually. If you shoot while moving it takes a step, takes a shot, takes a step, takes a shot etc. This gives you less DPS. You have to stop attacking, wait a sec, stop walking too and then fire again to get it to work properly.This makes for a very awkward experience which they should have fixed by now.So for this reason I can't recommend it.(And anóther thing. The Xbox 360 controller is supported, but you can't properly aim anymore. Also you can't strafe. Playing with a controller is like playing Hammerwatch. Run away, turn around with same stick thén you can shoot the monsters that are chasing you. This isn't very hard it's just extremely awkward and slower. And no strafing? Come on!)			"

												This game is a lot of fun. It's one of those games that I'll play for hours on end, then stop for a few months only to pick it back up again to explore the new content. I'm enjoying the progress that the developers are making, and definitely recommend this for anyone that enjoys/enjoyed games like Gauntlet.I also highly recommend using their adventure creator. It's a lot of fun, very intuitive, and simple to use regardless of your personal experience with design. You can make extremely simple adventures or go for something more complicated - whatever suits your fancy.My only qualm is with the overall content of the game. Would love to see some additional assets for adventure creation, including monsters, props, textures, environments, skyboxes, etc. There's a lot that could be expanded upon here, and I'm sure that they'll keep adding features to make adventures more exciting to play - and to create!

												It's a nice little ARPG that focuses on user-made maps, and there are some really good ones... as well as really bad ones. You start in your central hub where you can create custom maps, pick and customize your character, change skills, sell loot to obtain various rewards, choose an adventure to embark on either solo or co-op, or have a go at fighting the dragon for special gear.For me the biggest chunk of fun i got out of the game was the editor. Think of it like Portal 2's in-game editor, it's simple, intuitive and user-friendly, if somewhat limited in certain aspects such as enemy variety.The only real problem i have with this game is it doesn't get updated often. Even just adding more content to the editor would go a long way to making the game feel larger and richer to both mapmakers and players.I recommend this to the more casual ARPG fans, and even more so to anyone who likes being a mapmaker without having to deal with overly complex editors.

												Fight the Dragon is a pretty charming game.  With four classes and countless player-made levels, it offers a lot of replayability.  After getting all four classes to level 60, I have still yet to ""Fight the Dragon"" more than a few times. And that's one of the great things about this game, you can really play it how you want. The level editor is shockingly good and in-depth. You can make anything from a simple arena with waves of mobs or recreate your favorite D&D scenario.  My first day I stumbled upon a recreation of Diablo III Act I, the story and all. It was amazing! You could really tell the creator spent a lot of time working on it, and it was damn fun.  I have quite a few favorites that I revisit because they are so well made.  I was looking for a hack n slash style game with a light hearted feel and not so dark for a change. To be honest this fit the bill better than I could have ever imagined. Fight the Dragon was worth every cent of $15.			"

												This game is quite a lot of fun!  It does indeed feel like a mashup of Diablo and Little Big Planet.EditorThe shining star for me is the ACK, the tools that let you create adventures. While there are plenty of tool here to make a fullout adventure and even campaign, the basics of the tools allow one to create, more or less, a dungeon.I'm impressed, certainly, by the ease-of-use of the tools.  I'm sure I'm not the only one among us, but very rarely do I read tutorials or hints and tips before using a toolset such as a level editor.  For me, I generally only retreat to tutorials if I can't figure out how to do something that I'm trying to do.  All that to say, I've not needed to look at pretty much any documentation to use these tools, they are that simple to use.  (I am a programmer by trade, though.)I sort of wish that there were some sort of an option to intentionally ""complicate"" the editor in order to get a little more mileage in terms of efficiency and final product quality, but I completely understand some of the design decisions that were made.GameplayAs far as gameplay goes, it's solid.  It's nothing groundbreaking, but it's nothing to complain about.  If you like ARPGs, then you'll probably like this one.  The only things I've taken note of are the predictable and exploitable AI and a probable class imbalance (There are four classes).The loot shrine is a genius idea.  for those that don't have the game, the loot shrine is basically a place where you can ""sell"" items and donate gold.  The more accrued value you accumulate, the better the item and rewards you get when you finally cash-in.  It gives you a mostly random output, with the player having a small amount of choice in what their reward is.Another unique aspect of this game is the dragon.  He's a really tough enemy which, I'm assuming, drops some of the best loot.  You get loot at certain milestones of health you take away from the dragon.  You can only fight the dragon, though, if you have enough tokens (Dragon Scrolls).  Each Dragon Scroll gives you a certain number of attempts to Fight the Dragon.I've not dabbled too much in fighting the dragon because I'm still fairly new and he stomps me...Other ThoughtsAs a plus, the developers and community seem quite helpful (see comments in this review) and responsive.  There were a few bugs (and a mistake on my part) that have both recently been addressed and corrected with goodwill and no malice, despite my (then) stated disappointment.  That being said, there are likely more bugs, but as of now I don't know of any that I've come across that haven't been fixed.  You'll likely not find anything gamebreaking, just things that might irk you.I sincerely hope the developers will work on a sequel and are able to take what they learned from this game to make a spectacular new game, although not in any sort of a hurry as this game still certainly has mileage left.  Sort of like LBP, which is a sited inspiration on the store page.  The first LBP was great, but had some kinks.  LBP2 seemed to work most of the little kinks and bugs out and was an excellent builder in nearly every right.TL;DR  Great adventure editor, easy to use.  Pretty good gameplay.  Possible occasional bugs.			"

												A nice and brand new genre for me. Create your own adventure and let everyone play it!Recommended for those who love loot.Too few characters though, and there're plenty o bugs like dead body collision and such.And why hasn't it updated for so long?QAQ			"

Early Access Review
								My initial review was negative. I still think that combat is very basic that goes for both enemy and the player. Not much content, slow and daunting character progression and very limited character customisation ( luckily there is Steam Workshop ). Map editor has lots of limitations and not much variety. Camera feels too far away at times and there is no way to zoom in. So when it's all said and done why do I recommend it?-Dev's keep on adding new content.-You can create your own maps and character heads/bodies ( if you know how )-Combat even though is basic but at the same time its enjoyable. -You can play it with up to 4 players-Map editor is a blast!

												It's a fun RPG isometric game.The main objective of the game is to play and share adventures made by the players, and level up to face the dragon (the dragon is not really that important to defeat, he is a final objective but he will reward you with good loot, but you can get it also in the stages)It has simple mechanics and good game mechanics, the editor is not so intuitive so you will need to check out tutorials on how to build your own stage and specially how to make switches and traps work correctly.The bad? It seems little to no players play coop anymore (even though there is an active map creating community) and the enemy variety is very small. The graphics are also not the best, and some of the maps can have sections that are easily bugged.I would recommend specially if you have someone at home to play split screen with, or if you like creating your own quests to share with others.

												So let me start off by saying when I first started playing, I actually had my doubts about the game. I kept dieing, kept getting loot I couldn't use due to class or level etc. Was driving me nuts. So I farmed a little on the beginner levels then went looking for other *easy* levels to enjoy. I like how the community is the one to create a majority of the content. Keeps it fresh and there are some extrodinary levels to play. Havent really found a *bad* one yet, just some i liked a lot more than others. Even attempted my own creation and while short, was still fun to make and play it. If you're struggling at first, give it a little time and it does get better with some gear and levels.			"

												Great game with cool mechanics. The only criticism I have is that the controls are not the best. I use the mouse controls, and I understand they are not complete yet, but it still sucks when you die because of your mouse. Other than this I don't see many flaws, the combat system is fun, the dungeons are great, and the multiplayer is great. You have tons of easy to access character customization with the steam workshop, and I find the lack of DLC refreshing. I hope that the game still gets more updates, as the items seem a little bit bland as of now, but other than this the game is certainly worth 16.99!!!			"

												Great game to play with a friend / loved one. Disappointed with the developers attitude on adding features they think are useless or add no value even though the players have asked. Get the feeling they wanted nothing to do with the game after they finished it.Not a recommend if you're planning on solo play or internet multiplayer.			"

												There is a lot to like about this game, but it's a bit too grindy.You can make your own adventures and quests with a level editor, which is very nice. There are many player-made adventures to play through, which adds to the gameplay content. Some of these adventures are not that great and for one achievement you need to do 500 adventures... which is a bit too much because you've experienced much of what the game has offered at around the 200 mark.This brings me to the point about grinding - leveling up is very slow. Even with a few XP modifiers on your items it takes many adventures to level up once. Monsters give anywhere between a few XP to 36ish XP at around level 19 while you need about 2000 and said monsters have high health (needing up to 70+ shuriken hits each when there are many at once). Indeed, in many adventures the enemies come in too big quantities and have too much health. They have to be kited for a good while and when the two things (xp and kiting) are combined you get this tedious leveling system. Many of the weapons have so low range that only certain ranged weapon and long range melee weapons can perform well. For example, using daggers on moving enemies causes you to miss if you try to attack them from behind and axes only tend to hit one target for average damage when you could be using a hammer for AoE and higher single target DPS. Axes have the advantage of being able to use a shield, but using a shield is almost useless when enemies follow the first enemy they see, you can roll to evade and the shield is destroyed rather quickly.The class abilities are fine, I guess. Each class feels different and the game is fun to play in local or online co-op (online multiplayer is almost dead).Almost forgot - the game's soundtrack is pretty good, but the dragon boss fight is extremely disappointing. You can't properly evade its almost instant attacks and have to try again...100+ times.I would recommend the game as something to play in local co-op for a good while. 8/10			"
