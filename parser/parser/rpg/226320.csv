												TL;DR version: Movement changes ruined the gameplay with wind-ups, cooldowns and charges. Also becoming less F2P friendly, heading in P2W direction.A once wonderful game designed by Mr. David Brevik, the creator of Diablo and Diablo 2. But guess what? He's gone. Along with two of the other leading game designers. Now the game is taking a much worse direction. People in charge now once worked at EA and Activision. Needless to say, that direction is down.A game destroying update on January 19th, 2017 (after TWO MONTHS worth of testing and negative feedback...) makes the game 67% less fun by limiting dashes & teleports, top move speed and forcing travel powers to have a wind up. Movement based heroes are entirely crippled and it takes too long to get anywhere. Not to mention entirely lore breaking when any big ol' sluggish hero is as fast as Spider-Man, when Deadpool rides his vespa scooter at the same speed that's supposed to be represented by Captain Marvel's supersonic flight, when Black Panther has no chance to run down Bucky because they're the same, slow and limted speed now. (And NO they weren't the same speed before, they were the same base speed but individual heroes got bonuses from items and previously by having a higher a speed stat, both things are gone.) The game is barely playable in this state. Summon builds were also screwed up. Along with a gear overhaul making sure you have to partially regear most of your heroes. Despite overwhelming NEGATIVE feedback telling them to NOT do this, they've done it anyway. For the ""health"" of the game. Apparently losing players is healthy. In truth it's likely for the consolization of the game. (Consosle port confirmed on April 5th.) Which would be fine if they weren't killing what already makes it good. If you want a slow, plodding and tedious game, this is for you! If you want an ACTIONRPG go play Grim Dawn or Path of Exile (which is where David Brevik went btw, also coming to consoles!) because the action part of ""ARPG"" is gone here.And no, it's not about running to the boss and avoiding content, you can still do that. It just takes longer to do. The problem is the very act of moving is now bad, in turn making the game bad when the most basic action you can take doesn't feel good.Along with the slow, sluggish movement also gone are multiple skill bars. You're now limited to 8 buttons. For some heroes this made little or no difference. Others such as Dr. Strange who benefited from having skills on cooldown or Iron Fist who has a stance switching mechcanic or any summoner that now has to use their limited 8 slots on slotting a summon suffer greatly from this. They all have less active skills available. To clarify, not just the bars but the buttons too. You never had to juggle bars. You just had to assign the buttons to the seperate bar.Story mode's once wide open areas and large maps have been re-done and cut into smaller sections. Did you want less area to play in, less enemies to defeat and more load screens? Well good news! But you probably didn't want any of that.The Omega System was replaced by an Infinity System.From having hundreds, if not thousands of options to about 50, most of which aren't even really options. Omega points converted but the problem is now points are split. Your 10k omega points only give you about 180-190 in each catagorey. Stats themself were overhauled so all those +1 fighting challenge bonuses you spent your hard earned tokens on or hours finding are now probably worthless. Another example being mental heroes having their benefit go from energy to intelligence. So all that +energy gear you had has to be swapped out for +int.The recipe for exchanging uniques for credits was removed too so when all this unbinding and regearing comes out of your pocket, good luck building it up again. In addition now introducing cosmic versions of artifacts. Making current artifacts even more out of date and introducing more RNG.RIF/SIF boosts were replaced by SSB (SHIELD supply boost, formerly ""BIF"" for bonus item find) and you can only get SSB from potions you buy with real money, as opposed to the near endless supply of RIF/SIF bars that come from the MK1 fortune cards that are purchasable with in-game currency. This just wouldn't have been complete without nerfing the loot, which they confirmed they did on February 2nd. A stealth nerf at that as part of this game killing update. The timer on the remaining free XP and credit find bars from fortune cards have been cut in half, down to 30 minutes from an hour.In addition the once free prestige costumes that could be put into a blender to get a random costume for free will be removed soon making sure you have to spend money to get what you want because the 1 in 300-400 something chance was already too much I guess.Shortly following that on Feb. 7th it was announced story mode XP will be getting cut by 2/3 while at level 60. Infinity gains were already poor compared to omega and this is another effort to get you spending money.Also gone are the Eternity Splinters as rewards from boxes, daily login gifts and rewards for story mode.You now need 50 team-ups to get the best of your team-ups with the new team-up synergy system which grants your team-up 2% more damage for every team-up you have up to 50. In tandem with less Splinters being available, well you can figure it out.The free hero unlock after completing the tutorial for new players has been removed. You now get 400 splinters at the end, this means you can no longer unlock a 600 splinter hero (Spider-Man, Iron Man, Dr. Strange, Deadpool and a few others) your first day. New players used to be able to pick ANY HERO on day one, then get 400 splinters on day 2. A 1000 splinter value! Now you get 400 splinters at the end of the tutorial and 200 after 7 days. Sure, you COULD do nothing but login for 7 days to get a 600 starter but you're still out the second 400 splinters.It was fun while it lasted but in the words of Bob Dylan ""it's all over now baby blue"".(I reposted this after my initial review from November was downvoted by fanboys claiming ""It's only test center"" but now that it's the actual game it looks like this is more agreeable. NO CHANGES WERE MADE IN REGARDS TO COMPLAINTS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW, everything they did to make the game bad in November is still there in the live patch in January, in fact it got even worse. In other words...I told you so.)Abusive/rude/name calling comments, especially those using explicit language will be reported and deleted. Classy as always MH community! I graciously left one there who linked his comment to reddit. You can see for yourself an outstanding representive of the community. Also you should probably read the previous comments before commenting on things that were already addressed. You can see a decent portion of positive reviews resorting to immature name calling of anyone that doesn't like the changes and that's not the only place. This is the pro side ladies and gentlemen, this is the side that doesn't mind the changes/will keep playing. Immaturely attack anyone that disagrees with them. The other thing you'll constantly see along with ""butthurt"", ""childish"" and ""health of the game"" (developer rehtoric given as the reason for the changes) is ""knee-jerk reaction"", though again, this was available almost every week for TWO MONTHS on test. On a side note I had chat turned off in game since May of 2015 until I uninstalled it in January of 2017.			"

												A lot of negative reviews are getting jumped on so I wanted to summarise why people are so angry/disappointed in this game.Firstly, a total gear reset is happening. They're adding new tiers of artifacts, new slot 1-5 gear, new costume cores - pretty much the only items you won't replace are legendaries, insignias and rings. This has been justified by Asros as ""all mmo's do gear resets, this is normal"".Here's the problem: When other MMO's do this, they also introduce new content in which to obtain said gear. We have been waiting for any new zones/terminals/raids for a LONG time. for the past two years the devs have spent the majority of their time doing ""52 reviews"", a series of balancing patches for each individual hero. They stated once these were done, and every hero was on a level playing field, they would release raid content because then everyone could take part.This has not happened. Instead they finished their 52 reviews in early 2016 and then spent most of this year working on a secret ""biggest update ever"" which completely tore all these reviews apart and left a mishmash of bugs and power inconsistencies that has rendered 75% of the heroes significantly weaker, and far behind the few that are viable for endgame content. It's been a month since they've done this and they've only just announced that they're fixing 1 of the 40ish heroes that they have broken. So do we have to wait another 40 months for a new raid while they go back and re-review the mess they've made?When the ""Biggest systems update ever"" happened - we were left with exactly the same content/zones as before, but now they changed several heroes archetypes, changed the actual function of several artifacts, and didn't offer any free unbinds so that you could fix everybodies gear. If (like myself) you had made the effort to gear up all 50+ heroes prior to this, you're now left with a roster totally equipped with the wrong items, and if you didn't hoard credit chests (which have now been removed) - you can expect to farm credits for a couple of hours for every single hero you want to unbind items for (or you can buy matrix of unbinding from the cash shop for 50 cents each, so a few dollars per hero).So now we've been informed this week that even if we spent time/money unbinding these artifacts, it doesn't really matter because now they're releasing a higher tier of cosmic artifacts, which have somehow been shoehorned in before omega items. This has completely removed any motivation for people to play the game. You can farm the same old content for the same old items but when they actually manage to release these new items, which will also be farmed in the same old content, anything we have now will be rendered inferior. Why would we play a game knowing full well the items we're recieving are imminently useless, and the new items will be farmed from the exact same content that we're farming now?The ultimate insult to the PC playerbase is that these changes have been justified as ""for the health of the game"" - when in reality, the changes have been made to facilitate a conversion to a console game. The game is slower, the items are simpler, the customisation has gone, visuals such as size increase were removed with no compensation, and cash shop boosts have been simplified all for this one aim: To make the game viable for console release. Devs on the forum have let slip that they're doing this leading to massive censorship and damage control, but at this point we all know it's happening. It's in the game code, models have been designed for PS4, and some of the design changes are glaringly obvious.The fact of the matter is the devs have been lying to the fanbase for years, making empty promises, delaying content, but this last year has been the ultimate kick in the teeth because they've spent the last year creating next to no new content while running a series of sales. This money that they have been taking from the PC players is being used to fund a console release at the expense of the quality of the game. It's greedy, it's dishonest, and it's frankly insulting that they can't be straightforward and tell their fans precisely what they're doing.			"

												Plenty of people post reviews and point out how many hours they've played or how much money they claimed to have spent on the game. Here's one from a guy who has spent nothing on it and only has 6 hours played.My kids played Super Hero Squad Online until they shut it down. They were bummed so I said ""Hey! Why don't you try this Marvel Heroes game? You're a bit young for it but let's give it a shot. I'll even try playing it with you guys.""We played it for awhile and they thought it was pretty fun. They started talking about it all the time and were excited when we would all play together.Then the update happened...We went to play and saw it had a huge update. They were sad but I was like ""Maybe your guys will get some cool new powers or something!"" Once again excited we waited for everybody to get updated.We started playing and my youngest says ""Where did all my points go?"" I said, ""Looks like you don't get to customize anything for awhile or something now, not really sure I understand.""My middle kid says,""Why am I moving so slowly?"" I say, ""I don't know buddy, my guy feels a bit sluggish too.""My oldest then turns around, looks at me and wimpers, ""My robot friends are gone..."" I look at his guy and I sadly state, ""You can't get them again until you level up some more I think.""Meanwhile I am trying to figure out why Deadpool is doing more dying than killing now. The kids quit and say, ""Sorry Daddy, we're gonna go play some Roblox together. This game is not any fun any more.""I silently agree with them and have no desire to try and figure out the new system and go back to playing Path of Exile.--------------------------------------@Sainguin Libras I appreciate your comments but you have missed my point. Personally I'm not invested in the game. I don't really care one way or another about it. Certainly not enough to write a review based on my opinion.However, I thought it worthwhile to post the thoughts of my kids. They have no ax to grind with the company. No powerful characters derived from abusing mechanics they can no longer take advantage of. Nothing other than the simple way a kid looks at a game, they either like it or they don't. My kids went from liking it to not liking it after the patch.They have gone back to playing Roblox. @Mr. Scruffle pointed out that Roblox is worse than Marvel. I wouldn't know as I don't play it but the kids seems to like it. They are 4, 6 and 8 so their tastes do vary quite a bit from a grown man though. I'm still not sure why @Mr. Scruffle felt the need to review Roblox but maybe that will help someone out if they were thinking of giving Roblox a try and were reading Marvel reviews.			"

												Full disclosure here, I've been in this game since alpha (through beta and launch) before it was even on Steam. I quit the game in early 2014 because it was a clustercluck of awful optimization, no end-game content, bland heroes and nonstop grind and I just couldn't take it anymore. The groundwork for a good game was there, and the developers were some of the coolest in the industry and they actually listened, but I just couldn't handle it anymore so I took a hiatus.I came back in 2015 and I am SO GLAD that I did. I knew the developers listened to it's community so I had high hopes, but they absolutely shattered my expectations for the game. Their ""52 reviews"" (where they rework older characters to stay on par with newer characters) has added a ton of depth to the bland older heroes, end-game content is still a bit off but they've added raids and are constantly adding more end-game material to play around with so there's actually content now. They have daily login rewards and multiple events every month to reward their playerbase, and most importantly they still listen to their community. The best comparison I can think of for this company would be early Riot games, before they started focusing on the LCS and drifted away from their community and playerbase.Anyways lets finish up this review, I was rambling a bit. Think of this game was a Diablo MMO that focuses more on playstyle diversity and playing a well-rounded roster of heroes than grinding out 1 character until he's a god. Graphics:Graphical fidelity is the weakest spot imo, it's really tough to see what's going on with so many flashy spells going on. You're basically forced to turn off the effects from other players, and even then on some heroes its nearly impossible to see what's going on. For example if you're playing Human Torch you literally light the entire ground in a giant blaze of fire and it becomes really hard to follow what's going on.Early Game Content: Early game content is very diverse, which makes leveling a breeze. Mondays you'll find yourself grinding out Midtown because every Monday they have an event where you get bonus loot and experience from Midtown, but they also have different types of challenge modes (never ending wave matches are one of the more popular, where each level you defeat increases the difficulty and rewards of the next level, and you go after floods of enemies until you die). Then there's also terminals and legendary quests which give upgraded rewards. Cannot complain about early game content at all.Late Game Content:It's not the best, but it's being actively worked on. Raids are really fun and require a lot of coordination to be pulled off if you're doing them in higher difficulties. I thought Raids would be really tough to pull off in this type of game but Gazillion did a great job. Late game is mediocre but improving.Characters:The characters are great, they spend a lot of time making the playstyle of each hero feel fluid and accurate to their comic book counterparts. As of now there's more than 40 characters to choose from, with each one having variable costumes from their different comic book appearances. (The new Age of Ultron Hulkbuster costume, for example, is SO sick). There's still a few outdated heroes that need their 52 review, but they're coming up. In the next couple months we can expect Thing, Cable and Deadpool to all be updated and brought up to par with newer heroes. Not much else to say here, you can check out their roster online, you're pretty much guaranteed to find characters you like or would enjoy playing.Cost:It's free to play, why would I talk about cost? Because this game is expensive if you want to play multiple characters. You get one starter hero for free and are able to unlock all heroes either by VERY RARE in game drops or by using an in-game currency known as Eternity Splinters to unlock them. The heroes go in tiers and cost either 200, 400, or 600 Splinters to unlock. Your login reward for your second day playing is 400 splinters so getting your first hero is an absolute breeze, but the drop rate for these is guaranteed and happens about once every 6-8 minutes, which means worst case it could take you from 26-53-80 hours of grinding to unlock 1 hero. Which is high, but it honestly does add up pretty quickly as time does seem to fly in this game. You'll want to use your 400 splinters from the login reward on your favorite hero, and then use the rest on random unlock tokens, which only cost 175 splinters and have an equal chance of giving you a 200, 400, or 600 splinter hero. not so bad.Overall:If you like both Marvel and ARPGs (dungeon crawlers)? Absolutely download this game right now and get into it, you'll love it.If you're impartial about Marvel but like ARPGs? You'll probably like this game, it's a fresh take on ARPGs and it's free, you should do yourself a favor and download the game and at least give it a shot.Dislike Marvel but like ARPGs? You can ignore the IP and play the game, at least download it and give it a shot, as said above its a fresh take on ARPGs by the makers of Diablo 2, arguably the best ARPG of all-time.Like Marvel but dislike ARPGs? I'd at least recommend trying it for 2 days, using your log-in reward on your favorite hero and giving it a shot that way, you may or may not get hooked.Dislike Marvel and ARPGs? You can probably avoid this game altogether, but downloading it and giving it a shot is free and couldn't hurt.Chances are if you've played it before and quit because you didn't like the state of the game it's probably much better than when you left, the devs listen and the game is constantly improving. Highly recommend at least giving it a shot.			"

												Updated Mar 4, 2017 based on patch 2.05. Aparently, the ""bug"" that stop high end gear dropping is still not fixed. We are hence encouraged to buy or grind for boosters to make up for it.I am one of those passionate veterans who have played this game since closed beta, March 2013. I have clocked in 1,500 played hours prior to playing via Steam so whatever you see in Steam, add that to it. I am a content contributor of this game in YouTube making guides and more for new players. I have also contributed around US$700 to this game. Would I recommend this game to new players? Sure. You will get a decent 20-40 hours of fun playing as one of the Marvel characters free. But would I recommend you to invest time and money into this game? Right now, it is a no. But I may change my view when things change.9 months of very little update promising a 'biggest update ever' for the fans, here are my views after this update is live. David Brevik the founder of Diablo has left Marvel Heroes and joined Path of Exile. The effect of his departure is certainly felt through this new update that is done by a new team. It is obvious that they are focusing on (1) expanding into console (simplfying the game) and (2) expanding player base. As a veteran, I feel that all my existing 59 heroes have regressed and we are being asked to farm almost everything again on the old content. This may not concern the new players. But remember, one day you will become veteran. To follow up on the above point, I feel that most of my dollar contribution is used to fund a vast part of the update that either (1) I don't care because I don't play console or (2) change a vast part of the game that I don't like. You may think this may not conern you. But one day, you too will become a paying customer. This game is heading towards a pay to play / pay for power model. Earning XP and in-game credit has become harder. Item farming may become slower since they have slowed down the game. Costume crafting may not be as easy as before. Many other things that point to the direction of pay to play. The pace of this game has slowed down a great deal and has become very clunky. In the genre of ARPG, you gain farm efficiency as you gear up and learn your hero. Now it is almost back to zero. In fact, with the new boosts that hit the store (patch 2.03), it is now become very clear why (1) we have to re-farm almost all the gears, (2) the game has slowed down so much, and (3) all the crafting recipes that in the past sped up gearing of alt heroes are gone. Because now, we have many good reasons to buy boosts in order to advance in the game like before. Also, as of patch 2.05, the ""bug"" that stop the high end gears that drop in an end game zone (challenge point) is still not fixed. The only way to earn is to buy or grind for in-store boosters. There is still no new content. Right after the biggest update that promised to update all the heroes, I have put in time to adapt to the new hero design. Some heroes immediately got another round of 'quality of life' update that in some instances, destroy build variety. This shows (1) that the biggest update wasn't ready (like many of us have raised prior to the launch) (2) and that there is a clear lack of vision and direction of where this game should go. If inventory management was an issue before, inventory management now is a total nightmare with the new items to think through and the old items to go through. I think it is to promote more stash sales. I am expected to swap gears and bear the cost of doing so among all my 59 heroes because they have changed the entire system. I have never seen any ARPG that does that. Loot drop and UI is still a mess. I can't even see what I am fighting. And I still can't see what the boss does in this game. They should have done something about UI in the update. If I want to play a D3 clone, I would play D3. And yes, Marvel Heroes in this 'biggest update ever' has attempted to copy Diablo 3. From paragon system to how gear is designed. Except, the copying wasn't that good. Instead of improving on the existing system, GAZ has decided to drop it completely and design a new one (or rather, copy from D3). But like all systems, GAZ would need time to improve and make them work. I hope they have thought of that before dropping what they had. Com'on Gazillion. Give us the veterans new content. A reason to play.Biggest letdown ever for me, for now. Sorry.My view may change though, if Marvel Heroes has become better.			"

												I recommend this game IF, and ONLY IF:1) You bring your own friends.2) You never contact customer support, or require help or moderation of any kind. At all.3) You are ok with boutique pricing.It's a fun game. They do a great job on the heroes. The roster is the highlight of this game, and depth and diversity of roster is what holds the Diablo clone that is Marvel Heroes together. That said, there are thirty-something heroes and maybe one and half heroes worth of content to play through, so there is a lot of repetition. Of course, repetition is the foundation of all video gaming, so, as usual, it's more a matter of finding a form of repetition you enjoy, as opposed to avoiding it, which is virtually impossible.The main problem here is the community, by which I mean both the devs and the players. The players are the most sycophantic group of white knights I've ever encountered online, which is really saying a lot. You'd think you were playing the game with the dev's spouses, as personally as they take any and all criticism of such a deeply flawed title. And there is a lot of legitimate criticism to be made of a game that was downright terrible a year ago, and still, in its new playable form, remains only one-quarter finished, at the most generous estimate. Mention that fact, or allude to it in any way, and prepare to be made pariah by Marvel's zealot based online community. Worse, you could ask a question, and reveal yourself to be someone who does not comb the Marvel Heroes forums for the information required to play the game. Only a lazy scumbag would expect a game to be explained in-game, without having to go look up patch notes after leaving Steam to sign in at a third party website, and the Marvel community enforces this type of summary judgement with a mixture of glee and zeal that would impress even the most jaded citizens of Ironforge. This is internet tribalism at its finest, and the resulting experience as a player, particularly a new player, is correspondingly atrocious.The devs and moderators, sadly, are far worse. Whether you're talking about the development team, or the moderators, poor communication is the hallmark of Gazillion Entertainment. Be prepared to do frequent out of game research, simply because the devs can't be bothered explaining even the simplest aspects of play in-game. And pray Yig will help you should you ever require assistance with anything, at any point, because the support department at Gaz certainly isn't going to help you. You will never be a good enough customer to even be treated like a customer, much less a good one.Which is almost fascinating, because Marvel Heroes can be quite expensive. New heroes cost $4.50, $9, or $13.50, depending (mostly) on how long they've been available. A single new costume for said hero can be anywhere from $4.50 to $14.50. It is painfully easy to spend $500 on this game, and claims of thousands spent are not uncommon. This is boutique pricing straight off Melrose in LA, but the whole thing is run by a group of people whose customer service skills would be considered unprofessional by Orange County swap meet standards. The true marvel here is that Marvel has left their multizillion dollar IP in the hands of people who don't just ignore their customers, but often seem to have a genuine dislike for them.Don't get me wrong. The game is fun to play.Just bring your own friends. And be prepared to throw down big money. At a business where the proprietors and other customers will bridge the entire spectrum between pointed disinterest and open hostility.			"

												Similar to: Diablo 2 and 3, Torchlight 1 and 2, Titan Quest, SacredFeels like: X-men Legends, Marvel Ultimate AllianceHow free to play is it?: 1 free hero from a limited list, all heroes can be purchased with in game currency if you're willing to grind. The only thing that is impossible to get for free is S.T.A.S.H. which is bank space. You'll want some, trust me.Pros: A ton of heroes for the fans, with more being added every month or two. Weekly events to boost leveling, access special loot, and sometimes even gear out a hero in a day. A good story mode the first time you go through it, raiding for organized groups, a few modes for random groups, and lots of solo content. The developers seem to be huge fans and always want to add more.Cons: Bugs, every fix seems to break something else. The game seems to have issues with certain hardware configurations regardless of how powerful the system is.Final thoughts: If you're a fan of Marvel, or Diablo style games you'll probably love this one. Totally free to try, so why not see what you think and how well it plays on your system.			"

												1,000 hours over 3 years and they just released their ""biggest update ever."" I have always admire or grew to like the changes they made to improve the experience in every update over the years. This update makes this feel more like a cookie cuter mobile game than a unique player experience it once was. Worst update ever. RIP.This update feels like it is to get a console version ready, so they completely screw over their long time PC players to make money off consoels and hinder our gameplay to make it more contorller only friendly? Never playing again and uninstalling. Not PC gamer friendly, only used us for testing and initial money making so they could launch this garbage to consoles. Im OK with console porting but not if your going to punish the PC players at the same time. choke on it Gaz.and to the person who said ""So making the movement abilites not spamable made the game feel like a moblie game?"" no , but losing all hotkey customization and power bars is. Gaz gave their ""reasons"" and I just dont beleive them. if you like them though, good, enjoy the game.			"

												I've put a lot of hours in to the game. Had a lot of fun until the new set of Devs decided to change things for the ""health of the game"" While there is stuff in their Biggest Update Ever that is good like the hero reworks, most of it is bad. First they are doing it in stages. Even though they have been planning this for most of last year they haven't set out much of a road map since their vague blogs that only got less informative as they went on. Any player that asks whats next and they give a line like ""Secret stuff"" or we have plans.  With a massive update this big they really should have all this layed out. Not give us the line that the next part (omega items) are still at the early phase when they said before it would follow right after the hero reworks. Instead they change HPs and damage without the coresponding parts. So currently we have a game thats is 1/3 of the way done with nothing new to do but grind out the same content that we have for years only slower.For a company that said they are working on Quality over Quantity they have done neither over most of last year and leading into the new year. They pointlessly reworked the story mode into a linear map that you go from point A to B only have no real rewards in that mode. Still have X-Defence, Holosim and the Danger room that need reworking. They changed from releasing a hero a month to eight a year only to have the players still waiting on some that were preordered in 2015. I've gone from being hopeful on what they promised to baffled on the some decisions they are making. Releasing stuff that should have been part of a second phase, changing items dropping in harder content that you need those items to get to, lowering XP as a whole while keeping Infinity points XP needed very high. Devs keep saying it will all make sense when its all finished but thats looking like its going to be months out and we are playing a second beta all while unsure what the state of the game will be when its finished.

												I've had varying opinions about the game, but ultimately the last straw was the forum moderation. If there is ever a nazi level of moderation - this is the Gazillion forum.You can write a negative post about the game in a general discussion forum, then apologize, rename it, erase the text and turn it into a PSA for other players no to make the same mistake as me.You WILL get banned(and they will call it a warning).As for the game itself - it does have an engaging start. Variety of events, game modes, heroes and character customization - these are certainly the advantages. Also an advantage would be no real P2W, except for one paywall that I'll mention in the end.The game is a good place to roleplay your favourite Marvel characters, but unfortunately that's as far as it gets.The list of disadvantages is more numerous:>The game has practically zero multiplayerCo-oping story content or terminals - is a painful experience of you trying to compete with your buddy about who oneshots more enemies faster. Half of the characters have terrible movement options, while many others - can either teleport without any penalty, making them capable of rushing distances many times faster than any other hero, or who can at least fly or have skill that bypasses obstacles. In other words, casual content will be more painful to co-op than it is to solo, because of vast movement difference and class mechanics.Co-op farming challenges is totally unnecessary, because there are almost always enough people to do everything, but if you get a personal party - you can't even get private instance of that farming challenge. You just will have to deal with other people.Co-oping a handful of wave-based challenges is very recommended, with the notion of these modes being absolutely unrewarding. Maybe a couple of sick-geared people can outlast 60 waves of Holosim for the title, but beyond that - it's not something to co-op for rewards.Ultron is one exception to this. It's a mode that's very rewarding, pretty challenging and favors premade groups. I would list it as an advantage, but it's probably better to call it an exception to disadvantage.Finally - raids. Let's put it this way: Green raid is accessible freely by practically anyone who has hit 60. It helps you to get weekly commendation cap to upgrade items to level 66. Red raid is hard-gated by the community until you have full 66 gear(at least a month of gameplay). Axis raid is only accessible with best gear in the game, because first boss is overpowered, second boss is facerolled and third boss is a matter of movement.Raids have practically non-existent rewards. People have ran both raids for months and haven't seen a single raid item drop on any character. Items from Muspelheim can be crafted at the cost of 2.5 weeks of gameplay and a very rare rune.So you can surely get into a clan and run raids, but there is one thing you can be sure about - you will NOT see any unique rewards for it. If not for commendations, you would certainly have better places to play in than raids.>Power ClimbThis game has one benefit - you can personally reroll almost all of your gear. Unfortunately, the cost and the odds of having something decent rolled on your favourite gear - are, literally, astronomical. Let's say that your favourite artifact has 4 stats. To roll them at 90%+ you'll need some huge luck. A roll of 95-100% is often worth many times more than the artifact itself.Now, imagine if your unique slot item has... again, literally, 12 stats. Calculate your odds of getting... let's be honest here, 80%+ roll on ALL of them.......... Yeah.>Item GrindWhile it's not something new to the ARPG genre, the grind in this game is very peculiar. Developers actually gave you hope to get the desired item. A hope to beat the evil RNG. A hope in form of an achievement that rewards a single, often personal(acc-bound) item after you have ran the instance in question - 500 times on average. Depending on the instance achievement\item, the average translation to hours would be 10-15 hours straight spent in that particular instance. And that's just for one achievement. After you've got it, and if you need another such item - well, you may not have seen a drop before your 500 runs. And, according to player testimonies - might not see one in another 1000.>Stone Age BarterGame's trading is strictly barter, meaning that it can be severely scammable by the seller and very unforgiving to the buyer. The standard bartering currency is one of the best artifacts in the game that has been farmed by hundreds of thousands of people and, upon reusing, has become the base currency. When you start, your only way up is to keep playing until you loot something worth trading, then either convert it into this ""currency"" or trade it for what you currently need. This is the one system that actually cries: ""Diablo 3 AH was awesome"">Hero disparity, Cosmic TrialSome heroes are known to be popular and extremely easy\overpowered. This generally includes summoners, heroes with teleport and heavy healing capabilities.Other heroes can either be extremely boring to play or are just incapable of realistically competing. They are reviewing heroes, but it takes months, and it seems that they first poop out a hero, then think about it.Cosmic Trial is a gate that can be facerolled by one group of heroes, and either requires very solid gear or is almost undoable by another. It unlocks more rewarding farming challenges for level 60, which, frankly, must be much more default.>Stash paywallPractically everything in the game can be acquired for free, and all players cry in unison that if you ever agree to donate - it must be Stash. It's not much of a disadvantage, but I'd rather donate for content that enhances my gameplay without too much P2W, than be forced to pay for something that inhibits my very acquaintance with the game.Conclusion:If there is one thing I've learned in this game - it's ""You must not want"". Wanting something will get you mad about lack of drops, bad luck and lots of grinding.Just playing, from time to time, doing some event or dailies, and hoping, but not focusing on it - to get something valuable to trade - this is the more promising route.Like many other MMOs - this game is not about you.Since the review somehow got popular, let me make a few things clear:1. Review is OUTDATED. I have not played the game recently, have not been on forums recently, maybe things have changed. I do not particularly intend to check, but if a more adequate person comments with proof of change, I will reflect it.2. The main gripe is the grind. The grind that revolved around key factors of the game. It may not be too bad, but it wasn't very promising either. The horizon is either totally obscured, or it's so far and wide that you really don't want to walk it. In other words, you either have no idea if you have to reroll an item 10 times or 10000 times to make it good, or you know you need to run a dungeon 500 times to get a crucial build item.3. The game had reasonable trade progression, or maybe I just had some luck before I quit. But ultimately tradable things could be reached, this still does not resolve point #2. 4. Game itself is quite engaging, and to an extent this review is indeed biased. But how would you react when you are a frequent buyer at a store. Some items were good, some were bad. In general, it was convenient and you used it. But one day, a clerk totally ♥♥♥♥s you up and you really don't want to visit this store again. What will you say about this store?Frankly, people should be thankful I've at least tried to be a normal negative commenter - one who actually describes how things work, instead of ""I can play as Rocket, 10\10"". I could as well say ""game is bad, forums are bad, not recommended"". Somehow people who disagree can only see\comprehend these few words.			"

												The devs broke my favorite game.I've been playing since beta, I've seen all kinds of updates and nerfs. This recent update has had negative effects on every single character I own. Marvel Heroes used to be the game I would always return to when I grew bored with the ""flavor of the week"" games. I might not play for weeks or months at a time, but I would always find my way back eventually. But after yesterday's update I think I am done with it. This game is ruined and I feel cheated. This feels like Payday 2 all over again. I am sick of having a product I paid for changed without my consent. This is like having Best Buy come into my house and replace my laptop with an ipad 1 and tell me it's better for everyone. ♥♥♥♥ you, I paid for something else.All of the time and effort I have spent min maxing my characters and finding fun builds to play is gone. Every character now functions exactly the same as every other character. Builds may be more diverse, but it doesn't matter because they are all equally terrible. Every piece of loot I have scraped together took a nerf. And the only positive change I have seen is the mission tracker, which worked fine before and is slightly better now. I understand this update is coming out in waves, and this is only the first patch. I don't care if things may be better with the new gear yet to come. All I care about is that all my effort grinding loot, all my time studying guides, all my in game currency spent rolling gear is now undone. They changed everything, and it's worse across the board.I don't know why they did this. But the speculation that these changes are driven by a desire to bring in consoles and mobile platforms seems to make the most sense. They slowed it down, dumbed it down, and I think they killed it. The game is now a boring shadow of what it was before. This patch needs to be rolled back immediately.			"

												I used to have nothing but glowing recommendations about this game, unfortunately the new dev team has taken the game in a direction that just isn't all that fun to play. I am not talking about the BUE update or how I think the Shield Supply Points to be a disgusting Pay To Win money grab. I am talking about how those currently in charge of development simply ignore their community in forums that are their specifically for the content people are complaining about. Take this weeks Black Bolt release (Hint: It is not going well), and the fact that the devs are all but ignoring the very fans that begged them not to release him in his current state. I've supported this game since beta, my hours on Steam don't even take into account the year or so played before their was a Steam release. I did it because the game was fun, and now, it is less so, but I could look over that. The dev team (Then lead by David Brevik) were the main reason I supported this game in the beginning, they seemed to be as vested in us, as we were in them. Unfortunately this new dev team doesn't seem concerned about that aspect of the industry. Oh well, there are still many great dev teams with great games out there, I guess it's time to venture forth. TL;DR I tend to support devs I trust, this new dev team lost that trust, and doesn't seem interested in earning it back.  "

												Heard a lot of criticism and bad reputation about the game and that got confirmed through the fact that I played it a couple of days after it first launched into Open Beta. Im not lying when I say, the game was terrible back then. It was hard to call it a 'F2P Game'. But it did a 180° rotation since then, the F2P model changed alot and the way and the implementation of several characters or costumes etc. that the players suggest via the game forum is awesome. Gaz Entertainment interacts so nicely with the community, which is the only explanation why the game turned into such a good game in less than a year. Every gaming website that reviewed Marvel heroes like a year ago should 're-visit' it immediately. The meta score of 58 doesn't fit to it in any way. "

												When the game launched, I was surprised by the fact that the game was not even well optimized for weak/medium level PCs. I mean, seriously? Why exactly would you need a good PC, for a game like this? But oh well, so I did not play it for a while and gave it a try again recently. Hmm, I noticed all the patching really did some tricks. The game is quite playable now and it is kind of funny how there are so many things... SO. MANY. THINGS. to loot in this game. I like the atmosphere of it, which reminds me of the RPGs of the 90s (And this does not mean it is a bad thing. It is for me, in fact, a good thing, a great thing even). And since it is hard to unlock other heroes, or you have to pay, it feels special if you are the only person with that hero in the area you are in. I am right now playing as Spider-Man, and I noticed you can buy the costume of the Superior Spider-Man. You see, those guys know what kind of stuff makes money. Because in fact, I am quite tempted to buy this. It felt really good when I was fighting Rhino as Spider-Man, and the other guy who was the Superior Spider-Man helping me out and all, it was something like a dream come true for me, Spider-Man and Doc Oc Spidey working together to beat down Rhino? Oh boy. And it was incredibly fun to beat down Venom with a bunch of X-Men guys as well. I would have to say, this game has potential. The whole combat system is pretty fun, too, and I really like how fast Spidey moves during the battle, it is certainly fun to watch. This game, is quite interesting. Pretty fun. Even though I am a Marvel fan, if the game sucks, then I would not even think about playing it, but there is something about this game, that makes me want to keep coming back to play again. Certainly a great free MMORPG. 8.7 out of 10*UPDATED in November 28th, 2013*Now that I have played this game for over 100 hours, it is about time I wrote a little bit more detailed review. First of all, I really like the fact that the things in the map can be destroyed, for example, all those window glasses and tables and such all get destroyed if you use AoE attacks around, making the whole battle appear a little bit more exciting. The graphics are one of the best, and quite well optimized nowadays as well. If you have a good PC with a good gaming GPU, it is recommended that you max the settings, as there is a big difference between the lowest settings and the max settings. I've noticed that after some patches that happened recently, it seems like there are more people than there were in the past, and it's good to see that some new bosses and such were added as well. The game has certainly gone through a lot of changes recently, and I believe they did a great job. This game will grow, and I can tell. I just wish to see a little bit more costumes for certain characters, like Emma Frost, Jean Grey and Spidey. It's just, this game needs a little bit more love from more people. 9.1 out of 10.			"

												Marvel Heroes is an interesting game. It plays like Diablo, as in it’s an action RPG with loot drops and classes (heroes) to play as. That said, it has had an interesting history, at least as far as video games go. It was originally developed by Cryptic Studios under the name Marvel Universe, but it ended up getting cancelled.  Gazillion Studios took over the rights and rebranded it as the name we know today, minus the 2015. That came in May of this year, though I expect it to change to 2016 next summer. We’ll see about that, though. Anyway! 	I’ve been playing Marvel Heroes 2015 off and on since July, and I’ve been having a blast so far. I picked Rocket Raccoon as my first hero (the one you get for starting the game) since he looked like he’d be a lot of fun, and Guardians of the Galaxy was about to hit theaters. I played him for a bit, to level 12 or so, but heard he was getting his powers completely changed by the developers. This made me wonder whether it was worth the time leveling him up or not, since he was going to change anyway, and I ended up putting him on the shelf for later. Since I enjoyed the game enough to buy a hero, I chose to buy Loki; his powers were pretty unique, and I thought that it wouldn’t hurt to try something new. He has the ability to make illusions and send them after the enemy, either by hitting an enemy with his scepter or using another skill to create several. I remember using the ability he gets far down his illusion tree pretty often – the one where his illusions drop down like a meteor. Unfortunately, Loki’s Ultimate (a skill heroes get at level 52) is pretty lackluster. I admit I don’t know much about the comics (and I do hope to eventually change that) but Loki’s Ultimate has him turn into a frost giant for 20 seconds, changing the skill bar to unique skills only the frost giant can use. This would be fine if the frost giant didn’t move so slowly and if Loki actually did this in the comics. The Marvel Heroes 2015 forums are full of people expressing their distaste for Loki’s Ultimate, so hopefully it will change eventually. I thought it was kind of neat at first, turning into something so huge and powerful, but moving so slowly killed it for me. I did get Loki to level 60, though, and that helped me level up other heroes, since the game gives an experience boost the more heroes you have leveled to max.Other heroes I have bought or randomly acquired with in-game currency (Eternity Splinters, which drop once every 6-8 minutes or so) include Iron Man, Squirrel Girl, Captain America, Scarlet Witch, Human Torch, Thing, Taskmaster, Deadpool, Wolverine, Storm, Nova, Rogue, Moon Knight, Daredevil, Emma Frost, Punisher, Colossus, and Thor. So far, Human Torch and Iron Man have been my favorites to play, but I’ve just started to play Nova now and I haven’t touched Rogue yet.As a whole, the gameplay is fun. I haven’t done any raids (end game content) yet, but even so I have felt some heroes needing more attention from the developers than others. Some heroes, such as Scarlet Witch, have not gotten their ’52 Rework, or 52 Review’ yet, which means she has no signature power. Like Ultimates, Signatures are unlocked at a certain level, though this level is 30, whereas Ultimates are 52. Signatures are usually pretty vital, and heroes without them really feel it. Not only that, but 52 Reviews usually end up with a complete overhaul of a hero’s powers. In other words, I haven’t played Scarlet Witch because I’m waiting for her Review.Even with Reviews, some heroes are still lackluster, and need attention. Captain America is the one most people think of when they think of a hero who needs help. He’s squishier than he should be, and his signature doesn’t last long enough, with a minute long cooldown. (Most signatures have a 20-30 second cooldown, for comparison.) My boyfriend played Cap and really wanted to like him, but felt like he had too many problems right now. Hopefully Cap will get a loving readjustment, but we’ll see how long it takes for that to happen, if it ever does.The free-to-play aspect of the game is pretty fair, especially compared to similar ones on the market. Eternity Splinters drop about once every 6-8 minutes, and are used to purchase heroes, box space, or team ups. 175 Eternity Splinters allow you to get a random hero. The downside to this is that you might get one you already have; if this happens you can level their Ultimate to have a shorter cooldown. The only thing I’ve felt needed to be purchased was box space, or Stash space. This cannot be purchased with Eternity Splinters and without enough boxes you will feel overwhelmed. Each regular Stash box costs 500Gs, which equates to $5. If you like the game, dropping $5 every once in a while isn’t a big deal.The bosses are usually fun to play against, though when there are a lot of players on screen things can get laggy and you may miss Juggernaut charging you; this isn’t a big deal, though, since dying doesn’t really feel detrimental in any way. (Probably does in raids, but like I said, I haven’t done any of those yet.)There are events that happen very regularly, some very grindy. (Get 2000 of an item to have Agent Coulson from SHIELD be your team up.) That said, the events as a whole bring life to the game, and the developers are constantly adding things. New heroes are being added once a month or so, and while some feel rushed out the door, others are almost perfect. All in all, I would recommend trying this game out if you’re interested in Diablo-like games and/or the Marvel Universe, especially since it’s free.View with pictures: http://thatwritingthing.com/marvel-heroes-2015-review-keep-reviewin/ "

												Marvel Heroes has been one of my favorite games for a while, should I mention it is made by one of the Diablo II creators. It is a great MMOARPG that is completely FREE TO PLAY. Not paying with cash handicaps one through stash space, only thing you have to purchase, you can and I have found several free costumes. One of the things that keeps me coming back is the amount the devs care and update their game, every month a new hero is released (recently 2 this month) and many changes are made. This game is worth a try, forget about other FTP games and any other ARPG (POE, D3, etc) on the market. The reason this game gets a bad wrap is it released in what I would even consider a late alpha stage.			"

												My favorite Marvel character is Nightcrawler - I have all the old late 70s and 80s X-Men comic books. So naturally Nightcrawler was the first character I fully unlocked. What I really loved about this game is that I felt like I could play the character in a way consistent with the comics - meaning his teleportation in the game actually worked like his teleportation in the comics - something that no other game had ever done. I couldn't teleport infintely - eventually it put a drain on my spirit - but I could do it over and over to take out clustered groups of enemies one after the other and also to get around the maps fast. I loved the gameplay, even if it did get repetitive. This has all changed with the new update. He is limited to 5 teleports now... and a cooldown. And he can't even teleport to where you have the mouse pointed on the screen. He goes like 5 feet. WTF? And what's with this ridiculous charge up for sprinting? I haven't tried my other characters yet but I'm willing to bet the authenticity I enjoyed so much playing them is gone. I won't be spending any more money on this game and probably very little of my time. Very disappointed.			"

												This is a Diablo like APRG with superheroes. If you like those two things, you will probably like this game.How free is it?You get all content (story mode, instances and raids) for free. Gazillion (the developer) also hands out a lot of stuff for free at irregular intervalls.What do you get when you start?You get one free hero unlock the first day. The second day you play you get 400 splinters (the in-game currency), which is enough for one or two more heroes. After that you get a splinter every 8 minutes on the average, when you play actively (not sitting in a hub). You use these to unlock more heroes and team-ups. You also get a free team-up in ch 3 of the story, and you can unlock another one easily (in under an hour) once you reach lvl 60 on one hero. Go to the MH site, the Achievements forum has intructions, search for the ""Pirate Deadpool"" thread.How do they make money?Selling skins (hero costumes), more storage and lotteries with skins as the top prizes. You can also buy heroes and team-ups for real money if you are impatient. Is there Pay-to-Win?No. And there is no way you can tell in-game if someone has spent money on the game or not. Many of the people you will see wearing non-starter costumes actually got them for free as well, through prestiging (starting over from level one) where you get a new standard costume. 3 of these can be combined to make a new randomly selected costume.This game might or might not be your cup of tea, but it's free, so if you like this type of game, give it a try!(Edit: Spelling)			"

												LISTEN TO THE VETERAN PLAYERS,IF YOU START PLAYING/PAYING GAZILLION WILL RIP YOU OFF TOO,DON'T GIVE THESE CROOKS YOUR MONEY.DON'T BUY ANYTHING INGAME.THEY WILL MAKE EVERYTHING YOU BUY USELESS SO YOU HAVE TO BUY MORE..The massive game changing overhaul was a big F.U. to the loyal veteran playerbase and community, the unwanted and drastic changes ruined this game. Stear clear until they revert the changes.They will do the same thing to the console people that they did to the PC Veterans,Gazillion is trying to dupe new players into buying items/heros and once they get your money they will change demographics again and then YOU will be feeling ripped off after you have paid for a game you no longer want to play.I was a player since Beta, I did quit for a year or two then came back, I got maybe four months of fun out of this game before they ruined it. I had every character,a pet for each, all stashes unlocked and on top of that all 50+ characters of mine had ALL unique gear which was made useless with this update.This was the BIGGEST NERF I have ever seen in 30+YEARS OF GAMING.If you didn't get to play this before the update then you missed out on the PRIME of this game.The servers are dead and it prob won't be long before the servers are permenently offline.The update didn't revitalize this game, it killed it.

												Ok, so I guess i never reviewed this game back when it was fun. Were it pre-update I would tell you how much i enjoyed the pacing and customization of this game and how I bought all the summoner characters because I loved building summoners. I would click the thumbs up and hapily think about the oodles of hours and money i poured into it, and how rewarding they made it....And then the update cameI started out on the fence. There were a ton of changes, some good, many bad, most sort of in between. They had nerfed the pacing (everything is sooo slow now), made it about as customizable as Diablo 3 ( I play that too so i was used to that, though i didnt like how it happened in this game). I got used to the minor changes, complained a bit and planned my adaptations. And then theyreleased the follow up to the update and Borked summon characters forever. That was the last straw. They seem to be on a mission to standarize all the characters and thier builds to make them really samey, and I havent played since because of it. Maybe some day ill try it again and it will be fun again and I can change this review to ""recomend"". This is not that day			"

												This a review of the last update in the game, the so called Biggest Update Ever, like it was good thing.First of all, if you're a newcomer or even thinking of trying the game, notice this: there are around 60 heroes, more Team-ups, and more to come. When you create a new account, you're given none of those. You can play any hero up to level 10, unable to use items on them.Before the update you could fully unlock the hero you wanted for free, now you can't. Instead they give you 400 ES (currency good for heroes/teamups), after some time playing, wich will let you buy a hero (they cost between 200 and 600 ES).So yeah, if you're new, consider playing the game only if you don't really know what to do with thousands of $$ and feel like giving them to this company. Otherwise, move on.If you are a returning player, or a veteran, this update is also a middle finger you. Before the update ou had teleports/dashes on every hero, they were fast and spammable (no cd), now they are limited to 3 charges that refresh slowly. And they also move slower. The big lie/excuse to do this is that they felt the fast movement dampened their ability to create new content. Basically, they're out of ideas, or they are useless enough to create new content. And instead of firing half the company and replace them with people with some creativity, they just decided to damage the playerbase by removing something that was fun.Next change: they introduced the difficulty slider. Now again, these guys are just screwing with everybody or just plain dumb. Anything above the easiest difficulty will take at least 300% longer time to complete than difficulty before, while granting only 90% more rewards.They revamped the hero atributes system. I would say that was a good change if it didn't completely ruin all the items in yor heroes, because those BiS before are now useless.Did they introduce new content? Nope.They also nerfed the quantity of ES you can get. I mean, it's like these guys hate their playerbase, and just care about milking their whales. In every damn aspect of the game, every time they introduce something that looks good, they take two steps back in anything else.This game is terrible. 1/10, because it was promising for a good time, but all in all, every promise was broken in our faces.

												Sorry I have to change my review of this game. They changed a lot of things I liked about the game :/ and I no longer play it they ruined everything that made the game great and my previous review will be left here to let everyone know how great the game used to be.You can read my previous review here.So its about time I wrote a review for this game. My brother was the one that told me about it, and given other previous marvel super hero games I was reluctant but having tried this one, I am glad he told me about it. I will give a quick summary as to why.Character customization is pretty indepth and there are multiple builds and styles you can go for, with each hero and there are also long term player staying mechanics such as omega points for those people who love to keep playing but keep getting rewarded with power by doing so, you will constantly get stronger.Items, there are countless items, uniques, legendaires and you name it, even pets and team up heroes that help you.Story line is very long, in depth and has some pretty interesting comic book style cinimatics.Playable heroes, there are tons of heroes to choose from and you can play all of them if you really wanted without even spending a dime.Free, when I say free I mean free. Everything can be bought with real money or without real money. If you want to be a free player there is nothing wrong with that and its entirely possible to do without horrendous grind schemes.Graphics are pretty good.If I were to rate diablo 3, I would rate that game as a 5, and this game as an 8.

												I feel qualified to leave a response for this game now that I've sunk a fair amount (~700) hours into it.Marvel Heroes is an amazing Diablo-esque ARPG with elements of MMOs and the heart of City of Heroes/City of Villains elements thrown in, but they do more than that. I've been playing this game for almost a year, and I can safely say that anyone who grew up on Diablo 2 will be happy with a game like this and the new supergroup features that allow you to co-op with friends, acquaintances, and random group memebers more easily. the LFG (Looking For Group) tab also allows you to find new people to co-op with that are working on the same quests as you.Even though the game is a bit old now, it's constant updates and aestethic art are very appealing. More than that, the characters are very well built! With over 50 characters to choose from (heros and villains alike) you can enjoy the game for free (yes, for free) without ever spending a dime! There is an in-game currency which drops while you play. This currency can be used to buy iconic Marvel heroes to play as, Marvel team-ups, one-time boosts, or anything else the Devs decide to make available. You can literally unlock every character, team-up, and a few inventory slots in the game without ever spending money. With that said, I need to disclose that I have spent money on this game to buy special in-game items and to support the amazing Devs who have made all 50 characters feel unique, release regular updates, include new content for free, hold events what feels like every week, and give freebies away on a regular basis.Gazillion has done an incredible job of recapturing the feel of classic ARPGs in a format that will appeal to Marvel fans,  hardcore and casual MMO players, and fans of ARPGs.

												One of the best most underrated free to play games out there, with a business model so fair you will start throwing money at your screen and the game's devs if you play this game for an extended period of time.The game itself is an isometric action rpg, with at the time i'm writing this a roster of 57 playable characters, while you may not like playing every single one, with that many, there's bound to be a few you'd like playing and even without playing a dime you can try every single one of them to see which you like the most!Then there's a story mode, several challenge modes and other things to do while you're leveling your characters, then at level 60 once you accumelate some gear, you can start raiding! Yes, raiding in an action rpg, while it may not be the most fleshed out raiding system you've ever seen, it's still a ton of fun.As you can see, i have a few hours in this game and therein also lies the biggest con of this game, once you hit certain gear points, there's no real challenge to be found anywhere, the devs are working on it, but as of right now there's a real lack of challenge for very well geared people, good news is, if you start now it will take several months to get to that point at least.TL;DR: if you love marvel, give this game a try, if you love action rpg's you owe it to yourself to try this game, if you love both.. then what the hell are you waiting for, go play!

												The new update is utter trash. As a player since 2013 I have to say the game has downgrade to fun and addicting to slow and boring and P.S. why would the developers make the unlimited teleports limited after so long, that was one of the main machanics that made the fun, skills such nightcraler's teleport ability, deadpools teleport belt, etc.			"

												It's been a couple of months since I posted this review and decided to do an update.I played this game back in beta and I couldn't really get into it but they revamped the game last year and apparently made it much better, so i decided to give it another shot.  What a great decision that was!  The game's a hell of a lot more fun than the first time I tried it.  If you don't know what Marvel Heroes is, Marvel Heroes is free-to-play, dungeon crawling action-rpg with a cash shop that features non-stop action, fun, and of course LOOT.  If you're familiar with Diablo or Torchlight you'd be familiar with the type of gameplay Marvel Heroes has to offer.  If you never played either of those games, but you're familiar with a little game called Marvel Ultimate Alliance, you may enjoy this.  Before, when you created a new account, you were only able to choose a starter character from a given list that included:  Captain America, Black Panther, Punisher, Black Widow, Luke Cage, Human Torch, Colossus, Cyclops, Storm, Hawkeye, Rocket Racoon, and DareDevil. The developers changed that and now you can play ANY of the currently released heroes up until level 10 and with a new account, you can unlock any one of these as a starter.  The only exception would be the newly released hero of the month.  You will have to either buy the newest hero from the cash shop or from the NPC that sells characters for in-game currency/tokens called Eternity Splinters.As mentioned, there's a cash shop in this game since its free-to-play.  You'll find characters, costumes, team-up characters (characters that fight alongside your character), and items such as XP boosts, rarity boosts, pets, and random item boxes in the shop.  The characters and team-up characters found in the cash shop can also be earned in-game by collecting a token that drops off mobs about every 8 minutes called an ""Eternity Splinter.""  These let you buy characters from the Eternity NPC for different amounts.  A worthwhile note:  You receive 400 Eternity Splinters as a day 2 login reward.Some characters (like The Thing, Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, X-23, Hawkeye for example) will cost you about 200 Splinters.  These same characters cost about $5 in the cash shop.  Most characters however, can be bought for 400 Spinters, which costs around $9 if you buy from the cash shop.  Some characters like Iron Man, Spider-Man, Rogue, Doctor Doom, just to name a few, will cost you quite a bit.  They can be bought for either 600 Splinters or ~$13 in the cash shop.  If you're feeling lucky, you can try your luck with a Free Hero Box that costs you 175 Splinters.  These let you have a chance at a random hero unlock that can get you one of the more expensive heroes, including newly released ones!The cash shop isn't the main attraction for this game.  You can save yourself some cash on shiny new characters or costumes if you wait for sales (which come pretty frequently).  The summer sale for example, saw a 50% discount on a lot of stuff.  So it's sometimes better to wait, or earn things yourself. Gameplay is the main attraction here and it's very fast paced and extremely FUN.  Each character plays differently and with the amount of characters, it feels like there's over 50+ different classes.   Some are debuffers/support, others are DPS or tanks.  Some of the newer characters work better than the older ones but Gazillion is doing updates every month to older characters.  Even after hitting the level 60 level cap, you're going to get sucked into going after loot, and boy is there a lot of loot.  Until then, there's plenty to do before hitting the cap.  Players can participate in a variety of game modes including: story mode, patrols (Midtown and Industry City), Terminals, One Shots, X-Defense (group survival mode), Holosim (single player or two player survival), Age of Ultron, raids (Currently 3 raids), and Player vs. Player (have yet to try PvP).  At level 60, the Cosmic level difficulty unlocks for both Patrols and Terminals.  This difficulty mode is basically for the hardcore player because it offers a greater amount of challenge but also best opportunity for loot.  Also at level 60, you can join in on a 10 man raid and take part in some of the endgame content that the game has to offer.  Currently, there are three raids and each one scales up in difficulty, so in order to do the next, you'll have to work hard on getting the necessary gear.  If you happen to like a character a lot, you can prestige them, which restarts your character at level 1. This gives you a fancy new chat color (not that great) and the ability to buy a new pet, which can be used to gain bonus stats for your character.  Prestiging doesn't add any bonus stats so you don't have to do it if you don't want to.The support for this game is tremendous.  Gazillion really cares and they listen to their players when it comes to new content.  There's always suggestions for costumes or characters that Gazillion considers making for the game.  The support services are also fantastic.  I bought a character and the very same went on sale a couple of days later, submitted a ticket and they refunded me the difference!  They have a 7 day price guarantee.  You don't see that EVER on a f2p game with a cash shop.  You know what else you don't see a lot of on a f2p game? A good community, and this game really has a great one.If you like Diablo or Ultimate Alliance, give this game a try. It's free, so the only thing you'd miss out on is time.  Watch out for your wallet if you become addicted though!			"

tl;dr A game with great potential that's now all too willing to throw long-time players under the bus to ""gather more data"" in the name of ""it's for your own good.""The good:  A full lineup of your favorite Marvel ip heroes (and villains) doing their thing A wide variety of game modes . Events, events, and more events on a regular basis A mostly friendly community that's willing to help out a new player at every turn Regularly visually updated heroes and environment that look fantasticThe bad: The heroes (and vilains) ARE your main new content Horrendous and time consuming inventory management system Crippling interaction system that make this game a single player experience Skin deep development of game content in every node Poor optimization demands more from your system, visual clutter makes less of your system's capabilitiesThe ugly:  Zero accountability at every level and constant repositioning of the company leads to a discombobulated game  Paying boutique prices for an alpha experience  Iffy oversight, BUE upheaval, and unprofessional communication enable ongoing strife and acrimony  Heavy emphasis on designer vision of balance, light emphasis on user experienceLarge Blocks of Text:Well I found out that steam reviews have a character limit, so I'll focus on why I basically stopped playing and do not recommend this game: the ugly.There is zero accountability at this company from the top down, and this is reflected in the game: months are spent on new game modes which are quickly disgarded in favor of a new direction when all it takes to update them is updating the loot discovered in these modes to the latest thing; various ""exclusive"" items are put in the game at incredible prices such as $30 USD for a chance to draw these items from a pack of Fortune Cards then are made completely worthless later on by having the staff giving these cash only cosmetic items away in events or new ""boost"" boxes; crippling ""balance-based"" nerf adjustments are made on-the-fly to popular heroes while promised quality of life updates or boosts take years before implementation; specific feedback threads exist in hero forums for each hero that detail the same complaints or in some cases character-breaking bug reports for years but when updates eventually are made to the hero, it's as if nothing was ever written in black and white and a developer openly stating ""well we never heard anything about this being a problem"" until there's an open uproar in that specific hero community; there's a Test Center where many players volunteer their time and report reproduceable, glaring, game breaking bugs, yet these bugs still make it to live because ""we need more data"" until they're abused to death and create further dissention among the active player base because now they feel entitled to these bugs; the whole return of the ""tiers of difficulty"" bad old days with the return of a head game developer with fetid reviews at best last time around; the hits go on. The prices in this game are expensive a-la-carte - one stash is $5, hero specific stashes are $3.5, costumes run into the teens, and that's not even delving into heroes, teamups, and ultimate power upgrades.  The staff has ameliorated this somewhat by providing a ""daily draw"" system where a player can draw a coupon of up to 90% off, but the sobering reality with the ongoing Biggest Update Ever(BUE) is, you can buy 20k + G at 90% off, but the very next week everything you've progressed on in this game will have changed, so now you can have that fancy costume or hero stash for a hero you may no wonder want to play, or you can deck out a hero that's fantastic, only to have that hero be changed into something completely unrecognizable within a week's span of time.The community in this game used to be one of the most friendly I've ever encountered: people in social, LFG, or even price-gouging trade channels are all willing to go out of their way to help out a player that's newly starting out, and there's always a giveaway running on the forums for a cash item or an in game item, no strings attached.  This has been mostly drowned out by the bitterness enabled by iffy moderation on BUE feedback.  Veterans of the game would post their genuine hurt at how their years of play and work feels like they are completely null now gets ganged upon by goons who say something along the lines of ""well, don't play then"" or ""why don't you quit"" or ""maybe you should learn how to git gud and boost TTL LOL dummy killer expert,"" and when these veterans inevitably get riled up and retaliate, bam, they are jailed or banned by moderation.  In recent weeks, more attention has been paid  to moderating instigators as well, but the damage is already done, and it is a very divisive, fractious, and sometimes petty atmosphere that currently permeates throughout the game.To add injury to insult, the unprofessional and generally untrained, unpolished communications from the company do not help matters: from redirecting criticism by targetting the submission format (we can't hear your feedback because you didn't follow our format), to repeatedly making announcements on personal twitter before they appear anywhere in game, on the official site, or on the official forums, to waffling more than IHOP and doing 180s on a regular basis that's not based on player feedback but ""we went into a meeting,"" to outright replying to player responses with sarcasm; in summary, paid professionals who don't act like it.The worst part is how developers have seemed to fallen in line behind a ""we design it, you take it, like it or not"" philosophy since the second half of 2016 that only seems to put a token weight, if any, on player experience.  I don't mean that game developers should follow the royal dictates of the player-monolithic-entity; rather, designs and changes that have made it to the live versions of the game in recent months feel like at their core, their first, second, and third priorities is to conform to some nebulous vision of the future of the designer, not the experience of the invested player population of their long-released game.  Take tuning as an example: the repeated, unmitigated upgrades to mob ranged damage and DoT damage combined with the mobility changes all serve the long-term goal of the designer to make the game ""more interesting to actually play from battle to battle"" and move away from a purely end-goal oriented loot run.  Yet in the process of getting from point A to point B, existing players are effectively put on a spit and roasted over a fire to ""accumulate more data"" for designers:  Oh so our big Cosmic Moving Circle of Death kills you in 2 seconds now if you are built to do reasonable damage?  And if you build full tank it takes you 10 minutes to kill a boss but at least you can stand in the CMCOD with no cooldown for 4 seconds?  What if we gave you ""cosmic"" gear that allows you to stand in our CMCOD for 4 seconds and actually deal some damage before scurrying like a rat?  What did you say you want? Actually building more interesting battles that aren't bullet hells or whailing on HP sponges that now hit like a brick wall? That comes later, we want to tune first, then maybe make your experience fun.There's something that's often parroted by the goons on the official boards ""If you hate this game so much, why don't you play something else"".  That's actually pretty good advice, the main problem is the source of the ""advice.""  If you are encouraging a part of your own community to tell another part of your community to go away, how are you going to grow your player base?  That's why there are all sorts of theories such as a move to console - there's no other rational explanation for how poorly this game has treated its oldest customers in the last half year.			"

												So after playing the BUE for a while now and after playing for quite a whilebefore the BUE at this moment i cannot recomend this game at this time. Howeversince the BUE is nor done this review may change once it is all relesed (doubt it).To begin with the runes....sorry talents basically just took your one point powers and locked them behind a talent. As an example Gambit used to have 3 skills, one that gave you HP, one that gave you dodge chanceand one that let you respawn when defeated.You would usually put one point in each to gain atleast a little benefit of each, especially the cheat death skill.Now with the ru... talents you have to choose only one of three, and its not really a choice since you can just teleport to a hub and choose a diffirent talent. Alas from what i have seen most of if not all the characters got the same treatment with their one pointers.I guess they had to do that since they went from having 3 skill bar choices to one, so yes only 8 skills available to use, well 7 if you use your dash skill.That's not too bad but since alot of the characters have quite a bit of cooldown powers, however most don't have spirit to manage, it is kind of an odd path they chose to go down.The next issue i have with this update and to me the biggest issue out of thispatch is the removal of the omega system and replacing it with the ""new""parag..... i mean omega system. Sure the omega sytem had a lot of nodes and may have confused new players, but it did open up new and different options that you could atleast try out. Was there alot of copying of builds?Well, yes there was, but it'll be even more apparent in the ""new"" stystem seeingas how each gem has 6 options. But most players will choose the obvious in each gem, like Crit chance, or brute chance, sig power, move speed, dashcooldown and so on. So we will be seeing the same distribution in pointsespecially since we have alot fewer options. And once again just like D3 it brings it from a Loot Grind to an EXP Grind in order to advance to higher difficulty.Which brings me to my next point....the loot. They have already stated theat the next three heroes will ship with uniques, which they plan on getting rid of in the future for Omega items. Since the next three heroes will have uniques (those being Beast, Nick Fury and Black Boltif im not mistaken) they usually ship one (1) hero per month. So minimum we're looking at atleast three (3) months with no Omega gear.Unless they plan on shipping 2 heroesin one month (doubt it). Now they plan on releasing Cosmic artifacts, which are basically the same old artifacts with one random extra affix (stat) on them. Those being,15% Primary Resource Cost Reduction2000 Defense Rating,2000 Dodge Rating,2000 Deflect Rating,2500 Health,Plus 1 to all Attributes-2s Cooldown on Med Kit Power,150 Primary Resource,10% Cooldown Reduction to Signature Powers.Those affixes will be random when the item drops and they cannot stack, so basically months of planning only to add an extra affix on existing things.UPDATE: As of this writing 2-13-17all the 2500 numbers were changed to 1500 and a few other changes.The next issue i have is that as of now cosmic difficulty isn't really difficult,it's just that with our damage numbers nerfed and the enemy hp still high it justtakes longer to kill stuff, still just as boring. Now this may change with the introduction of omega items, but well just be back to where we were beforethe ""BUE"" just destroying bosses in 10 seconds. Add to that the fact that the ""new"" parago.....infinity system isnt capped once again like D# it'll become anexp grind instead of a loot grind. As far as i know or read on the forums no announcment yet has been made as to what new boss mechanics they have in mind for the future. Look I know the BUE isnt finished, that they are going to release it in stages, but why make changes and add some things when other things aren't inplace yet for it all to make sense. Now theyhave added Kadala.....sorry another character to buy certain items that werea pain to find sometimes (URU), just waiting on the release of omega itemsso they can introduce a char to buy a random one aswell.

												Other people have posted thoughtful critiques of the last patch, so I don't need to reproduce all they have said here. I agree with most of what has been posted. I will comment on what was the biggest issue for me. The last update undid all the work that I had done gearing 59 heroes.In MMOs, it is standard for new and better gear to come out. However, in that case, your current gear is still the best outside the new gear, and you can use it to get the latest and greatest. This last update in Marvel Heroes requires that you completely regear your heroes BEFORE you start hunting for new, better gear (which isn't even out yet.) As an example, you might have a hero that does physical damage. Before the update, that means gear that gives +Strength or +Fighting will be best for him.  So you gear him, re-rolling uniques until you get the best + to strength, finding artifacts that fit him, getting + to strength on his pet, and putting + to strength os a challenge bonus on his uniques.Then you find that the update changes him so he gets more damage from speed and durability and no damage from strength. Now you need to unbind artifacts that give him the wrong stat and find new ones, reroll his pet, find or reroll new uniques and put new challenge bonuses on them. These activities cost in-game resources, and send you back to the tender mercies of the RNG.When all this is done, you have no new equipment - that doesn't come out until ""later."" All you have done is spent a lot of time and energy to basically get back to where you were before. This isn't suitable in a game where part of the enjoyment is to invest time and energy to make your characters better.They could have eased the pain a lot. They could have unbound all artifacts so people could replace them without using resources. They could have allowed people who had pets with +3 to a given attribute, change it to a different attribute without cost during a grace period. They could have allowed people to hange the challenge bonuses on their equipment without cost during a grace period. They did none of that, and showed a total disregard for the work people had put in up until this time.			"

												have played since launch, put time and money into this game even went so far as to log in every day for over 2 years and since the biggest update ever, I will not play any more the game is broken and truly not fun for me anymore. not only did they break my favorite characters but they really left me with no one on a full roster who is even close to being playable, I am saddened and dismayed that this was done so that they could open the game to consoles at the sacrifice of long term PC players.

												I played this game a lot....over 1000 hours over the years...because it was great and always getting better. Updates were frequent and high quality.  Although a free-to-play game, I gladly spent a fair sum of money over time because it was so worth it.    Then came the game redesign of January 2017,  and it was all over.  The game was cut off at the knees, slowed down, watered down, and lost the wind from its sails.    It is a great example of the folly of fixing things that are not broken....you just end up breaking what was already good.			"

												My insane hours played on this game should tell how much i enjoyed it, as it is my main game. Butt I have to say the biggest update ever is very dissappointing. Not only the movement changes make the game less fun and dynamic, the simplified heroes design is meh and offers less possibilities, the overall nerf to all heroes, yes because it is a nerf when you make the same bloody conttent more difficult, and seriously it's so cheap and stingy to just make the same content with yet another tier of difficulty, considering the game hasn't really offered any substantial content for over 2 years.I also don't like the monetization Gaz is trying to put in place, incorporating even more obvious pay to win elements to the game with this ""bif"" boosts. And the insane xp required for a single infinity point is basically telling you get heavily cash boosted or don't bother.But the worst part is that the update is incomplete and the promised omega gear is coming only in a few months, so veterans like me who have almost looted everything in the game, have close to nothing to farm. And do you expect players to theorycraft and gear their heroes when there are several pieces missing ...Gaz had really improved the game since launch but this last update is a big step back as far as making the game better.  As we were told that all these changes were driven by a better gaming experience, which is very questionable considering there was evidence of a future console port, which would make sense based on many of the design decisions.I am not going to go deep into the bug riddled patch, as unfortunately it's been a trademark of Gaz, with poor QA control, wondering if they are not outsourcing their IT work to save money.  The only thing I can say I like about the update is the improved visuals, which is very little to compensate for all negative elements I mentioned. I wish Gaz would revert back from this patch but I know it's never going to happen. I have barely played recently and now I am seriously considering to let this game go, which is sad knowing how much time, dedication and money I spent on this game. "

												Extremely enjoyable Diablo style game that is a must play for any superhero lovers out there.The game has been vastly improved over its initial launch just 5 months ago back in June, and with plans of adding 2 new heroes and new content every month, Gaz has also said they have enough content planned for years to come so its only going to get better.The game is F2P in every sense of the word, all heroes are purchasable with a special in game currency that drops from every type of enemy called Eternity Splinters with heroes starting at 200 splinters and going upto 600 for the more popular heroes like Deadpool and Ironman, you can also use real money to just buy your favourite heroes right away with the games G currency if theres a hero you really cant wait to play as, typically a splinter has been said to drop every 5-10mins of killing enemies so if you have the patience you can get all your heroes for free.There are some things that do require real money to obtain and they are more costumes, bank storage as well as some cosmetic fluff like pets and xp boosting potions, there is however a rare chance for any of the costumes on the store to drop while you're playing but it is very rare.

												This biggest patch ever update just ruined the game. Completely dumbed down for console release all my heroes feel nerfed and slow as molasses. More variety in builds my ♥♥♥ it's super simplified for 12 year olds on conoles. These devs do crap like this every year they slowly build it up to something decent then rebrand for the new year drop a huge patch and screw every thing up this has happened every year since launch. Only this time they completely destroyed everyones builds and next comes all the items we grinded for. Please don't waste your time these devs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and have no idea what the community wants.			"

												This is a free to play, diablo-style, loot based, mmo game. And for one who likes Marvel universe, it is also an awesome one. Cons:- This is a loot based game. If you don't like grinding you might get bored once you are through basic modes of the game.- Characters: there is still some balance needed so that weaker characters (like Mr Fantastic), can be more appealing.- Queue system: for raids doesn't seam to work at all. For PvP - I'm not sure if anybody plays this mode.- Chaos: when you start the game, you may get a bit confused at first. It takes some time to wrap your brain around how the game works.Pros:Characters: over 50 or almost 60 (villains, anti-heroes and heroes from Marvel) are made and voice-acted extrimely well. Game does justice to their individuality. I even started liking characters I wasn't paying too much attention to before (like Taskmaster). All characters play differently and have 3 skill trees you can build up to your liking as you level up.Events - there are weekly events, though repetitive after a while. And other events, that happen rarely, but bring cool rewards.Drops - the balance between drops of greater value (like costumes, eternity splinters required for new hero unlocks) is done ok. You can always buy them for RL currency, but you also stand a chance of obtaining them through in-game currency. It is not too fast, but it's also not painstakingly long. It's done fine.Keeping up with other Marvel's enterprises - this game is up to date with whatever happens in Marvel's comics, movies and tv series. There is this integrity aspect that is appealing, especially if you enjoy whatever Marvel is putting out there.Constant updates - this game is still being updated (new characters, team-up heroes, gameplay modifications). Which is a good thing. Devs are still expanding the game, fix stuff, change some, add to it - a good thing.Achievements - for completionists. Lots of achievements and some have really awesome rewards.			"

												 Ive spent a long time reading other reiviews since the ""big update patch"" and i think this might be my first review of a game ive ever done. I spent soemthing like 10k hours in marvel it was without a doubt a wonderful game with huge charactor that set it way apart from other similiar tittle's at the time. I think the most shocking aspect at first was just how accesible and responsive the developers were to thier playerbase. They were really on the spot when it came to tweaking things or changing directions on game development based on player feedback. I can't pretend to know the reason the game took the direction it went rather it was forced externally to make changes or it was a do or die attempt to evolve the game into other markets to keep the game afloat, but i do know that they fundementally changed how they react to their playerbase's concerns. there were thousands of post pleaing them not go the direction they chose with movement powers, removing divirsity, and homogenilizing the entire game charactor develepment. But for reason i'll never know they just flat out ignored everyone and went a direction which ruined a game that i loved so much. I'm not angry so much as im just sad to lose such a enjoyable arpg, i cant imagine how a company that has a proggression system which was called the omega system ""have hundreds of possible custom choices for a player to proggress though reduce it to a complete rip off of the diablo 3 paragon system where its litterally stacking a arbritrary number each time u gain a lvl in the system. Some would say that the Omega system was reduced to a few viable paths but to those who say that, i say atleast we had a choice, now we have nonthing but a round robin paragon 2.0 As to classes themselves they removed all fluidity which came from 30 choices when they reduced us to 8 talented skills. while i get why its easier to balanced 8 vs 30 why not just make it even simpler and make everyone play the same class with 1-2 skills, if u dont want to put effort into having a huge class roster and the balancing that requires why make almost 60 class's then water them all down to a few ""archtypes"" effectly making them all the same which just diffrent animations.The mobility changes ill never understand it was WHAT made marvel heros the game it was it's selling point, the irony of them removing that and then making mobility even worse then every other arpg on the market is baffaling. its almost seems intentional that they wanted to hurt their game. there are so many points i could cover but i think the purpose of this review is state if id recomend the game going forward and maybe if you never experinced marvel in its prime this version of it wouldnt seem so bad in comparisson, but if your a returnning vet what you once knew is now so far gone. I do plan on sticking around to see if they revert this patch or somehow polish so its not anything like it is in its current state but based on thier previous history concerning this patch they might just ride this decision even if it kills the game, but i hope im wrong and one day i can once again upvote and recomend this game once again.

												The ""Biggest Patch"" for marvel heroes was a complete disappointment for Me. They tried to copy mechanics from Diablo 3 and failed horribly with its execution. Gazillion (Company of the game) have taken out the best things about the game and implement their broken diablo-esque mechanics in hopes that it will make the game better, sadly I dont think it has.The continously lack of content and company goals set for this game since launch and drowned this game into months and years worth of band aid fixes that have never truely made the game any better, and this new 'patch' has not been any different. From continously broken stash/storage inventory to an outdated UI/Chat feature that looks like it was made for the 1990s version of this game, to not even having simple things in the game like a mailbox system amongst the more glaring issues the game faces, I am giving up on this game.We are continuously told to wait and see and hope for a better future with every year this game stays alive for. I swear ever the community of players have developed stockholm syndrome for this game.Truth and fact. The game is poorly designed, and if it was not for the Marvel universe theme, no one would be playing this game. 2/5 stars, and only for nostalgic purposes.			"

												So So sad. I have been playing this game on and off since early Beta. The Game was doing so well adding new heroes at the light of speed, new content. Slowly the content started to dim, no new content in site. A raid here and there and then the creation of new heroes slowed to a crawl. But worst is this last update. I loved Nightcrawler, he is my top hero to play with he needed some love but the love they gave him 5 TELEPORTS and a cool down. Not the love he needed. I worked with Gaz implementing the controller Support. Early users knew it as Bica's Controller Support, used before they implemented there own design based off my consepts. But This game is doomed, unless they port it to PS4 and XBOXONE. Until they undo what they did this game is a big NO Thumbs Down. I loved this game. Now. Just another game set aside and uninstalled. Good by my love. - Bica			"

												This game is my most played game on steam, and its sad to say that they screwed the vet players in hope of attracting new players with its simplicity. The movement change is supposed to bring ""healthier"" gameplay while it does the opposite. Oh and if you say one bad thing on their forums they ban you instantly. Honestly this game has the worst team of devs I have ever experienced in all the games I have played. They literally gave me no reason for the ban and I have spent $100s on the game, guess they dont care about money, huh, thats weird. Nonetheless, at least I can thank them for banning me because now I have no temptations of playing. Thanks for giving me my life back with these new ""healthy"" changes that dont give any new content, or even changes that attract new players. Hopefully in the future some other company makes a good Marvel MMORPG that does right to the marvel universe, because this game definitely doesnt portray how the heroes are in the comic books anymore. Anyway,  good luck to all the people still playing, hope you have fun crawling through the maps =)			"

												I can not find the fun in this new patch at all.It is slow,clunky and end game is always going to be the same boring grind.I really do not see the point in pretty much starting from scratch just to be doing the same boring stuff in the end.Not going to go in depth with anything as it is a waste of time at this point,but anyone who has played this game for at least over 100 hours is going to have a tough time enjoying this in its current state.RIP !!!

Built upon lies, unkept promises, and only about the $$ now.-Potential... It was there but then Gaz changed.-I've played this game for quite awhile, as you can see, and what I can say is this.This game had potential - real potential.However, that potential was never realized. So many lies, unkept promises, lack of new content (Remember that promise of a bunch of new content? Where is it exactly?) after the initial 2015 rebrand, and worse of all the Dev team has took a turn for the worse as time went on.When the game was young and failing they were kind and open to the playerbase, and even accepted criticism, as they needed their fans if they were going to keep their jobs. However, as the game gained traction, thanks to many of us investing even when no one else would, the Devs changed. They no longer accepted ANY criticism about the game and began silencing any that weren't a bunch of Yesmen. Now that they had $$ coming in they could care less about the players but the most elite high paying $$ players.Funnily... The Devs, time and again, said that what happens on the Forum and the Game were separated from each other.That was a lie.If you're ""punished"" or ""silenced"" on the forums for revealing these truths they will GLADLY accept your money still yet you're never ONCE told that you lose access to Support. So if you need a Refund, your account is compromised, or ect.? You're on your own but it's ""okay"" (/sarcasm) as they'll still take your money!So if you aren't a high payer that brings in a lot of $$ than your opinion means NOTHING to them. While those that did pay a lot of $$ to the game? They're treated as if they're Gods/Goddesses whom the Mods protect even as they abuse other users who're free or didn't pay as much $$. And the Rules? It doesn't apply to them at all.-An Unbalanced Mess for the $$-It's clear that new Heroes were meant to be the ""Best of the best"" as nearly every new Hero has been leagues higher than nearly every other character before it. In some cases they were literally the best of the best with the competition being so far behind. Such as with the release of Venom whose was extremely broken.This is all part of the Pay2Win system they have. It wasn't bad early on but, like many things, that changed as Gaz started getting the $$ and no longer ""needed"" the fans any longer.This is all to get you to buy the latest Hero as they're simply built to be better than the Heroes before them in every way.Furthermore Hero Synergies and soon Team-Up Synergies mean that those who don't put forth the $$ are at a severe advantage and then there's the highly unbalanced Omega System that doesn't reward skill, it rewards those that have the most free time to grind it out. Heck, Gaz altered the Omega System to make it even SLOWER than before. There's simply no way a non-grind player can match up to that guy sporting +10 Fighting and other goodies from the Omega System.Prices are STILL ridiculous, even for old costumes/heroesThere's no excuse for the prices of many of the costumes - especially older costumes. Not even ""Enhanced"" fit the high price point on them and these ""Variants"" have very little added them beyond a slightly altered look yet they cost nearly as much as Enhanced? Ridiculous.Gaz REFUSES to lower the prices of very old Heroes and Costumes despite many of us PAYING fans begging them to do this so that the game could appeal to more players and entice more to become paying customers. This is because we wanted the game to grow and have a healthy fanbase as well as for more people to enjoy a game that we saw had so much potential.Heck, we were ripped off about Team-Ups as well. I was one of many that bought the original Team-Up Pack and let me tell you this - We did NOT get what was advertised. What we got was a passive boost where the characters we bought aren't even there to serve as our ""Team-Up"". Sure there's talk of a ""Revamp"" but I have no faith in it.Gameplay... Is not challenging at all.This game is extremely easy, if you're one of the ""newer"" Heroes, while it can be extremely frustrating if you're one of the ""Older"" characters like Captain America or Daredevil. Furthermore many Heroes play VERY similar to each other with the new Heroes obviously doing everything better because if a Hero isn't broken at launch it cannot rake in that $$, no?Challenge... The game has none at all. Everything but Red Raids can be done mindlessly, though only the ""best"" Heroes have good clear times, while Red Raids themselves? An unbalanced mess where only ""certain"" Heroes are allowed in because the MANY other Heroes, not to lack of player skill, cannot compete due to outdated concepts or simply poor design even after being ""remade"" with the 52 mess which is a direct jab at DC's New 52.It's a multiplayer game... So why am I alone?This game does little to promote ""teaming up"" with other players or building meaningful friendships with other players. The leveling experiences suffers GREATLY from this. It's far more efficient to be Anti-Social in this game and grind it out yourself while leveling and even at Max level as you do the same Cosmic Terminals over and over again. That is boring, heck Green Raids can be pugged as well while only the more ""Elite"" are allowed the ""Honor"" of being in Red Raids so unless you're ready to devote a stupid amount of time grinding the same content over and over again you are out of luck there.Furthermore, the experience gain without any Synergies or Boosts is appalling in this game. I've had many friends/family quit at the level 40 and 50 marks because it took FOREVER to level up and there was literally nothing I could do to help them out as they refused to grind out the same content over and over just so they can get to 60 to grind Omega Points which take a very long time.-Drop rates are horrendous-I've only had 1 costume drop for me and it was a dupe in all my time that I've played this game. Even during events like the Cow/Omega/Cosmic/Midtown Monday Madness event(s) and running at 600% boosts in everything I didn't see a single costume drop or even a rare Artifact drop at all. The drop rates in this game are simply put... Horrendous. The Devs have even nerfed said rates for specific ""rare"" artifacts before because they were dropping at ""unintended rates"" so had to be ""adjusted"" to the ""intended rates"".The Devs want to have a ""Loot Hunt"" but if someone is running at 600% boosts during events and still doesn't see what they're looking for even after MANY hours of repeating the content then there's a HUGE problem. Many times drop rates have been brought up and over and over again yet Dev's ignore the fans and even go as far as ""silencing them"" by deleting posts/topics, issuing bans, and all kind of intimidation tactics so as not to ruin the ""Image"" they want to sell.-Closing-This game has so much wasted potential all because of greed. All that good will they wanted to form and to show that they ""cared""? All of it was an act to get $$ from their fans, with lies and unkept promises, and the moment they got enough of that $$ and a steady revenue they betrayed and threw under the bus those very same passionate fans that helped to keep the game alive even during its darkest hour.I've invested so much time and money in the past towards this game as well as the forums, to share views/opinions/ideas (Some of which the Devs took like my suggestion towards making Power Cosmic only have 1 Sphere... You're welcome, it was heck when it was 2 Sphere.) towards improving the game because I wanted it to succeed, and I can honestly say that I regret it because the Gaz that I respected and  supported  for so long is no longer around, they were replaced by pure greed who doesn't care about the fans at made them into who they are to this day.

												I had a negative review for the game that reached the word limit and had more than 3000 thousand votes but I deleted it in anticipation of this update. I also want to point out that I have close to 1000 hours with the standalone client too and spent too much money to write here without feeling ashamed.Now that its out I can easily say these:-Dont even think about playing this game if you had over 200 hours before the patch.-Dont play this game if you are expecting something that requires a little bit of thought.-Dont play this game if you want to get loot.-Dont play this game if you are bothered by constant glitches and bugs.-Dont play this game if you want to play a optimized Unreal Engine 3 game in the year 2017.I dont know what can I say about this update and the game in general. Only proper contents they added between mid 2014 and today were the Muspelheim raid and the  Omega System. Raid didnt get much attention because the big part of the playerbase didnt want to bother playing with other people or paying attention to mechanics and they turned Omega System to the Paragon system from Diablo 3.They just cant manage to optimize this game even though its a 5 year old game running on a 10 year old engine but I want to believe that they are trying their best. It used to be that when you set the options to Medium or High you got more fps compared to Low and game crashed less back in 2015, at least Low gives more fps now.This update also introduced a lot of broken mechanics and bugs at every aspect of the game. Everyone accepted the fact that with each weekly patch Gazillion introduced more bugs than they fixed. But considering the size and scope of this update, its really not surprising how many game breaking bugs are there.Now comes the worst parts of the update:-Removing the credit stashes and increasing the price of important parts of crafting.-All skills maxed at level 20 instead of 50.-Skill bar limited to 8 skill instead of how many skills you wanted to use.-Some talent trees are forcing you to use certain skills.-Limited movement(thanks to gamepads)-Redesigning the whole game for gamepads/consoles-Oversimplifying an already easy and casual game. This game was planned as a simple ""family game"" but it changed a lot over the years both visually and mechanically but now its back to its roots except visuals didnt revert back.Also hero designers at Gazillion really ♥♥♥♥ed me in the ♥♥♥ by screwing up my favorite hero, Nova. He was already in a bad state mechanically and visually but now he is a complete joke. You can either throw yellow balls with him or hit the enemies with punches that cant even touch them because of the amateur developers. Gaz always had developers who were either bad at their job or just amateurs but even after firing more than half of the team and hiring new poeple nothing has changed.I just hope that people who started playing the game recently comments about how Im only a whiner and not open to changes. I cant stomach the Gazillion fanboys though, they will eat anything Gazillion puts infront of them.			"

												I've played this game for 2 years now. I would have more than 900 hours had I used the steam version. Change is hard, change is difficult. Change is good in general, but not in this case. I came back after months of not playing and it's completely garbage. The whole system was perfect the way it was and it was way easier to learn and adapt. I have no idea why they had to touch it and fix the unbroken. I wouldn't recommend coming back if you're a veteran player.			"

												To whom it may concern:This game is dead. I've been playing Marvel Heroes since 2014, spent almost 1k hours in this game and a bunch of money too. I am not a whale but I could be considered an endgamer because that basically what I do since more than a year now. I started doing this - optimizing DPS, playing the highest difficulty modes, farming perfect 100% gear, etc. - because it was the only ""joy"" I had with Marvel Heroes. Now this joy is gone. Let me explain:Marvel Heroes is incredibly crowded with bugs, they are everywhere. Hero power bugs, user interface bugs, tooltip bugs, you name it, Marvel Heroes has it. Some of those insanely annoying bugs have been in the game since years . To give some examples: 1) Patrol zones are areas where there's a ton of loot drops. Most of these drops appear on your screen edges and stay there. The thing is now that the loot is not worth picking up (even in the highest difficulty a normal non-endgamer wouldn't pick up that trash). As a consequence, all over your screen's edges are little UI elements that tell you there's an item laying around and therefore covering essential UI information such as the power bar (yes, you won't see your skills and coolowns then), mission log and proc/buff table. A game that prevents you from seeing your own skills? That's even new to me.2) There are plenty of heroes in this game, I'm yet to find one who doesn't suffer in one way or another from one or multiple bugs. The thing here is, Gazillion (the developers) needs ages, if they do at all, to fix these bugs. With the latest version (Cosmic artifact patch) a new iteration of Blade was introduced. Blade was released in October 2015. That was the first treatment Blade got, however it didn't change any of his bugs. It introduced more bugs to his power kit. A powerful quote from the forums: Originally posted by DADMSH: You [Gazillion, the developers] are quick to address issues when they benefit the player and slow to address issues which hurt players3) With Gazillion's ""BIGGEST UPDATE EVER"" they reworked lots of heroes and game mechanics, introducing a new difficulty slider. The highest difficulty, Cosmic, is a crazy mess right now. It's a very high risk game mode, with little to no reward. Again, with the latest version, they introduced new ""cosmically enhanced artifacts"" (basically endgame artifacts) which are locked behind incredibly low drop rates and don't even replace the old artifacts in the loot tables of cosmic difficulty modes. What I'm saying is, the reward is basically still pretty much non-existant because you won't see it. And because we were talking about bugs earlier, a rather funny note: Cosmically enhanced artifacts can currently drop without their cosmic affix.There are plenty more factors that play a role in my decision to say ""Marvel Heroes is dead"", such as Gazillion's communication, game design, hero design, but in the end I think you can summarize that the design and philosophy of Marvel Heroes is not sustainable. They introduce an update, promising big (Gaz would have said ""biggest"") improvements to the game, and yet we're still waiting for the game that doesn't hurt playing. They want us to be patient since years (!) while not giving any visible and noticeable improvement to the game. Fellow gamers, potential players, developers,there is a reason for those negative reviews. I'm not hurt by all those changes to the game, I'm at a point where I see that the philosophy behind Marvel Heroes is not and will not work out in a positive way. It's obvious that this game is preparing for a console launch, however with that kind of game philosophy and design the game is destined for doom even on a new platform.			"

												I spent from May to December last year playing Marvel Heroes. I wasn't around before that to see how far the game progressed from its first state. Still, I enjoyed playing, but that's all over now. After the latest and largest patch on January 19th, I can not longer recommend this game. We knew it was coming months ago. We tried it out on the test center. Most of us hated it. That's why I had decided to quit before the update even came. But I was still curious to check it out once it hit.I had 44 of the 59 possible heroes at level 60, with a handful being from green to red prestige and two at cosmic prestige, as well as 36 team-ups at level 60. After 592 hours in eight months and $615.00 spent in the game (about $77 a month), I don't take this negative review lightly. I don't regret the time or money I spent. I had a lot of fun. But if this is truly the path Gazillion is going to take, regardless of how the majority feel, I won't give another hour or another dollar to this game.			"

												So, fair to say I liked this game a lot... a real lot. It was what Diablo 3 should have been. Point system powers. Add points into the powers you wanted to use. Brilliant! Even better though, it's Superheroes. A virtual plethora of heroes and villains to play and have fun with in classic isometric hack'n'slash fun. What more could you ask for?Well, all of that's gone now. A patch has arrived that rivals the levelling of Pompei and brought the whole joy of playing this game crashing to the ground. These changes have been sprouted as making the game better, but all I see with these changes, are that they were necessary to make to sell the game to the console market. Nothing to do with improving the game at all. There was nothing wrong with the game. If it ain't broke... don't fix it!Oh yes, and on top of that, the patch has been rushed as there are numerous bugs and things 'turned off' as they aren't working properly. So in this new iteration of Marvel Heroes, I cannot recommend this game. Pray some miracle occurs and there's a sudden 'CTRL-Z'. Whoever thought this change up should be taken out to the back paddock. "

												The Super Hero ""Diablo"" that could. What initially was a very lack luster super hero diablo-esque, action rpg has evolved very quickly into a casually enjoyable Marvel experience. Players play as their favorite hero and procede down a condensed set of recent Marvel Comics story arcs written or supervised by Brian Michael Bendis, the prime writer for past and some current Avengers, X-Men and Spider-Man books. Those familiar with dungeon crawler style Action RPGs will quickly understand the controls and camera perspective.Despite some performance issues, the game is still enjoyable. However some will become turned off by the fact that you and many others can be playing the same hero in the same space at the same time. Once you get past those initial hangups, its smooth sailing.The Free 2 Play store model sells characters, costumes and services but the player is able to earn them with enough work.			"

												I've been playing this game on and off since beta. I've put a stupid amount of money into the game, a mistake I always say I won't make, but end up doing so anyway. I have all but 9 characters, most of them max leveled and geared. I had about 8-10 of them really geared. I've likely spent over 2,000 - 3,000 hours played since I didn't play it on steam until around the time of the 1st anniversary. I've done everything at a top tier level. Was Top 100 in all CDR Tourneys 3x in a row before I last quit without using any exploits, not being 100% geared, and only using FOTM characters 1/3 of the time and that was mainly because my non-FOTM chars had their movement abilities negated for that tournament. So I decided to check out Marvel Heroes again today after a long break due to seeing the Iron Fist show and remembering how much I liked playing him in this game. He used to be one of the best designed characters. Obviously I was looking to play him and burn off some of that hype. I logged into the game to find myself cluttered with like 50 different crap items that aren't even max rolled, my main -- Black Panther, stripped of his Holobody visual (Which I busted ♥♥♥ in a DR tournament to get with him a ways back. Good thing I earned like 5 others) and my maxed Crit Dmg rolls are gone. Some of my characters have bound versions of these crapalysts, yet BP didn't. Probably missing more. I'm not wasting time to check nearly the entire roster. I have zero interest wasting my time sorting through nonsense I did not want or ask for. I thought the point of this big update was to make life simpler on people? Instead it's undoing all my effort and making me extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥. You even changed stat bonuses, so now all my +Fighting enchants on my gear are next to worthless since INT is the new DPS stat apparently. You have any idea how long it's going to take to farm for new stat enchants for the number of chars I have? Do you understand the amount of dumb, incompetent failures I had to suffer through in my raids to even get this far? Seriously. I don't want to do that any more than I absolutely have to. No one should. These are the things you need to think about before you make sweeping changes.All the saved costume cores I had seem like shadows of their former selves and hardly worth saving in my bank anymore. I heard you nerfed Iron Fist into oblivion both TTK and TTL-wise -- that ended the hype train real quick. So nice to hear you're still doing that to characters after all this time. Oh, and I'm not happy AT ALL about the Omega System being scrapped after what seemed like endless, mindless grinding to max my former Omega Points before I took a break. Thanks for that. Really appreciate having my time and money wasted on this game. Only took me 5 mins to decide to uninstall this garbage and never look back after logging in today. I kind of disliked Gazillion as a company before, but learned to just accept this was nothing more than a cash grab item farming game that wasn't really going to ever climb to any great heights. Somehow it managed to sink lower though. That..was unexpected. Whomever thought of implementing these changes all at once without taking a vote is a complete fool and would be fired instantly if I was in charge. That's how badly they messed up. I'd see you blackballed from real game development and banished to the world of Facebook gaming forever. There's so many things that're still broken in this game even after a year or longer that you could've really fixed instead such as entire characters like Venom or Spidey. You could've made new raid content, or found a way to improve co-op or multiplayer gameplay outside of these boring patrols. You had to choose to ""fix"" what's not broken and in turn lay ruin to everything just like you always do. Very foul and unwise. My advice to anyone starting out is not to bother.  You might find a character you love, waste months gearing it close to perfection, only to find the character or items ruined by devs. Repeat to infinite, because that's what always happens. Like a sudden category 5 hurricane hopping from character to character. There's no security with your time spent here. Which is a death sentence to any MMO in my opinion. Take it how you will, but don't say no one warned you. I haven't kept up with it, but Path of Exile is probably a better bet if you want an item hunting MMO. When I last played it, it was far more in depth, ran smoother on a superior engine, looked better, and was probably the only F2P game that's ever done a cash shop in a proper, non-intrusive way. I'm probably never going to play it again, but if that genre is what you're looking for, that or D3 are pretty much your only quality bets. At least until some crazy Korean titles I've seen come here, if ever.			"

												From the original boring wasteland that was this game three years ago to this gem of an ARPG, Marvel Heroes hits so many of the right notes when it comes to fun, fast, engaging, and ultimately satisfying gameplay.My first experience with Marvel Heroes was their introduction at PAX East 2013. Like most, I was awe-struck by the promises of an mmo, isometric, loot hunt set in the Marvel Universe. Down foes with Cyclops' laser eyes? Bounce Captain America's shield between baddies? Yes please; count me in.And in I was with my Starter Pack pre-order, that is until the game's release. Maybe it was the bright lights, raised staged, or Ms. Marvel's cosplayer, but my ten minutes with the beta was enough to convince me to buy-in. Then June 2013 rolls around, and instead of seeing my childhood heroes brought to life in adorable, isometric, diablo-esque fashion, I'm greeted with painfully slow progress, a static, lifeless environment, with not a lot to do. I could swing around as Spider-Man and not much else, until now.Perhaps I have the 3-year Anniversary Event to thank, but all that time has made a huge difference for Marvel Heroes. It feels like a game transformed. There is so much that is not only right with this game, but innovative. Everything you do contributes to your overall power in some way: leveling a new hero, playing an old one, bringing along a team-up hero, feeding a pet unwanted loot, donating rather than selling to vendors, exploring, passing cosmic trials. My personal favorite? Synergies.Synergies are account-wide stat and affix bonuses earned by playing with different heroes. Rather than feeling beholden to one ""Main,"" you're encouraged to experiment with new heroes. Best of all, synergy buffs make thematic sense in the Marvel Universe. Level up Spidey and you'll be harder to hit thanks to a +4% dodge rating. Level up the Hulk and you've got 6% more health. That may not seem like a lot, but consider activating 10 synergies at the same time and the benefits start to add up.Likewise, each new hero you bring to level cap increases all experience gains in the future (up to +200%), making subsequent heroes that much easier to level. Even if you don't reach the level 60 cap, bonuses are awarded at levels 30, 50 and 60. While your level 60 Silver Surfer nets you +5% experience, even your middling Black Cat is helping with +3%.  And that's the general theme of the game: all of your actions are rewarded.Working in tandem with your heroes' powers and synergies is the ""Omega Program"". Regardless of whether you are playing a new hero or the same hero over and over, all experience earned also counts towards unlocking Omega points. The ""Omega"" system  allows you to spend unlocked points on 14 sub-sections in exchange for additional account-wide boosts (think Skyrim's node system), allowing you to tailor your strengths the way you like to play. Like your power specializations, your Omega points can be reset and respent at any time.But what if bouncing around a roster of ~56 super heroes doesn't interest you. You can always just level the same hero multiple times through the Prestige system. Granting more bragging rights than tangible rewards (besides an extra default costume), the Prestige system actually changes the color of your in-game name for everyone to see your dedication to that specific hero. A white or green name may indicate someone's fleeting interest, an orange or red name may mean they are currently playing a favored hero, and a yellow name exemplifies undying devotion. Earning a yellow name, also known as Cosmic prestige, takes 25 times longer than usual to level, affording the player unparalleled expertise. Green, Blue, Purple, Orange, and Red, on the other hand, all take as long as the standard 1-60 route, which is to say not long at all. A savy player will stack bonuses, buffs, and knowledge of the story-mode in their favor, cutting their 1-60 time to as little as 30 minutes (mind you, that is only for the most dedicated players. I managed to get my time down to 90).Along with heroes and their relevant account-wide synergies, you can also have a Team-Up hero. Also known as TU's, these heroes act as AI-controlled escorts that can attack, taunt or heal depending on their available powers. And much like your own character, they have their own gear and abilities for you to spec. Not in the mood for a companion? Then change your TU's specialization to an ""Away"" spec which provides you and your party with extra damage, healing over time, or any other number of advantages. All of this and I have yet to mention to loot, and there is lots of it.In direct opposition to some of the more horrible design trends/flaws in gaming of the past few years, Marvel Heroes throws loot at you, from everywhere and all the time. My past week with the game has made me all but forget Diablo 3 at release, or all of The Division (that dumpster fire of a game). You're not slogging through uninspired incursions for one chance at one piece of loot that has three layers of RNG stacked against. No. Instead, everything you find is either hero-specific gear or all-accessible gear.And no matter what you find, you're always upgrading. Always trying new builds and new pieces of gear, because respeccing is free, just like the multiple specs you can have on each hero. But even gear you don't want is useful, serving as a donation to grow the in-game crafter or enchanter, allowing those vendors to expand their selection.And if all of that doesn't get you, then how about a pet system with pets that are actually useful. More than just a cosmetic tag-along a la Path of Exile, these pets will happily suck up those unwanted drops (literally, it's called a cybernetics vacuum). Vacuumed items are tallied according to their rarity until you hit that rarities threshold. Give your pet a few hundred common items, and they'll give you an additional 8% health. Give them 180 cosmic items and they'll increase all your powers by one. And if you don't like the bonuses your pet is providing, your crafter can help reroll any number of them (at the price of having to vacuum up loot of that rarity again). Best of all, if you happen to get lucky and find a new pet that you love, the crafter will swap the boosts between them.I'm not sure who to thank, whether it be Gazillion Entertainment or Secret Identity Studios, but the developers have been making all the right decisions by taking an active interest in raising everyone's in-game quality of life. So how do these guys make money?! While Marvel Heroes is free-to-play, the one bottleneck is Stash space. Though a couple of extra tabs can be unlocked for free, and hero-specific Stash tabs come in hero bundles (like the Civil War bundle that was on sale for $2.50), you will eventually have to make the choice between 'travelling light' or giving in to the gamer hoarder in you. Some might argue that unlocking heroes can be seen as another pay wall, but even the average player will have no problem unlocking random heroes at a reasonable pace.Regardless, and this is coming from a life-long gamer that detests F2P/P2W/IAP monetization garbage, there is enough enjoyable gameplay here that whatever money you do choose to spend on Marvel Heroes will be money well spent. Now if you don't mind, I have a newly unlocked Scarlet Witch that has been calling my name.			"

												The ""Biggest Update Ever"" killed a lot of what made this game fun for me. To be fair, most of the streamlined (see: dumbed down) features such as 1 hotbar, infinity system, etc., are disappointing but can be tolerated. What I can't and will never see past are the movement nerfs.I can't blame the developers for wanting to evolve their game, but I think it's become apparent that they don't have a grasp of what made their game fun in the first place. Either that or they just simply couldn't care less about the current PC playerbase since their not-so-secret console port is just around the corner.			"

												With the help of David Brevik (the guy that made D2) and an amazing developer team, Marvel Heroes went from a game that few enjoyed to a truly one of a kind ARPG experience. Unfortunately, David Brevik left a year ago to advise the Chinese release of Path of Exiles.The new team is focused entirely on getting Marvel Heroes ready for consoles, and that means neutering much of what once made the game great. Movement abilities have been changed fundamentally that makes most previous movement builds unplayable. The console 1.0 update (BUE) has also dramatically changed the pricing model that worked extremely well for years. A system where players felt like they were actually contributing to the better of the game by unlocking things quicker in the shop for real money over taking the longer route of unlocking for free, but now new/free players are getting squeezed, and pay only exclusives are on the rise.A year ago I would have emphatically recommended Marvel Heroes. Today I wouldn't. Who knows, maybe the developers will turn this around, but with this just being the first update in many gearing towards getting the game ready for consoles, I'm willing to bet the worst isn't behind us.

												670+ hours in the game; spent over a thousand dollars on the store. Cannot recommend the game any longer. The latest update is absolutely trash. -Charges on dash powers-Wind up duration on travel powers.-All the gear you've spent countless hours farming from bosses due to low drop rates? Soon to be completely useless. -Difficulty sliders with worse loot. -My entire roster (every Hero at 60  + some prestiged) feel completely nerfed. -Skill tree's dumbed down-Infinity Stone system almost a carbon copy of D3 Paragon which offers no ACTUAL diversity (If you don't take +INT over the other 4 options, you're doing it wrong).  This is just a smidgeon of my issues with 'The Biggest Update Ever'. I doubt I'll be playing this game much, if at all, in the future.  "

												Used to be my favorite online game, now they have completely changed everything that was fun about it.I have probably spent about two hundred dollars in game, and I regret it completely now.The new ""Infinity System"" is just completely useless, and changed my overall aspect of character customization. They've changed the power/skill tree in ways that I cannot even fathom.The new update has completely changed my view on this game. Biggest Update Ever? Biggest pile of ♥♥♥♥ update ever more like. Would have recommended this game in the past, but definetly not now. Although I don't have nearly the amount of hours clocked as some, I still have a fair amount. All I can say is listen to the people who have more hours clocked than I do, that should be enough.			"

												This most recent update homogenized the game almost to the point of unplayability. I used to love zipping around the screen as Silver Surfer, just a blur of board and cosmic rays. Now, I'm sluggish and unresponsive. Doctor Strange used to be one of my favorite builds, with a bunch of one-point wonders, a spell for every situation, and a need for fast reflexes to keep this glass cannon alive. Now I'm just a glass cannon with extremely limited escape mechanisms. And Elektra. Oh man, when she came out, she was death on high heels. I was everywhere at once, I WAS the shadows. Now? Unplayable.I get that they wanted to make things hard and Diablo 3-ify the game in preparation for the console release, but here's the thing: if I wanted to play D3, I'd play it. When I want to have a classic Brevik-style teleporting ROFLstomp and ACTUALLY feel like a superhero, I'd play Marvel Heroes.I miss how when I used to play certain characters, it was like I had to take on the psychology of the character. If I'm Punisher, I stand and fight and mow everything down. If I'm Ant-Man, I distract with ants, bounce around, and then set up in the middle for a Giant Man Stomp. If I'm Venom, I burst into the fray and grab everything within eating distance.Builds used to be so much more free-form, but now with tiered talents, you're forced to take one of three choices every six or so levels after 32. Half the time I want two out of the three options (so I can almost play the character the way they're meant to be played) and the other half of the time, all three options are for abilities I'm never using. Gazpls.  Srsly.  Even some quick fixes like giving everyone a dedicated dash and signature button would help, because then we'd at least have 10 abilities rather than being hamstrung at 8. My Sorcerer doesn't feel so Supreme anymore, my Spider-man's not so Amazing, and my Thor is very very very far from Mighty.I'm glad I didn't spend money on this game when I considered it recently. I know you guys spent a lot of time and effort on these changes, but they're just bad. I'm sure it's not under consideration, but the best thing you could do at this point is just roll the patch back entirely.			"

												The Biggest Update Ever... that has no new content whatsoever.Gazillion has gone steadily downhill after the people with the most talent left the company. They had promised us higher quality updates, in a compromise for having less frequent ones. What we got instead were fewer heroes, and a couple terminals. I don't consider all the Marvel movie tie-in events as ""content"". Sure, they are new, and some of them were even pretty fun. But guess what? You can't do any of them right now. You might be able to do them again sometime in the future, but currently, they are NOT content you can do and enjoy.It seems their sole focus for the entire year of 2016 was ""new player retention"". The constant revamps of Story Mode, the redesigns of the Tutorial instance, and other pointless endeavors that all amount to nothing in the end. The Biggest Update Ever (known as BUE) is the ultimate culmination in this ""do nothing"" year for Marvel Heroes. They sacrificed an entire year with endless revamps of things that are ultimately pointless in an effort to retain new players who will inevitably have nothing to do and get bored and quit.What's the point of ""new player retention"" if you put zero effort into ""old player retention""? Either the new player quits right away and there's nothing you can do about it, or they become an ""old player"" and quit due to the complete lack of content because your focus is on all those shiny new wallets that haven't bought anything yet.Let's put things into perspective. The last significant content update, ie something completely new and not just another terminal or rehashed patrol zone was the Danger Room. The Danger Room was released in late 2015. I know that developers complain that players burn through content faster than they could possibly create it, but come on. Over a year with nothing new but story mode or terminals.It's ironic, really. In all their effort to revamp the game, they completely ignored the things that they should have focused on. The Holo-Sim and X-Defense modes have gone basically untouched since they were released. They have horribly outdated rewards and go relatively unplayed by the community at large. They could have put the smallest effort into updating these two modes to be comparable with the modern day Marvel Heroes, and it would have given us two entirely ""new"" modes to enjoy.In the end, the BUE is nothing but a promise that things might get better in the future. All the movement changes, the attributes, the item mechanics, the constant changing of Heroes (some for the worse), and more, all equate to a giant step sideways at best. Given the current state of the game, there is a large population of people who believe that it was a step in the wrong direction.2017 marks the first year where Marvel Heroes forgoes their usual re-branding of the game in order to garner better reviews. They have nothing to show over the previous branding, and they know it. Only time will tell if all their excuses about the movement changes allowing for better game design will turn out to be true. Given their track record on promises, I have zero faith in their ability to design content that isn't just ""stay out of the red circle"".Would I recommend this game to anyone, at present? Absolutely not. Brevik left for Path of Exile, and you should too.			"

I have most of the characters, have a  ton of character bank tabs and other bank tabs and have done all of the raid content. This update literally screwed people like me who have played for a long time. I was so sick with the big update that i quit playing for a week, checked back in and SSDD, wait a week, SSDD, and so on. My character banks became useless since there is no exchanging uniques for different things. What they did to the Omega system is just terrible because you can't spend infinity points how you want. They are spread evenly throughout all trees and you have to spend them in a tree you don't even want. The character powers rework seems pretty good but everything else is just terrible if you are a veteran player. There are a few veterans that like the changes. Maybe the changes are better for new players. But the whole thing feels like a big middle finger to those of us that have put time and money into the game since the begining.			"

												Do you like Diablo/Torchlight/Path of Exile? If you do then check this game out. The game is F2P and lets you pick one of nine starter heroes that you can level to 60. Features story campaign, various replayable boss instance ""terminals"", 10 player co-op endless mob/boss wave zone (Midtown), 5-player survival mode (X-Defense), 5v5 PvP (Dota style mode), with more maps and modes coming in the near future. There are currently over 30 heroes and over 200 costumes with new ones added every month. Straight Talk: Game is fully F2P, no gated content (time or money). You have extremely limited storage space which means at some point you will buy more using real money. Heroes cost 200/400/600 ""splinters"" which drop one every 6-10 minutes, which gets you around 10-12 per hour of steady play. Heroes can cost $2 up to $15 apiece and costumes can range up to $20 for ""enhanced"" versions (addition animations/voice work). You CAN get costumes to drop in-game, but the drop rate is ridiculously rare (I have none in 700 hours). Best bet for new players is if there is a specifc hero and costume you want to play, either pick up a bundle on the website or in-game store (combo would probably cost around $20).The developers are extremely dedicated to this game and regularly interact with the community via the forums and live streams. Player feedback is used often in design decisions, and the game is patched weekly. One new hero is added per month (sometimes surprise heroes are added in between, such as Taskmaster and Loki) and other game content is rapidly being added or revamped.			"

												This was my go to game when I had nothing else new and shiny to play.  Usually there would either be a new character(s) to level and learn or new areas to try.  Sadly the latest update done in January 2017 veered too much away from what I enjoyed in original game, having several dozen options of playing every hero and always feeling powerful no matter the options chosen.  Every hero became way simpler to play, losing nearly all the customization options that were available.  Plus the characters were general weaker, took more damage and did less damage as well.  The old system wasn't perfect, but it's obvious from the choices made here it was less about improving user enjoyment of the game and instead prepping the game to be playable on consoles.  To be frank the new customization system was unintelligable, it only works as there are so few options.  If you're looking for something where you have 8 actions choices and that's it enjoy, otherwise there are better ARPG options out there now.  Hopefully this works for the company in the long run, but I can't recommend this game any longer.			"

												Sorry guys, you've missed the boat on this one.   I've played Marvel Heroes since beta testing, clocked over 1000 steam hours which was after playing a couple years already at that point, and I'm sorry to say I'm turning in my founder's hat as the games pretty much done.  There was a system change to market the game for consoles which stripped out the majority of the flavor and novelty that the game held.  There are so few superhero PC games that it's a shame that they lowered everything down to 30 fps limpware console specs but thats what they did to it.  If you're a console player and Gazillion is still in business to distribute this game to consoles, it's now reduced to about the average linear grind crap you're used to so you might as well play it, gamers though ought not waste their time on this anymore. Cheers!			"

												If you are looking for a great Free 2 Play MMOARPG, Marvel Heroes 2016 is an amazing choice. It's like Marvel's Ultimate Alliance meets Diablo 2. Not only is it a great game, it also has a great community and dev team to match. A portion of the dev team are very active on the forums and communicate with the members of the community as well as play the game themselves. I played many hours on the regular client before I started playing on steam. I've been around since beta and have almost 1,000 hours in the game. There's a nice mix of 58 playable characters such as Spiderman, Dr. Strange,Moon Knight, Xmen, Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, Fantastic Four, Thunderbolts(Venom, Green Goblin, Elektra, etc.), and more! They just recently added Ultron! You can test out all the characters to level 10 to see which one you want to unlock first. As you play the game you will earn in game currency, which will allow you to unlock playable characters as well as other things such as team ups, and pets. You can level playable characters to Level 60 and once there you can further your progress with the Omega System. The Omega System is a huge ""skill tree"" if you will, where you can continue to customize and develop your characters even further! Want a different look for your playable characters? There's currently over 425 costumes, which is a whole hell of a lot of costumes! Costumes you mainly acquire from purchasing for real cash, HOWEVER each character you can unlock, comes with a default costume. Once you reach level 60 you can choose to start back at level 1 and take them back to level 60(prestige). You can prestige each of them numerous times, and each time you do it gives you a default costume.  You can then take 3 costumes to the crafter and blend them together for any random costume that in the game. Not only that but there is a small chance to get a costume as a loot drop as well. As you might notice some of the older costumes might not look as good as some of the newer ones, but don't worry as they have already started giving visual updates to them. Emma Frost just recieved hers and she looks amazing! Next up is Hulk!Not only are there currently 58 playables, there's also 50 team ups that you can get to fight along side your playable heroes, most of which can be unlocked just by playing the game. There's also a slew of pets, over 45, which include Bamf!, Doop, Spider Ham and a mini Blackbird! There's also tons of achievements where you can get special costumes, team ups, and other kool stuff. There is one thing I do suggest you buying if you love collecting lots of loot are stash tabs. This is one item that you can't normally get from just playing, you need to purchase them with real cash.(Gaz has given some away in the past during events). If you love the game it's definitely worth purchasing and showing the support and help fund the continued development of the game.As far as content is concerned, the game has a good amount. Currently it has 3 different Patrol zones(Midtown Manhattan, Industrail City, and Secret Invasion) with 2 difficulties that you can play solo, group with up to 4 others, or just join people to complete missions and battle lots of villians in the Marvel Universe. There's an Age Of Ultron zone where you can team up with 4 other people to clear missions and battle Ultron. This mode will soon be getting an even greater difficulty. There are 14 boss terminals with 3 difficulty levels in which you can run solo or group up with 4 other people, the newest is to battle Ultron. There's a 10 chapter story mode that takes you to places like the Savage Lands, Asgard, and Latveria. They are about to introduce Dynamic Level Scaling to the game where you will never outlevel the zone you are in and you can play with your friends no matter what level they are. They also have 3 side story mission zones known as One Shots where you can do solo or up to 4 other players to take on  Map Ape, Mr Hyde, Lizard, Kraven, and the Red Skull! Not to long ago, they also released the Danger Room which randomly generates secarios with different difficulty levels. You can solo them or group with up to 4 others(Cosmic difficulty is heavily aimed at group play). Marvel Heroes is also the first MMOARPG to introduce Raids! There are currently 2 different 10 man raids, one that takes place in Muspelheim where you battle the might Surtur(2 difficulties with different mechanics), and the other takes you Marvel Heroes version of the Axis story line where you battle a jacked up Red Skull/Onslaught(currently one difficulty). They will also be introducing a 5 man version of the Muspelheim raid soon. There's also 2 older modes that will be getting an overhaul down the road, the SHIELD Holo Sim and X Defense modes. Currently Holo Sim is a mode where you can take on waves of enemies that escalating difficulty that can be done solo or with one other person. Currently X Defense is aimed at group play for up to 5 players. Here you battle waves of enemies in the X Mansion to see how far you can go. They have a good variety of weeky alternating events which includes one event that takes you into Limbo to fight N'astirh and every Monday they have Midtown Monday's where one of the Patrol Zones has awesome loot!  Besides these events there's also Tournament with various visual prizes. Every few months they put on special events. For example, May was a month long Civil War event that that ran with the Civil War movie, and in June was 3 years of Marvel Heroes! If you read some other reviews you might seem people mentioning there are bugs that come with each patch. Obviously if you play online games you know this already, it's not going to be any different anywhere else. Also the game has had it's share of performance issues, mainly in busy Patrol zones but the devs are working constantly to improve the overall performance of the game. The launch was really rough and unplayable for some, but Marvel Heroes has come extremely far since then. You may see people posting they can't launch the game or that they are encountering errors. Often times these things can be fixed simply by verifying they integrity of the game cache or running steam as an admin.. or if you run the regular client repairing the files or running the MH client as an admin. Another thing I wanted to mention is some complain about character balancing. Balancing over 50 characters can't be an easy thing to do. Some devs can't do it with 6 characters, imagine having to do it with over 50.. so yes, some characters are stronger than others. However, the devs put forth effort each week to do the best they can at trying to balance the huge roster and taking in lots of players feedback. You also may see people complain here or on the MH forums that there's not enough content. As you can see above there's actually a good amount of zones and things to do in game. Often times when people are complaining about not enough content, it's not because there's not new or enough content but it's not content they wanted or preferred.. there's a big difference. I'm not joking when I say this, but new content when added to the game you will still see people saying we don't get new content lol.So as you can see the game isn't perfect, no game is. So expect things not to be perfect each week. The pros of this game outweigh the cons by far. Do I recommend this game? Hell yeah I do! I think this game is awesome and we have an absolutely amazing community which includes the dev team. We do have some trolls.. but what game doesn't. Some people just want to watch the world burn. What are you waiting for? Download the game and try it out for yourself.			"

												All of these changes are coming at a time when Marvel Heroes is expected to move to consoles soon, which is basically the reason for the changes.  What gets me the most is how some players claim these are 'good' changes, for ""balance"" and ""optimization.'  Baloney.  These changes are so the PS4 doesn't crash because the game was simply too fast for its processor :)Also so the game is easier for controller users to navigate through the PC-centric menus.  Instead of 3 powerbars with 8 powers each, you get 1 bar now.  Instead of power point allocation, no more power point allocation!  Instead of a unique and complex Omega system, you get a bland, watered down Infinity system which rips directly from Diablo 3!On another note, the same people who are defending this new Gaz development team (as other have stated, the creator, David Brevik and his team, who made the original Diablo games, left this company about a year ago, and this update is the result) are insulting and condescendingly making fun of anyone who rejects these decisions.   The community is toxic by any standards now and the devs seem to turn a blind to the antics of their white knight defenders..It's disgusting.Less movement on all heroes and now they all move the same completely breaking immersion and lore (Spiderman, a super quick hero, moves the same speed as Colossus, moves the same speed as Storm, moves the same speed as Wolverine, etc..) and teleporting heroes move the same as running heroes.  In other words, the lore aspect of the gameplay is DEAD.  Not to mention all the cool lore tidbits that were in the old Omega power point system.  Now we have this Diablo 3 Paragon replacement going on that limits the 170 something odd power points of the omega, down to 30!  Imagine PoE losing 70% of it's power points in the skill tree....It's an entirely different game now. People who are criticizing these changes are being insulted and ridiculed constantly by the white knights of Marvel and Gaz, even so much so as being banned for being flat out against these changes.  They're practically censoring all negative feedback, which goes to show the real whiners are the developers and their defenders, and not the people who are simply unhappy with the results.  All the negative reviews talk about very real, limiting, backwards changes to the game.  No more Eternity Splinter rewards from story mode quests, so it's gonna be a lot harder to unlock new heroes for new players.No more free default costumes after prestiging so you can blend 3 of them into a new random one (you still had to pay a good amount of credits plus some more or less rare mats for them, so you still had to work for them).No more power points (in an arpg who does this??)  The Infinity system and stat point allocation is broken!  At least the Omega system made sense when you put points into your preferred allocations (btw not everyone ran the same Omega configurations, not even for end game raids, not everyone follows Marvelheroes.info like a bible the way WOW players follow IcyVeins too).  The Omega system allowed for truly unique builds to emerge.  Now you have only 30 points to allocate round-robin style within 6 different trees..No more crafting!  Crafting has already been gutted as well since they removed unique item exchanges for credits, runes and relics (3 important items for end game progression) so that will be MUCH harder to grind as well..  And with the soon to be Omega items, all uniques will be obsolete anyway!  So much hard work / time / money just thrown away by the devs.  That's why veteran players are mad too, it's not just the movement nerf, it's EVERYTHING!  The only thing that hasn't changed is the Marvel name, the Hero roster, and the visuals.  Even maps aren't randomized anymore, like every other Diablo-like game / ARPG!  Now all the first few (6) chapter maps are the same everytime! It gets boring after the first time, since it's the same everytime now!  And they will do that to the rest of the chapters, too.Honestly this is the biggest FU a company could do to their players, and although I wish I had written a positive review while I was enjoying it months earlier, I write this negative reivew based on their recent ""Biggest Update Ever"" because it is an insult to David Brevik and the legacy he created, and it's a flat-out disregard for their PC player base in favor of an upcoming console market.I understand the company has to make money, but this is quickly turning into a P2P, P2W game.  This game is ruined.  And unless they make some drastic changes or revert at least some gameplay mechanics / systems back to how they were, don't let anyone tell you this is an improvement.  It's not, at all.  It's not that we don't like change.  Change is good, when it's good change.  This is a disasterous change to a once great game.  R.I.P Marvel Heroes.			"

												My go-to game has had the rug pulled out from under it by the devs themselves. The latest ""biggest update ever"" is just another half-cocked mess that they may or may not fix over the course of the year. Sweeping changes with little regard to over all enjoyment or balance has taken the fun out of Marvel Heroes. It took the fun out behind the shed and put it down.To ""slow down"" game play changes were made that basically neuter your heroes. You run slower, you travel slower, you deal less damage and take more damage. The Omega system, while a bit bloated, was infinitely more fun and interesting than the new Infinity System. The Infinity System is all about numbers, no room for fun effects when you can have .05% more critical chance. Experience points needed to advance in the Infinity System were massively increased, most likely to entice the sales of experience boosts.I've put quite a few hours into this game since it was in Beta. I've been through all the changes and rolled with it. This update was the straw that broke my back though. Look elsewhere to scratch your gaming itch.			"

												Tried the new changes here and thought it was a massive step backwards.From day one this game has been poorly managed and this patch is nothing short of disgraceful.Here is what i found from my short time back.-Omega Tree replalced by a infinity system with about as much deepth as a paddling pool.I liked having opitions now i have even less.-Movement powers now have charges which makes clearing tiresome and slow(POE are afraid to nerf this because they understand people enjoy moving fast).-The above does not make the game harder,for the most part boss AI is still as bad as it was before (looking at you Shocker and Juggernaunt)-Vet players have to regear,this would not be a problem if NEW CONTENT WAS ADDED but it's the same old content as before.-Old content like Raids,Holo Sim ,and X Defence are just ignored by the devs.-No more skill point investment meaning i have little to no imput on what skills i want to focus on,gearing has become as bad as Diablo 3.-The passive and trait system is just a homogenized mess,All heroes have pretty much the same passvies which makes it easy for a lazy developer to balance the game.Screw having Marvel Heroes that feel unique.In short this game has gone down the Diablo 3 road and making everything more casual.I would not recommend this game to anyone in it's current state.

												This used to be a great game until the recent patch. Now I can't recommend it to anyone. It went from being a fast-paced and fun beat-em-up to a slow, prodding, way-too-difficult chore to play. Even on the easiest difficulty the game is way too difficult for leveling a character, which really doesn't make you feel like much of a superhero. The movement changes and single hotbar just make the game intolerable to play at this point.I wanted to like it. I wanted to keep playing. I have desperately tried to find a way to make it enjoyable, but it's simply not. Every aspect of the game is slow, frustrating, and not fun.RIP Marvel Heroes. We had a good run.			"

												I'm here to state that I can no longer support this game anymore, not after this update.As a player of MH, I've personally clocked in over 1.1k hours, so my feelings on the game is not of someone who simply got on the game for a few days and decided that the game is no longer enjoyable.First off, I'm not an advocate against certain changes, because that can bring about new things that can potentially make the game more enjoyable.  However, many of these changes were either unnecessary (literally destroying years of investment, guides, setups etc in ONE patch) or just another implementation to getting more players to throw in $.- The Movement Speed Change -Absolutely 100% not a fan of this.  We went from moving at what felt like ""Super Human"" speeds to now a pace that feels more relevant to that of an actual human level.  It just feels so limited now, in contrast to before when you were flying, teleporting and dashing everywhere.The previous movement made the game feel far more fast paced which made it extremely fun, and more importantly, making you feel like you were really using a Super Hero.Since the speed nerf, and the limitations on dashes, the game obviously got slower, but more importantly the pace is just boring now.I've never been an advocate from going at 100mph to suddenly transitioning to less than half that speed.An example of another gaming genre...Street Fighter II Hyper Fighting to Super Street Fighter II.  Capcom increased game speed in SFII: Hyper Fighting which was an incredibly Popular implement for the players.  It had players having to think quicker, reacting faster, and just a more enjoyable all together SF game.However the next incarnation, SSF:II transitioned BACK to the Slower Speed of previous SF games, which detracted MANY of the player base.  This ultimately prompted Capcom into creating Super Turbo which reintroduced speeds similar to HF, but actually faster which once again made it enjoyable to most of the players.Speed in the game of MH matters a lot when you consider the big maps, and Terminals in which the entire focus is simply getting to the boss.  By adding things like the stalls or wind ups to traveling speed was bad enough, however because of the speed changes, I feel that it now has the opposite effect of what Gaz wanted.Players now are even more focused on simply getting to their objective due to this very reason, which hasn't stopped people from basically playing the same way they did before.Limited dashes, teleports having laughable range, which also indirectly hurts movement dependent heroes.  Also, Slowing things down did NOT make for a more Advanced Game.  People keep saying that the game is so much more strategical now...Please Stop the Nonsense. I mean gee, I have to click my hero to run slightly to the side now to avoid a Jugg charge unlike before.  Basically, Gaz just forced us into having to click a few more extra times now.   The current state would actually make More Sense if the Bosses were revamped to have diverse and unique attacks vs human players.  However NONE of that has changed, and thus we're left with the same linear bosses and the slow pace.I would argue that it would have been FAR more interesting and fun, if the bosses were made to compensate for the intense speed of the previous Marvel Heroes game prior to the speed nerf.All in All the Movement Speed is one of the Worst Changes/Nerfs to the Game, by far.- Omega System Changed to Infinity System -The Omega System with it's 10k total points (I only had about 7.9k Omega Points) allowed for some really creative allocations.  Yes, I understand that it was broken down pretty quickly and we pretty much understand what was really good and what wasn't.However we at least had flexibility to allocate the points to where we felt were best fit to maximize our potential.  Seeing people in forums talking about how putting certain points in here vs others made for some interesting builds, debates which made the game more Fun.Now we're severely limited on points and with allocations costing so much (Not to mention how long it takes to farm them), you're literally negating any sort of creativity but instead boxing people into a small room.  Not to mention obtaining unneeded and USELESS points into stats that would ultimately not have any relevancy to your particular Hero.  Does Jean need more Str?  Nope.  However Tough Luck.- Splinters - The New Implementation is simply set forth to ultimately get more players to having to pay real money.Never A Good Thing, period.Before people go ""Well they need to make money.""  Take into context that a Great and Enjoyable Game will ALWAYS Draw Money.  Heck, I bought the Majority of my Heroes in this game.However, hearing that New Players will no longer have access to a Free Hero, but being limited to only 400 splinters completely negates them from being able to pick up the 600 Splinter Heroes.  This effectively excludes popular Super Heroes like Iron Man, Spiderman, etc.How is this an improvement to what we had before?  A new player comes in, wants to play Spiderman but then realizes that they're 200 splinters short, so instead they're forced to playing an off hero that neither he/she wants in order to hopefully obtain the 600 requirement hero in the distant future?  Limiting players on their first Hero choice is a Perfect way of Detracting them from wanting to continue.Some may complain that getting free splinter boxes on log in was detrimental to the company, but that is once again, complete nonsense.One would have to be logging in without playing extensively for MONTHS+ to potentially getting a free hero, which is in no way a feasible way of doing things, so that excuse is an absurd one.This 100% is nothing but an implementation to garner more money from players while hiding behind the ""System Change"" statement.- Team Up Synergy - Sounds great on paper, however when you take into account that Team Ups can cost as much as a Hero, than you'll understand that once again, this is another change to simply Draw More Money.With the new team up synergy, people will have to be spending time not only for Heroes, but also for Team Ups if you plan to boost their damage capabilities.With the limitations on Splinters already, this will only put more stress upon the players as they will be needing not only Hero but Team Synergies as well.They could've done a Team Up Damage boost without ever having to involve obtaining more TU synergies.Let's Not pretend this wasn't another concept to getting players to throw more money at the company.- Removal of Free Costumes (Prestige) - Another option stacked on to basically make players shell out their wallets. Even when we had the Blending Option.  I still personally bought 99.9% of my Hero costumes, because the RNG blender was far to random with the ridiculous ratio of costumes one could have potentially gotten.  Almost always I got costumes for heroes I didn't even have, nor wanted.In fact, out of all the times that I have ever ran the blender, only two costumes were of any satisfaction to me.  Once again, another change to garner more money from players.- Exchanging Uniques for Credits Removed - Seriously?  What?  So how are we going to earn the Millions required into gearing our Heroes in the coming future for this overhaul?  In a game might I add that has literally about 60 Heroes and counting that are in the game?Even if you were only planning on gearing say 4-6 characters, with the lack of funding now with credits, and nothing to compensate this loss, the amount of grind required would be Astronomical.- Final Verdict (because I can't type anymore due to limitations) - Overall, in it's current state, I simply cannot recommend Marvel Heroes to anyone anymore.  I have uninstalled this game, and will likely never return, simply because I've about had it with Gaz.			"

												I've played the game over 2,400 hours through steam and well over 3,000 hours counting the time I played before the game was available on steam, including beta.The game held promise, but it has fallen flat. A superhero ARPG made by David Brevik, creator of Diablo II, should have been a home run, but it has been plagued by poor business decisions and an even worse design team.The game launched with little more than an incoherent story. Many of the ""launch"" characters were absent from the roster and the characters that were available simply shared copy and paste powers. The store sold characters and costumes at absurd prices, with more popular characters costing up to $20. These problems were eventually addressed to some degree, but the damage to the game's reputation had been done by then.The game relaunched with a new name to clear the overwhelmingly negative reviews on Steam. There had been some changes and new content added, but the same problematic developers remained. Deadlines were never met and new characters and content were launched in completely broken states. Old characters were never iterated upon and quickly became useless. Criticism on the forums was swiftly silenced.Most of the game's roster was eventually in such a bad shape that the development team had to launch a year and a half long process of completely remaking every character in the game. They did this while simultaneously releasing new characters, which caused hindered the development of both new and old characters. Feedback was frequently ignored and developers pushed broken products live after a few days of testing to simply move onto the next item on their agenda. Many of the characters have a long list of bugs which exist to this day, despite hundreds of posts about them on the forums over the years.The game limped along until they finally finished remaking their entire roster. The development team promised loads of new content, and dramatically diminished the number of new characters they planned to release to ""give them more time for other content."" This never came to fruition, as the developers have spent all of that time on altering the mechanics of the entire game for a console port (which they lied about to players for months). This has proven to be the nail in the coffin.Here is the game as it currently stands: Combat is slow, dull and uninteresting Characters are weak, fragile and have poor designs Many of the characters do not play like their comic counterparts (ex: Colossus spinning on his toes with outstreched arms) The story is poorly written and confusing There is very little content - terminal missions copied and pasted from the story, a two-player horde mode, a 5-player horde mode and a few zones with different maps but identical purposes and play experiences Drop rates for loot are pitiful Itemization is awful Earning anything for free takes months Movement is obnoxiously slow, causing you to miss out on open-world bosses unless you are there for the spawn The prices on the store are laughably highEnemies all feel the same There is no reason to interact with other players ""PvP"" is an absolute joke - probably the worst I have ever experienced in any game The community is almost non-existent You will be instantly banned from the forums for any statement critical of the game Your feedback will be ignored - the childish developers will literally flame you or mock you before they listen to youDon't waste your time on this game or on this development team. Don't be fooled when they relaunch the game to wash away all of these negative reviews once again. Don't fall for their, ""I'll gladly deliver content tomorrow for some of your money today,"" style of game design and management.			"

												I've played this game off and on since release, always returning to a better game than when I last left. Unfortunately, this time it appears that we're finally seeing the impact of David Breviks departure. I could go into a rant about all the bland/tedious changes, but I'll leave that to others who'll put more time and effort into it.Suffice to say, this update did nothing to solve the remaining problems involving character, item, and content balance/updates. In fact, it arguably made the divide between the ""haves"" and ""have nots"" even wider. Sorry Gaz, you bet the barn on this one and now you have to live with the cows in your house.			"

												I'm very disappointed after this 2.00 patch update. ""Biggest update ever""? I'm not impressed.Everything you hardly worked within hours of gameplay is gone.The infinity points is so silly! All my heroes powers were consumed by a bad kryptonite (yeap, D.C. one). All the setup regarding power points were erased.The movement powers were also removed by the kryptonite.This is an entire new game and, in my opinion, it got worst.For first-time players this new game should entertain (a little), but for the old-school guys, a complete waste of time.Even after 2.01 patch, things didn't get better.This was my favourite game, I think OverWatch will be my next one.

The game is now even better than ever - for me at least.The skills are more diverse than ever, the convoluted Omega system that required you to have a PhD in several sciences to make sense of and calculate the ""best"" route to go (and ended up having people use cookie cutter builds anyway) was replaced with a simpler, yet more rewarding, easy to understand system.The movement changes can hardly be felt in every day gameplay and allow for more challenging encounters. Heck, I've 1600 hours on steam and about 1000 hours on their stand alone client clocked in - and after this update heroes that I hated playing now are real fun!Don't listen to the haters - change is always met with resistance. Give it a try for yourself and see if you're having a fun time playing - because that's what games are about in the end!			"

												Once upon a time I loved this game.  I overplayed it, then left.  When I heard it had a huge update, I was excited and came back.  Wow.  Everything was worse - movement, combat, character customization - you name it.  And not a little worse.I've never seen a patch even close to this bad before.  Avoid at all costs.			"

												TL;DR It's free to try and get 15-20 hours of casual play. I wouldn't spend money or commit long-term time in it's current unfinished state however. The economy and endgame gear are in this weird purgatory right now and will be difficult for new players to enjoy high level gameplay until those issues are fixed or finished.Pre-Existing ConditionsBefore the Big Update the game already had no new playable content for almost a year. There is also no real endgame other than maybe grinding for better/more stuff, redoing story for costumes/splinter currency (rewards have been removed, costumes on their way out), or maybe doing the two raids. Basically the entire game is ""middle game.""I. ECONOMYLong story short, unique gear is currently being phased out to be replaced with rarer Omega gear which doesn't exist yet.Basically one of the most useful currencies in the game for upgrading your gear has recently been rendered useless, meaning high level Cosmic areas will be much harder for new characters. Rerolling your gear can sometimes mean nearly doubling your damage/defense/HP etc and/or adding 2-4 stat points per item, but with the credit recipes gone, it will probably take a month of grinding to afford proper rolls.Even IF new players could afford high level unique gear, it will be removed at any moment – all that time/currency will be wasted The most irritating part of the recipe removal is they didn't give fair notice; was only mentioned in general announcements that most removals were ""further down the line"" from now.II. BOSS DIFFICULTYPlayer dmg was nerfed to a fraction and higher level boss HP stayed the same. Instead of creating challenging gameplay as stated, it made bossfights longer & boring. Bosses like Juggernaut still have easy-to-avoid abilities still do dumb things like charge while face to face with a wall so his insta-kill does nothing.One of the toughest bosses has always been Hulk, which as nothing to do with HP – he's extremely mobile, in a very open area, deadly both ranged and melee, & has a formidable stun. His attacks are also projected but are faster than Jugs. The entire battle keeps you on your toes.If they really wanted to make the game challenging, they should've really improved the AI or added/tweaked the abilities of the bosses to be more versatile.III. STORY CONTENT/XPNew revamped story areas look amazing and retuned XP makes it easier to lvl by story. However half the story maps are now linear and ALL the good quest rewards were replaced with watered-down artifacts.Revamped maps are basically corridors, replacing open mapsRemoving half the sidequests and replacing all quest rewards completely removes incentive to exploreWith an account that has unlocked enough permanent bonuses, leveling from 1-60 now takes under an hour.Basically cranked XP + bland rewards + removing optional content from story removed any incentive to replay most of story which was like 40% of the available gameplay. Now what used to be ~6 hours of semi-interesting rewarding playtime got replaced with 40 minutes of point A to point B – point-LESS is more like it – why would I bother finish a story I've played >100 times for no rewards? All that effort to retouch the story and 2/3rd of chapters are getting overlooked except by the brand new players - and those new players in turn will start to overlook it too as they progress.IV. MOVEMENT CHANGESThese changes included fast travel getting a 0.75 sec windup, all dashes now fixed distance, and all dashes have 3 charges on cooldown. It was supposed to make gameplay more tactical & force players to choose when to dash, deter boss-rushing past mobs, keep you in the fight rather than dashing away to heal. Also “lore” was hamfisted in as a reason “to make speedy characters like Nightcrawler stand out.”These changes accomplished none of their stated goals, and as a result seem pointless and intrusiveMH is not suddenly tactical. Juggernaut is just as easy to avoid as before. Hulk is just as hard as before. Dash limitations don't keep you in combat; I find myself derpily walking away if I'm in a bind without dash up and it looks absurd to see Hulk or War Machine trot off rather than using a dynamic dash abilityFast travel limitations DON'T deter boss-rushing. In fact I'm now MORE inclined to boss rush since rewards/loot are nerfed and there is basically nothing between start point and the boss worth my time/effort. Wind-up is less than a second but it still feels like an unnecessary interruptionThe Marvel lore is great, but this is a videogame; using lore as an excuse to downgrade mechanics in a game that flagrantly ignores the lore to begin with is straight up BS. Thor, Iron Man, Colossus are immune to bullets in comics, but not in the game. Black Widow & Punisher have no powers, but in game can solo Loki, a god. These examples are acceptable game-logic to balance each character to be symmetrically fun – but they still break lore. So using lore to say “Hawkeye would get tired from rolling 500 times” is flawed b/c by that logic Hulk & Thor would get more, if not infinite dashes but are gated behind the same limit in a game that blatantly ignores lore anyways.All the restrictions really do is make gameplay less flexible, slow down combat, and make boss battles less dynamic/visually impressive.V. GAZILLIONEven before the Big Update I was annoyed by how Gazillion would sometimes mention things abstractly and it wouldn't come to fruition. Their communication lately has just been downright abysmal.This update was clearly rushed. Along with bugs that were reported by players in the test center but still went live, they teased this for months and months – and then they finally announced release date, two days before going live. I cannot fathom a reason springing the actual changes on your customers without giving more noticeOn top of all of this – THE UPDATE ISN'T EVEN FINISHED! So we're waiting in limbo for however many updates at an undisclosed date with another bouquet of unpleasant surprises that will supposedly finish the game.CONCLUSIONOverall I think Gazillion bit off more than they could chew. Alone many of the changes made sense, but they don't synchronize well with each other and they exacerbate each others' flaws as well as the pre-existing issues. If I were to be an optimist without realistic expectations, I might say the ""completed"" updates will sort everything out and put all of these changes into context. BUT FOR NOW THE GAME IS UNFINISHED AND WE HAVE NO CLUE WHEN THEY WILL BE OR THE FULL EXTENT OF THOSE FINISHING TOUCHES. Yes, a 3 year old game suddenly feels like it's in beta again. Many of the changes failed their stated goals and make the gameplay far more rigid than before; a new player won't notice some of that, but this unfinished state is really why I don't recommend spending money on Marvel Heroes. For better or for worse this won't be the same in a few months/year. Hold off at least until it's ""finished"".My first draft of this was over 21,000 characters so I had to cut out a lot of details and examples which illustrated my argument – there are other issues I didn't even get to mention. If something is unclear or you'd like elaboration feel free to ask. I hope I will be able to change or even delete this review if and when they make improvements. I have a heavy investment in Marvel Heroes, having bought ~23 heroes/team-ups and more in store a couple months ago I still feel I need to get the most of my time/money, which is why I'm still playing and hoping for improvements, but to the new players who have no such investment I can only offer the highest caution unless you are just looking to kill a few hours of casual play.

												I've played the game since it launched, and it has gone through many different stages.  A thousand hours is a fraction of the time I put in over the years.  The lastest patch has changed so much that the game is basically back to beta, and I cannot recommend the game in this state.The mobility changes were supposed to make movement tactical, but by rolling defense into dashes and putting them on cooldown it is not practical to use dash to position for attacks.  Since bosses are not locked into a similar cooldown for their dashes, melee heroes are stuck chasing enemies.  The fight mechanics have not been changed at all, even though that was supposedly the cause for the changes.As jarring that change has been, the game lacks itemization at this point.  It isn't worth picking up gold tier drops, because it is known they won't be useful in the future and there is nothing to do with them now.  This basically dismantles the endgame, leaving us with just leveling.So unless you want to play the waiting game to see what future patches look like, I can't recommend this game at this time.UPATE:  In the weeks since I have written this update, the game has continued to be plagued with bugs.  While none of the issues with itemization of the primary gear slots has changed, the game has unintenttionally experienced rollbacks, price protected cash shop items have gone on sale, and ultimate upgrade tokens have been removed from the splinter shops.

												Started playing a few weeks before the big update so I am not able to judge the changes very well, however I did get screwed over by not picking a previously free hero before the update hit.  The change is now that you get some eternity splinters after the tutorial level, but as I have already completed that I got neither.  Now I could live with that as I did dilly dally on picking a hero but as the developer didnt even bother to include this pretty significant change (to new players) in the patch notes I find this means I do not want to support the game.  What else can they change without even a warning?			"

												The Biggest Update Ever .... AKA The Biggest Iceberg Ever.This game went from something fantastic to something less than mundane. If I could fully express how much the changes let me down I would but I can't even put it into words.If you played and enjoyed this game before the patch you will probably hate it. Everything you played for probably got removed or changed in a negative way.If you play Diablo-esque games you will probably not enjoy this game anymore. The speed of the game has been drastically reduced.If you enjoy feeling like a super heroes, you probably wont enjoy this game anymore. It doesn't feel very heroic to get slogged by basic minions just because you chose a hero that got messed up in this patch.If you enjoy many pointless skins that you can no longer earn for free, you might still enjoy this game. Iron Man and Spider-man at least have a ton of skins....This update killed this game for me and that is a tragic thing, this was one of my most beloved games for a long time now.			"

												By far the best Free to Play game I have played. First hero is free, and you get enough in game currency after about a week to unlock another. Besides stash space and choosing a specific costume, nothing is behind a pay wall. I've spent money on a few costumes/hero bundles, but you could play this game for nothing and get plenty of enjoyment. Only negetives I have really is that there can be a lot of lag at times, and currently some of the heroes (Wolverine especially) feel pretty weak at the moment. Lag I can deal with, and hopefully they fix some of the heroes in the upcoming changes they are doing. Really can't recommend this game enough, especially if you want to play something for free.

												1st year of MH: Pretty bad, but it's obvious that the game is heading uphill...way uphill.2nd year of MH: Really, really good.3rd year of MH: Some stuff popping up here and there, but it's obvious MH is heading downhill.4th year: All downhill and nothing happening. I'd say the decline of this game could be attributed to the fact that many big names from the company were ""retired"" and replaced with new blood or that Gaz honestly commits so many mistakes (often the same ones over and over) and just routinely shoot themselves in the foot. In all honesty, it's probably a culmination of many different aspects. Even the community has eroded greatly, in my opinion. What was once a great community has lost so many of the good folks and has boiled down to the ""white knights"" against pretty much anyone that says anything even slightly negative against Gaz. Latest update really sealed the coffin, in my opinon. Strongly suggest you DO NOT spend any money on this game. Unless there is a phenomenal console release at some point before the 2019 contract ends, I really don't believe this game has a sustainable future. Fingers crossed that I am simply just taking a slightly pessimistic view of the current situation, but I honestly think it's just the view of a realist. It pains me to say I don't recommend the game, but I simply don't recommend the game in its current state.			"

												You know, the most recent update really is emblematic of the continuing issues the game has had since the massive overhaul was revealed.  In the most recent patch, the developers made the following decision:  that on difficulties higher than the default, the gear needed to survive those difficulties could only be *earned* in those same difficulties.Literally the most fundamental concept in a loot-driven ARPG is that the gear dropped in your current difficulty includes gear that allows you move up to the next difficulty level.  The fact that they willfully failed to understand and implement this most basic structure is a severe indictment of the level of competence and care that this game has received as part of its update.Furthermore, this update was not announced in advance, or even in the patch notes, but only after the fact when people realized loot in the game was broken and called them on it.  When you not only make game-breaking decisions, but won't even communicate them to your player base, that's even more problematic.While this is only one example, it is illustrative of the vast majority of the changes that have been implemented in this update.  From the movement speed changes to the power bar limitations, decisions have been made that have harmed the game to no clear benefit.  As someone who followed the beta testing of this update, and viewed the mountains of feedback pointing out the clear problems that were entirely ignored, I can only say that the development team was made more than aware of the problems they were causing, and knowing this released the update with all of these problems intact, with no clear plan on fixing them.As it stands right now, this game is fundamentally broken, and while veterans may be able to struggle through for now, if you are reading this review and trying to determine whether this game is worth your time and money...  as of this point, it is not, and you should absolutely stay away.  If this game is generally fixed at some point in the future, I may update this review, but right now, this is not a game or a game company that should be rewarded for the changes that have been made so far.tl;dr:  Recent updates have taken what was a fun, casual and interesting game and made it a boring, unrewarding grind that as of now actually tries to prevent new players from advancing beyond the easiest difficulty tier.  It should be avoided unless and until it is fixed.			"

												This game started off pretty bad, back in 2013. I still enjoyed the flawed aspects and mechanics but the developers quickly improved the game. These improvements came out very rapidly and they kept churning out updates over the next few years.Recently the game became stagnant as they stopped releasing updates for about hafl a year while working on their ""Biggest update ever""Well it's been released and I can no longer recommend this game. As a veteran to the game; the depth of gearing was reduced, the game has become simpler with only one skill bar, attributes went from being all useful to only two attributes per hero and the post max-level system was reduced from many trees of bonuses to a round robin diablo 3-esque paragon system.New players use to be able to chose a free hero, any hero despite their price and were given currency to buy another average priced hero. Now new players are simply given enough currency to buy an average price hero and have to wait a week to be given enough to buy the max price heroes.The mobility in the game has been reduced from a game where almost any hero could speed around to where it is after the update; sluggish walking with extreme cooldowns with charges to any dash or teleport. Even heroes like Silver Surfer or Nightcrawler who should be fast are also very slow and clunky.Another aspect to the game that is now ruined; Summoners. They have completely crippled any summoner heroes to the point where they're better off being spec'd their boring or lackluster combat powers. They promise they're working on it but this brings to light another big issue with the game as-is; incomplete systems. This new patch changed the way you gear and was suppose to replace the current most power item tier (unique) with a brand new item tier (omega) but that was delayed to the distant future. Summoners were suppose to recieve changes to their own gearing for this patch but that didn't arrive with this patch either.Quite frankly I just don't recommend this game to anyone looking to get into. Any veterans who read this;  The game you remember is gone and I implore you to express your opinion on the new patch.			"

The change to the power trees is just downright infuriating. And finally, the way they butchered my carefully managed inventory practically brings a tear to my eye. All of my hard won uniques are just GONE.I hope for Gazillion's sake that they manage to secure some new players. Their veteran players all seem to be leaving in droves.			"

												Fan of the Diablo series?  Fan of Marvel Comics?  If you're both, then this game is for you.  If you love Marvel but haven't played Diablo or any similar games (Torchlight, Titan Quest, etc), then you'll probably find a lot of good stuff in here too.Free to play action-rpg, with many, many different characters to play.  Your first character is free, you can buy any other characters with real money, as well as their costumes (which there are a LOT).  But if you're not into spending money, you can collect items (Eternity Splinters) and purchase characters with thouse, either as a Random Hero Box where you might get a character you already have but costs the least amount of splinters, or you can get the character directly.You can easily play the game for a long time without spending a dollar.  I've spend 10 bucks across 150 hours of gameplay, and I have 7 characters.The game is constantly being updated/patched, and new characters/costumes/items are being added all the time.  A character you have might not be fun to play, but down the line it might get reviewed and be fun as hell afterwards.Max character level is 60, and every character you get to 60 gives you an EXP boost across all other characters you have.  And you'll generally get enough splinters for a random hero by the time you get one character to 60, so you'll have a chance to start working on a new one immediately.  Or you can join a Supergroup (Clan/Guild), do raids, farm items, make your level 60 a total badass.So yeah, if you're looking for a fun as hall ARPG, this is a great game.  It's not perfect, but it's much better than it was beck when it originally came out, before the MH2015 rebranding.  So give it a shot, blow up dudes with your mind powers or laser eyes, or just punch them with your rock fists.			"

												This game seems to be on a roller coaster when it comes to its quality.It had serious issues in open beta, but it got better and better with every update. The decline started a year ago when Danger room was added. It promised a skill based random game mode, but ended with dmg sponges and rubbish reward/time ratio. However with the deployment of the ""biggest update ever"" the game crashed into the ground. And it crashed hard. The new infinity system(!), movement skill changes, powerbar changes, ignorance towards player feedback and killing the unique items before the next tier is added... these developers spit in the face of loyal players in hope of luring new players and being more console friendly. You may like this game as it is but for me it's a stranger who killed one of my favourite games.Maybe the roller coaster will go up before the game fades into the void. Untill then.			"

												After massive backlash and fans and players pleading with them to not impliment the latest update, Gaz decided to go ahead an NGE MH2016. After logging in, noticing they'd destroyed items (costumes), changed the movement system, redone powers, and basically ripped the game apart and put it back together with dodgy tape and craft glue. I have played since open beta and have seen numerous changes but I am done with this game in this state. Sorry Gaz, we warned you.			"

												I've been playing this game for years, but they have destroyed it in anticipation of a console release.  They slowed everything down DRASTICALLY.  The movement now takes about 3-4x as long as before, and bosses that took 1 minute now take 6.  That in and of itself is awful.  But they went further and decided to ""simplify"" the game.  Now you only have one action bar.  That means that any hero that required more than 8 keys to play before is now not a playable hero.  An overall downgrade from its previous stat ""The Biggest Update Ever"" was actually just a game killer of something that I've played for a very long time now.			"

												Update: 1-29-17I just can not recommend this game at this point.The BUE hit way too soon. Their big update was not complete and it has really messed up a lot of things. The dev team did not listen to its players and decided to go ahead with all the major changes. Movement is slowed way down, damage is tuned down as well, items were completly changed and that meant having to spend credits to unbind and or reroll their stats. many things were taken away way too early, other things are pointless or will be once the second part of the patch drops in 3 to 4 to 6 months down the road.right now in game there realy isnt anything to do, all gear you loot will be pointless once the second part of the update hits so no reason to farm for items, no new content for the vets. so if you are a new player you can level up heroes but anything other than that will be a waste of time and effert. my recomendation to any new players looking at this game and thinking ""hmm that might be fun"" i say wait, wait untill around June, put this game in your wishlist and check the reviews and see how things are going. by June maybe all the big updates will have hit and maybe things will have normalised by then. The same goes to any returning players thiking about returning to the game.as for the games forums, they seam to be getting even worse. what was once a great and fun place to hang out between playing is now not so much fun. it is completly devided now and some of the dev team that post in there are starting to sound and be very rude, im sure its just stress but it still looks bad when you see it from a dev.12-19-16as of right now i can not recommend this game. or if you do play it i would not spend any money on it at all. 2016 has been a horrible year for this game compared to 2015 and 2014, going from 12 new heroes a year down to 5 hurts it a lot, not to mention no new zones or areas at all added this year. there is also this big huge update on its way in that no one really asked for and from what i have seen in the test center it's not making the game better at all. they are also holding back the last 3 new heroe releases untill their update is fully out so most likely not untill march of next year.its really sad to see this game fall so far after being so high and so good. it has been one of the best free to play games i have ever played. it was trully free to play, you can get every playable hero for free and not have to spend one dime to get them, same with the team ups. this company is also really good about giving out a lot of free stuff as well. if you get onto their forums you will find for the most part a really good community and if you go into their special giveaway forum you can win a lot of free in game things that will help your characters. That being said this past year the forum community has started to change a bit, a lot of the good natured and nice people there have left, there are still more good people than bad there but the number of ""jerks"" is on the rise			"

												Having started playing the game in late 2013, I grew accustomed to playing the game in a certain way.  It had versatility and a fun factor with considerable appeal.  Post-BUE (Biggest Update Ever), the game simply is not as fun to play as it was pre-BUE.			"

												Turned into a grindfest now with the ""biggest update ever"".  Not the fun kind of grindfest either.  This is the kind where you feel forced to buy boost items with real money if you're a new player who didn't get your gear while it was easier (before this patch).  Once the new items come out, and some harder difficulty modes, even the most hardcore fanboys left will realize how they're getting ripped off.  That said, if you never ever want to be able to play the endgame highest difficulty content that will be coming out in the next few months on heroes you just got or a new account, you'll be fine.

												Having played this game since 2013 on and off, (albiet mainly via the gazillion before recently switching to steam hence why I have a low playing time), I always found this as a fun time wasting game which allowed me to play as my favourite heroes for free. As a casual player, I have felt the changes a lot less severely than others who have spent many hours in this game. But, even so, this ""update"" has made the game feel worse for me.The customization I have done with my heroes, e.g. Rogue has dissapeared and overall the game has been slower and clunkier.I am suffering issues I previously did not, running this game.Even worse is how the playerbase has changed. Back around a year ago, there were many people playing this game, fast foward to now, the numbers you find in the lobby or Manhatten etc. has dropped dramatically. This is partially due to this new update alienating the lifeblood of this game, the playerbase. With the lack of people, this game has become much more stale.In terms of gameplay, it has become stale, with the nerfs to movement and speed by far making this game less fun.The changes to the omega system/infinity system is annoying to say the least.The changes to powers also make this game much more infuriating to play, and while I understand this is supposedly for the future with console users, there won't be a future if the current playerbase stop playing.

												As nice as the devs are over on the forum to us, they are extremely incompetent. With the biggest update ever, several changes were made that completely change the way the game is played and therefore the target audience. Here's what has been changed:  Number of hotbar slots has dropped from 20 to 8. Once you've slotted one basic, dash, signature, DoT, spender, and vuln, you have 2 slots left which usually means one more DoT and another layer of damage for most heroes. Good-bye escape powers, grab powers, ""fun"" powers, shields, leaps, backflips, and utilities. You have to build for DPS now or suffer.  Dash powers have been given a pretty large fixed distance... That means as Spider-Man you have to slowly walk up to enemies to punch them while they unload bullets into your face, or you can use your knowledge of trigonometry to calculate the correct angle and direction to dash to so that your second dash to enemy brings you to attack distance. Oh but wait, you only have 3 dash charges on a 4 second cool down. Marvel Super-Hero Squad genuinely has more fluid combat. I'm not even joking, go play it right now and compare it to this game.  Enemies have been retuned so that they take longer to kill. I would love this change, except for the fact you now only have 7 attack powers. Boss fights are dull as hell using the same powers over and over. At least before you could do things like swiftly switch between melee/ranged powers or single-target/area or energy/physical for synergy bonuses and to match your situation but now you have to pick one set depending on which animations you like the most.  This game has been out for 4 years but even minor things don't work. Ghost Rider's and Darvedevil ""apprehend"" powers don't even work. You just shoot out a piddly little chain/cable and nothing happens. It's been like this for four years. Enemies still have perfect tracking and non-random attack intervals. Run into a room filled with enemies and they'll all instantly turn towards you and fire at the same time with perfect accuracy and timing. And they'll keep firing at the exact same interval (basically in waves) until they're dead. The amount of burst damage you receive every few seconds in this game because of this is just nuts. FOUR YEARS  Traits. Each hero gets about 5 sets of three traits, and gets to pick one from each set of three for five total. Because of the reduction of 20 skills to 8, most power effects have been shafted into these. The only problem is, some trait rows force you to pick between things you really need, while others are plain garbage. So much so they don't even change anything because you don't have enough room on your hotbar to equip an extra power that they affect.  Difficulty level locks. A lot of the more fun content (SHIELD Holo-Sim, X-Defence, etc.) have been set so they can only be played on higher difficuties for no apparent good reason. I wouldn't have minded before the update but with the enemy health changes, these game modes feel very wrong. Basic HYDRA goons can one shot Wolverine but it takes Hulk about 5 seconds to kill one. Just doesn't feel right.I love the devs for this game, great people, but unfortunately they suck at actual game development. They have basically completely turned around their target audience by changing the game. The game has gone from a fast paced ARPG that revolves really heavily around loot, reflexes and skill, and good builds, to a pretty slow paced beat-em-up that focuses on easy access to players.			"

												This was once a great game but the newest Patch has ruined it. By major nerfing movement and simpfication of game machanics make it hard to recomend this game anymore.  They also nerfed new player experence also by removing the Free Hero unlock for new players. Now they give you only 400 splinters for beating the tutorial and 200 if you log in 7 days in a row. Now if you want to unlock Spiderman from the start you gotta wait 7 days to do so. AVOID FOR RIGHT NOW!			"

												The game used to be fun with custimization options using the omega system and movement builds.  You could basically play when and how you wanted.  The new infinity system removes alot of that customization and makes it much more vanilla.  The dash nerf and one power bar limit also hurts.  One thing I do like about the update is the power bank for Rogue, which makes changing her builds much easier.  Unfortunately one step forward, and three steps back though.			"

												Despite the urgings of what seems to be a great many of the other reviews here I've quite enjoyed Marvel Heroes. It's gameplay is fun, lots of flashy effects, high damage numbers, having to dodge and kite and most of the heroes have their own interesting little gimmick / mechanics. The atmosphere is awesome, bringing the marvel universe together in a convenient diablo-like world with 'acts' represented as chapters and all the big bads you could want from Shocker to Doctor Doom. The loot, rather important in an ARPG is done in a way that rewards players for time spent,  with small thnigs like relics that drop atleast once every 3-5min that stack upto 1000, giving you slow progression in addition to the fast progression like artifacts and uniques that are boss-only and are invaluably important to getting your character viable.Lategame in Marvel Heroes is basically an externsion of the story mode with easy/medium/hard/intense/oh god difficulties for players to work their way through - from fighting bosses on 'easy' in Green terminals, to Cosmic terminals where Doctor Doom will show you the meaning behind his name, Holo-Sim waves defending virtual civillians, or defending Xavier Schools students from invaders in X-Defense - to now even being able to raid - Marvel Heroes has most players needs covered. I think the later game still has potential to be worked on, and imporved - but as it stands I do enjoy it. It IS F2P, anything you can get in the store is either - avaialable pretty easily, or purely cosmetic - such as costumes. The only exception being Stash Tabs - which you will not need until you're entering the lategame stage of Marvel Heroes, and by that time you've spent towards 30-40hours on the game, and I'd say that's about fair. Every F2P ARPG at this point in time charges extra for additional stash tabs - I don't think it should be this way but I do think it's one of those things that won't be going away so it's kind of pointless to argue about it.Updates - Holy hell, the updates. When I first played this game at launch it was a horrible mess, and hardly worth 20minutes of my time, coming back to it later I fell in love! Every week or so a new event comes around, or a new rebalance, new content, or another Hero for everyone to sink their creative teeth into - and that's one of the best parts about Marvel Heroes to me, the constant Developer discussions, interaction, compromise and updates that make the game a delight to keep playing.All in all I think Marvel Heroes is currently one of the best ARPG's on the market in my opinion, That said everything boils down to ones preference, as such I recommend you try it, rather than read reviews! It's free, if you don't like it, delete and complain about it over VOIP for 20minutes and move on - that's how we gauge F2P's now-a-days anyhow :D			"

												I can't recommend this game at this time for a number of reasons, some of which were already communicated by plenty of other disappointed fans/players.Gazillion, at this point, has realized that they don't have the development resources to produce content for long-time players fast enough to keep them happy AND chase the new player demographic. Rather than seek to make their most loyal and longest-standing customers happy, they've made the shrewd business decision to churn the community a bit and get some newer blood in the game. And you know, I get it. I get that they see this as the only option to keep developing the game rather than limp along creating elite content for vets and then die a slow death. But I think we've just learned that this approach has real consequences. The reviews posted here could be the extent of it, or the discontent could grow into something more damaging to the game. We will have to see.Regardless of where this game goes in the future, I will have to see real change in the behavior of this studio if I'm to spend any more money on the game. The way Gazillion does business, plans features, communicates game roadmaps, makes character skill decisions, and moderates their forum is so incredibly inconsistent, I'm left questioning the integrity of the technical, business, and community management leaders of the company.  I actually don't think the ""Biggest Update Ever"" really updated much that the user can truly perceive, which is the biggest gamble of any refactoring effort. It's still most of the same powers with some rearranged math and some slower traveling. It's still the same game that the casual player could get bored of pretty quickly, to say nothing of the veterans. What's even more horrifying is that this refactoring introduced new bugs as well as left older bugs still painfully neglected, which makes me actually wonder how bad the code was to begin with. Shipping a refactored game with very little content to get existing players excited about is the type of mistake I don't expect to see from development teams with the resumes like that of many of the developers at Gazillion.As a player, the time and resources spent on this update don't yield enough (or any) big ticket content changes to justify waiting 6 months for the thing to ship. The game is as stale as it was at the end of 2015, when the team still saw new heroes as ""content"" instead of new story chapters, one shots, raids, or even perhaps a new mode that doesn't recycle already created assets like environments or bosses. Players have now waited 6 months for the widely-hyped update, only to have to wait additional months (who knows how long) for the rest of the systems to be updated and that doesn't even mean they'll provide new content, if I'm understanding the roadmap correctly. Their PVP mode is still in beta. It's been almost 4 years. It's stuff like this that makes me feel like this game doesn't know what it wants to be in life. For the sake of the community that still loves this game, I hope every promise the development team made regarding this update comes through. The community (or at least pockets of it) was really the crown jewel of this whole game. They deserve to have the game they really wanted and supported for the last 4 years. The realist in me, however, looks at Gazillion's pile of mistakes so high not even Spider-Man could scale it, and has doubts that it will really deliver anything worthwhile in time for it to make an impact. I'm hoping that this review will be updated at some point in the future because I really hope this game turns around. I'd be happy to eat crow at that time.			"

												Everything you need to know about this game is that the devs just rolled out a massive amount of nerfs to facilitate a console launch.  Consoles couldn't handle the pace of the game so dash abilities were nerfed into uselessness, and travel abilities (Like running), have been given a ~1 second channel time in which your character must, I ♥♥♥♥ you not, run in place before he can start running (at a much slower rate than pre patch).  The post 60 advancement system (called the omega system), which was a lore rich web of abilities you could purchase has been replaced with the ""infinity"" system.  The new system has only a handful of things to spend your points on (6 categories, each with 6 abilities) versus the old system's hundreds, and forces you to spend points in categories that are useless to your character.   It also bears mentioning that this game, which launched with very little content, has had very little additional content added in the past three years.  It has very little raid content (2 raids, both very, very old and puggable), and virtually no pvp (one level, it's been in 'beta' for years, no one plays it).  About 80% of the new content are new characters to buy and new costumes to buy.  About 18% of the new content are incentivized movie tie ins (and the Marvel policy on no cross promotion for Fox films means no events, costumes, or character tie ins with X-Men/Deadpool/F4 movies)  The rest of the 'new content' is basically rehashed 'arcade style' versions of existing story levels.TL;DRThey have decided that consoles are a more lucrative market than the PC gamers who have kept this game going for three years.  Save your money, play something else.			"

												After testing the BUE for at least 20 hours now I would like to give my opinion on the Update, the future of MH and of course GAZ.I have played this Game for a long time and I have allways been very generous when things happened that I didn't like. But now I start to wonder if this Game is still for me. Not because the Update is completely bad, which it isn't, but because of the fact that I get the feeling that GAZ stopped caring for anything we, the PC community have to say, a long time ago.**Content:** Let's start with the Fact that there has been no new Content for over a year, allmost 18 Month to be precise. All that GAZ ever did in this time was telling us that big things are on the way, that they are working on the game and that they will continue to make MH a great experience.The Problem is, they did not do any of these things. The New Map for example, is not new Content. Why is it no new Content? Because all we do there is grinding for the same stuff in the same way that we did in Midtown or Industrial. There is absolutely nothing new on this map. The Streets are setup differently and the buildings look different, but that is it. **Heroes:** When it comes to Heroes GAZ once released 1 Hero each Month, they stopped doing so. They also keep telling us that it is impossible to add Quicksilver as a playable Hero because of his Movement. Well let me tell you something, there were games, and there still are games who have or had Speedsters in the Roster like City of Heroes, which was over ten years old and had them from the start. Then there is DC Universe Online, also Speedsters who are really really fast, no problems there. But GAZ, not able to implement Speedsters because of the Engine or whatever there excuse is.Then they said that they can't add Quicksilver because they are afraid that some Players wouldn't be able to play him because there PC's are not good enough. REALLY? When was the last time that the people who work at GAZ have taken a look at the last Generation and the actual Generation of PC's that are used by Gamers? Did they ever watch any new Games that came out in the last 1-2 years? The Graphics are unbelieveable and the games still run on the highest settings with PC's that are 2 or 3 years old. This also goes for MMORPG's or ARPG's. It seems that every Company out there can manage much better Graphics with much better performance except for Gazillion. They can not even handle a Speedster in a Superhero Game because the Engine is bad and the PC's are bad.Maybe Gaz should stop making excuses for there Programmers who seem to be less competent than Programmers of other Companys.**Greed:** So Instead of giving new Players a free Hero they get 400 ES now. What if these new Players want to play a 600 ES Hero? What if they tried a 600 ES Hero until level 10 and then they want to keep playing this Hero? They can't because GAZ is so greedy right now that it is getting unreal. Does a free Hero really hurt your wallets that much that you need to take this away?**They don't play the Game:** It was clear before but after this Update no one can deny that the Devs don't ever play this Game. If they would they might have noticed that the CC of even the normal Mobs is game breaking right now. So it is no Wonder that this Update is so wonderfull considering that the Devs don't play the game AND don't listen to the Players anymore.**Veterans:** Another thing that Gaz doesn't seem to care about anymore are the Veteran Players who played this Game from the Start and went through all the hazzle an dazzle that MH had to offer.The newest example of a Veteran destroying the new Update in his Review on Steam, is Winfrid Wong who was a very active Player, 4000+ hours. Who has a very succesfull YouTube Channel that focuses on Marvel Heroes. On his Channel he has a Video for every Single Hero with an indepth Analysis of every Skill, the Mechanics, the Theory Crafting etc.He is probably the best known Marvel Heroes Player when it comes to Theory Crafting and Builds who spent hundreds of hours outside of the Game to create Charts and dozens of Videos to explain every detail of the Mechanics behind the Characters. He even analyzed Team Up's to help people find the best combination for their play style.And he is now telling people that Marvel Heroes is going down hill fast. That Veterans are ignored, the time they invested, the Money they have spent. Because after the Update every Toon needs to be geared again. The Gear needs to be farmed again. The Infinity Points need to be grinded like Omega before. So basically the Veterans start allmost from scratch and Gaz doesn't give a Rats Fart for them anymore.Instead they prepare for the Console Launch, they stopped developing Content for the PC a long time ago and once the Console Version launches things are going to get alot worse.**Console Launch**: Once the Console Launch is there Gaz will stop developing the PC Version allmost completely. Why should they do that? Because the PC Players were around 3000 in the end. On the Other Side of the Coin is a Playerbase of Millions of Console Players. So what will happen if Marvel Heroes is succesfull on Consoles at first? What if, lets just say, 600.000 Players will use Consoles to play the Game?Gaz will simply look at the Numbers and they will conclude that it makes no sense at all to even have a Community Manager for the PC' Gamers anymore. 3000 don't really matter when on the other Hand there are 600k. If the Console Players dont like something they will be heard because they matter. But who is going to care for a few PC' Gamers Gaz started to ignore 18 Month ago? Nobody!**The Good, the bad and the ugly:** When David Brevik left Gaz we all knew that something must be seriously wrong at Gazillion. The Mastermind behind Diablo, Diablo 2 and Marvel Heroes has left the building to do another ARPG. Path of Exile. So why would he leave Gaz who develop an ARPG and join the guys at the Path of Exile Studio who also do an ARPG? Well, we did not know at that time, but we know now. He left because Gazillion is murdering this once so wonderful game on the PC to get the Console Version ready.They are using the PC Playerbase as Beta Testers for the Console Version. They are using the Money that they get from the Cash Shop to fund the Console Version. Why can I be so sure of that? They did not develop anything in the past 18 Month for the PC Version so where do you guys think did all the money and the workforce go? Exactly to the Console Version Development Team. Where are the people who created the new Heroes? They are not able to give us one hero a Month anymore because the people who worked on those Heroes, on developing them are now working on the Console Version. Why didn't we get any new Content on the PC? Because the people who used to work on the Content are working on the Console Version now, and they do this for about 18 Month I guess.**The Missing Parts:** Coming back to the Biggest update ever. How did Gaz believe that implementing a complete new Difficulty System, that is based on tweaking the Game Mechanics and presenting new Gear for the Heroes is a good Idea, IF they only implement 50% of the System? Where are the ♥♥♥♥ing Items? Where is the Gear Gazillion? From all the stupidity that this Update offered this has to be the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ one. If I go and buy a Car and the Seller tells me that the Tires will be delivered a few Month later and that I would just have to wait before the Car is finally awesome I would just tell the Seller to ♥♥♥♥ Off.You either deliver the whole Update or you WAIT until it is finished. Gazillion did just prove that there is no one left with half a brain where the planning is done.			"

												Edit: My play time on Steam is not my full play time. I usually played from the Marvel Heroes launcher. When I played the Steam version, I had a lot of bugs like characters in walls.I did love it. I have played it in short spurts over the last year. In November/December 2016 I really got into the game and leveled 26 characters to level 60, switched in Kitty Pryde as my main, and was really having a lot of fun. I hit my 200th login on the day of the update. The Wolverine Team-Up reward was the only good thing to come out of that day. I didn't want to believe all the negative feedback, but it is unfortunately true. Everything is a step back. The pause on sprint is a deal-breaker alone after using it so much. On top of the pause, movement speeds are slower. Traveling takes more time now. It feels significant. We can't trade in my extra duplicate uniques in anymore for anything. I can't imagine how long it'll take to get from 275 to 1000 relics without the unique exchange, which was already a slow and random way to acquire relics. The only  value to obtaining more unique items now is to turn them in for small amounts of credits, that isn't really all that worthwhile.There are so many nerfs. The removal of boosts to character abilities means less specialization (when all abilities are treated equal level). My characters feel weaker since the update. We can no longer customize the actions of our team-ups. They have access to and seemingly use all abilities. It's probably a bug, but my signature move on Kitty Pryde doesn't function 90% of the time. Or if it is functioning, I can't tell. While they introduced the Infinity system for simplicity, to reduce the number of nodes exponentially, it has far less customization than the Omega system did. One of the selling points for Infinity was that we only need 25 points for an attribute (like strength) upgrade, where as in Omega we needed 200. Well, that might be true, but it takes 10x the amount of points to acquire an Infinity point. They converted our Omega points to 10% worth of Infinity (3700 Omegas went down to 370 Infinity). So 25 Infinity points for an attribute is the same as 250 Omega points. It gets worse though. to acquire 25 Infinity points in any of the 6 categories, you have to gain 25 points in all 6! Each Infinity point is awarded in category rotation. You can't apply your Infinity points wherever you want. They  have to be spread equally across the categories. That means to get 25 points to add +1 Fighting, you need 150 points (25 from each category). So that would be 1500 Omega points in the conversion. I don't see how that is better than the 200 Omega points we use to spend for +1 Fighting. I loved this game previously because I could log on and have some fun in a Diablo style game that I could play mostly solo. It had some level of time sink to it, but nowhere near as much as other MMO type games. It's biggest flaw was inventory space, but since the game was Free to Play, I didn't mind dropping money on that. I bought very few characters with real money. I probably spent $25 total on the game and enjoyed leveling 26 characters with another 4 to play still. The story was great. The character dialogue is really fitting, if not repetitive after a while. It was just a great fun game.Now it's not. It makes me sad.			"

												Been playing MH since beta and have been a huge Marvel fan for my entire life, their ""biggest update ever"" sucked any bit of fun out of it. The hero changes are acceptable, but the movement changes and omega/infinity system changes are not. Gameplay is beyond sluggish, gameplay is still repetitive, and they're sliding it closer to p2w. This is not how this game started out, and I'm beyond disappointed in Gaz. Cannot recommend, go play PoE or D3 if you want an arpg, and stay clear of this.			"

												Marvel Heroes has a nice free to play model where you can earn heroes through in-game currency. There are a fair number of giveaways as well. It used to be a fun game to log in, kill some bad guys, and maybe get some better gear.The recent changes have made the game less appealing. The game is a lot slower and the grind for top-end loot has become insane.  Paid boosts seem to be the only way to get good gear, which is a sad change to the business model.			"

												The Biggest Update Ever has come!My profile will tell you I have sunk almost 1500 hours into Marvel heroes since it's beta came to Steam a few years ago. It won't tell you I have spent nearly $1000 as well.Each year  would buy the expensive Advance Pack and usually spend $200 on Gs to spend as well.At this point my spending has come to an end and it's very likely my playing has as well.I'm not going to lie, I play very casually. I like to hop in for an hour after work to relax. Sometimes on a lazy weekend I'd spend half a day in game. It may have been repetetive because there really hasn't been much new content added in the last year, but it was fun. Mindless fun, but fun all the same.The Biggest Update Ever changed a lot about the game:It simplified power Trees and added Talents. feels very much like Warcraft to me. I wasn't attached to power trees as they were so this is fine. There are no more power points either. When you unlock a power it is unlocked at it's fullest potential. Honestly that's a great change...When levelling I rarely remember to allocate points.It simplified the Capped Omega System into the Uncapped Infinity System. I understand why they did this but am not the biggest fan of it. Sure in the old system it was quite easy to look up a cookie cutter build and implement it. But realistically that's all that's going to happen in this new system too. It may be uncapped, but points are equally allotted between all 6 stones. This takes control away from the player and essentially makes you earn 6 points for each 1 you want to spend. This is a total fail in freedom to choose.A lot of the story chapters were updated. I'm sure that's good for new players. For me and players like me, not so much.A lot of artifacts got huge changes. Some became more useful to certain types of characters, others were completely changed to the point that they are useless for characters they were already on. The changes left soem players needing to farm for new artifacts for those slots. That'd be fine if there was any new content in this Biggest Update Ever.There isn't. Nothing. There are changes to the Buff system that feel like the game is becoming significantly more Pay To Win as well. As someone who has no problem paying for a game i enjoy this would not be a big deal to me, but I definitely see it as an issue for whatever future free players they manage to draw in.But the biggest change and my biggest problem is the changes to Movement Powers. Dashes are limited to 3 (more on some characters through talents) recharging every few seconds (the cooldown can be lowered through the Infinity system). Travel powers now have an annoying .75 second delay before they kick in to stop players from using them as a makeshift dash. Some characters got a neat animation that makes the delay less noticable. Others got animations that scream YOU CAN'T MOVE. While I understand the devs reasons for the changes and appreciate their hard work, the movement changes specifically have made the game less fun. I've logged in out of habit the last few days but I feel that is about to end. I've learned in my old age to stop doing things that don't make me happy and sadly Marvel Heroes no longer makes me happy.			"

												A business model with a game loosely taped to the side. Every aspect of this game is just the developers begging for more money.The only things you can do that feel truly free are to pick 1 character and 1 build then level to about ~30 of 60 levels. After that the experience gained decreases immensly to promote buying exp boosts. It's true that you can get everything in this game with enough work, but it would probably take years to accomplish. It's fun for a playthrough or two but after that this game loses appeal based on how much money you would need to invest to have any fun.			"

												So, I’m not someone who usually writes a review. Check my profile you will see that. I have almost 1500 hours into this game. Loved it. Been playing it for a long time, bought almost all of the Heroes you could buy. Out of all of those Heroes, I’ve found 6 that were my favorite to play. Spiderman, Gean Grey, Thor. Ironman, Ultron and Cap.I’ve spent a great deal of time, effort gearing and optimizing those chars gear and Artifacts to get them to the point where they were. I could go into Cosmic Midtown and have no issues with survivability or taking down Bosses. Spiderman’s with his Level 20 Ultimate fighting Crossbones, Once I active my Ultimate on him I could nearly one shot him. But now with the new 2.0 patch in place. My Heroes all feel like wet noodles. They get totally wrecked now. Think of the movie Super 8 with the train wreck scene and that’s what this new 2.0 patch has done to this beloved game. Its totally wrecked the game for many of us.I used to really enjoy the game, it was fun. I’ve been playing this game since its early days and since beta. I’ve seen a lot of changes happen over the years most of them have been for the good. But this latest patch has really turned the game upside down. They have removed the Omega point system and replaced it with their new Infinity system. If you have played Diablo 3, then think Paragon system. That’s basically what we have now.The Devs now want you to now endlessly grind the game to earn infinity points and its endless like the Paragon system. The problem is when they removed the Omega system its nerfed our heroes in a big way. We have lost a lot of great stats that we were able to get from Omega. Infinity give us some of those back but at great cost per point used on many of those stats. And many of the older Omega stats are now gone. Ones that were by definition to raid required stats.As many of you are now seeing the reviews for this game went from recommended to now mixed. I think with more negative reviews to come, the reviews will drop to bad and not recommended.For me, I can no longer recommend this game. The Devs could have spent that last 6 months instead of making a patch that no one seems to want to creating newer content and raids and mission areas. But instead we get a new 2.0 patch that has bought Marvel Heroes to its knees.Another big annoyance that everyone is upset about is the Cool down that’s now been added to movement. It’s now a 3 second delay for any Hero to Fly, Teleport, Swing and Run. Its mind boggling that the devs thought this was a good idea.  This one thing just goes to show that the mindset of the developer was not in a good place or thinking about this with great any care when they implemented it.  There are some good things with this patch but not enough of them to talk about. Im still trying to get mny chars optimized with the new patch, but the more I try the more frustrated I become with this game now.Good luck Gaz, because you game is now a failure.			"

												It took me a long time to get to like Marvel Heroes. It came out in relatively rough shape with a not-so-great microtransaction business model. But over the last year or two, I have come around because of the incredible outreach the devs made in improving the game and talking to the community. Prior to last month, I would have put it in my top three ARPGs.Then the Update happened. Last month, developers moved to make some sweeping changes. Some are beneficial, such as:- Talent trees for all heroes which lends some diversity to other characters who were generally limited to cookie-cutter builds- Simplification of boosts cuts down on some of the bloat in the in-game store which was probably confusing and a turn-off for new players.- General balance pass that helped prop up some heroes who've fallen by the wayside and knocked a couple who were top tier for far too long.But the brunt of the update was how the game changed movement within game and post-leveling progression:- Movement powers were all slowed down by about 20%.- Characters with teleports are now limited to short distance hops that still have travel time- All characters are limited to just a couple dodges on a cooldown.- OMEGA leveling, which was postgame skillpoints, has been removed in favor of a carbon copy of Diablo III's Paragon levels. These take excessive grinding to acquire, barely impact your character's stats, and many are actually just irrelevant to your character (Summoner Damage on characters without summons)One of the biggest frustrations with these changes is that they are geared towards console release. Dataminers have found increasing amount of references in game code for an upcoming PS4 version. Despite this, developers are misleadingly insisting these changes are unrelated. The worst part of these changes is the feedback. Players cried foul for months ahead of time and devs retreated on social media and the forums, only responding to positive posts and ignoring constructive criticism. Since it dropped, they have largely either ignored the uproar or noted that ""It's for the long-term best interest of the game"". At this moment, upcoming patches appear to largely address unrelated issues. Given the Gazillion's lack of responsiblity and foresight in handling this, I cannot recommend Marvel Heroes at this time.			"

												This game has been on a long decline since the middle of 2015 (the height of raiding and Supergroup (think of Guilds) participation). The only thing that hasn't been in decline is some of the work by the art departments, but you have to pay for those heroes and costumes to benefit from that department. The free portion of the game has morphed from a fast-paced game into a bad Diablo 3 clone, which is unfortunate because this game used to have its own unique niche in the ARPG market and a lot of people loved it.. at that time. Shame.			"

												Game has been ""Consolized"" in the latest patch. ""the biggest update"" ""for the health of the game"" means removing and limiting the choices on how you can build your characters powers.

												PROS:At least loki's has an ultimate now.CONS:moving around this grindfest is a complete chore now,  It was only bearable when you could just blink at spirit cost or for free or whatever dumb thing your hero used. Awesome!Many squishier builds are completely garbage now.Characters that required more than one bar and did not transition are useless.Talent system is much better for heroes that were trash, devastating for everyone else.Talent system has obvious objective branch choices.I.E. doom has to take a talent for his latverian army now, instead of just having it. The omega system was overwhelming to newbies, but the new infinity system is a bore and wastes a tone of time.  Talent system would be interesting to new players, but its just a lame tone down of the previous skills' abilities.  TLDR:  Before they gimped movement; this game was a  grindfest diablo clone with a marvel skin.  Now:   You really start to notice how long it takes to reach bosses in midtown, hightown, etc. Many gimmick characters that were fun because of their constant movement or etc, are fun for about 1 second, twice on a twelve second cooldown.  So enjoy that double blink when you need to cross maps to kill x boss x times for no drops. "

												This was my all time favorite game to play until the 1/17 update. I've spend a couple hundred on it over the past 3 years and didn't regret it once until now. They nerfed every character, ruined every form of travel (teleport, vehiclesl, dashes, and even running), and made attributes entirely pointless. The game is completely unplayable in its current state and I just wish I would have know what was to come before investing so much time and funds into a game that the devs would just nuke to nothing. 0/10 would not recommend until they replace everything about the game that made it fun.

												Marvel Heroes 2016 claims it is an action rpg.  This is a lie.Marvel Heroes is where my time goes to die.Thanks to the daily login awards, I know that I have played for 61 days.Thanks to Steam I know that I have played 650 hours.Is it July already?1) How do they get your money?  This is the critical questions on any free to play game.Marvel Heroes lets you earn the entire roster of 58 heroes and villians for free by grinding.  They let you earn a huge number of teamups and other benefits by grinding.  How do they separate you from your hard earned funds?  Loot.  Tons of loot.  They drown you in loot and then sell you additional STASH (bank) space.You can also use money to buy heroes, costumes, and other stuff but the key pressure to entice your expendatures is inventory space limits.2) Is it fun?  This is the key question for almost any game.I enjoy killing hordes of mobs and occasional bosses for fun and xp.  As such I find it fun.  I preferred Diablo II to Diablo III and this game feels a little bit of a throwback in that regard.Does it get grindy at times?  Yes.  The do a decent job with daily shared, legendary, and influence quests to make sure you always have some short term goal to work for other than simply level grinding, but after 50 runs from 1-60 it is starting to feel repetitive.  But then I spin up Deadpool's Canadian Devil (think Tasmanian Devil's rampage with guns) and it's all better.3) Do I recommend this game? YesIt's worth 1 playthrough for free if you like action RPGs or the Marvel Universe.  Stop Dr. Doom and Loki from taking over the world.  Then start your twelve step program to break free as needed.  I admit that I am powerless over Marvel Heroes, and I have to get back to my game.			"

												The BUE is a mixed bag, unfortunately it's an unfinished product.  I'd agree with the sentiment it's the BME, Biggest Mistake Ever. Many of the community were blindside by the depth of the changes and the inconsistency of changes discussed in forums.For the casual player who didn't read the forums they had a huge surprise.  I only learned about the BUE in late December and tried to take it all in but missed a lot, plus the stated rate of changes to the recipes was changed without clear fore knowledge.   That alone was highly frustrating.Cons1. Basically a really fast paced game has been slowed down dramatically.  2. The heroes have been nerfed.   Doing less damage overall.3.  Access to only 8 powers.  We used to have access to 3 power bars, 8 powers per bar and have all the powers we wished to use and assign  up to 168 powerpoints as we saw fit.  Choosing the powers we wanted, max the powers we wanted is no longer. 4. No longer superheroes just heroes. .Now heroes feel like they are fighting with one hand tied behind their back due to their limited power selection. Many heroes now have much of their powers on cooldown during fights and feel limited during combat.  Normally I would have just chosen another power bar and cycle through, no more.5. We now have limited options for builds for the heroes which is determined by the talents of each hero. If we ignore the talents players will gimp their heroees.  Few of the powers I personally liked to use together are the ones the devs chose to work togehter. therefore forcing players to change how they play the heroes.6. The Omega system was replaced with the inferior Infinity system.  The former Omega system offered  true customiziblity of the heroes.    The Infiinty System             a.  offers few choices.             b.  higher costs,             c.  infiity point progression 10 times slower.             d. decreased the progress of veterans by dividing Omega points by 10.             e. Players no longer can envision and play heroes how we wish by upping defense or melee or ranges etc.             f, wasted infinity points in gems we don't care for.             g. pychologically less rewarding since points are fewer, slower coming, less rewarding.  Formerly Omegas could be               assigned more usefully as you played.  Now maybe once every few months would you look at Infinity points.7. The upside of the slowdown is not finished, the drop loot has bugs, 8. the Omega gear isn't finished yet, 9.The higher difficulties aren't finished. 10. The economy of the game changed.  Cost of recipes weren't lowered on release yet recipes that created currency thru exchange  in the game were removed.   Though that since has been fixed.11. Some of the recipes were prematurely removed or poorly communicated they were being removed.12. Many artifacts now had higher level requirements, only being equiped at max level.13. Ultimate power not accessible until level 60, formerly 52.  One of the joys of prestiging was getting our ulitmate back for the final push, that now gone.14. The traits for some  hero weren't consistent with lore.  Some players spent resources realigning heroes after update, then find out the traits are being changed in a later patch.  Those should have been formalzied earlier.  Traits now limit attributes.  Many players had to reassign artifacts or costly bonuses to benefit from the new system.15. Due to change in artifacts, uniques formerly BIS are no longer and require millions to reroll to get BIS again.  With the change in the economy for those not having the foresight to stockpile credit chest only a few heroes would be as powerful as before.16. Limited dashes, 17. Linking dashes to breaking crowd control 18. Reintroduce difficulty settings furher bifurcating player base.Pros  1. Team up synergy- encourages players to own more teamups.2. Mission Tracker is customizable and on one tab.3. Updated graphics look good and more cut scenes.4. Updated artifacts.5. Costume cores are easier to reassign for individual heroes if you have multiple costumes.7. Increased difficulty Zone option.8. Easier to complete Cosmic Trial.9. Removal of Startech, though interesting initially, became annoying trash.10. Medkits no longer take up space, cost nothing. great new feature.I understand some of the decisions, slower combat so we can see the combat clearer. I like beating up trash mobs, a reward system is being designed for loot explosions by accumulating xp which the mobs can trigger which is a good idea but this has yet to be implimented.   The BUE should NEVER have been released without that.The devs poor communication, steadfastness in the face of many in the community objecting to the changes. Many player feel that they have gotten all stick and no carrot.  Many of the complaints were discussed in Test Center but the objections appear thave been ignored. The sense that we players are being told we aren't playing the heroes correctly.  The sense that the game is being streamlined for console and PC users are being used as testers for console.  The slow pace at which new content has come out, many player are still waiting on heroes from last year.Overall the BUE has been a negative.. I miss the Omega system, multiple powerbars, level 52 ultimate the most.  Everything else can be dealt with but the Omega system is like Chess and Infinity system is like Checkers.  The Devs should have communicated in game with windows, notifiying the changes beforehand. Frankly focused on new content, heroes rather than redesign what wasn't broken.  Now the game feels very incomplete, slower and LESS superheroic and if last year is any guide the new finished game won't be done for some time.			"

												Marvel Heroes the 3rd edition of the game, the 2017 remake via the biggest update,  in my opinion is a complete failure for a game that had turned it around after the initial launch.   They have simplified so much,  like getting rid of the omega customization system for the overly simplified infinity system.  Why not spend the time revamping the omega system which was much more interesting.   Gone are talent point skill points and the ability to increase certain powers over others.  Hate , hate, hate the movement change which slows everything down.  Where is the new content to go along with the biggest update?   They drop this complete change and say it's all not done yet, just wait for the rest?  WTH.  There are plenty of other things to complain here, but I'm done spending $ with this overhaul.I will agree, they are trying to go console with this, but it is a big step backwards on many levels for a pc game that came out in 2014.

												i really wish I could give this game a really positive review. when it is up and running correctly, it is a lot of fun. It is easy to just play for 30 mins on your favorite character and have some fun. There isn't a whole lot of depth, but for a free to play game, it is really good.The problem is that the game is really buggy. It will be running like a top, and then a patch will come out and cause crashes for a large portion of the players. Gazillion's tech support is pretty slow at finding solutions.I usually have to walk away from the game for a few months then come back hoping that another patch has fixed the problem.			"

												Reposting my review to keep it fresh. Nothing personal, but anyone posting positive ""reviews"" of this game right now are paid shills, just plain stupid, or easily amused by terrible games. There is literally nothing good about this game right now. It's much worse than I ever even imagined it would be, even when I updated my reviews right after The Biggest Mistake Ever went live. The game is a hollow shell of what it was, and offers nothing worthwhile for either new players or veterans now. They're obviously doing all this in preparation for a console launch, but they've messed it up so badly, nothing short of a complete rollback of all the recent updates could possibly bail them out now. Above all, DO NOT believe any of the reviews of this game by critics and publications. All of those are obsolete and irrelevant. This is quite literally no longer the same game, any more than Diablo 3 is the same game as Diablo 2.Anyhow, here's my previous reviews:Updating this review because it's even worse than I expected, after The Biggest ♥♥♥♥♥torm Ever. Practically everything about that update made the game worse, not better. The switch from Omega to Infinity removed all semblence of choice; everything is obvious and mandatory now. The points received to spend leave everyone far weaker than previously, and certain build types are nerfed to obvlivion. The changes to powers are basically the same thing; dumbing down the game, removing options, removing fun. The movement changes, as expected, are a tragedy.Nothing about this game is worth playing it any more. Path of Exile is better in literally every way imaginable. Save yourself the bandwidth and drive space, and ignore this has-been.*PRE-UPDATE REVIEW:*Don't bother. This game is finished. They just went out of their way to prove they no longer give a rat's ♥♥♥ what their players want. They're proceeding with rolling out a massive change that completely ruins one of the few things that set this game apart from other ARPGs, which was the awesome mobility. It's getting nerfed to the ground, even though almost no one wants it. Along with other massive changes that are also for the worse, adding a ton more grind for no reason.Used to be good, but as soon as these changes land, it's going to be nothing but a fastly inferior Diablo 3/Path of Exile with Marvel characters. Save yourself a wasted download, and just get Path of Exile instead. No reason to bother with this game any more.			"

												So this game was awsome before the update. Then I was banned from chat for stating my opinion. I guess freedom of speech doesn't work everywhere unless  the opinion is a good one for this game. So i was banned from chat. I appealed and received a 7 day account ban. After the ban I tried logging back in to give this game another shot since I realized after all my hours played and money spent I thought to myself maybe the update is not that bad. I logged back in and lord behold I was still ban from chat. I appealed again and no response. I tried playing this but its impossible to play when I cant raid cause  of the chat ban. I cant trade, raid, or party chat due to the chat ban which makes the game worse to play that its pathetic, especially with the new update. They should have ban me just from the social tab. But its cool that means gazillion lost another customer. I have a gut feeling this game isn't going too far and does not have much of a life line left. Advise for the future players freedom of speech in this game does not work even with a filter implamented unless your opinion benifets this game. Becareful what you say. So I deleted the game from my computer and will never return. Atleast the old gazillion team listened to their costumors. Ill pop bottles when I hear the news that this game bit the dust which Im sure it won't be long its already out lived its life span anywayse. Till then ill take my money else where to something more fun.			"

												Another discontented with the update, I guess you could call me. It hit a few of my main heroes pretty hard(summoners particularly) and Hawkeye, while never particularly good, has a lot less output than before. My main gripe, though isn't about my characters feeling weaker and slower. Its that the game has been changed to feign difficulty/challenge instead of actually becoming challenging. The way they game has been updated simply makes it so that enemies have more health and deal more damage, while you do less damage. On top of that, with the movement nerfs imposed on dashes just makes people THINK they are being mor 'tactical' with their movement when its really just hampering them. TL;DR: Difficulty now just amounts to 'buff enemies, nerf heroes' and 'stop moving around so much so enemies can hit you more'.			"

												850+ hours on record.  Stumbled on the game when remembering fun times had playing Marvel Ultimate Alliance.  This game is not quite like MUA and is meant as more of a sandbox Diablo clone.  I played from June 2016 until the 2017 January ""update"" Gazillion developers dropped on the community.  Was a very enjoyable game until last week.  Example of a game developer doing everything against common sense and logic, and rather than release new content to keep a free to play game from getting stale, many of the games core mechanics have been drastically altered despite negative feedback from game community.  There is a good reason that at the time of this review recent critiques of Marvel Heroes has been mostly negative.Long time players feel ""update"" was a move to getting a console port of this game to increase developer revenue streams.  Time will tell.  In the meantime Gazillion has had their fingers in their ears as far as listening to feedback prior to and since update, and it doesn't help that a shrinking loyal cadre of *%#$ing sheeple idiots in the game are in it only to see their moronic suggestions adopted as how game will operate going forward.  Views or critique that runs against newly adopted updates is met with bans on official developer forums from Gazillion employees, and scorn from the token idiots that got whatever moronic feature they wanted with this update that has made gameplay worse.Used to feel like a super-hero in the environments, now the game isn't fun to play and bears little feel to how the game played when I first picked it up.  I hope that some are able to enjoy the game in it's current state and would like to see someone enjoy it as much as I once did in my time as a regular player.  Just strongly feel that the utility they will get out of it isn't what it once was.Enjoy hunting cash whales, Gaz.  Was fun while it lasted.-Ace			"

This game used to be above average at best. Now with the "" Biggest Update Ever"" it's become an underwhelming grind fest with little to no reward at the end. The Dev's took away the allure of the game which is being a Superhero that gave you the feeling that you had some impact in the world, to just being a hero with little impact at all. This ""Big Update"" didn't add any new content (which it has very little of) or any updated effects. Gaz and their Dev's have given us a weaker version of a game that hundreds of other games do better.The only reason I can see why Gaz destroyed their game was to try and sell it on the Playstation. Gaz has thrown this game back in Beta mode with countless updates needed just to make it average again. Very sad... :(			"

												Version BUE:I'll start by saying that I'm so time-invested that I will continue to play...some, not like I used to play from October-ish 2013 through early January 2017. However, six hours of gametime since the update is enough to convince that the current Gazillion development team and I have very different ideas about how this game should evolve.  Meaning that my support for the game will dwindle as long as the current design philosophy prevails.1. Talents/powersWhen the developers began their announcement of the changes in their devblogs, this plan was one I was generally supportive of. Subject to my overall assement about the implementation, I'm pretty ambivalent about this change. Neither great nor terrible.2. MovementHere is a big area of divergence in opinion about the game design. The designers have reduced all heroes to essentially the same for purposes of getting around. Heroes whose identity is predicated on movement (e.g. Silver Surfer and Nightcrawler) are now limited like everyone else. I missed the explanation for the ""necessity"" of winding up for travel powers or charges for dashing, but the choppiness of it precludes me from even giving them a fair chance on justifying it.3. Infinity system replacing OmegaI was mixed on this proposed idea, and after reconfiguring a few heroes, I can say I LOATHE the new system. The old Omega system was flawed with an abundance of practically useless nodes or nodes that you took to unlock the actual useful nodes. I was very much in favor or streamlining the end-game progression, but streamlining is related to efficiency not OVERSIMPLIFICATION, which is precisely what the Infinity system has done.  But if that was the only change, I would only be mildly annoyed--what really infuriated me is the ham-fisted approach of forcibly allocating points into the six categories. To compare with the old system, It would be like having 10000 omega points but you could only spend 1000 in psionics, mutation, or any of the other branches.4. Implentation of the changes.I can sum up my thoughts on how Gazillion implemented the BUE with the term, HALF-COCKED. Implementing pieces of a system that require parts not yet available is just foolish.  There is the PR hit the game is rightfully taking--they were going to get some negativity regardless, but I would have don't think it would have reached as frothy bilious hostility had they delayed the update until the whole update was complete.I'm not privy to their internal sales data, but have to believe they are taking a substantial hit right now. I can say that I personally holding off from spending any money right now even though Beast is coming out soon, and he is the hero I have been most eagerly awaiting--at the current time, I'll probably just buy him with splinters as opposed to buying his bundle like I did with the other previous heroes I most wanted (the aforementioned SS, NC, and Rogue.)In sum, I wouldn't recommend this game to others at this time even though I will continue to play it some.

												It's truly rare that you have the opportunity to watch a company and its game self-destruct so quickly and spectacularly like you can with Gazillion and Marvel Heroes right now. They clearly don't have the talent or resources to keep up with their game and are compounding that by expending what resources they do have, not only on not improving the game, but on actively making it worse by undoing the things they've spent the last year working on and that their players spent their time attaining. The goal seems to be excising fun with surgical precision, except that surgical precision is an order of magnitude away from anything the team can muster these days, as evidenced by the myriad bugs present in every single thing rolled out (accompanied by contradictory dev posts on the matter). They have been hemmorhaging management and developers for some time now, which has turned the company into a mess, which has made more people want to leave, so it's a vicious cycle of incompetence lacking completely in direction except for ""away from a good game."" Nearly every change is shortly undermined or undone, and they have recently kicked the foundations out from under the mechanics of their movement and combat systems to make sure even getting around the game world is a chore. Ostensibly, some of this is ruining the PC game in preparation for the launch of a bad console game, but right now, I'm not sure it will survive that long. It's a shame. This used to be a fun game.

												Came back to the game after the 2.0 update to find that it's been ruined. So much was lost in their 2.0 simplification update. Extra bars are gone, no need to actually HAVE and plan a build now. Pretty much went from being a great ARPG that could compete with Path of Exile and destroyed Diablo 3 to a Fisher Price version of its former glory.Marvel Heroes 2016 is simply not worth the time anymore unless you're a HUGE fan of the characters.For the real gamers out there, you're better off sticking to a better ARPG like Path of Exile, maybe even Grim Dawn.

												I can say after the new update the game is a pain in the ♥♥♥. I am a vet and I poured money into the game - and now I hate it. There is no daily login rewards anymore; it's slow and sluggish; we can't no longer have more than 1 skill bar, we are being placed onto the betting table in hopes of pulling mobile/console gamers into the scene.We also so a lot of options removed for builds and either not get representation or we were forced to take talents to return functionality to abilities. Summoners have no representation in the infinite part of the infinity system. Some heroes have been ruined or are neigh unplayable in high level content, i.e. Cap and Bucky. Gutting abilities, removing them, and then forcing people to take a talent in order to get it back up to current is not inventive.I'm tired of nerfs: I got killed by TRASH in patrols. TRASH. With my max-geared heroes, TRASH killed me. I am fairly certain that has never happened ever and it immediately made me feel like a regular civilian - certainly not superheroic.This game is not fun to play anymore.			"

												This final update has been the nail in the coffin... When devs find themselves cornered... lacking the skills or willpower to create proper content, to add more hroes, to hold to a rather fair F2P format. Greed and laziness shine through.Marvel Heroes has had its ups and downs... I´ve been around since the closed Beta, i was a founder, supported the project like so many others... This update makes me feel like i´ve wasted years of my life. Spent years working on a functional system, on customizing many characters, spent plenty of money because it felt worth it...The complains aren't so much about the damage rebalance or dashing reduction, that's fine... But the omega system, something people have spent thousands of hour to level it up, was thrown to the garbage completely, 2nd and 3rd skill bars, erased, very customizable skill/spec tree, discarded... A lot of people have fully maxed characters at this point, and relearning them as they level isnt an option anymore. They've made gear people have worked for obsolete, not because there are new items with better stats, but because they've rendered old stats completely obsolete.Now it isnt worth even as a F2P. don´t even try it.

												Used to be a bad game (Release) then got better over the years. Now it feels like an alpha game with no clear direction to where it's headed.Talents were a good idea but Gaz delivered horribly and rather than create diversity in builds, it instead led to builds being stale and cookie cutter ones.Difficulty is skewed now, what was once easy content was scaled up to a difficulty higher (Former green content is still green content but is now as hard as red content.) without giving increased rewards.Dashes feel wierd now due to charges, bosses still deliver one-hitting skills after another but you get only three charges which will allmost instantly be used up. Travel powers are now slower and have a windup.Free default costumes from prestiging are going away.Gaz is introducing new p2w content in the form of BIF which will also invalidate former paid for drop rate boosts.Costume size changes are going (Keep in mind some people paid for Pym Shrinking syrum just for it's size decrease).Infinity system, while it couldve been a great system, is very restricting, forces you to take unneeded stats, is more cost inefficient than former omega system and offers much less alternatives.TL;DRDon't bother spending money, Gaz cares more about it's soon to be console game than us.

												Originally a standout fast-paced, highly accessible action RPG, Marvel Heroes has recently chosen a new design direction. It now has a slower pace and more challenging, engaging combat.Now, instead of defining its own genre, Marvel Heroes is sharing design space with Path of Exile and Diablo III. They may rival Path of Exile in quality one day, but for now, it's not a good look.Not recommended.			"

Oh How the Mighty FallA once-great game, fallen into disrepair. Between the ignorance of the development team, the open IRL bigotry of some of their main employees (Looking at you, Asros), the 'Biggest Update Ever' amounting to a complete gutting of its internal systems and core mechanics...Marvel Heroes is an unplayable with an intolerable background. It's straight-up broken garbage.So allow me to reverse my original review: Play Diablo 3 instead.Sure, when MH launched, the difference was clearly in Marvel's favor. But unlike Gazillion, at least Blizzard's Diablo team is capable of positive iteration.			"

												I enjoyed the game a great deal, though generally only really played it in spurts.  It has gone the way of WoW and so many other games and dumbed everything down, taking out all the cool (though not always the min/maxer useful) abilities in the omega point system and taking the choice work out on your skills.  To add to that it is now seems made for consoles, which after playing and not sticking with every other game that has done that (ESO, DCUO, NWN, etc) I will likely be seeing my time in game drop even further.  I will still play it and I enjoy the super hero aspect of it (since CoH/V is no more) but I can't recommend the game anymore.I don't understand why game devs think we don't like to have options and the more options the better.  Come on folks, just let us play how we want instead of forcing us to play how you want!			"

												Some people will/do like the changes, they claim the game is now more of a “challenge” and/or “the game feels new and fresh”.. Some will/do like some of the changes, and some will adapt or try to adapt. And then there are some like me, who do not like any of the changes at all. Why? Because this is now no longer the game I fell in love with, spent most of my free time playing and one of the few games I threw money at. Yes it has changed, but it does NOT “feel new and fresh” and if I wanted that, call me crazy, I would have moved on and found another game. Doing the same old content at a slower rate is not what I call “feeling new and fresh” Having to respec and regear 59 level 60 heroes is not my idea of any kind of fun. Here’s the bottom line, if you have never played this game and want to try, go for it but don’t spend a dime on it, make no mistake, this game was changed for the new console cash cows. The paying PC players have for the most part been milked dry. Some new players, like some old player might still like the game, but it is NOT what it once was, so, I can no longer in all honesty recommend this game. "

												I've been playing this game since it hit steam and have logged in nearly 800 hours. This games USED to be one of my favorite games to play. However after the 'Epic Update' I find myself struggling to get any enjoyment out of it. Gaz's update seems to be aimed at streamlineing the game for console and new players. And while it certainly has done that it's also made the game far less engaging and boring after more then 20 hours.Many of the old systems/idems, such as character specific uniques, gold medallions, attributes, and the omega system, have been nutered to the point they are all but worthless. The good news is it takes far less time to fully gear a character, but it also means once geared there is little to do except switch to a new character and run through stroy mode again. Now however there are manditory stroy checkpoints so you have to do every mission with every character to progress. Which is even more tedious and boaring then it sounds.			"

												As of right now, I can't recommend it. The game is a shadow of what it was. This update reeks of the SWG CU if anyone remembers that debacle. At this point it is all to obvious that they are getting this game ready for a console port.*Post BUE Edit*I have put in a LOT of time on every different toon now since the BUE, and my review stands as before. this game is a shadow of what it was. Frankly, it is a complete joke now. Loot is nonexistant, no new content in 18 months, everything is slooooow, hell, even the coding is ♥♥♥♥-poor. I would say if you really want to check it out, then get in and run one toon through the story to completion, then uninstall. Anything else will be a disappointment.The official forums for this game are almost as much of a joke as the game itself. Your criticisms have to come with a healthy dose of brown-nosery or you get assaulted by white knights or simply banned by the heavy handed forum mods (Gaztapo).The game is adopting a p2w attitude which will probably be its eventual downfall. It isn't quite there yet, but it is quite easy to see how they are making the push.Again, if they make changes that make the game great again, I'll change my review. Right now this review is sadly gonna have to stand.Ohh and my hours played aren't really accurate as I have another 10 or so months that I didn't play through Steam.			"

I can see Hardcore gamers wanting something new and perhpas thats why the remade the game in January 2017 into something completely different.  I didnt even get to fully explore the old version (end game and epic zones) So once again as a casual player for MMOs, lose out unless you power game through to see and do everything.  Some are finding the all new Marvel fun but when I login now I just dont have any interest in playing for na hour or two like I did.			"

												The game is now clunky, the fights tedious and pretty much every aspect of the ""biggest update ever"" directly targeted the things I liked about this game (down to my Tri-Doom!).  It has been a good run, but I can no longer recommend this game to anyone.  There is also no new content in this ""biggest update ever"" so you get the fun of doing the same old stuff you have been doing.... except it now takes longer and the loot is garbage (They didn't release the new tier of loot with this... which is just painfully stupid).The current dev team has no clue what they are doing, taking the game back to the horrible state it was in at launch.  I toughed it out then, but not going to this time.  So much time wasted on creating this garbage... when they should have been focusing on creating content.

												What used to be a fast paced, fun game has become clunky and slow. Movement powers and damage have been reduced to the point of a complete change of feel to the game. Massive changes to skill trees and character attributes require the long time player to invest considerable resources to re-optimize their characters, and some characters have changed so dramatically that former favorites are so different that they are no longer fun and interesting to play.I have not completely given up on this game yet, and hope to find fun in it again if/when more content is released and powers are adjusted to bring back some of the old feel and pace at least. However, at this time I cannot recommend this once great game.			"

												Hello.. I Do Not enjoy Marvel Heroes since the biggest update ever. I did try. The biggest disappointments for me are as listed:1. Movement Changes such as teleport / dash / travel powers are now SLOWED and LIMITED. This has slowed the game to a snail's pace compared to the game prior to the recent patch. 2. Omega System was more interesting and engaging than the LIMITED Infinity System. Omega points could be precisely used where the infinity system has a forced distribution for less impact. Also missing are interesting additions like the stark drone ally from the Stark Omega Tree.3. The Power Bar or Hot Bar has been LIMITED to one row. Prior to the game patch there were three available. This change has limited the number of powers you can use at any one time.4. Character Damage and Durability has been LIMITED.5. The free in game currency is being LIMITED..removal of item to credit chest exchange..removing eternity sparks from story mode .There are other reasons.. but these are the ones that i believe are making the game not fun for me.All the effort and time put into the game.. grinding for gear, artifacts, and the like has now been washed away because most of your items are not good anymore..either grind for new ones or reroll...but this time it will take longer.. with less credits... less power.. and finally less fun.Prior to the update this game had the option to be easy or challenging depending on your preference. For example, if you didn't want to have unlimited movement.. you didn't have to use it. If you wanted boss fights to last longer.. you could remove artifacts and gear or change attributes to do less damage. If you wanted less complicated ...all the mechanics were in place to have that.Those options are gone and so is the fun for me. "

												I played this game daily barring a few days at most for three years. I played a bit of the beta, and then played through their rough launch. I put in money because I truly felt like this was a great game with a great team behind it, I would have recommended it to anyone looking for a game to play.That is no longer the case, I would not recommend this game to anyone. The game has been revamped from top to bottom, and not a single change has been for the better. I've never seen a game so catastrophicly implode as I have this game. I didn't play Star Wars Galaxies, but everyone knows the story of the NGE and how it killed that game. This is right there with the NGE. I truly hope the developers do not end up joining any companies of games I currently play as they destroyed a solid game.			"

												This update killed anything good about this game. Do yourself a favor, play something elseHere is the way Marvel Heroes works. The longer you play, the more you get screwed. They nerf everything you get. Every last good item you find will become useless. You used to get a year or two out of the newest items before they became completely useless, but now it can be 4-6 months until it becomes junk. It's pathtic.Anyway, the new update makes you slower, weaker, and feels even more like a beta game then before (if that is possible). The forums constantly say...wait longer...wait longer. Same old thing since 2013. They have 2 years left on the Marvel rights. When exactly do you think that waiting game will end? the game has had zero new content since forever. Just more paint to make it seam like it has changed.Like I said, do yourself a favor and play something else. The only thing Marvel about this game is the costumes and Hero names.1 out of 5 stars.

It is no longer Marvel Heroes, it is Nerfed HeroesSure the game had its flaws in balance but nerfing everything and make the game slow and stale isnt really appealing. Sure by now you would think they also made loot to drop 5 times higher qualities as TTK went up 500%.... they didnt.Instead of old difficulties where normal/hard were entry levels and cosmic was ""endgame"", it now really has 3 difficulties. ""You oneshot everything(Normal)"", ""You one or twoshot everything(Hard)"" and ""Everything oneshots you(Cosmic)""Overall this feels like SWG and CU/NGE all over again. Implement a whole new mechanics that nobody really wanted and then blaime the community for hating those changes.The best part is that now you only get one skillbar with 8 slots. First i was thinking why the heck they would make this change. Then i realized that console controller only has 8 buttons.....TL:DR This ""Biggest patch ever"" was made to consolize the game and totally screwing the current playerbase on PC.			"

												Oh how the mighty has fallen...What was once a fast paced, fun ARPG is now a clunky, clumsy, slow paced shell of its former self.The game's depth, which once used to be cranked up to 11, has now been dialed back to about a 3.  Movement has been homoginized across every hero, which leaves heroes known for their movement feeling awkward and weak.  The pace of the game is glacially slow now.  The time:reward ratio is WAYYY off.  New content hasn't been released for the game in a VERY long time.  And now that the current developers feel it somehow necessary to reboot just about every aspect of the game, it feels like new content will be at least a year away while they fix the garbage that they just released.Once the previous developers all left the game that was pretty much the death sentence for Marvel Heroes.It is clear that the latest patch is ramping the game towards a console release cash grab that will no doubt fail miserably. I wouldn't recommend this game at all.  It has no future.			"

												With the ""Biggest Update Ever"" Marvel Heroes has quickly become a pay-for-sanity type of game. Progression is at a FRACTION of the speed it used to be. I don't understand this change, at all.The vast majority of Heroes have been gutted in terms of complexity and flexibility. We went from three skill trees to two, and typically there is only one viable way to play a Hero at end-game. They TRIED to make each hero have multiple unique playstyles, but failed pretty hardcore.They ban people that disagree with their opinions (including constructive critcism), so I don't see how they could ever get feedback to change this stuff.It used to be a pretty good game that was fair to free players. Now it is the complete opposite. Whales will be loving all their boosts they buy with hundreds of dollars, though. I suppose they did what they intended to do... make the game more accessable to people that have zero experience in the genre while simultaneously making more money due to the complete thrashing of the free gains of progression.I'll come back in a couple years if they ever fix what they've done. Doubtful they will, though.			"

												As someone who spent over $300 and poured over 1000+ hours in this game, I gotta say this ""MASSIVE UPDATE"" is probably the worst update I have ever experienced in my life. Simply put: It's a pile of garbage. One of the best ARPGs on the market is now a joke of a game. People who spent countless hours on this game got shafted hard, it's like all their effort and work AND money put into the game meant nothing.All that time looking for the perfect rolled gear and collecting omega points basically went down the drain with this update. Anybody who used to be at the top of their game are now bottom tier, even with the best gear possible. Simply doesn't make ANY sense at all from a player's standpoint. Gazillion is basically giving all their veteran players the finger. Until they do something about this and change it I refuse to play and I recommend everyone and anyone to do the same and stay clear from this game. What was a fun, fast, action filled, gear hunting game is no longer existent due to this pathetic excuse of an update. Please Gaz, or whoever it is in charge of this whole overhaul... get your sh** together or get Brevik back. Whichever option will be at least 100 times better than this pile of filth you have on your game right now.			"

												Well the recent news require a review, it seems, just for the sake of it. So here we go.Marvel Heroes was a fun and good game. It was not an AAA gem, it was not the best game ever, but it was a good mix, with some ARPG elements and some MMO ideas. It was somehow easy, but it worked and did its job perfectly. It had awesome reviews (like 80-85% positive), and there was a huge community supporting it. It was a game with a f2p model based on microtransactions working well, with very frequent updates, many additions to the game since the beta years ago, constantly evolving with new heroes, places, etc. Well it was a lot of fun. Even if I don't play it since many months ago, it's still my third most played game on steam, which is at least shocking. So what happened?Maybe you don't know David Brevik, he was one of the minds around the successful Diablo 2 and worked with Gavilion to make Marvel Heroes good from the start.He left the team, and now the developers decided to change absolutely all the mechanics, removing hotkeys, changing all heroes movement to be the same, and many other vital things..and you know what? It is not for improving the game... it is just because of a console port! If you look at the recent reviews, now they are like 30% positive, for a game that was 85% before!The community massively told the developers to stop and don't make this patch, but they didn't care I guess. They ignored the players and went for it.In spite of keep improving their already successful game, they destroyed it with a complete redesign to accommodate consoles. So they got now what they deserve. This is just another example of a ruined game by a company with a very, very, very dumb and unprofessional move. Sadly a common trend today.			"

												I held off for as long as I could, the Biggest Update Ever felt like a nerf to the game but it was tolerable and there was ""hope"" the game would be further improved as this was like wiping the slate clean. However, after todays patch where the stealthly nerfed the loot drops without informing the players and we only found out about it from numerous complaints I cannot recommend this game as it seems to be going down an awful path.I mean for starters it's a loot based ARPG, except the majority of loot you get is trash and unusable, now that's been nerfed even more it means all there is, is just painful mind numbingly boring grind. You don't even feel like a Hero anymore, it's more like Marvel Zeroes 2017 than Heroes....Secondly this shady nerf to the loot, they likely wouldn't admitted anything had there not been enough people complaining whic forced them to speak out about it. That's not something I can get behind, I hate shady ♥♥♥♥ and Gazillion just became Shady.Basically it seems like the new Dev team since Brevik left and the majority of old devs left, wants to un do all the work from the previous few years improvements and take the game back to a place where it wasn't doing very good in amount of players because the game flat out sucked.We once had heroic/superheroic, it got removed, now it's backWe once had seperate boss specific loot, it got changed to universal loot tables, now it's backWe once had no Omega, we got Omega which was fun, now we have Infinity, which will take an infinity to grind it's that slow.None of this ♥♥♥♥ worked 3 years ago, ♥♥♥♥ knows why the devs think it's going to work now and that's not even mentioning the devs are trying to poorly clone Diablo 3 with these new updates.If you want to play Diablo 3, then get Diablo 3, it's a much better game than MH in its current state			"

												Man, hindsight is 20/20 right? I wish I could take back the cash I dumped on this game, it's not the game I started playing any longer. Horrible developer choices have severely limited character customization and playability, destroyed the ability of characters to quickly get from point A to point B, nerfed damage across the board, made trivial fights take 10 times longer than they should and just made the game less fun overall. No idea what they were thinking; if you want to waste an evening trying the game knock yourself out but I would strongly reconsider making a financial investment in this one.			"

												2016 was one hell of a year for Marvel Heroes, a game which originally launched in 2013. Gazillion continued the good work it started in 2015 to revamp Action Role-Playing Game (ARPG), which saw it tie-in closely with other Marvel properties and events.First, let’s not beat about the bush here this is a Free-2-Play (F2P) game, and as such uses a lot of the standard methods to sustain and support development and server costs with real money items. However, most these are entirely optional as most things can be found in-game as drops or rewards. Naturally, premium DLC packs are often timed alongside major Marvel events or in-game character releases for those who wish to simply buy new characters and items.When I first played Marvel Heroes, back when it launched in 2013, I’ll admit to being rather underwhelmed. The hero selection was small, with Daredevil, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Storm and The Thing the five original starting characters. Now, you should consider this was before Daredevil’s Netflix debut, Scarlet Witch’s appearance in the Avengers movies.In comparison, the starting hero list now, gives you a larger selection of heroes to choose from including several ‘Key’ heroes (Black Panther, Captain America, Deadpool, Gambit, Iron Fist, Moon Knight, Nightcrawler, Psylocke, She-Hulk and Winter Soldier). If none of those heroes take your fancy, you can always try out any other hero available up to level 10 too. This is where Marvel Heroes has grown for the better – it’s more welcoming.Also, this year has seen Marvel Heroes tie-in with Captain America: Civil War, Netflix’s Jessica Jones, Daredevil and Luke Cage, Agents of SHIELD and most recently Dr. Strange’s big screen debut. In game events, have been created, many which have gifted players a few heroes based on the event so if you had played during 2016 you would have received Captain America, Iron Man, Daredevil, Luke Cage and Dr. Strange for free… at the height of the popularity no less! Oh, and there was a cheeky Black Cat available on Black Friday.So, there’s a much larger feeling that you’re rewarded for playing, or at least keeping an active eye on the Marvel Heroes’ twitter feed to see when super events are going.Furthermore, Gazillion have revamped the game’s introduction level, which acts as a tutorial, streamlined the crafting system, overhauled the storage (which perhaps remains the one cash cow in regards to real money) and balanced the game’s story missions to scale correctly with the character’s level. In short, the state of the game in 2016 is a more enjoyable and rewarding game for newcomers and those who dip in and out for the big events.There’s perhaps a slight argument that the game has stalled slightly for those who have played constantly since launch, with a slow introduction of new content once you max your character at level 60. Yet, 2016 did see the introduction of leaderboards as an attempt to push a bit of competition between long term players, as well as the much-waited Chapter 10 of the story (which admittedly received a mixed reception from those I’ve played with over the years).Essentially Marvel Heroes 2016 is a loot game at heart, with each hero having its own themed loot to gather most of which will make sense to true Marvel fans when they see the names. However, the loot feels a little lifeless. Unlike other loot games the collecting of new items for your hero doesn’t change or upgrade the character’s appearance. Sure, you get your stat boosts, but any cosmetic upgrade you might be after can only be sought from new costumes (either from the store or from a huge stroke of luck by an in-game drop).All in all Marvel Heroes is a fun game that for me does the F2P model correctly. Every item in the game can be achieved in-game from either a lucky drop, or currency grinding (which for the most part happens naturally as you play). Or you can splash out with real money to buy the hero you want ASAP, with a Costume you want, and the extra STASH slot you might need too. And that’s OK, as those purchases don’t cheat other players out of an experience, there’s no real Pay2Win feature within Marvel Heroes. It’s easy to play this game solo, or to play with friends and strangers. If you’re ever short of friends to play with there’s a rather strong community spirit within this gameThere are areas where Marvel Heroes could improve, and it feels like Gazillion have started to address that with the updating of visuals, the heavy running and feedback gathering of content and changes via the Test Hub. There is a small feeling on reddit, the official forums and on Steam that Gazillion aren’t sure what to do and are running out of ideas since the development team has changed since 2013 but… that’s what happens. People leave to seek new challenges and jobs, and new people come in to replace them. It’s hard to criticise a development team that are pretty open on the forums about what they’re doing, that do listen to feedback (they often poll to see which new characters should be added), and spend time with Streamers and community groups.There’s criticism that there’s no new content to the game, yet 2016 has seen specific content added for Civil War and Dr. Strange. I also find it difficult to think of many loot games that keep introducing new content too. For me half the fun of loot games is running the same areas, harvesting, wrecking insane damage to gather items, materials and other oddities that I have my hit list.Marvel Heroes 2016 has been one of my most played games of 2016, one which I keep returning to simply because it’s easy to play. It’s helped me to become a Marvel fan too, and I’ll admit no shame in enjoying the cross promotion that’s happened with the game and Marvel franchises over the last 18 months or so. I’ll admit this might not be a game for everyone, but for a Marvel fan it’s almost perfect as it plugged the need for a good Marvel game since Ultimate Marvel Alliance (which has since been rereleased).Full review can be found here: http://luchalabs.com/2016/12/07/review-marvelheroes2016/ "

												It was fun for the first 2,400 hours.  I started playing in open beta, so I've been here since the beginning.  I play a lot of RPGs and ARPGs, but I have to say that this game has taken a turn for the worst.  I'm sure you can read about the big update on other reviews, but after playing multiple characters today and seeing how the game feels - it just isn't fun anymore.  I like challenge and all that, but I feel like someone cast ""Slow Time"" on all of my characters then broke their arms.To top it all off, I used to be able to breeze through endgame content but am now relegated to the FIRST of multiple new difficulty settings.  I am geared quite well, but made adjustments to regear according to the new system and even redid my talents/infinity points/synergies/etc.  Unfortunately, I am getting destroyed with no option but to literally grind the lowest difficulty setting so I can get more infinity levels (paragon system in this game).  I don't mind grinding for awhile, but the time to benefit ratio is absurdly dismal.  It would be like logging into World of Warcraft with a fully geared max level character and being relegated to farming Molten Core again.As to why this occurred, the developers decided that they knew what was best for the long-term health of the game despite the vast, persistent outcries against their poor decisions.  Just like a country that fails to listen to its citizens eventually crumbles, so too is this game headed for disaster.  When a game is devoid of fun, it no longer fulfills its entertainment purpose.  It is sad having to write this review, but I can no longer recommend this game to others in good conscience.			"

												This game has come a long way.Started out in May 2013 and so far it has been nothing but fun.Marvel Heroes, created by David Brevik (creator of Diablo 1&2) and Gazillion Entertainment, has evolved to something more than a simple ARPG.It is Free to Play, which means there is no reason for you not to try it out.It is world-wide, which means you are able to play with people on the other side of the globe with no latency issues (no EU or US or Asia Server separation crap).It is a Superhero game, which means you play one of Marvel's Super Heroes and you choose your hero out of the other 20+ available ones, also includes the original voice actors and very soon you will be able to play certain villains as well.I have never seen such dedicated developers, who really listen to the input and suggestions from the community.The constant communication between developers and players is key for a great game and community.Definitely something other developers can look up to!New patches (bugfixes, balancing, more game content) are coming out every week, constantly improving the game experience and making this ARPG truly stand out from the competition.For me personally, I have been with Marvel Heroes since Beta. And I must say, it is absolutely refreshing to see developers making a game out of love and not out of greed for money.I am very certain I will stay with this game for many years to come.Where other APRGs failed to deliver on their promises, Marvel Heroes certainly has become my main game to fuel the loothunt and hack&slash addiction in me ;)The game deserves a complete new review, which means the current meta critic rating of 58 from back in June 2013 is so outdated and does NOT represent the current state of this game at all anymore.-ChronicBoomwww.immortals-gaming.com "

												I actually have close to 1700 hours logged on this game (had the standalone version before coming to Steam), and it has gotten progressively WORSE. This latest patch completely undermined everything players logged on for.Characters are super slow and travel powers have a wind up. Bosses now have more HP. Gaz claims it's to make the game more challenging, but all it does is delay what the game was made for: grinding. Instead of taking a minute (or less if characters are really good), you're looking at FIVE minutes for one boss. So we're running the same content over and over and over again like we're supposed to, but now at a MUCH SLOWER RATE when you combine slow speed, delayed travel, and higher boss HP. It turned grinding into torture. Nothing about it is rewarding.On top of that, all characters practically had a reset button pushed on them, so all the grinding for items and builds that people spent countless hours on is out the window. Once powerful characters are now severely nerfed into the ground. People did not spend all their time and money to have it thrown away with some misguided, selfish ""vision"" the developers had.Gazillion Entertainment (the developers) try to pretend like the player base has a say in the future of the game, but it doesn't. No one asked for this terrible patch. Many people pleaded for Gaz NOT to implement these changes, and they ignored it all. Now you reap what you sow, Gaz.			"

												After what the players and DEVs call the BUE (Biggest Update Ever) there was the removal of multiple toolbars for heros this greatly reduced the number of abilites any hero could use. Now there is a stressed importance of builds, so you are no longer this powerful hero but instead a differently trianed clone of the hero or something.  The massive restriction in how you can play as your hero and the new importance of travle abilites and dash abilites (which could've easily been mapped without taking up toolbar slots) for every hero mean you have even less options in total for which attacks you would like to use.I personally call this the WORST UPDATE EVER, the big improvements if any are all in the way the systems does the math for damage and item drop rates which is all unseen in the background of the game. The loss of the toolbars feel like losing several of your limbs and for some heroes like Star Lord or summoners like Doctor Strange lose more than 1/2 of the available atttack options now that there is only the single small toolbar.

												This game had potential. I played it when it first came out, and there was a lot about it I liked. It's basically Diablo but with superheroes, which is a really cool concept.I wrote a review a while back and in it, my main complaint was the overwhelming amount of baubles, shards, cards, boosts, and random event loots that would constantly clutter your limited inventory. A good 30% of the game is spent managing the loot chute constantly coming your way, and I don't just mean gear. Gear is cool. Even gems (or enhancements you can slot into gear) are cool. But every time logging in it was like opening a closet so full only the door keeps it from spilling out into the room.Now though, the developers have released an update that severely dumbed down the game and nerfed, normalized or undid a lot of perks people spent weeks unlocking. I spent some money on this game unlocking a few heroes but now I, along with many other players, feel betrayed. I can't support that kind of behavior so I've uninstalled and I'm releasing a new review expressing my disapproval. It appears the developers are leaving the PC crowd behind, which based on recent industry trends is a pretty boneheaded move.			"

												I did not have thousand of hours spent on this game. I was not a veteran. But let me tell you something, even for me, the infinity system, the change to the movement abilities, the reduction of the action bars (now you can only have 8 active skills instead of -all of them- like I used to have with my deadpool) and the change on some items and unique items (for my deadpool) it just seems they wanted to dumbify the game. And make it less fun.I agree with some things.  Maybe infinite teleporting was broken, but the range nerf was huge and imo not needed. Maybe the omega system was complicated, but for me as a new player it seemed much more fun.Maybe my deadpool was immortal and needed some nerfs, but now im left with a seemengly useless build and survivability because:1) They limited my skill use, formerly I used all (all) of my skills by the means of 3 different skill bars, I loved the range versatility in it, and the feeling of using all my skills.2) My items where changed and they swaped skill point bonuses with ♥♥♥♥ing less ""awesome"" cost on my skills, before this ♥♥♥♥ stat items did existed, but omg, after trying to avoid them the rework ♥♥♥♥s me right back. And other changes that nerfed my deadpool ""lifesteal"" aswell3) Changes in stats out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere. For me as a new player, who was saving some money to get a stash tab and new heroes, this seemed like a good time to reconsider my investment. I cannot imagine how veterans feel about this. I do hope that a middleground is found, but for now, I really dont have much motivation to play, and I was really excited to come back.			"

												Over 2400 hours on this game.  The new update has worsened the game and I've now uninstalled it.First, the hero updates have not been reviewed enough.  A few of my heroes, and my main (Spider-Man) have been ruined.  I loved my spider-man and played him from the start of this game at launch.  The new system takes away so much of his effectiveness in battle compared to before that he is no longer fun to play.  The story mode changes are making it much more linear.  They are fun and interesting the first time though, but are stale and boring after that.  I always thought they story mode changes they would make would make story mode a alternative to the grinding modes they have, but they went the opposite direction of what I thought.Since they have ruined some of the heroes I play, I would now need to invest a large chunk of time to find out which new heroes I would like to play.  Meaning I have to go through each hero and test out the 1-3 possible builds they have and see if I like them.  That means testing some 50+ heroes.  I already did that in the past game and don't have that type of time anymore.  After then figuring out which heroes I like, I would need to redo all their items as they changed a lot of artifacts, made uniques suck again, made some runewords suck, etc...  It is kind of sad, but I prefer the talent/skill system of Diablo 3 now more than compared to this game and I hate Diablo 3's talent/skill system.Also, the omega node system they had before was very interesting.  Instead of drastically changing it to the very boring and dumbed down version of this now infinity system.  They could have just altered specific nodes in the old system to increase the amount of playstlles.  They actually decreased playstyles now with the new infinity system, something you don't want to do in an ARPG.  I know the reason why they went to the infinity system is to reduce the labor resources used to create new nodes and balancing in the old omega system.  Now, the infinity system is stuck as it is and has no where to go, when the omega system was only about 60-70% done and they could have added in some really cool stuff with it.  I know people think this new talent/skill system adds more playstyles, but it really does not.  All they did was removed affixes to skills and put them onto a system in which you ""activate"" those affixes now, but you have to determine which affix you want most.  I don't want to go into explaining it as it would take a while, but this new system does not add extra playstyles to these heroes.  Most heroes are still stuck in choosing a melee, ranged, or movement build.  Though, a hero that is all melee, you get too choose between regular damage or bleed damage.  Some heroes did get new skills.  Lucky for the few heroes that did and lucky for the few people who play those heroes that no one played before.Overall, this change was not needed and actually worsened more heroes than it helped.  It also worsened the story mode.  I uninstalled this game and had high hopes for it.  This game though, after David Brevik  and other key developers at the start of the game leaving, has caused it to go in the wrong direction.  Lastly, this is sad that they spent the entire last year developing this update and this is the best they can do.  We were promised by these developers in the past that updates would add conent such as:- new story elements (the last part of the story ch. 10 was not on par or even close too the ch. 9 asgard update)- story mode could be used to grind instead of the grinding zones- new one shots to add interesting side stories (none have been added since Brevik left)- New Raids (again, none added since Brevik left)- update to x-defense and holo-sim challenges (has this even been worked on, ever?)- updates to make midtown and industry city more random and changing instead of the same stale boring thing we see every day.  They only change midtown since its launch by adding in 3 extra parts of the map that spawn no enemies.  Really, you added empty builldings that do nothing?They have not delivered on anything they have promised, but instead did this update which fixes only a few things.  Those few things are skill updates to certain heroes that needed them.  All they needed to do, instead of rolling out new skill changes for everyone was to fix the heroes that needed changes.Also, they spent time changing the name and inventory visual for costume cores( items you attached to costumes in the past to improve your stats).  Why did they waste resources doing this?  All they had to do was remove the ""costume"" word from the title of these cores and they were pefect for what they did (making these cores a standalone slot item).  They did other little things as well that they wasted time on that did not need changes instead of fixing the core issues. I believe they think they can grab a slew of new players who have never played before by saying ""Biggest Update Ever"" and new players won't realize all of the stuff they still have not fixed.Recommendation: Do not install if you are a new player, the best days of this game are behind it.If you are a current player, I recommend you uninstall.

												Most disappointed update ever. Every hero feels out of point; everything got nerf to the core just to make old content to be more ""challenging"" meanwhile they could have done better by adding new contents. P.S Receive a permanent banned for giving out objections and ideas.			"

												I still preferred the previous style of gameplay of Marvel Heroes. That's where when people are happy, they will be happily to spend it as well. A little bit of change i don't mind, but this time i felt it's alot.. So too bad.Always keep in mind, LISTEN TO YOUR PEOPLE who are your biggest supporters! Not about the biggest update.

 Intro This will be my first 'review' I will be writing for a game, so if you have any feedback for me, I am happy to hear you out! After writing this I do actually believe it's more of an introduction to Marvel Heroes with my own opinion mixed together. Anyhow... Recently Marvel Heroes re-released as Marvel Heroes 2015. Gazillion had a rough start but they really turned the game around in to something great. There are weekly updates, events and patches to keep everyone busy. There are heroes and some villians to play in MH2015 but I will just talk about heroes (easier to read).  Gameplay You get to choose one of the 11 starters, which are; Captain America, Black Panther, Punisher, Black Widow, Luke Cage, Human Torch, Colossus, Storm, Hawkeye, Rocket Racoon & Daredevil. After choosing one, the journey begins. First you will start with the storyline, which is set up in chapters. In total there are nine chapters located all throughout the Marvel universe. After gaining a certain level, more game modes will open up to you, giving a lot of different options to level. Gameplaywise, Marvel Heroes is an ARPG, similar to Diablo 2. Furthermore, It's loot heaven. Really, I have never seen this much loot. Like most ARPG's, it can be grindy, expecially if you don't like the game (duh) or hero. The game is set up as a serious time sink. At the moment, you have around 35(?) heroes and villians available. These can all be leveled to 60. If you enjoy a hero that much, there is the option to prestige him/her, 5 times. The prestige system basically means starting over having a different coloured name and the ability to buy a special pet (pets are only for showing off). If you still don't have enough from playing your favorite character, Gazillion recently added to option to cosmic prestige your character. This takes 25 times the normal leveling rate. Talk about a major time investment right? The game has three difficulty settings. Normal, heroic and superheroic. While leveling you will unlock these modes automatically. In my opinion, the game is not hard (except for some endbosses which are rediciously difficult) and very forgivable. This is not everyone's cup of tea, but I like it because I don't have all the time in the world so it always feels like I am progressing.  Endgame When you're level 60, there are various different ways to gain the best loot possible. To be honest, I haven't done a lot of endgame yet. I do have 3 level 60 heroes at them moment, but I prefer leveling over endgame. Gazillion added raids not too long ago but I have yet to try them out. I will update this section as soon as possible!   Business Model The game is F2P, but it may be the fairest I've ever encountered. So far, I've only spend €4,- on some extra storage and a hero. I will spend more soon (those packs are sooo tempting!) but that's because Gazillion deserves my money, not because I need to. I do think some cash shop items are overpriced when they're not in discount.  Eternity Splinters This is the in-game currency. You see, most of the stuff in the game is obtainable through the in-game currency called Eternity Splinters (ES). These ES drop on an invisible timer. You just play and they randomly drop from anything giving XP. From ES you can buy heroes, team-ups or anything else you'd like. The only thing which is not obtainable through ES are storage space and fortune cards. It's a neat system and you get some extra ES on your first playthrough to help you on your way. Graphics On the highest settings, the game looks great. The newer heroes/areas all have detail and you can see Gazillion puts a lot of care in designing their game and characters. Some of the older areas and heroes however, look a little bit bland. They are working on this by updating the older heroes. I haven't heard any plans on updating some of the older areas. Another thing is the performance. After playing for a while, the game's performance gets worse. This is a known problem for players and most think this is a memory leak. Over the months I've played, it already got better, but this is still an issue.  Longetivity THERE. IS. SO. MUCH. TO. DO. Seriously, the possibilities are endless. There are so many heroes that you can choose from. Also I have the feeling the game is gaining momentum because of the re-release and the ever growing popularity of Marvel. They connect their game to the Marvel movie releases with great updates (latest example Guardians of the Galaxy). Summary Marvel Heroes 2015 is an endless timesink. And a very very very fun one at that. So far I've spend a fair amount of time in the game. I prefer leveling over endgame, so I will have to spend some more time on that part. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is in to Marvel (or anyone in to comics in general). Gazillion really nailed the feeling of being your favorite hero (or villian). The game does tend to get grindy at times. Also, this is not mentioned before, but the community is great. The official forums are very active and in game there's always someone willing to help.  Tips for new players  Don't sell the loot you don't need, but donate the stuff you don't need/use to the crafter. By donating you level him up giving you nice options later on. When buying heroes with Eternity Splinters, you can also buy a random hero box. This box is 175 splinters whereas the heroes are 200/400/600. This box will give you a random hero so if you're not too picky on which hero to play, this is a great option. There is a chance that you receive the same hero you already have, in which case you will get an ultimate token.     marvelheroes.com official website. "

												TL;D(want to)R - This game released a MASSIVE overhaul patch that neutered pre-existing content, over simplified character customization thus limiting character builds, dumbed down their entire approach to the games core mechanics, and absolutely butchered the skill trees which, in my opinion, use to actually be fairly decent at offering at least some customization options. This game never did me any favors in terms of feeling that any new content being released aside from new heroes and villains was substantial. But this game was simply still just a fun way to kill some time and roleplay as your favorite Marvel icons which made it easy to overlook the limitations. But now for them to make such a large and terrible change without really offering any substantial new content is a double jeopardy and just reeks of laziness and foolishness on the parts of the developers who have chosen to completely ignore and/or disregard the vast majority of those who tested these changes beforehand and expressed their disdain for the upcoming patch. I honestly feel bad for those who missed out on this game beforehand because this ship has sailed. It is now devolving into a tightly packed and neatly packaged console game that no longer maintains any of the charm that this title use to have.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------Before this particular update, this was my go-to casual play game. I am not saying that it was by any means perfect, but it was a solid ARPG that allowed me to play as MANY different Marvel icons, and it did so in such a way that made building your character feel at least a little bit unique and entertaining. But this update... OHHHH this update... it took the game back about 5 steps.Imagine reverting Diablo 2 back to Diablo 1, or Torchlight 2 to Torchlight 1, or Red Dead Redemption back to Red Dead Revolver... (hopefully at least one of these examples works for you). What I mean by this is that the game had a certain (very mild) complexity to it that was intriguing and it was replaced by something all together inferior; lacking any of the depth or creativity of the original content. There use to be the Omega system which utilized points that you earned after hitting max level that continued you build up as you gained experience or as you leveled up other characters. There were many options offered with the Omega system, albeit some were a bit unbalanced in some regards, but there were options nonetheless. This update completely neutered it and replaced it with these six or seven five-point trees that you dump your points into in a very generic fashion. This is a DOWNGRADE. It's like being in highschool and the ciriculum decides to drop back 8 levels and you now being taught to spell words like ""train"" all over again. This new point system is dumbed down to a near pathetic level and it is an insult to it's loyal fanbase. If that were not bad enough, this game (just before this patch was released) offered THREE skill tree's per hero, as well as multiple quick-bar slots to organize your moves into. They now have done away with one of those three trees, and replaced it with a very cookie-cutter ""traits"" like tree that governs the strength of various moves AND they have limited you to 8 skills total (they removed the ability to change quickbar slots). All of these changes have LIMITED gameplay, not expanded upon it. Which brings me to my next point... Marvel Heroes releases nearly no new content throughout the year, that is aside from a good number of heroes/villains (to be fair). We are running the same raids, the same missions, and the same community patrol areas that we have for the last 3 years. They only just recently finally added a new patrol, and IMHO it really isn't that great. The actual end game content is severly lacking, and it is becoming more and more clear that their intention is to release as little content as possible while still recyling old content for as long as they can get away with it. And that use to be forgivable before this patch because the game was still genuinely a blast to play and even with the tedious grind of repeating uninteresting areas there was still a charm to the game; no longer.

												I've never reviewed anything but I have to chime in on this one. I used to love playing this game. ""The Biggest Update Ever"" changed way too many things, and way too drastically. I started playing back in 2015, and now as of today the game feels totally unplayable. I'll find another way to bide my time hoping for the ""Biggest Revert Ever"". As of now I just can't bring myself to log in anymore. Gaz really f**ked this one up.			"

												Some of you probably saw TotalBiscuits review of this game(a.k.a WTF is Marvel Heroes). In the review, you can probably tell that he thought the game was terrible. But you have to check the date it came out, June 15th 2013. 2013! A year ago when the game was first released. A game can change TotalBiscuit, and im about to show everyone how it did change.So lets start off with the beginning and storyline. Once you make an account for this game, you automatically get to choose a hero from the starter hero list(11 starter heroes to be exact, including Human Torch, Rocket Raccoon, Storm, Thing, Hawkeye, Captain America, Colossus, and i cant remember the others). Once you pick a hero you automatically get a starting cutscene sort of explaining the main story line, where Dr. Doom has stolen the Cosmic Cube. In this cutscene, Uatu and Doom fight in order gain control of the Cosmic Cube. I bet you can guess who wins, but no spoilers!After the beginning cutscene you are traveled to Queens, where a current bank heist is going down. Fight in the streets to the bank to stop the heist. Once you have defeated the badies in the bank and saved all the civilians, you go over to the vault where (surprise!) Black Cat pays a visit. This is your first boss. Defeat her, and go to the front to speak with Sergeant Acedillo to travel to the prologue stark tower. In order to keep the review kinda short, lets just wrap up the story line here and have it for you to do the rest. Also, when you travel to Stark Tower, speak to Jocasta. She'll give you a box that if you right click on it gives you some shiny items called Eternity Splinters!(Which, you may or may not have picked up on your first mission)Now you may be asking yourself, what are these ""Eternity Splinters"" anyway? Well, you couldve just looked at the item description in your inventory, but if you didnt, ill explain them to you. These items are the way you get special items from Adam Warlock, located in each hub. Through Eternity Splinters, you can get new heroes! If you save up 175 of them, you can get your first random hero box! Right click on this item in order to open it, and youll get a shiny hero token which(if its not the same hero you already have), you can write click on to add that hero to your roster! Also from Adam Warlock there are Team Up tokens, which is a companion system which you can learn about from the forums or something else.Once you are completed the story line, you probably will be level 30, or almost atleast. That means your halfway through the leveling system! The max level cap is lvl 60, but you get a really cool power for your hero at lvl 52 called an ultimate power!Now, in order to level, there a ton of things you can do! Terminals, Shared Quests, XDefense, SHIELD Holosim, Legendary Quests, and much more!Now, this reviews gone on long enough. Notice i didnt really include anything bad about this game, and thats because i cant really think of any! The games just getting better and better, with more stuff to come!. All id have to say is that, surprisingly, this game takes a good graphics card in order to run it. Also, if your a non marvel fan, this game isnt probably for you. But if you enjoy marvel, diablo like clones(because realize-the maker of diablo 1 and 2 helped make this game), this is definatly a game to try out!			"

												Work hard to take feedback from players each year, make the game better. Before start of the next year, take all that work, throw it in the bin and try something new. Get more feedback throughout that year, gain progress back towards a solid game. Before that next year, again scrap all progress and everything learned from what your community wants, dumb down the entire game in preperation for console release. Slow down game progress, remove end game farming that had value to replace with forced end game grinding for no gain or farming purpose besides hoping for micro transaction purchases to further fund console release. Well done Gazillion, we on PC will now smash your ""biggest update ever"" of console crap into the dirt, along with your marketing practices.			"

Game mechanics are dumbed down and the developers spend their time ""fixing"" what isnt broken instead of working on new content. Major content updates arent even released once a year.Do not recomend in the least.			"

I was looking forward to coming back to it, but saw all the recent reviews of those with a ton of playtime.

												Marvel Heroes 2015 is an action role playing game in the vain of something like Diablo set in the marvel universe. That's simply the best way to describe it without going overboard. You take your cursor point it at things, kill enemies, collect loot, and so forth until your character is max level and you eventually get better and better equipment to put on your character as time goes on. This game is a loot driven game plain and simple. You like seeing progression on your character and do it over and over on repeat again and again? Then this is the game for you. If you've never been a person who has been into clicking and collecting loot then there really isn't anything here for you. Sure this game has the Marvel license attached to it, one of the largest franchises in the world but if you don't like the gameplay then seriously there really isn't much here for you. Even less here for you if you don't like the Marvel license.For you see that Marvel license is exactly where this game makes it's bread and butter. When it comes to free to play games the game has to attract their audience in two ways that are pretty much valuable to us as gamers, TIME AND MONEY. You spend the money on the heroes & costumes you thought are cool within the Marvel univese, you eventually spend your time leveling up that character you spent your money on, rinse and repeat. For the most part that's what is considered fun.  But here's the real kicker with this game, let's say you didn't spend a dime on it. Would this game hold up? Would you still be having fun?The short answer: heck yeah!Gazillion Entertainment, the developers of Marvel Heroes 2015 has done something quite remarkable that I've only seen f2p developers like valve do. They have made a polished and refined free-to-play game that if you seriously wanted to you could play this game completely free and still be able in a small percentage of a way get everything in the game free as long as you are into the game for the long haul. You want that spider-man hero for $13.50 but don't have the money to buy him? Well just use the starting hero you got free (they actually have quite a good selection of starter heroes from when I started out) and earn 600 eternity splinters (currency drops) and you can have him. You want a certain costume but don't have the money for the exceedingly priced costumes to buy one (cosmetic costumes for $15.00 is seriously way too expensive) well then either spend a hefty amount of time playing and possibly get a costume as a drop, prestige and possibly earn enough costumes to recipe the costume you may have wanted. The numerous ways in which you can gain value for something in the game is equivalent to the amount of time put into it and a whole lot of luck.We spoke of the business model but how is the actual game? Each character in the game can fit into categories usually used for these types of action role-playing games. You got your melee tank characters (ex. Hulk, Thing) you got your ranged characters (Hawkeye, Cyclops) you have your character who excel in dps, you have characters who excel in aoe. Each character in the game intertwines between these certain categories and while you do see some similarities, each character never feels exactly the same. There is a wide variety to this game that will make each character you play as that much different with each playthrough.This game is truly remarkable and my hat is off to the developers and community for this game who have shown a way of making a game better than what it was a year ago. When I played the beta and release a year ago, I played and enjoyed the main campaign but there was never really anything there to really suck me into that cycle of time and money. I gave it a few months off and was quite surprised how addicting the game has become.Marvel Heroes 2015 is befitting of it's new game title and hopefully a second chance on making an impression on players.

												This is my opinions regarding the new changes to Marvel Heroes 2016 for their ""Biggest Update Ever"". I have played 350+ hours, which is not as much as others, but still in my opinion a decent amount for a casual gamer.So far I am disappointed overall with the changes. While some characters feel improved for playstyle many of them now feel very similar, they have reused more of the ability effects, which were unique to certain heroes, on other heroes, I find having done this moreso that pre patch has taken away from the various heroes feeling unique from one another.You now have only one bar to slot abilities on and then get to pick one trait while modifies abilties or provides passive effects from each tier as you level up.The travel powers now have a whind up and dash abilities have charges... in my opinion it should have been one or the other. Before you felt like a hero zipping around the map, now it feel sluggish. Movement based heroes like Silver Surfer and Juggernaut are now not very fun to play for the most part and I am not certain how they will bring back their unique feel without reconning some of the changes.Most heroes feel now feel like you have to tailor their traits to do one specific build, a minion master for example, if you deviate from those traits it really ends up impacting the character.In my opinion the game feels like they have simplified it and made it easier to port over for mobile and consoles. Traslation... we see major profit potential, our investors will be happy and we will deal with the current playerbase later. I can't fault them for this line of thinking as a business, but I can be disappointed about it.I keep thinking they took most of their ideas from WoW/Diablo and the way Blizzard simplefied their game over the past few expansions... not a brilliant strategy considering how subs have declined there. While the new infinity system is easier to understand, it has now removed a lot of flavor from the game. I can only assume they were motivated to implement it because of the upcoming Marvel movies and didn't want to deal with the previous system any more because it was cumbersome for further development.The game also now feels more like a cash grab than anything else, especially with upcoming changes Gaz has mentioned for prestiging characters and the removal of costume rewards. I will hold final judgement on this till I know if they are going to replace aquiring costumes in game somehow, rather that just being able to buy them in the cash shop.It is to bad the game was rolling along very well and it really felt like a company which was concentrating on a fun experience while earning a decent profit. Now it feels like ther will be a few cookie cutter builds to maximize efficiency for many heroes.If you are looking for a game to jump on and tinker with because it is Marvel or want to beat things up in the Marvel universe, a la DIable style gameplay, and don't mind paying for your favorite heroes the game is still worth checking out. Otherwise I would give it a pass right now or go play Diablo 3 since it has take a big step toward being similar in character building.			"

												Like Diablo but with Marvel super heroes, tons of loot, tons of different characters to choose from, all with unique playstyles, constant action, crafting, and now the game has native controller support. You can't go wrong, one of the best f2p games I have played. Must try for iso arpg fans!(Majority of the people writing negative reviews don't fully understand the game. Story mode is just a small piece of the game and is very easy. Once you progress you open other modes to play that are very addicting like ""Mid-Town Patrol"" for example. Try the game for more than 30 min!)With that said I do think the difficulty needs to be higher. With the game being as easy as it is in story mode, it can be a chore to get through it. I still recommend the game to Iso-rpg fans but know going in you have to put in some time before it gets challenging.			"

												If you´re new, you´ll probably like the game because you don´t need to adjust to the changes.Problem: I´m not new. I really liked the game before, now I´m not sure anymore.Tested the update for about 3 hours now, I have all heroes and I started alphabetically. Currently I am at C. I´ve started at green (because of all those what have they done reviews), got to red and then cosmic difficulty.Some heroes are ok / nearly the same like before. Some on the other hand.Seriously. Not Sure what they´ve done to Black Cat, maybe I´ve just took the wrong Wave or something. But she was horrible. Cable felt similar to Black Cat. Maybe I need a closer look at that Infinity thing, but with Angela or Blade I have no problems at all. With Black Cat and Cable I have currently massive problems. I am pretty sure some other heros will have similar problems.They released the Biggest Update Ever and its only 50% done (Thats how it feels to me).Balancing between heroes feels not complete (that was one of those things why they have done that)Infinity System feels unfinished for me. At the point you fully unlock all the capped nodes, it´s only Stathunting. And for a lot of Heroes you don´t even need to unlock all the capped nodes. So some benefit some not ->Balance?The wind up on the travel power is horrible. Feels clunky and looks completely odd. The dash cap, yeah. Not a problem for some heroes. For some it is that thing that holds you up. The moment the charges are gone and on cooldown, you´re dead (mostly). There are so much AOE Decals, Effects whatever. Hard to see whats coming (or from where). Its also annoying for heroes like Black Cat and Black Widow, where you have other skills which relies on that dash. So you have 3 charges for getting out of the way and resetting a cooldown / get cloaked / use a skill. And ""walking"" out of the way is often not an option because there is soo much AOE Attacks from bosses and / or trash mobs, it doesn´t matter.If you want to use all traits / talents, you have to take skills which you´re not using or you do not like. Happened only twice to me now, but like I said, I am at C...I have no problem that cosmic is harder now but it seems that the balance between heroes is still not there. And playing red then is ehm, yeah. Boring. Thats why I switched from red to cosmic. Red is not enough damage and cosmic is too much. Especially from all the trash mobs and the AOE Attacks / Affixes from the bosses (looking at you caltrops / lightning sphere) And there are coming 2 more difficulties.They had to do something, sure, but for me its worse than before (currently)I will update the review if something changes for me (because of more heroes played / ""tested again"") or if the balancing will change. In my current mood, I can´t recommend the game anymore. It feels not like the game i played before.			"

												This is my opinions regarding the new changes to Marvel Heroes 2016 for their ""Biggest Update Ever"". I have played 350+ hours, which is not as much as others, but still in my opinion a decent amount for a casual gamer.So far I am disappointed overall with the changes. While some characters feel improved for playstyle many of them now feel very similar, they have reused more of the ability effects, which were unique to certain heroes, on other heroes, I find having done this moreso that pre patch has taken away from the various heroes feeling unique from one another.You now have only one bar to slot abilities on and then get to pick one trait while modifies abilties or provides passive effects from each tier as you level up.The travel powers now have a whind up and dash abilities have charges... in my opinion it should have been one or the other. Before you felt like a hero zipping around the map, now it feel sluggish. Movement based heroes like Silver Surfer and Juggernaut are now not very fun to play for the most part and I am not certain how they will bring back their unique feel without reconning some of the changes.Most heroes feel now feel like you have to tailor their traits to do one specific build, a minion master for example, if you deviate from those traits it really ends up impacting the character.In my opinion the game feels like they have simplified it and made it easier to port over for mobile and consoles. Traslation... we see major profit potential, our investors will be happy and we will deal with the current playerbase later. I can't fault them for this line of thinking as a business, but I can be disappointed about it.I keep thinking they took most of their ideas from WoW/Diablo and the way Blizzard simplefied their game over the past few expansions... not a brilliant strategy considering how subs have declined there. While the new infinity system is easier to understand, it has now removed a lot of flavor from the game. I can only assume they were motivated to implement it because of the upcoming Marvel movies and didn't want to deal with the previous system any more because it was cumbersome for further development.The game also now feels more like a cash grab than anything else, especially with upcoming changes Gaz has mentioned for prestiging characters and the removal of costume rewards. I will hold final judgement on this till I know if they are going to replace aquiring costumes in game somehow, rather that just being able to buy them in the cash shop.It is to bad the game was rolling along very well and it really felt like a company which was concentrating on a fun experience while earning a decent profit. Now it feels like ther will be a few cookie cutter builds to maximize efficiency for many heroes.If you are looking for a game to jump on and tinker with because it is Marvel or want to beat things up in the Marvel universe, a la DIable style gameplay, and don't mind paying for your favorite heroes the game is still worth checking out. Otherwise I would give it a pass right now or go play Diablo 3 since it has take a big step toward being similar in character building.			"

												This used to be a positive review before the ""Infinity update"". I have less faith in devs as of right now. Replayability : 2/10 Events every month : 9/10 Dev's interaction with players : 1/10 Real F2P aspect : 6/10 Inevntory management : 3/10 Game's future : 2/10  Talent update : 7/10  Replayability : There was a Movement nerf included in the so called ""biggest update ever"". This has made the game slower and time consuming. Events every month : Events are still good so far, except sometimes they don't turn on some features of events for example, Limbo event (no limbo enemies in midtown). Dev's interaction with players : There have been so many threads about negative response about Movement nerf and Omega system to Infinity system change, still devs released the update in live client without any changes. And they still say ""we listen to our player's feedback"".... Real F2P aspect : Right now you can get 1 extra default costume everytime you prestige and use 3 of those costumes in blender to get a random costume from store. In the upcoming update free costumes from prestige will be removed, and the only way to buy costumes will be from store/real money. Also They have removed Eternity Splinter boxes from story rewards, so theres literally no sense in doing story over and over while prestiging. Eternity Splinter droprate in patrols seems to be higher than before 'for now'.  Inventory management : Stash....ah the real money maker for devs. can you buy it with ingame currency you ask? yes but whats the price? 600 splinters.. bruh Game's future : This game is going to die soon, if they keep rolling out this kind of updates / ""nerfs"". The Infinity System which was added in place by removing the balanced and interesting Omega system is a degrade. Infinity system is like 6 year old's homework, way too casual and not interesting at all.  Talent update : Talent update is okay, but there are so many talents left useless cause they are in same talent tree. I never liked power points system so this was a good addition but still need some tweaking.  TLDR : Game is playable but not enjoyable, Devs want to milk money now from PC players for console release.Overall rating for this game is now : 4 / 10 which was 8 / 10 before this update.			"

												Having played this game for over 2 years, and really enjoyed it, for the last 3 days, I have tried to play it and it is just horrible.  Every character feels the same, the nerf makes me feel like I am plaing with Kick ♥♥♥ and not A List super heroes.  Apparently this is just the begining and if that is so, I really don't look forward to what is to come.  I hope all these changes to make this more console friendly back fires, and it flops when released.  You have a dedicated fan base that has stood with you over the last 3 years, and this is how you repay them.  Complete garbage.			"

												I have been playing this game since open beta.  I have recorded 2520 hours not including the hours and hours I have played outside of steam.  I was a founders pack purchaser the pack that included specialty costumes such as the Hulk Maestro costume.  I was not satisfied unless I did my dailys at least once a day.  I loved this game.  Now I can not stand it.  I am angry and sad at the same time.  They have taken a game that seemed to flow and get better between each up date and with each hero addition to a game I don't even recognize.  I have seen many posts that have detailed the destruction of the game play thus I don't see a need to reiterate.  I will only say that this game a game I never thought I would do this to now on the short list for being removed from my computer.  If the current reviews detailing the state of the game and the great dislike that it has created are not heeded by the developers this game is destined for the ash heep of games I once played and once enjoyed.

												Note: Review is a bit outdated as their 3.0 ""biggest patch ever"" just came out. I haven't had time to properly weigh in on it. Please consider other reviews, though there is one glaring issue I do see in the negativity posted thus far about the changes. It's people's impression that the game slowed down somehow or got less involving. One of my biggest complaints was that the Omega system was insanely convoluted and hard to understand even after hundreds of hours of the game. Now it's more or less fine tuning very transparent stats in a logical order, which is an improvement. Also I mentioned a negative point about travel powers making or breaking the fun for some heroes. People seem to forget what playing Thing was like pre-everyone-has-a-travel-power-but-they-are-still-massively-inferior-to-teleporting-characters. I feel now I'm picking a character because I want to enjoy them and I don't feel like I've gone backwards because of travel powers.Both of these areas so far are improvements to me and in no way ""dumbing"" a game down. It's making it more cohesive and balanced. Large difference.I could change my mind soon, but again: I need more time to fully discuss these changes.----- Old review below -----Marvel Waifu Simulator 2016.I've played this game off and on since 2013 and with the incredibly positive changes and frequent updates/events, I still haven't ran out of things to do or max. The grind is supplimental to your entire account, not just characters so it ensures that you are constantly rewarded just for playing whatever you like and however you feel. There's 50+ classes and they release a new one every month. The ultimate ARPG grindsink. Insanely fast and satisfying gameplay with exploding environments, throwable cars, and large scale group fights. You can play and unlock everything solo too. Your choice.I bought a stash tab, a couple costumes and blew 25 bucks trying to gamble on BOGO hero tokens (and won) during one of their sales, but that still doesn't equal the money I've spent on AAA games and played fractions of the time. You can currently play the whole game for nothing and the unlocks are 1000% more generous than they were on launch.  You can even gamble on costumes for free if you want to become a prestige grinder. They give paid stuff away, even heroes all the time. There's a ton of different ways to play, more end game scalable content than paid-for-MMOS and some things I still haven't seen done in an ARPG to date. It seems like I try to get people into this game and they think they have to spend money, and absolutely do not.and the best thing: They finally fixed the performance on higher end gaming machines.9/10 mechafistsFew negatives and things to address just to be fair though:- you are no longer forced to raid for that high end slot gear or medals. Everything can be unlocked via the rep vendors now and crafted. Raiders will get it quicker of course, but you don't need to kill a boss and hope that item drops anymore. This shouldn't translate as to ""you don't have to work for anything and it's handed to you"". This note is for people that played before and were possibly turned off by having to raid or for people that just don't like raiding. That said though the raids are actually really fun and mostly a zerg that takes 20 minutes or so. Nothing like a 4 hour wipefest for an MMO grind. You'll get a shot at gear and now you'll also get the currency to craft the same gear. You get the currency through events and quests outside of the raids albeit in much smaller quantites.- in the past the inventory system was a bit unfair and space was still limited. They revamped the stash and you can grind for in-game currency to unlock another tab. I've only had 2 tabs for  years now and it's enough to work with. It used to be pretty much that if you wanted to play on a 'serious"" level you almost had to buy one. No longer.- peformance improved dramatically for me in the past couple patches. They finally went full 64 bit. If you didn't play before because it was laggy, try it again. The game was so fun and original feeling that I just dealt with it, but super glad that I can now play public zones with a full party and not suffer while actually helping my team do damage becuase I'm not lagging my ♥♥♥ off.- still need a pass on movement/travel powers for most of the classes. Teleporting heroes feel like playing a Ferrari compared to some people that can't even hop 10 feet in front of them while trying to catch up with the RAPID pace of the game. That said some people are just great to play despite their crap movement powers, but it's understandably trying to stick to their source characters. It would just be nice to have that not as a factor. It's pretty much irrelevant in some content though.- some of the older and original classes feel like abandoned Early Access games and need refreshing to catch up with the new heros where the team got WAYYY better at making new ones that feel more fluid, creative and interesting.- game is themed around MCU, so if there's a new movie, expect something new from the movie be it a costume, hero or events. This isn't entirely a negative, but it creates hilarious situations like getting all hyped about Spider Man in Civil War and then surprise, balance pass! Right now the Civil War characters are getting a bigger bonus than say the X-men, so it's not always favorable to your favorite character.- I'm not joking when I say maxing end game stats is grindy. Like I know you think Diablo 3 or Path are grindy because it might take a whole week to grind and/or trade for a set a gear in a new season, but you can't even fathom the Omega system, perfecting end game gear for multiple classes and so forth. It's a system that caters more to people that love theorycrafting and min/maxing, but the game is still fun for people that want to throw cars and just be a comic book hero here and there... but if you are completionist and want the most out of a particular character you enjoy, you are going to be in it for months and then more months. This is a pro for me, but it has to be noted.- some gear is event exclusive, meaning you'll have to wait until the event comes back around to grind/unlock it. This isn't a situation of say.. ""you need this piece to play the character"" by any means. I'm talking about maximizing. It's not always just kill a boss, or collect currency. The events keep the game insanely fresh from month to month and week to week, but it does have that bad side to where if you miss the event, you won't have access to the stuff on the vendor, but you will if you play during the event. The good thing is though, their events aren't disposable items. They are are some of the very best the game has to offer so the events are well worth it unlike most games that give you snowballs and cookies for xmas and pat you on your santa hatted head.			"

												Characters are well made lots of skills and powers. You feel like the hero your playing. Gameplay however is very lacking, its just wave of enemies that really just attack you. there is no AI at all and loot is just stuff that rasies your stats. its not like you get items that unlock powers or change how your character plays its just stat mods. and it might be an MMO but its the loneliest mmo you will ever play. there really is no reason to party unless your doing the terminals and even if you do there is not stragey or co-op its just everyone spamming there powers until the waves are gone. If you have an itch to run around as hulk or spiderman its fun for a bit but once you have played this game for a few hours you have seen all this game really has to offer.			"

They promised more content and quality and what we got was less content and nerfs.Developer has no idea what they are doing. Limiting movement and adding more limits and nerfing powers.Don't invest money!Game needs new content NOT revamps of old content. Have you ever wondered why they renamed the game originally...well because it was getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reviews.Not recomended!If any dev is reading this:-Revert movement changes-remove invisible walls-add more quests, new areas and story lines. You have the comic universe in your palm and all you managed to do with it was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story that can be finished in less than 1 hour?SHAME SHAME SHAME!!!!!!DO NOT SUPPORT THIS KIND OF DEVELOPER!!!

												This friday Gazillion Entertainment ruined Marvel Heroes for me. A game in which i invested money and over 500 hours of my time.The update did not deliver what it promised, instead of streamlining the game and removing the clutter it took away a huge amount of choice and substance.It is less in everyway, removed style, play choices and leaving only a malnourished husk of it former self. Oh it is easier, it is open for casual gamer but it is a slap in the face for most old players of this game. It´s a cash grab, because Gazillion Entertainment wants to make money, but this move is a dilettante one because it alienates a lot of current gamer who now write angry reviews. This will not attract new customers and the delivery over the weekend and friday itself was horrible, just badly planned. I´scared now for this game i liked alot, because i can´t see any kind of future for me in it, there is no path from here which will make the game simular enjoyable as before the patch. The infinity system is just awful, yes the omega system hat too many options, it could have done with the reduction of at least a quarter of it, but this is just not enough to develop different playstiles. It is bland, it doesn´t offer much of a choice to have something unique.The Ability System i don`t mind that much, but the decision to bring in this update without the new omega rarity, which would bring some new features for much need choice, is also a mistake.Gazillion Entertainment dumbed down the game it seems to attract new players and remove the complexity so it can, to some degree, keep the game running with less people on it so it will have more earnings and investing in marketing to keep the old players quiet.Which didn´t work because the whole execution of this BIGGEST UPDATE EVER was done horribly with the bugs, wrong attribute stats on uniques  server downs and log in issues.And because i don´t see any future for me in the game and i like a lot of others feel punished and pushed away because of simple greed.I don`t judge anyone who truly likes this new version, different people and different tastes.I don`t minde change, change is good as long it is part of progress, this is a step back, it is the lost of character and choice, it is just less then before because options are great.So now i am stuck with over 2000 g which i can`t spend because there is no content for me in this game and i can`t get my money back.They promised me a grand meal and all i got was brandless microwaved white beans with next to flavorless sauce.I will wait for the appearance of the omega rarity to see what it will bring before i make the decision to deinstall the game and cut my losses, but i can`t hardly see any future for me in this game because the people who made this horribly decisions are the same one who working on this.And i don`t see any kind of learning curve with those people when this was there BUGGEST UPDATE EVER.

												***Post Update Review*** {{ DO I RECOMMEND THIS GAME: NOT AT THE MOMENT. }}After investing in the game by buying every single playable, I'm incredibly disappointed with the recent overhaul. A lot of the replay value for me after level 60 was my ability to tweak my ability trees and keep playing around with Omega combinations. This update has basically dumbed down the power customizations, so with the click of a few buttons players can mash and smash their way through the game without putting the same amount of thought into their setup. I get that it's supposed to be easier, but end game setup should be that easy. I used to run through various characters each week making changes, but I just feel bored now. I wish, at this point, that I hadn't invested the money. *** OLD REVIEW ***Marvel Heroes is by far the game I spend the most time on at the moment. The game is constantly evolving and improving from its original state. There is plenty of end game content. You can start with two free characters, and Gaz is extremely generous during events and holidays -- they normally give out three or four character boxes a year, and others can be unlocked by accumulating eternity splinters, which drop about every eight minutes.Once you have your crafter leveled to twenty and your Hammer Bay experience topped (two primary goals during early gameplay) you can start working toward getting your gear maxed out and buying recipes. Following the story is the best way to level your character to sixty, and gaz gives you the opportunity to 'replay' each character several times by prestiging. Each level earns you a different honorary color in chat while you play as that character. Once you have your character properly geared, you can advance to end game raids: Goldtron, Green and Red Meph, and Axis Onslaught. The game is amazingly fun for entry level and advanced players who are fans of marvel, and is both very well done and often updated for an ftp.			"

												I really enjoyed the speed of this game, it made it feel like a unique ARPG and something different besides just having the Marvel license. However the recent changes to the game have sucked out a lot of that speed, and beyond even that, the company is TERRIBLE at releasing content. Heroes are delayed months and are often terrible choices in the first place. I obviously enjoyed this game enough to play it for 300+ hours, but unless things change I won't be coming back.			"

												Easily the best free to play game I've tried to date and the game I've spent more time playing than anything since *wipes tear* City of Heroes. Its an 'Action RPG' which basically means it has a story but the primary focus is gearing up your heroes (roster of 30+ and one released once per month typically) for the first of its kind, a raid! Yes it has raids not usually seen outside of traditional MMO's where a group of ten people must work together to take down the bosses.The only in game item that can't be bought from simply playing alot is storage space and this is few pounds per storage bin but given the time spent if you enjoy, easily worth the investment. Heroes can be bought for 'Eternity Splinters' as well as the 'Team Up Heroes' (limited AI pet henchmen with some skill configuration and gear itemisation) which drop on a semi set period of time (approx one drop per 8-12 minutes of play). The only negatives with this game (assuming you enjoy the type of game it is obviously) is that its still a bit of a beast to run on a PC and while patches are weekly (with an outstanding development team running things) bugs and wierdness continue to exist and creep into each update. All in all its a game I really enjoy and if your bandwidth can take the initial download without problem, then please give it a try!			"

I have decided against that, what I will do instead is make a list of the changes after BUE that I do like, 1. I like how the costume is seperate from the core/affixes now.There you have it, thanks Gaz.			"

												The latest update left me no desire to play this game any longer. The devs want feedback but don't respond to 95% of it. The 5% they do respond to is to let you know they have a ""plan"" and things need to be this way. It is sad because it was a really fun game. Hopefully Marvel will license their IP to another game company because Gaz as went down the crapper.			"

												This game is utter trash, the community is horrible, and Gazillion has run it into the ground.  I cannot recommend this game to anyone, they have continually lowered the gear drops, hoping you buy 1/2 hour 'boosts' to item find.  It is a free game, but some suckers have spent hundreds of dollars on it.  But more than anything, the community is horrible.			"

												This game was really fun, attractive and addictive for the past few years, with regular updates and improvements. The game was both simple and complex to play, allowing to satisfy both short fun plays and longer intransigent ones.But with the last major update release, this fun and attractiveness got sadly altered, and the game lost a great part of its charm. Gameplay is much less pleasing, and playing seems less rewarding than before. You're not enable to focus your powers and options as much personally as before (with power points and Omega points being removed for just a few arbitrary specialisation options and a new easier but much less interersting nor useful Infinity points system).Maybe i'll login again in a few months to see if the devs are fixing the game upon a better balance toward the fun and attractiveness, but i strongly doubt they will as they no longer listen to the MH community.

												It is with a heavy heart that I must say the most recent ""massive update"" has made this game massively worse, dumbing it down & slowing it down for consoles. It's clear they've started treating we PC players as nothing more than beta testers for console kids and I cannot recommend it to anyone who would play it on PC at this point. I've put over 1,000 hours and hundreds of dollars into this game, and I'm deeply saddened to see it ruined like this, but it's the truth.			"

												The 'BIGGEST UPDATE EVER' has hurt the game imo. Originally, it was a nice F2P MMORPG. However, as it stands we're looking at an unfinished product. The balance of the updates are going to come within the following months but it'll be riddled with bugs and large downloads (patches). The actualy gameplay has been slowed down for console port (rumors but still a legitimate assessment) and previous modes have been abandoned (ex: X-def, Holosim and Danger Room). Certain aspects of the game have been completely stripped even though they were works in progress. Therefore, you can expect this iteration to be stripped eventually as it seems to be a fundamental practice at Gazillion. Its free... try it. You be the judge. I have well over 2000 hours logged (keep in mind AFK are also accounted for) and this game has always entertained me, however, the current iteration is a big let down.			"

												I've been playing this game since closed beta, but I used the game launcher instead of steam, that's why the play time is only 7xx hours.The game had some great devs back in the days, but they all left one by one, and the game started to fall downhill.  The game is in the process of ""re-make"" with a new team, the so-called ""biggest system update"" is just their first step to their ""re-make"" project.  This update is basically to simplify the skill systems, so they can make easy changes in the future.  Seriously the original systems were good enough, why would a game suddenly change the whole system?  And it feels like they are just copying from D3, not a good sign to the future of the game.Since this is no longer the game I used to play, I would NOT recommend this game, because this game has stopped pushing out new content since long time ago, but they do keep adding new heroes and in-game shop items (boosts, fortune cards etc...) for you to keep replaying the same thing over and over again.I had some good time with this game, spent some money on the skins and cards to support it, but I guess it's time to say goodbye.If you wanna kill some time and play your favourite hero, it's worth to give it a try, but the loot and rng in this game sucks.Btw, this game is falling into the p2w category ;)   "

												They have Massively dumbed down this already simplistic game instead of adding any new content or programming boss fights to be anything but a joke.Now instead of having Optional ability to use more than 8 total buttons (many loved to use 9-12 via the hotkeys which were removed) everything is always console-simple.Everyone post-update is still forced into a cookie-cutter build in order to not be handicapped (you have no choice of what stats to use, everyone in game is forced to run +4% flat damage and +4% flat damage and nothing else matters.)Movement is now terrible and clunky. They lied and said it's to make boss fights good, but then the bad movement happens even when there are no bosses within a mile or you're inside of a TOWN. Month after month after month of alternatives which wouldn't be so bad were proposed by players, but the developers made the decision to ignore 100% of player feedback even BEFORE they put the patch up for pretend ""Testing"" by the players.Essentially, the few areas in this game that weren't simply worse than the much-more-popular free ARPG path of exile (that has ten times as many players) have been ruined by the ""Biggest Update"" that they neglected a year of content releases in order to dumb down the game.Nothing in the update makes creating a new level in unreal engine any easier for the developers, so it won't speed up their abysmal content creation whatsoever. It will do the exact opposite, they've wasted a year breaking the game this way, and the next year or two will have to be spent repairing what they didn't need to break in the first place. All that unnecessary time could have been spent creaitng new raids or harder dungeons, but now it's taken up by this bad series of patches. "

												I've played this a fair bit more than I'd like to admit, even bought the odd hero because I didn't mind supporting a fun game. Had I known this update was where the game was going I doubt I would have done either. Forget the ""annoy me every few seconds for a few seconds"" delay added to the movement powers... removing 2/3rds of my skillslots and removing skillpoints (ie. all skill gradation/most build variation) would both be dealbreakers for me on their own. Together they inspired me to write a review for the first time in my life so congratz on that i guess?Anyhows I thought this game was a bit of mindless fun before... would never have thought the developers where sitting around going: ""you know what.. this ♥♥♥♥♥ too complicated.. we need to dumb it down some more...."" *sigh*In short latest update has improved the experience of this game similarly to say the way a swift kick in the nuts would... which might be preferable because at least it wouldn't come with a 8gig download and hopeful expectations. All hyperbole aside it really does, at best and with a stretch, feel like jumping back into an earlier game from a favourite series and having to get through that period of adjusment to the simpler gameplay mechanics of the earlier game. (I say it's a stretch because I never had to erase dark souls from my life in order to revisit daemon souls...) The reviews they self-posted on their steam page used to strike me as clearly cherry picked but not wildly inaccurate... a bit optimistic and inflated perhaps.. but nothing I (or I think most players) would have ticked ""strongly disagree"" to anyway. I re-read them after the update and sadly the best endorsement I could give them now is that they may appeal to anyone with an appreciation for excessive irony and that reading them may in all likelyhood offer a more entertaining experience than anything offered by the ""play now"" button. Hope the dev's have a corperate master/ focus group/ stroke to blame for this, because if this is an honest expression of their conceptual and creative talent then their expended effort just becomes tragic - (which as an observation made by an adult with 300+ hours on a superhero themed grind fest that he's bothering to review should grant it both a little weight and perhaps some substancial irony...) All of this is a shame because before I would have recomended this game as flawed but fun with one of the very few free to play models I've seen that wasn't pay to win in disguise and didn't horrendously distort progression or make you a second class citizen in game just because you didn't buy anything off them. Sadly even that aspect of it took a hit in the latest update so I really cant think of anything I like enough to stick around myself, let alone recomend it to someone else. Finally: To the devs and keeping in theme with your last update:a dumbed down version :  Your ideas are bad. Your game is bad. You should feel bad.""			"

												I have played a little under 500 hours of Marvel Heroes, spread over a few years, and while the game was never on par with D3 or Path of Exile, it was still pretty decent, allowing you to play your favourite Marvel heroes.That is, until the recent patch was released, a major overhaul of pretty much everything.Imagine waking up one day, and having not one but all your characters changed. The base stats changed. The gear changed. Even basic mechanics of the game changed, such as movement skills. And on top of that, the end game progression changed.So, you wake up to this nightmare of a patch to find that all your gear, all your builds, all your enchants, trinkets, pretty much everything is now worthless. Everything you played for is flushed down the toilet, and replaced with something inferior that seems only concerned with making sure you don't have access to things that scale in ""bad"" way.To add insult to injury, instead of a normal daily login reward, they gave me a coupon for a slight reduction in price of my next microtransaction !The end game Omega system, which was akin to a massive skill web, has been replaced by generic points similar to Paragon Points in D3. Not only did it introduce an actually infinite grind, but spending 18 hours to gain 0.1% damage reduction does not seem like a worthwhile investment of my time.			"

												On paper, Marvel Heroes was full of potential: a strong and important license of a prestigious name, could be the ultimate game for fans of the House of Ideas. And all in all it is a product quite funny, if taken in the right spirit and treated lightly. Find a profound experience, competitive and long-lived, however, he will be disappointed, and will have to prepare to have a lot of patience and a lot of money: microtransactions loom over virtually every content and the developer has imposed limits to fruition with an insistence annoyingly strategic. If it does not scare you, and you just want to play the main campaign and forget about it, the fact that it is completely free is a considerable incentive.			"

												The in game community seems generally friendly and willing to offer advice, there's a lot less trolls about than I expect from a Free To Play game.I did wonder if it was Pay to Win when I started downloading, but that's not the case, there is a cash shop but it's only really for cosmetic items and convenience like extra storage.You can play any Hero (or all of them) to 10 then you need to pick one to Uncap and play towards 60 which is the max level, other heroes can be bought with the Splinters that drop in the game and there are random hero boxes buyable for less than the average Splinter price if you are willing to go with random ones. Obviously if you hit your credit card you can buy them all directly by buying the G currency which can be spent on all sorts of stuff.The quest system seems fairly robust (very repetitive if you play multiple heroes to 60 of course)  and there are other areas to level in. It's perfectly possible to level to 60 solo, but you can also group with friends and play together.I've not been playing all that long, but I'm enjoying the game and I'd recommend giving it a go.

												Shadow's Review of Marvel Heroes 2015 Overview : After 28 hours played.This is a Gauntlet meets Diablo style of game. You get to play one of many marvel owned characters, ( heroes and villains) using powers that are unique to them in some way and work your way through the world based out of the Avengers towers aka Stark Tower. Currently there are 38 heroes available to play, with 12 more in a pay for x-pack, and level up with a hand full of different play styles. Free to play... This is a free to play game, So far I only felt compelled to buy Nightcralwer, who I have had a crush on since I was like 14. His teleport abilities and straight up DPS has been well worth my money. I bought my husband the new 'advanced' Rocket raccoon costume. This gave him the skin from the latest Guardians of the Galaxy movie and the same Voice actor saying thing you expect the movie Rocket to say. “I wonder if there is a goodie inside” when braking boxes. “Humans come in interesting shades of blue.. and you can teleport.. tell me how!” and lastly. “Braking stuff is more of Groot's thing, I like shootin stuff!” Buying costumes are one thing that isn't tooo expensive and I feel is well worth it. Seeing a lot of the fun factor is seeing the heroes or villeins you know and love kicking ♥♥♥. Most heroes have two to five costumes out there including some for the comics and movies. Million shades of Wolverine, to the phases of storm threw out all the comics. Deadpool has a hand full as well including the Lady Deadpool.There is is a gambling box you can buy and can give you gear. Meaning there is a Pay to win.. but it is  such a slaughter fest no matter if you are soloing or working in a group of four. As far as I can tell beside costumes there is no other reason to put any money into this game. Most of the things you can want including other unlocked toons can be done threw in game gathered things eternity shards.. mostly or special event drops.  Lastly there is a daily-ish log in reward box that gives away much of the power ups exp boosts and so forth you can buy on the market.. soo just play and have fun. Fun factorOnce I got Nightcralwer I really started having fun. Listening for the lines that triggers when he is around other hero's he knows. The fact he plays exactly how I expect a teleporting powered half daemon to play. Much of the gear also has throwback to the comics on it. I like to read the quotes that appear on the gear tooltip. I also got Loki as a buy one get one free deal. He was surprisingly fun. Though I look forward / hope to see a costume / skin based of him in the Avengers movie. The costume is good but I feel if it was the actors skinny frame and voice acting I would want to pay for that.Loot is not shared, you mostly will get drops for your current toon with an occasional drop fro one you may have locked or unlocked. Most of the time I just sell them or use them to level up a vender.DifficultyThere is a feel of challenge, among the chaos if taking on one or ten to many mobs at once and seeing my health go down faster then I would like. Nothing I could not teleport out of and take a first aid kit. Leveling with someone really has pushed up to see how far we can go in some of the events. There are dailies, and weekly events and holidays to really help break up the flow of the game if you're trekking through for your third plus time. The most difficult thing for me was the trickle of upgrades that dropped. Seeing that most gear has bonuses for abilities or skill trees on it I was finding only two out often or so drops that were even the right skills or trees for my Nightcralwer. The events really have me hordes of gear to look through, so that is a nice bonus.  Replay abilityAfter I max out Nightcralwer I could go and max out Loki. In the story line I will be given 3 more toons while completing the story. So yes.. but I already can tell that if you are a person who looks for more than just mass slaughter and enjoying seeing your favorite marvel characters do something awesome. It might get old. Side kicks aka Team-UpNow there is a NPC based side kicks available in the game. I have earned enough of the dropped random currency to have bought one, but seeing I am enjoying my play with my husband I decided to save my shards for my next hero to level with him. Venders, crafting and leveling. Because you can play this game many times through on many different toons. You get to level up your venders. You can do this by “donating' loot to them and Shield metals. With a crafting being mostly upgrading the quality of gear you find, and changing the random not for your toon gear into your toon gear. I have chose to level my 'crafting' NPC and my 'enchanting' NPC vendors first. Seeing that my level has shot up by fifteen in just two Agent S.H.I.E.L.D. Events it is more important to be able to upgrade the gear and enchant it then it is to be able to but random loot boxes from the weapons and armor vendor. In SummaryFun game if you like that style of games, mowing down near armies of baddies. I would suggest it as a free to play game for those who want to hang out with the marvel goodness but doesn't really want to fork over the wallet. I simple 15 one time payment can unlock any hero or villain you want to play and the costume you may want for them. ReviewGameplay 8/10Esthetic 7/10Fun 7/10Difficulty 6/10roleplay 0/10			"

												TL:DR - Where once you had a truly superheroic and fast paced game, you now have a turtle's paced crawl. One of the biggest reasons I really enjoyed the game was the fast paced, get in/get out - over and done - have fun for a quick hour's worth of gameplay.The game used to be a very fluid and fast paced game. Of course it has only been 2 days now after their ""biggest patch ever"" and the game just feels slow and clunky. I can understand the desire to change things up a bit and revamp some outdated mechanics. Honestly they were in need of some redesigns to begin with. But they have slowed the game down to a chugging crawl. Once flying across a map in a matter of seconds, while actually feeling superheroic, you are now forced to ""wind up"" to sprint at what feels like a reduced speed. On top of that and this is a personal preference, they have limited players to 8 ability keys, (+1 if you count your ultimate). Now this again is purely a personal choice but if I want access to every ability my character can use then I see very little reason as to why I cannot have access to them at all times. I would be fine if they just returned the ability to remap multiple keys to the RMB as this was a very handy mapping scheme, I loved it! But alas, Where you were once able to fluidly switch between energy restoring abilities when you needed them, at the times you actually needed them, you now have to flood that spot while taking up said space that could be conveniently used for something more... beneficial. Limitation is not the spice of life.Several of the changes I have seen really make me think they are trying to move toward a pvp direction with pushing everyone to an even playing field. Limitiing character movements so one character does not have an advantage over another, which is fine. But you can limit that to pvp segments while in pvp areas without hindering other players.Also the consoles, yes I know, they want to expand their market, so let's slow down the rest of the world so the special consoles can keep up with the PC crowd. Oh right, character balance, well someone always has to be at the bottom of the barrel.The good points: the characters are well done and the abilities, of the 3 or 4 I have tried at the moment, are nicely improved (save for one). A once convoluted omega system is dumbed down and far more straight forward and drastically reducing the level of complexity (to me this isnt necessarily a good point but I understand the reasoning - and mildly approve). I just don't know if I can support some of the current gameplay designs at the moment, but meh, I have almost 2k hours played and other games to play. Wish I could add a ""Middle of the road - recommendation"" to the game.			"

												TL:DR - Where once you had a truly superheroic and fast paced game, you now have a turtle's paced crawl. One of the biggest reasons I really enjoyed the game was the fast paced, get in/get out - over and done - have fun for a quick hour's worth of gameplay.The game used to be a very fluid and fast paced game. Of course it has only been 2 days now after their ""biggest patch ever"" and the game just feels slow and clunky. I can understand the desire to change things up a bit and revamp some outdated mechanics. Honestly they were in need of some redesigns to begin with. But they have slowed the game down to a chugging crawl. Once flying across a map in a matter of seconds, while actually feeling superheroic, you are now forced to ""wind up"" to sprint at what feels like a reduced speed. On top of that and this is a personal preference, they have limited players to 8 ability keys, (+1 if you count your ultimate). Now this again is purely a personal choice but if I want access to every ability my character can use then I see very little reason as to why I cannot have access to them at all times.

												The biggest update of all time was not kind to this game.  I really enjoyed what Marvel Heroes had to offer (I think my playtime would suggest that) but this update feels like it ripped everything away that I had earned.  I thought that maybe it wouldn't matter if the udpate made the game fun in a whole new way but now the game only seems like a hollow shell of its former self.  I hand it to the Gaz team to have the guts to go for an update like this, a risk of alienating old time players with the possible reward of bringing in many new.  However, the updates add no excitement and I have no urge whatsoever to re-gear characters that I have already spend 100's of hours on.  I play many MMO's so I can understand the philosophy of having to re-gear but that usually conincides with new content in which to embark on that mission.

												After putting a metric ton of money and time into this game...it is now a piece of garbage. Everything I have saved for years in this game is now pretty much worthless. There are no words that describe how much this sucks. I spent so much time building up each character and learning the in's and out's of this game and now everything has changed and they have crapped all over the people who have spent the most time into this game. They are building it out for consoles from what I read. I wish they would have followed Diablo's path and made a different game for the consoles and left this one alone.All that being said I got a few years of joy out of the game before this. It has never been PERFECT....but now I dont ever see myself playing this game anymore. The same thing happened to City Of Heroes. All good things ALWAYS come to an end. I knew better than to play an online game but I did it anyway.			"

												This is ltierally probably one of the worst games in exsitence now. The game was originally designed and tested for PC players back in 2013. Their entire player base has been PC players. The idea for this update was to acoomadate to the ""console"" players so that they can be more ""on par"" with the PC players. Another way of saying this is that they are trying to take away any advantage PC players might have over console players. More keybinds, better mechanical movement of our mouse versus their cursor, etc. Why would a company throw their main and currently, only player base out of the window to accomadate for a marginally less maximum player base via console? I can guarantee as a console player, we have always been the outnumbered group of people when it comes to multiplayer games that also invovle PC variants of that game. Why would a company displease 100% of their current playerbase to accomadate for probably 10-15% of their potential incoming playerbase from the console? The company is literally trying to kill this game off so that they do not have to maintain it anymore as they are losing profits. By giving console players access to this game, this is their last attempt at getting a huge flow of income. Once this is done, the game will also be over. That or no one majored in Business in the slightest or even minored in it and have no idea how businesses are supposed to run.			"

												I have played this game for about 2 years and thoroughly enjoyed myself. However, after checking out the most recent update, I have decided to move on for the following reasons:- Movement, once fast paced and heroic, is now much more cumbersome with the introduction of travel power activation times and cooldowns. Dashes are now a fixed distance instead of variable, which has significantly upset the combat ability of melee characters. - Power/ability bars were reduced from 3 bars to 1, limiting build diversity. - Every single hero in the game was overhauled with this patch, leaving many unfinished and unbalanced.- Glacial content release with poor focus on end game content. - QoL issues still plague the game and have not yet been improved. The changes in the most recent update were made, per the devs, in order to deliver more ""meaningful and challenging"" content in the future. At face value, this sounds like a good thing. However, it is unclear what their vision of meaningful content is or how these changes will yield such benefits. In my opinion, slowing characters down and limiting their options, while forcing them through the same content, does not make the content any more meaningful and does not reflect intelligent game design. I will continue to check the forums to see if any much needed adjustments are made to the recent update. Until changes are made or the devs vision of a better, more meaningful gaming experience comes to fruition, I cannot recommend this game in it's current state.			"

												First i was shocked by what they did with my fav. game.Then i thought give it a try. Then i realized that they cut it to the simplest.The Talentsystem and the Infinitysystem are not bad if this would be a new game that would be out of alpha for a week.But for people who played this game since beta it feels like having the Choice of 300 TV Channels before and now only 2 channels left (Train- and Religion-Channel). You still have a choice.The ""biggest"" Questions for me are:Why dont they listen to their first hour and moneygiving players?Why dont they finish the biggest patch ever?

												I didn't spend the time most of the people in the comment section did on the game.However here is what I have to say about the update.Jean Grey, Rogue and Ghost Rider were my 3 most played heroes as they are my favourite out of the entire roster of heroes. I grew up with the X-men comics and Ghost Rider as a kid. So naturally I enjoyed those characters more. Now to the review part.At first glance the update seemed to fix the issue I had with Rogue having to go back and steal every single power all over again, now instead the powers would remain in a ""Stolen index"" for me to pick from later. But I soon came to the horrifying realization that everyone else did. My MOST played character was now weak. I use to be able to smack down a boss in less than 30 sec with my power loadout of stolen powers. It took me 3 tries to kill the boss, a fight that usually took me 30sec revolved around me having to not only change my loadout to try and add more survivability, but the hardcore damage powers no longer had the ""boom"" that they use to.Jean Grey, probably one of the most powerful characters in the game. Most deffinetly one of the most played. I love toggle abilities and naturally the Phoenix was my go to powerhouse. Sadly she feels less like the mighty Phoenix that can rip apart cities and more like the ""candle dove"" that struggles to tear apart a trash bag. From Goddess to cosplayer in one update.Ghost Rider. Mind you he was not top tier to begin with but he remained my all time favorite marvel hero so I had to stick with him due to loyalty and likability. What use to be a struggle to kill a boss is nearly an impossibility now.Biggest update has nerfed the greatest heroes. Movement abilities now nerfed into oblivion.Old systems put in place to improve overall gameplay now ruined with ""New"" ideas to improve but instead broke.I would gladly return to the game if and ONLY if they fix the damage they had done. Some things I would like to keep (actually the only thing I would like to keep from the update is Rogues stolen index). Other things need a desperate fix.			"

												The ""Biggest Update Ever"" ruined the game. Content takes longer to finish due to scaled up difficulty, traveling around the game world takes longer due to nerfed movement powers, and the rewards were nerfed to where its nowhere near enough to justify the time spent. It takes dozens of hours to farm enough experience points to get anything worthwhile from the new Infinity system, and the best ways of farming credits, Odin Marks, and Relics (those are money, end game item currency, and stackable equipped items, respectively) were flat out removed from the game with no replacement added. The only way to feel like you're not wasting your time in this game is to load up on 'boosts' from the cash shop so that the experience gain rate, credit drop rate, and Odin Mark drop rate feel like they should be all the time. Want to spend $15 for 2.5hrs of 'decent' drop rates, and $3 for every 30 minutes after that? Because that's what it will take to keep the boosts going. What a RIPOFF.There is no point to playing this game right now. Equippable items are getting completely re-worked in an upcoming update, meaning that most of the items you can currently obtain might or WILL be changed or outright removed from the game soon, so you might as well wait until then before even considering trying this game. However, I would STILL recommend playing something else, made by developers that actually care about their players.The devs have also clearly been using the PC version of the game as an Open Beta test server for the upcoming console release of Marvel Heroes, and it's a huge slap in the face to those of us who have spent hundreds (if not thousands) of hours playing this game. This game has gone from a unique, though flawed, ARPG, to a cheap Diablo 3 clone that wants your money more than caring about whether or not you're having any fun.			"

												I've been playing this game since it came out. It was shaky at first but they got it together and it was fun. Granted I couldn't understand why the Hulk had to spend five minutes working on Crossbones or the Moleman--one punch death was called for in that case--but hey, its a game and I could live with it. Now that they've released the Biggest Patch Ever I have to say I am hating it in spades. Charatcers are so slow and underpowered its a joke. My inventory was spammed so hard by this update that all 16 of my Purchased sorage boxes are stuffed and the only way I can empty it out is to BUY MORE! As a veteran of gaming I can't ehlp but think one or two things.1) a blatant attempt to kill the game by making so bad it dies on the vine and leaves them free to find a new cow to milk.2) The game's generated income has dropped so much that a play to win formula has been adopted. Either way, steer clear. Go play Path of the Exile or Diablo 3 or Warcraft for that matter. This cow is on its way to slaughter.			"

												I have been a Marvel zombie since I was little and when I found this game it was love at first sight.  I spent a lot of time playing and a lot of money on it and was happy with it.  Until they started talking about this ""Biggest Update Ever"" which sounded like a bad idea but I hoped that saner heads would prevail and they would realize how bad of an idea most of it was.   Then the update hit the Test Center (the test server that lets players help then test patches before they put them up on the Live server) and it was everything they had said it was going to be, unfortunately.  That is why you can see the negative reviews about it from before the update went Live.  The response was so bad that they blocked feedback on it on their site.  But they went ahead and moved it onto Live with no real changes.I can no longer call this a good game and I do not recomend it for new players. They seem set on making into an inferior version of D3 for some reason.  It very much reminds me of the changes that killed Star Wars Galaxies down to the cries of the fanboys saying that that everyone who disliked it was just afraid of change.			"

												This has been a pretty enjoyable game for a long time, but the latest update essentially gutted the game.  It is borderline unplayable right now, stay far away at this time, it has a fun factor of zero right now.  I will never understand the thought that a fun game with great reviews needs to be totally scrapped and remade into a steaming pile of feces, but that it what Gazillion has done.			"

												As much as I've enjoyed this game in the past, I would never recommend this to anybody that has previously played any Diablo game or Path of Exile. The movement has gone to ♥♥♥♥ and it just feels like you're not doing anything productive as far as progression goes compared to before the big update.			"

												3.5 years into the release of a game and they revert it back to a beta. This game has been reimagined so many times it's hard to tell what the developer philosophy is at this point. They want a 'marvel heroes diablo 3' mashup. For some that's fine, but as someone who was severely disappointed with D3 these changes are made directly in spite of why I played this game. ""Biggest update ever""Bigger isn't always better gaz. Bye.			"

												I use to love this game. I played quite a bit in beta and spent 200+ hours on cycolpes only(I've always liked glass cannons). But the update is so bad that I haven't even tried it and then there was another bad one. BRING BREVICK BACK!!!!!!!!! Sadly I don't think this game is going to be golden again, if they would have just added more content and balanced out new characters they would have been fine, seriously everyone was eatting this game up. Nothing is forever. I want to recommed this game but I would be talking about something that doesn't exist anymore.			"

												Worst update ever! The new restrictions on travel/dash powers are ridiculous. Force to regear most of your characters to meet changes.  Not to mention that new gear you need ""coming in a future patch"". Completely nerfing teamup activation rates on away powers and damage unless you have maxed your all of your team ups. Limiting the Action bar to 8 powers, etc, etc. Not necessarily unplayable, just not worth playing.			"

												The new patch has largely screwed up this game, there is the old saying""If it aint broke, dont fix it"" this is a classic example, the game was large, open ended, had lots of content, but after the update, alot of the base game mechanics are screwed up, the world has been made more linear and a great deal of content has simply been removed.Add to this the increasingly greedy efforts by Gazillion, like removing free costumes when prestiging, and the game has gotten much worse, I still play it, but overall, this update has been a complete ♥♥♥♥ show.

												Recent patch seriously gimped movement for everyone. The game feels WAY slower than it did before. I can live with the skill changes and I can try to adapt to the new Infinity system, but the movement changes are absolutely ridiculous.If I recall correctly, most of their reasons for the movement changes was to ""make room for making future content"" and so that people can ""take in their surroundings and appreciate the detail put into the maps a little more"" (I ♥♥♥♥ you not, I remember one of the admins say something along those lines in the official forums). That is complete and utter garbage and the only real reason I see here is so that they can streamline it for consoles.

												I'm not a good writer of reviews, but I'll do my best to sum this up: Don't waste your time. This game used to be one of my favorites, and I dropped hundreds of dollars on it due to its in-depth gameplay and customization. Now they've dumbed down the game to ridiculous levels to make it more ""accessible"" for console players. For example, they limited you to only using six different moves on a character, despite being able to use almost double that before. The new ""Infinity System"" took your ability to choose 100s of different bonuses for a character to customize your playstyle and replaced it with 25 bonuses in total, most of which are complete trash. On top of all that, they put a blanket nerf on all characters in the game making it a huge grindfest. Battles you used to be able to complete in a minute or two minutes now take 6+ minutes and some aren't even possible at all if you're not using the right character (and this is with maxed out gear)!

												The biggest patch ever....It didnt dumb the game down.It did however make the game extremely clunky, slower paced, and just not as fun to play.  The smooth, fast paced combat is gone. Intentional speed bumps and road blocks were put in that disrupt the flow of gameplay, especially in combat. Many heroes are a complete chore to play now, which is not fun.This update tried to copy a LOT of mechanics from D3, which is fine, I enjoy D3 too. However, they failed to impliment these mechanics in a balance and well planned out way. Too many heroes feel like the new mechanics were forced, completely disrupting the fun and enjoyable aspect of their gameplay. Hopefully the devs wont be close minded and deaf to the feedback they are getting from many vet players. Hopefully they will make updates and changes to smooth things out and make things fun and flow better again. However, as it stands right now, this game just isnt fun to play.			"

												A once awesome ARPG has been left to wither for over a year by a dev team foolishly devoted to porting over to PS4.  They haven't been able to address basic bugs on the PC version for close to 4 years so I don't see how the PS4 will treat them well, but either way, the PC version is a dead end now and SHOULD NOT BE INVESTED IN as any further development of the PC version of the game is speculative at best now.  D3, POE, Grimdawn or even Torchlight 2 are much better options for you at this point.  I have over 5,000 hours in game and it pains me to write to this, but the PC version isn't what it was, and seems to now be abondoned.			"

												The ""big patch"" has ruined the game.In an attempt to get the game ready for a console release the game has been absolutely destroyed.Gazillion Entertainment went out of their way to try to sell this as an improvement since before the patch was even live.However the list of issues is enormous.Story mode has been gutted, most of the gameplay in early chapters has been simply removed and turned into linear corridors. This mode also dropped in-game currency allowing for purchase of new Heroes, this has been replaced with drops of complete useless crap.Because of this in order to get ONE Hero out of a roster of 59 you must spend 50-80 hours picking up drops of the currency which are on an 8 minute timer. Spending this much time to get new Heroes ruins the game, there is simply not enough content to play on each Hero for long enough to get a new Hero. This is simply greed and an attempt to force players to spend money, its a very unfair practice against free to play players.The new trait system was designed to allow more builds and more choice, however ultimately there only just as many builds as there were previously but many of them are broken and will take months to fix. Most movement oriented builds are completely broken. Some Heroes have received a revamp that they desperately needed for years, with this kind of track record how long are players excepted to wait for this patch to receive fixes for all the new broken Heroes?Movement has been slowed down and dashes have been limited by charges in order to slow down the game. The goal was to force players to fight trash mobs instead of rushing to bosses, not only does this not stop players from rushing but it also makes the game incredibly clunky.When activating the Travel power the player is locked in place before being able to move at full speed, this implementation is about the jankiest part of the patch. Long before the patch came out testers have asked for an implementation where the Hero gradually increased movement speed when the Travel power was activated to allow movement during the build up of speed reducing the jank. The developers excuse was that it was too difficult to implement what is essentially sprinting...Dashes are fixed length and and have between 3-5 charges depending on the Hero and Build. The fixed length makes playing melee Heroes a complete chore, with every dash players are forced to move back to their target after dashing far past the enemies. The fixed length was implemented for the sole reason of accommodating controllers.Dashes were meant to be used as an escape and invulnerability when fighting enemies, however it simply does not work. The damage is not balanced in the least even using up all the charges of a dash you will still often die. Timing enemy attacks is also nearly impossible, between trying to keep track of the cool downs on the power bar and trying to see through a billion different particles created by skills it impossible to see what the enemies are doing. This type of system does not work in a ARPG game. This is not Dark Souls. Dark Souls is an actual good game.A new difficulty has been added, however it was named after the previous hardest difficulty. Even though this mode is now harder it provides the same drops as previously. On top of that the gear that is meant to allow gameplay in this mode has not been added to the game and likely won't be for months.The sheer greed Gazillion Entertainment has show in this update is disgusting. Free to players have no hope of ever getting new Heroes in a timely manner, they will soon remove free costumes and the potion boost system is about to be gutted in order to make it more pay to win.Before this game had its nuts cut off I would have gladly recommended it to anyone but now I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.

												I love marvel, hell some DC stuff aint bad, special wink at killing joke. but this game is so grindy to the point it kills its own fun. Played it since beta, back when you can ""find"" heroes an costumes, it was as rare as finding real gold in your back yard. techniquely possible but unlikely. Fast forward to know they have a splinter token system. thoses drop far more often, but yet again they stifle your ablity to even farm  a single hero / back up summon. like a pet but  more uesful  still like the game but the grind to find just enough tokens for a new hero has put me off from coming back in full force. also their way to find new costumes is such a hassle. you have to lvl a hero from 1-60. you get a bonus free plain starter costume , do that 3 times you can ""blend"" them in a RNG game of hoping for an awsome or atlest a new one...heres the thing with that you have just as much chance as getting one you have, a new one, or even a copy of one of the ones you just sacrifed to RNGesus . its down right wrong to do that to you but it has happend. (forgot to mention you have to level the vendors...yes the vendors first to even do all that costume rng blend. you have to give them items worth something to raise their xp.....I would only recomend this to die hard diablo 2 an marvel fans but even then its a run of the mill game.    favorite part of the game hearing heroes coment to one another that they normally dont see or know a bit about. example Ghost rider telling Punisher ""he is just as guilty as those he kills""...or to peter parker, ""your guilt out weighs your sins"" (even special comments on certian costumes)			"

												This game was amazing. But this 2017 update, the biggest game overhaul, absolutely killed the game. Limiting dashes and such, removing skill points for the skill trees. It's no longer any fun. There was once such an in depth customization and tailoring to make your hero play exactly how you wanted it to. Not any more. With the Omega system revamped and diminished into the Infinity system as well, there isn't as much room for being exactly what you want to be. Not to mention other bits they removed from the game, such as login splinter rewards, making the grind for new heroes without spending anything even harder.			"

												DL'd this game wayback 2013. the game is fun but still incomplete, i still give it a try while waiting for the fix.Alas! the game is standing on its own, its like the succesor of Diablo 2 with a different taste! and it boost my excitement when this game got here on steam. With no doubt and all, i DL'd here in steam and bought the deadpool pack for steam only.And then the ban hammer came after i did something stupid, because of not reading the terms and conditions. wasted 3years of farming and real money for a one mistake.i tried to explain to devs, but no.. they want perma banned. i still can't believe what happened so i lay-low and thinking about doing a new account. and after a half year, i recovered from the pain and got my strength in-game 75% atleast thanks to my experience.And then here comes the big-update!OMFG!!!!! they want be like DIABLO 3! from infinity points (paragon) to skills(no more power points)!And the movement? OMFG!!!! i just felt bad for players using movement hero!Overall!? this game is going comepletely trash, ever since David and friends left gaz. Download this game sure.. its fun for the first hour or day whatever.But take it from me, dont use real moneywhen you feel you need that real money for extra stash, DONT! just dont!After testing this, you can delete this game and move one.Wait for upcoming ARPG like ""Lost ARK"", Lineage Eternal or MU legend.

												EDIT:  I continued playing Marvel Heroes a lot (several hours a day every day) since writing my initial post BUE (biggest update ever patch 2.0) review.  I wanted to give it a fair shot and I think 2.5 months is a lot more than fair.Basically the game isn't any better off now than it was 2.5 months ago.  Every patch since the BUE has been working towards cleaning up the mess that was created because of the BUE.  They've already revamped the new Infinity system and it really didn't make it much better.  Still, more than two thirds of the nodes aren't even worth investing in.  They're still trying to balance heroes even though the BUE was supposed to make that easier for them.  It hasn't.  There are heroes who have 3x more DPS than others.  Instead of focusing on the underperforming heroes, they're focusing on the overperforming ones so every patch comes with a list of nerfs.  The last 4 patches in a row, downtime has been at least twice what it normally is and after the server comes back up players have experienced roll backs losing hours of XP, loot and even purchases from the store... Oh and to top it all off, Nick Fury was just released as their most recent (and last that we know of) hero and he's by far the worst they've ever released.  His entire kit is copy/pasted skills from other heroes.  It pretty much felt as if they said ""well, we already sold this guy in the advanced pack last year so we have to ship something... what's the fastest way we can do it?""I tried to love this game again... It just isn't happening.  I can't keep playing it in it's current state.  I really hope they turn things around but I'm moving on for now.Original Review Follows:So I only have 500 hrs listed here on steam but the /played command in game lists me at 1200 hrs and I'm pretty sure it's closer to 2000 counting the hours played prior to /played being implemented.Admittedly, I haven't played much over the last year because the game (at least for me) started going downhill a long time ago.  But I have thousands of dollars invested in my account so I've kept it updated and installed all this time, checking in now and then.  I heard about this huge update and figured I should see what it's all about.First off, the game crashed a few times before I could even start typing in my password... Never a good sign.  But I finally got it to load up and found a whole crap load of stuff in my in box.  Apparently they decided to remove costume cores from costumes and call them something else.  Thankfully they were all still bound to the heroes I had them on previously cause I never would have remembered which one belonged to which hero.Storm was one of my top 3 mains so I switched to her and went to the training room.  I spent about 2 hours trying to wrap my head around all the changes they made to the core build system.  Storm used to be all about resource costs and regen.  But now all of her skills are free and when her resource fills she gets a buff.  Also core stats changed.  Fighting isn't the be all end all stat for DPS any more.I had a rough idea what my TTK on the test dummies used to be with her so after fine tuning everything other than gear, I gave it a shot and came up about 10 seconds short.  Which to some, probably isn't a huge deal.  But I spent so much time and money (not only in game money, but real money) fine tuning her gear to be perfect that at one time, I had the fastest TTK with Storm out of any other player in the game.  Basically, for me to fix her at this point, I'd have to reroll all her challenge bonuses, change a few artifacts, her rune and a handful of other things.Once I realized how much I'd have to do to get Storm up to speed, I quickly realized how many other heroes I had geared for end game content.  The thought of having to go through all that dozens of times... I just said ""nope"" and closed it down out of frustration.If you're a newer player who hasn't invested as much time into your heroes, maybe this will work for you.  But I've stuck with them through so many revisions over the years and had to regear so many times, I'm just done.  Maybe 6 months from now, when things iron out, I'll give it another shot, but for now... As much as it pains me to do it, I gotta thumbs down Marvel Heroes.			"

												A once great game ruined by by the new devs that came from companies that made FPS and sports games. This game used to be extremely fun and fast paced and pretty much never got boring. Then, one day, people from EA and Activision come along and decide to take away every ounce of fun this game had and made it slow and boring because they want to port the game to consoles. Not sure why they had to make the game so sluggish to be able to port to consoles, but it really doens't matter at this point since just about every fan of this game has left thanks to the new devs that are trying to make cash instead of a game people actually love. Funny thing is, the old devs that worked on this game and made it so great left to go work on Path of Exile, which is also coming to console. What is even more funny, is that they aren't changing a single thing on the PC version of Path of Exile just to be able to port it to console which shows just how smart and caring the devs are for that game compared to the new devs for this one. At this point, I hope Marvel Heroes crashes and burns before the new devs can make any profit on it.			"

It pretty much felt as if they said ""well, we already sold this guy in the advanced pack last year so we have to ship something... what's the fastest way we can do it?""I tried to love this game again... It just isn't happening.  I can't keep playing it in it's current state.  I really hope they turn things around but I'm moving on for now.Original Review Follows:So I only have 500 hrs listed here on steam but the /played command in game lists me at 1200 hrs and I'm pretty sure it's closer to 2000 counting the hours played prior to /played being implemented.Admittedly, I haven't played much over the last year because the game (at least for me) started going downhill a long time ago.  But I have thousands of dollars invested in my account so I've kept it updated and installed all this time, checking in now and then.  I heard about this huge update and figured I should see what it's all about.First off, the game crashed a few times before I could even start typing in my password... Never a good sign.  But I finally got it to load up and found a whole crap load of stuff in my in box.  Apparently they decided to remove costume cores from costumes and call them something else.  Thankfully they were all still bound to the heroes I had them on previously cause I never would have remembered which one belonged to which hero.Storm was one of my top 3 mains so I switched to her and went to the training room.  I spent about 2 hours trying to wrap my head around all the changes they made to the core build system.  Storm used to be all about resource costs and regen.  But now all of her skills are free and when her resource fills she gets a buff.  Also core stats changed.  Fighting isn't the be all end all stat for DPS any more.I had a rough idea what my TTK on the test dummies used to be with her so after fine tuning everything other than gear, I gave it a shot and came up about 10 seconds short.  Which to some, probably isn't a huge deal.  But I spent so much time and money (not only in game money, but real money) fine tuning her gear to be perfect that at one time, I had the fastest TTK with Storm out of any other player in the game.  Basically, for me to fix her at this point, I'd have to reroll all her challenge bonuses, change a few artifacts, her rune and a handful of other things.Once I realized how much I'd have to do to get Storm up to speed, I quickly realized how many other heroes I had geared for end game content.  The thought of having to go through all that dozens of times... I just said ""nope"" and closed it down out of frustration.If you're a newer player who hasn't invested as much time into your heroes, maybe this will work for you.  But I've stuck with them through so many revisions over the years and had to regear so many times, I'm just done.  Maybe 6 months from now, when things iron out, I'll give it another shot, but for now... As much as it pains me to do it, I gotta thumbs down Marvel Heroes.			"

												Edit to my earlier reveiw to make clear why I do not like the new ""Big Update"".1)Lack of items for the new updates. Made changes to the game but will put in items for the changes ""soon"".2) Unclear changes to stats for heroes. Stats that worked before the update like speed, durabity, or str now do not matter at all if they are not two prime stats.3)Infinty System still has nodes that have no use or stats now are useless if they are not your prime two stats.  And the xp for the new system is still broken.4)Over seven heroes went live with the wrong prime two stats. 5) Launch with story stopping bugs on story missions that were found by testers on the Test Server the night before the update went live.6)Dev team says this part one of many patches for ""Big Update"" that are coming ""soon"".  That right, this update is coming out in long drawn out parts.So if you want to play understand, you are now beta tester for dev team that is not really listening to player feedback.			"

												I hadn't played the game in a long time, solely due to another new year update sometime ago, but i had always followed it waiting to hear of something to make me want to invest time and money into it again.... Sadly, it seems i was right over a year ago.... this was getting nerfed to unplayability, and i stopped wasting money on it and decided to just go play elsewhere...I would suggest to everyone, Console players as well, READ the other Negative reviews from people who spent much larger amounts of time (and no doubt Money) on this, and understand that the game you may now be getting is not even a shadow of the game that once was easily the single greatest Marvel Universe game ever created....I'm gutted to see it go down this road.... much less than others, as i had already stopped playing, but this is a travestyRIP			"

Movements have been slowed down so now you are forced to spend more time to finish your quest because it simply takes longer to move from point A to point B.

I didn't play to max a build or do raids; I just intended to level alts and gather loot.Its become too much of a slog to do so in a game that was already light on worthwhile content.			"

												I mean just read the other reviews. This game is pretty much ruined at this point. If you want my feedback...oh wait. The developers don't even achknowledge feedback. ALOT of bugs slipped through the cracks that were reported MANY times over. Yet they claim ""We just wanted to get it out after so long sorry guys."" Right, take you 4 week holiday vacation and then give us an update when you did nothing to the testing center for this and it's still garbage? I've spend hundreds of $$$ on this game and it's just feeling like I wasted it on what I take to my driveway every friday morning. Trash.They've also taken away the ability to let you choose any hero to level past level 10 (You can trial any hero to level 10, but prior to this update on January 20th you could ""Uncap"" one hero for free, no matter the cost it is outside of the ""free."" This no longer exists and you are allowed any hero that costs 400 eternity splinters (the games currency for allowing you to buy heroes/team-ups and bank tabs.) You could also use these 400 on two different 200 splinter heroes. Overall it's a terrible change for those who like the following heroes who cost 600 splinters that you could uncap for free before; Deadpool, Dr. Doom, Dr. Strange, Ghost Rider, Iron-man, Spider-man. Before you could uncap for free and get those 400 eternity splinters, giving you a variety of two heroes for just playing the game in 2 days. (Not played, just login 2 days). Now you get the choice of 1 hero that limits you. It's a terrible decision.If you want a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ diablo 3 clone that uses the marvel IP, look no further, this game is just for you! Just don't expect anything to be consistent!			"

												Marvel Heroes was, at its prime, an ok Diablo clone with a Marvel Skin.  If you loved the IP, you might have given it a try, then.Now?  It's well past its prime and has gotten much worse. Please consider avoiding.  As a Free to Play game, the balance between the free element and the pay element was great.  Then it became good.  Now, it's totally income based.  The devs are saying ""Pay now.  Support the game.  Trust us.  Later, it will be better.""The game currency to buy free characters has been dramatically reduced.  Log-in rewards have removed most currency and free character chances.  Most now consist of expiring 5% -ish coupons for paid options.  The devs have even formally stated the ability to get free costumes via restarting characters to Level 1 will be gone.  A company making money on FTP is acceptable.  But a company making the game less enjoyable yet costing more to unlock things... with vague promises of things being better... is not.  I regret the hundreds of dollars I've spent on this game since launch, as it is not even close to being the game it was.  MY FAULT, granted, but please don't make my mistake.On top of the FTP changes, Gazillion made a gear reset that makes the game slow, grindy and frustrating for a previously fast paced ARPG.  Add the change that long term character powers were reduced by a factor of 10, both in numbers and in game effects.Plus, on the boards, the developers aggressively censor and ban players for negative comments, to a level I haven't seen since 2005 MMOs.If you really want to, try it yourself, since it's Free to Play, but please do not grudgingly support Gazillion financially ""in the hopes"" that future iterations of Marvel Heroes will be better.  Marvel Heroes was passable at its height.  MH2016 isn't close to that now.As always, check with people that know you personally and that have played the game so that they can see if MH2016 matches your entertainment needs.  I suspect, that, given its horrible new direction... it's something to avoid.Your precious entertainment time is best served elsewhere.			"

												This game has come a long way since its release.  In its current state, it is a very fun and fair f2p game.  If you played it initially and didn't like it back then, you should definitely give it another shot!  Needless to say, if you like Marvel games, this is probably the best thing we have at the moment!There are tons of characters that are mostly fun to use and feel different.  The animations, effects, and sounds are really good for an ARPG, and you really feel like a superhero/villain while playing.  Unlike other ARPGs like PoE or Diablo, Marvel heroes actually have a lot of content focused for teamplay.  There are even raids in the game that require a full team of players that require actual skills too.  There are a lot of things to do, a lot of items/characters to farm/collect, and a lot of events to participate in.  I come back to this game every time a new Marvel movie/tv show comes out, since the game usually has an event associated with them at the same time.Overall, it's a solid 8/10 game overall, and a solid 9/10 for someone who either likes ARPGs or Marvel comics/movies.  It's free to play, so why not give it a try?			"

												I've been playing for 2 years, I've had a lot of fun with Scarlet witch, Captain America, War Machine, The Human Torch, and currently have started playing Doctor doom, He was fun.The update rolled out, and suddenly doom is a chore, it's not fun anymore. Summoning works much differently, the prexisting omega system has been phased out, drops are now almost inconsequential, and log-in rewards are just.....nothing. Gaz is focusing on a very different audience now, which is alienating the current players, and forcing people who have spent a lot of money away because of these changes. I was lucky, I was going to spend $150 on G (ingame currency), that's not going to happen,Marvel heroes is turning into a monetizing, diablo clone of a game, without the drops or the fun that it had previously. And I for one, am not going to ride the bombshell with it.			"

												""The biggest update ever"" is nothing but an incomplete idea. A dozen heroes had a main focus on talents whereas the rest were halfassed ideas where skills that were dead before are now being shoved into a rotation that you don't have enough skill bar slots to put it on. It wouldn't be so bad if it was an alternative to a skill so you're not stressed over slots, but this is the only thing they're so hard on not changing. Really unfortunate.Mobility. ""We want to slow things down for the life of the game"" is a funny statement since you can actually reach the movement cap now easier than you did before. Sure you can't teleport across the map instantly, but you are running much much faster than before. The problem with this entire change is the mob pack densities. They did nothing to this and this is what makes the entire change to movement awful. You have ""packs"" of mobs that consist of 30 rares that are all ranged in a single area so god forbid that you dash into it you'll die instantly(Well current difficulty changes is god, god, instantly die) and then you have times where it's 5 normal mobs. Why? There's a reason why people teleported across the map before and it was because killing mobs in MH is actually VERY tedius opposed to Diablo 3/PoE where ironically you clear much much faster.Infinity Sytem. I get that the old idea of having a ~100 possible spots for extra stats becomes too overwhelming to a new user and in the long run becomes harder to create new things to the system, but what they replaced it with is actually underwhelming. ""Hey we want the D3 crowd, but we'll make it worse."" is what they came up with. It wasn't that the old idea was bad. It was their idea of what consistutes of a good node to spend points in was bad. What it is now, isn't bad, but it does  homogenize everything.Artifacts. They finally had the balls to nerf artifacts after having them exist in such a broken state even though they introduced ones that would one up the previous leader. I'm glad that they did this, but holy hell a lot of the changes they made is just absolutely disgusting. An artifact going from top tier to bottom tier is poor design. Difficulty Slider. Though this is incomplete, they ignored what people said during testing. It basically has two levels of it. You never die and kill everything instantly or you die instantly and things are annoying to kill. And they actually want to scale this infinitely similar to Diablo? Hahaha, if they can't even get 3 right, how can they get an infinite amount right?The update just feels awful all around. I'm sure if they polished the garbage changes then they'd have a gem, although it'd be a gem of garbage.			"

												I bought a few games during the Steam Summer sale, and now those games are covered in virtual dust because I found Marvel Heroes around the same time. I started off with an incredible deal on the Civil War pack which gave me a running start at this fun and addictive game.As people have mentioned, it is a Diablo style (wear out your mouse) MMO game where you get to play as your favorite Marvel Heroes. I liked that you can solo most of the content, but if you want to join others, I feel the game's community is very helpful and friendly.There are various currencies in the game like loot dervived and found gold, Odin Marks for special items, various random event items and Eternity Splinters which you collect as you play. Eternity Splinters are the currency you can get new characters with or you can buy them for real world money called ""G"".One major thing I liked about the game is that it truely is playable for free and various special events yield even more free items. Although, I eventually did pay real money with absolutely no regrets for some additional heroes and most importantly inventory space called Stash's. (That is the little catch in the free to play model, you have very limited inventory space.) I found that by waiting for sales and special offers you can build a pretty large base of characters easily without spending a ton of money and even when I do pay I feel like I'm getting way more of a value and playability than I have with many of the other paid games in my library.The developers really stay on top of things creating new heroes, special events and additional content all the time. So it's nice to know they actually care about putting out and supporting a good product.The gameplay is easy, but there are deep, complex and enjoyable aspects to it as well as you progress. A few things I wish I knew starting off is items/loot from worst to best is: white, green, blue, purple, yellow and finally the unique brown for basic items. Relic's, Rune's and Artifacts and Legendary items are valuable for the more advanced development and depth of the character's and game. Selling loot for credits isn't very important until much later on. You are way better off donating loot to your Crafter and Enchanter who unlock options as they level. (You can donate to most vendors but I feel the Crafter is most important first.) Team-Up Heroes are a lot of fun to have and help a lot if you solo often. I bought 1 and got 1 free on sale, and one came with the Civil War pack and one was free from an event. Also, you can use the same Team Up multiple times on the various main characters available. They say one of the best Team Ups is Pirate Deadpool, whom you get for free from doing a simple quest. I like Clea best and recommend getting her if you buy one.There is a very in-depth forum available for questions you may have and most people will help you out if you just ask.I recommend this game to everyone and especially Marvel fans! No regrets getting and playing this one.			"

												I absolutely hate this game now.. I can't even get myself to play 1 full hour.   Why am I still playing tho, you may ask.  I'm still playing it ONLY because I bought a dlc and have not gotten everything from that dlc yet.  They have made some of the dlc as part of the tba at a later time.  Sort of like the yearly passes you buy from other games.  I'm only playing to get some of what I purchased by buying the pack.  I can't stomach the changes.   The story mode used to be open world, now its skip everything and go from point A to B to C...way to linear (boring).   Gear reset is going to be harder than ever with the forced play at the higher difficulties.   Constant loot drop litter from other players that do not give flying F if they drop their trash on top of the excessive trash loot that drops.  You end up having to go through your own loot as well as others trash to get the items you want.   The ramp up to the travel powers sucks completely because you will be struggling to collect the random experience orbs that can spawn/drop anywhere, many times no where near where you killed some baddies.   The bosses at cosmic level (3rd difficulty level) can one-shot you.   They will be adding 2 more even more difficult levels at later date that will require full groups to even attempt.   What's bad about that is most ARPGs are not supposed to function like an MMO.   Higher level loot will be locked behind having to find groups.   Travel power nerfs makes it a slower, more difficult gameplay because like I said the bosses at level 3 cosmic level can kill you without second thought.    The thing I hate most about this BUE is that it is completely alpha quality.   Constant bugs, constant changes to ideas they F't up. (infinity system is already getting rehauled).  The actual gear reset is months away and we are being forced to use the obsolete gear they are trying to replace.   If Blizzard tried to release a half-♥♥♥♥♥ expansion where you need to wait for months after release, to get gear, people would revolt.  And that is what has happened here.  The so called BUE should be called Biggest BETA-TEST and ♥♥♥♥ YOU Veteran players Ever.   My gameplay time don't show here because I played from the stand-alone client for years and only reinstalled through steam to get thoses last purchased items I was owed.			"

												OVERALL: I do not recommend this game in it's current iteration for anyone at max level. I do however recommend this game to fresh, new players who have not yet reached max level, and who plan to do so slowly (i.e. casual player).Continue reading for an explaination of the above.Let me preface this by saying that I have been playing this game since November 2013 (1600+ hours) and am extremely active on the Test Center, forums, conversing with devs, other veteran players, etc. I own 90% of the roster; I paid for about half of them and unlocked the other half for free, even though I can unlock them for free in-game. I have over 4000 Eternity Splinters (the currecny to unlock characters), but I chose to pay for some characters because I believe in supporting games that you enjoy. I've spent well over $500 over the past 3 years on G's (in-game currency) to purchase other things as well lke costumes, boosts, Fortune Cards, etc. I'm writing this review because the most recent update on Jan 19, 2017 has had mixed reviews; and I believe I can help new or potential players understand why.The reason I recommend this game to new players (who especially love Marvel) is because at it's core, this is a fun pass-time that can absolutely be played in a casual way by persons of any age. It's simple enough for casual gamers (even children) to understand. It also lets people play as their favourite Marvel characters, as well as provides a fun way to learn about Marvel characters you may have never heard of. Movie tie-in events from real life are also fun to experience. The best part of this game to new and casual players, is that it can be entirely F2P if you so choose. Spending money does not affect progression in an over-bearing way where you feel light years behind everyone else if you do not spend. Other than experience boosts (which Gazillion has decided to remove after this week), most of the in-game store only contains cosmetic and 'chase' items that have no effect on gameplay at all. Also, unlocking a single new character requires roughly 20 to 60 hours of gameplay each to achieve - which is not bad considering the handful of free giveaways throughout the year as well as the AMAZING player community that often holds free giveaways on the game forums. Speaking of the community, it is by far the best I've ever encountered on a game this size. In-game and on the forums, everyone is extremely helpful and there are always multiple conversations going on at once. Unfortunelty, many of these great community members have stopped playing due to the complacency that Gazillion has adopted over the years. Now, onto the negative....The reason I do not recommend this update to Veteran players, or anyone who is trying to ""gear out"" their max level character is simple. Loot & End-Game Content. The loot system in this game has been messed up for a long, long time, but Gazillion Developers have instead focused on character updates, QoL's, and the 'new' Infinity System (which is bland and uninspired, yet they claim it is end-game progression). They have not at all addressed the lackluster loot drop ratios, nor have they added any raids or fulfilling game modes (i.e. one-shots) in almost 2 years. 2 years without new and farmable end-game content!Pre-update, the only way players could farm decent loot during the past two years was to ""boss rush"" OLD content over and over and over again until the thing that they wanted dropped. Drop rates are extremely low so the number of runs a person would have to do in order to get that loot would easily be in the hundreds, if not thousands. Multiply that tenfold due to the game having 60 characters to play, all of which needing the same loot to reach their top potential. Now as abysmal as that already sounds, with this new update the devs have decided to make the game significantly slower for players to farm and progress. They have taken away ""boss rushing"" by limiting the number of teleport and dash powers while not increasing the loot acquisition proportionately. So basically what has happened is that the difficulty of enemies has increased, your ability to skip over them and just ""boss rush"" has been removed, and the loot drop rates have not changed. It takes at least twice as long to farm the exact same (don't forget, 2+ years old) content, and there is no increased rewards to compensate. For example, if it took 3 hours to find a boss artifact in a 'Terminal' (a short 'instance' for all you MMO-types) before the update, it now takes 6 hours to do so, post-update. This is unnacceptable and has turned a LOT of veteran players off to the game. We have told the devs constantly over this game's life that the loot is not in a good place. They sometimes acknowledge this, and say something is 'in the works'. Whatever 'in the works' means, I'm not sure, because we haven't seen anything done in last 3 years.Loot is the number one priority in an ARPG or MMO, and Gazillion has continued to fail to deliver on that aspect. They have been hinting at revamping the loot system for years now, but absolutely nothing has materialized and it appears to have just been a carrot on a stick that some players (posting positive reviews) seem to keep believing in.The second major negative about this game is the lack of new content. There are only two raids in this game, the latest of which was released almost two years ago. The next longest time-sink game mode are called One-Shots (longer 'instances' than Terminals). The most recent One-Shot also came out 2 years ago. All of the other game modes (X-Defense, HoloSim, Terminals) are so old, that their loot tables have not been updated in over 3 years. Gazillion Developers introduced Danger Room last year, but the rewards are sub-par in relation to the difficulty of the instance. No one plays them anymore because they are so time consuming with little payout.To top all of this off, Gazillion has introduced a new (payment only) method of guaranteed loot, in the form of a boost potion from the in-game store. This further drives home the problem that Gazillion has been aware of their awful loot drop rates, and instead of fixing it, they have instead decided to monetize it with these new boosts (by the way, it's important to note that these boosts are still lackluster, they guarantee loot but it is random and you do not know what you'll get). Gazillion does not like giving out meaningful loot, but they are running a loot-based ARPG/MMO?! It's ludicrous. How are players expected to gear out up to 60 characters when it takes anywhere from 3-6 months to gear out ONE, and this was BEFORE the Jan 19th update. It does not sit well with veteran players, which is why you're seeing all of these negatvie reviews. One more negative about the recent upate: Team-Up synergies. Team-Ups are companion characters you can purchase or unlock that assist you in combat, but you cannot take control of them and play them. When these were released (3 years ago) they came with a promise of having a Team-Up synergy system that would further buff our characters and provide unique benefits depending on which Team-Up you used. Well, three years later, we finally get these synergies, but all they consist of is a simple 2% damage buff that stacks the more Team-Ups you have unlocked. So we waited three years for a 2% damage buff per Team-Up owned, stackable up to 50 times. That means you need to buy or unlock 50 Team-Ups to get the maximum benefit. Team-Ups cost 80% of an actual playable hero, does the cost-benefit seem fair to you? What a cop-out by Gazillion.So bottom line is: If you're new and looking for a fun and casual Marvel IP game that is F2P, this will satisfy you for a month or two. If you're a veteran or want to seriously start doing end-game content and gear up your characters; wait. I do not recommend playing until Gazillion improves their loot system and adds new game modes that take more than 5 minutes to complete.			"

												It's finally time to review this game that I once loved and after the 2.0 BIGGEST TURD update EVER. There's already alot of reviewers saying the state of the game right now. Releasing an incomplete update with no OMEGA items and even after 5 patches later, still nowhere to be seen. These devs are even trying to get the console players to suffer as much as we did, with the release of their MARVEL HEROES OMEGA trailer. Don't bother trying to get your concerns on the forume either, they will instaban you for anything negative(about the devs, the game, constructive criticism, SJws, etc) views. AVOID PURCHASING ANYTHING from the cash shop, any semblance of what David Brevik did to make the game successful was erased by David von Dorman(Current CEO of Gazillion).			"

												Past your first play-through of story mode, and pushing into the few bits of raid content that exist, you won't get much re-playability out of this game. The developers seem to think the only content worth creating is more and more heroes. Worst yet, it is often new heroes with skill and abilities that are direct copy and paste from existing heroes kits.But before you have to worry about hitting the ""all aboard the new hero train"", you must first get past the ""unreasonably hard gearing boss"". Where in, you have to grind out RNG on top of RNG to even be able to obtain the gear fitting of your characters best build. But even once you do, you are going to waste all of your accumulated in game currencies to re-roll that .1% drop chance item (This is actually generous, a lot of the best items are reported around .05% chance) you worked so hard to get, to make all of its applicable rolls high enough to be worth the effort in the first place.After all of that, if you are strong willed enough to stick around and want to play multiple heroes, you have to get ""past the free-to-play gating"" boss. This games restrictions on free-to-play players is the worst I have ever seen. Base in game storage is aweful. Just to hold all the reagents you need for crafting will take up all of your free stash space, and most of your inventory. But beyond that, to purchase new heroes for a free to play account you need eternity splinters. Those splinters are gated behind an in game cooldown, and only have a chance of dropping. Without hard to obtain or store bought potions, its about 1 splinter per 10 min or so with an average kill rate, which at 400-600 splinters needed for most heroes you are looking at 66-100 hours of in game grinding just to buy a single hero.This games expectations of its playerbase are unreasonable, and will burn out a free to play player almost instantly. The only way the game can be consumed at an enjoyable pace is if you spend an ungodly amount of money at the in game store to circumvent what at its core, is a very unbalanced and underwhelming game.The game was overall enjoyable for me until I hit end game and realized just what was expected of me to compete. But once you take a step back and look at the big picture, and realize just what you have to do to gear a single character, and then what it takes to purchase more, you can't help but be demoralized by the whole ordeal.I will likely only log in to check out any new content that  might come, however rare. But I can't see myself ever considering this a game I would spend most of my time in like I would have previous MMO's in my past.			"

												As a longtime player of the game following it since it it was known as Marvel Heroes MMO in 2011 and playing it since Beta (and someone who has supported it through DLC purchases) it makes me sad to write this. Truthfully, MH2016 isn't as bad as some of the reviews will make it out to be. But it's lost the spark that could make me recommend it as a game to spend your time on.Marvel Heroes is free-to-play, and you can unlock a lot of things in the game just by playing it, but that investment of time comes with an expectation of payoff and as of the game's most recent patch, the ""Biggest Update Ever"" I don't feel that sufficiently exists anymore. Thousands of players who invested their time and money have seen the nature of the game changed extremely significantly. Options have been simplified, gameplay has been slowed considerably, and the roster of heroes has been weakened. Marvel Heroes has always had an issue with portraying the characters of the Marvel Universe accurately. I mean, how do you even balance a game containing Wolverine and Silver Surfer? Black Panther and Thor? But it was something that could be overlooked because nearly all your heroes could achieve levels of power that made you feel like a superhero. That ability--for now--has been yanked away from most of the roster, leaving you with segments of the game where Marvel's legendary elites can get wiped out by grunts on the street. Merely moving through areas is much slower now, to say nothing of fighting the mobs you'll find there.In the end, Marvel Heroes isn't a bad game. There are plenty of things to grind for, a very impressive chunk of the Marvel Universe available to unlock, and some decent Marvel-esque experiences to be had. But once you get past the license, the game as it now stands is average at best. Even with the license, I can't recommend it considering all the other games (including free ones) that could be taking up your time.			"

												I've played a massive amount of time and would have continued, but the new changes have not made the game fun for me.I had invested a lot of time in items that are now pretty much worthless, which is one of my concerns, but the main one is the changes made to the game that has turned it into a slug fest killing bullet sponge bosses.The game no longer flows as it does, and that's a real shame.I now have to re-domind numbing content that I hade acccess to before that I no longer have access to, with over 50+ heroes. That's a time investment of around 12+ hours that I need to do again, just because.I need to re gear my characters, re evaluate their powers and learn their new play styles, which is not a fun process anymore.If you're coming into the game it might be fun, but if you're a vet then it's pretty easy to get turned off.Can't recommend this game in the state it is in at this stage.

												Previous to the ""biggest update ever,"" most heroes felt unique. There were some similarities between some of them, some similar abilities, and a few clone characters, but the vast majority of them were completely different. They had different playstyles, different abilities, and they were all fun and pretty well balanced. However, the newest update shoved every hero into a handful of categories. Nothing is unique and different now. They all blend together and have all been nerfed and dumbed down.			"

												Think Diablo meets Marvel Ultimate Alliance meets F2P MMO. While a fairly simple ARPG, it adds complexity in that every single character is its own class. Now there's 30+ characters, and a new one is added every month. Although you only get one character free at start and get an easy second when you complete the story campaign for the first time, you can grind currency to buy them in-game for free, or just drop real cash to make them available now. The majority of my characters I've gotten through this method, and I have roughly 1/3 of them.You really get to feel like your favorite Marvel super hero in this game. When I lay down thunder and ice storms and tornadoes as Storm, or teleport around as Nightcrawler, or simply punch everything in the face as Hulk, it really gives you the feel good buzz that you are the character, not a generic hero like most MMO games allow you to be. While it's fun making your own, I'd much rather play as the real deal. There is enough characters now that you don't often see more than one of your character on the board, depending on how new that character it is, and how popular it is.The downsides to the game are mostly F2P related, including the multitude of in-game currencies that confuse your bank storage, and the fact that each bank storage slot costs $5 each. This is fairly expensive, and you need a decent amount once you have more than a few characters. I currently have something like 6 general bank slots (2 free, 4 bought), 2 crafter slots, and 6 Hero specific slots. I'll likely buy them all at some point as my bank fills to the brim with stuff I can't bear to sell. Also, costumes are really expensive, running from 4-15 dollars, about the same price as characters. While I definitely purchase a lot of them, I wait until the BOGO sales to do so, so I have a chance to get another one for another character I own. I've gotten quite a few free costumes this way.There is raid content, cosmic, hard, and normal difficult boss fights, sandbox style street brawls across Manhattan and two wave spawn modes, the content is a bit thin. The campaign isn't really replayable, even if you play thru on another character, as the rewards are just too slow compared to the instanced boss fights you can level on. It does feel like the game needs more content, and the devs are creating more as we speak, including a bunch of new one shots, a new campaign chapter, and higher tier raids... something for everyone.When you first start, the game is easy. It doesn't really challenge you. Step one foot into the challenging door, raids, or terminals, or oneshot stories, and the game drastically goes up in difficulty. The campaign prepares you for this, however, as long as you don't go crazy and skip difficulty levels on the repeatable content. I found the game very satisfying the first way through. Now when I level a new character, I jump in the wave survival matches and level up 10x faster. The game's character synergies boost all of your character's stats as you reach lv50 with them, and boosts their XP gains when you hit 60 with each character.Although the F2P stuff and the limited content are a bit annoying, the game is still amazing and playing it is really fun. I love killing Magneto, and Dr. Doom and Loki over and over. Playing as Loki is equally as fun! Pick your favorite Guardian, X-man, Avenger, Fantastic 4, or other Marvel hero and give this a spin. It's free, so it only costs bandwidth to DL and install.			"

												Here are my opinions on the current state of the game. I am a veteran player that have clocked over 5000 hours on the game if you include my time on the standalone client.The recent 2.0 biggest patch changes basiaclly is a soft reset and the game is back in ALPHA state. I am on the fence with the changes becacuse it is a 3 years old game and to have drastic changes on it now seems redundent.As of right now there are not enough new content to justify all the changes and provide very little incentive for veterans to play other than grinding for EXP(infinity point).Can't really recommend this to new players too because how underwhelming it is being a 2017 game and how much catch up new players have to do in order to be on the playing field.Pros-Streamline power set with talentsUpdated visuals and animations.Console friendly. (which is their primary goal for streamline the game)A massive roster of heroes + villans.Cons-Lack of content or loot that excite players.Very expensive cash store for heroes and cosmatics.Infinite exp grind which will promote botting.Removal of Omega system which had a lot of Marvel flavor.We lost a lot of mobility and statstical value, our stock of currency devalued overnight.New players are further behind on the curve if they have no been playing.(material/gold)			"

New skill traits are cool and new design of the heroes.But did you guys really have to make heroes weaker!??!?!?!? lowering dps is what killed me. I spent so much time on Iron man and Spider-man to pass cosmic trial, the game was already challenging for me.The fun part of playing this game is spending hrs of time and making your hero strong.After the patch, all the bosses are challenging... due to huge NERF!!! to all heroes. My main heroes are so weak that its sad to see them doing no damage...Why didn't they keep all the dps and just make the bosses HP higher ? or make more difficulties for terminal? I really dont understand what they were thinking in their head. I see players that are happy with the update or very upset. To be honest, time will tell whether the update was good or not. I hope they learn that player's  opinion matters the most, not the developers.Oh and big thank you to Gaz for saving me from spending more money on this game.			"

												I started a while ago and fully unlocked deadpool, beacuse he was one of the most expensive characters, not to mention its deadpool, and i fell in love with the teleportation aspect. Unitl they ruined it. I would use it as movement since my computer couldn't process the map fast enough whenever I was using his transport vehicle, and now its only allowed 3 teleportations. I would use it to jump into the middle of a horde of enemies, or out of the way of an oncoming attack, but now it is slow and cant be repeated. The game was really good and looked promising, but they need to change it back. The new update is garbage. Also, recently Im not even able to open the game, so its useless now.

												Thousands of hours into this game down the drain. Unbalanced heroes, unbalanced content, removal of features, addition of excessive grind and a new P2W element in the cash shop wrapped up in a pretty bow with the label ""Biggest Update Ever"". Even without the absolute demolishing of an otherwise, fast-paced game, the pure bug ridden mess of a patch is enough to worry even the most staunch proponents of the content change. Marvel Heroes started going downhill when previous talent left the team and was sadly replaced by a handful of people that fought to make the success built upon by Brevik and Doomsaw and turn it on it's head. The game is nearly unrecognisable from what it once was, and is a travesty of a mess. Asros and his ilk ought to be ashamed of themselves. There's a reason all the previous devs completely abandoned the game; don't visit forums, don't post about it on twitter, don't stream anymore. They saw the writing on the wall and bailed while they still a once fantastic label to add to their resume. Good news for them, bad news for the players.			"

												Marvel Heroes is a F2P ARPG, or a diablo like game if you aren't familar with the genre.It does some things well, like a large cast with each being fairly unique in play style. The Omega System (think a more complex paragon system if you played D3) offers the same post max level progression. Many of the skills have good flashy looks. The gameplay is quick and you'll often feel powerful like a superhero should. The storyline is enjoyable for a playthrough...but after like any ARPG becomes something that simply slows down progression.Which leads into the things it does not as well. Forced stat gains tied to storyline quest mean you're forced between grinding out those quest lines for skill points, mana, hp or be a weaker character for it. Progression without buying boost can feel slow, especially if there isn't a  major event going on at the time. While there is always some form of an event going on, not all of them are fun and many of them will require you to play multiple times to get the ""best"" rewards.The game has an odd mix between wanting to be a casual ARPG and an end grind heavy MMO. While you can enjoy the 1-60 experience and push to cosmic (hard mode) versions of what you've been doing without getting into the grind to hard. You will eventually hit the point of, do you want to turn this into a weekly grind where you have to do, X, Y, and Z to maintain effecient progression, switch to leveling a new hero, or taking a break.

												This will be my first review because of just how much of an effect this has had. Though I've not put it as many hours as some, I think 500 hours is enough to build a judgement on.Marvel Heroes was previously a fast paced ARPG will a whole swathe of skills for each and every character. There were many interesting enemies, events and mechanics within the game which meant that each character felt, for the most part, pretty unique. It did, however, have its problems. A major problem was increasingly complex items with so many different stats and modifiers that it was becoming unmanagable (from both the player side and the dev side). Power levels were ballooning, and  tremendous gulfs were emerging in these power levels, so that it was becoming nigh on impossible to create challenging, rewarding, and balanced content. Things like the uptime of invulnerability was so high on virtually all characters, that many enemies carried insta-kill attacks, because that was the only things that could take people out. There was also an enormous disparity between many characters with some being unimagineably powerful, while some were borderline unviable to play as.As of the ""Big Update"", a great many things have changed and most of it was intended to address these problems. A removal of the invulnerability modifier to medikits will have a major impact, as well as limiting mobility. This second point is an important one, the fast pace has been wrenched out, and in many players' opinion (and increasingly, mine) the game now feels unbelievably slow and sluggish. I have so far only played a handful of characters with the new update, and many of the changes I am a fan of. An array of often largely useful powers have been tightened up and many interesting skills, talents and modificiations have been brought in to really improve some of the under utilised heroes. My biggest issue so far has been that summoner heroes seem to have been hit hard. As an example, for me, Ultron has descended from being my favourite 'hero' to being unimaginably dull to play has, Rocket Raccoon, has similar issues, both of these heroes being down to the signficant hits to summoner mechanics as a whole. Gaz have stated that much of this is to make a 'less passive' game, and while I understand these statements, I am more inclined to agree with what many are now saying in the forums. These changes are to bring in a console release. Fewer powers on the go, for controllers. Slower movement, to give consoles the time to keep up. Tremendous nerfs to summons, to remove what is on screen, so again, consoles can keep up.Fundamentally, the game has been torn down with the hopes it can be built for a console audience that will keep it afloat. Because that always works in the end. Edit:""The point, the f**kup, the mistake that we made, was answering anunasked question.“Can you change an MMO drastically after it launches?”Categorically, NO.

												I'm compelled to write this review because of the ""Biggest Patch Ever"", a huge rebalancing and reworking of the game that hit live servers on Jan. 19, 2017.  At the time of this writing, I have 643 hours played in this game in the period it has been on Steam alone.   Suffice it to say, I love this game.  I am not sure how much real money I've put into Marvel Heroes over the years supporting the game, but I easily estimate it over $300.Bottom line up front.  This new patch is atrocious.  Heroes were weakened across the board in relation to enemies.  The previously unique Omega system was replaced by a bland, Diablo-esque system where meaningful decisions are nonexistent.   A fluid, exciting travel system was replaced by a slower and more cumbersome counterpart fueled by regenerating charges.   Overall, this patch is a slap in the face for all the veterans of this game.  Our feedback was wholesalely ignored on the forums.In summary, this game is no longer fun to play.  You do not feel like a superhero when playing anymore, and if that's not the central concept of this game, I don't know what is.  All these changes were made in the name of ""balance"", ""new content"", ""sustainability"".  But guess what, devs?  You forgot ""fun"".			"

												Bottom line: This game is now a terrible console port.With their newest frustrating update they made travel slow and combat more boring and time-consuming -- all because they will be launching on the inferior Playstation platform. Travel speed has been reduced, fights are longer, the character view area is smaller/closer, character powers have been vastly dumbed down (and made bland!), damage is now a fraction of what it once was.  Gave the update a chance and playing just isn't fun anymore. I greatly regret spending the money I did on this game only to have them dump their PC players for console kiddies.And when the Steam reviews go from ""Mostly Positive"" to ""Mostly Negative"" in 36 hours, it's not just me.

												This is a terrible patch and the wrong direction for the game to take. It is possibly a nail in the coffin to a game already on the rocks for not having any meaningful rewarding game play elements. Increasing grind on content that is YEARS old and removing build diversity is not an update.  It's just not fun. The game used to be fun. I have 1000's of hours played, once upon a time it was fun. Try POE instead that's where their former Lead Dev now works.			"

												What the hell happened here? This game used to be everyone's go-to game when we mention Marvel games.I remember when the game came out,and I realized that the computer I had was too weak for the game.After more than 2 years I finally got to play the game.I download it,press that PLAY button,and boom it's puts me into the main menu.It felt so cool fighting Ultron forces as Cap,Hulk and the others.I remember getting my starter hero (who was Ultron).So good memories.And then I stop playing for about 4-5 months.You know life come's in and all of those things.And now,in 2017 I decide to return to the game.I see the BIG UPDATE tab,and I click on it.I read through the 1000 pages of patch notes,and I just sigh.They nerfed everything.Movement,they destroyed the omega system for the infinity system,and oh god all of those starter hero changes.Oh and who could forget the costum changes.I feel bad for newer players,if there are any,who enter the game,and can't play as their favourite Marvel hero.It's just sad.And if they get a hero,they find out that you can get costumes to them,but guess what you can't,because ♥♥♥♥ YOU.I actualy have horrible history with costumes,because my first costume was droped from a thug in the Hood Hideout termianl.And the costume was for Storm.So the movement changes.Oh god those movement changes.There was one thing that I used to do all the time as a new player.Zip around the entyre city as Ultron with his dash ability.Oh boy it fellt so good going at the speed of light while dashing around the city.So how the hell can they ruin this,well they can make it an ability,that has 3 charges.You can dash 3 times than you have to wait 1-2 seconds.WHO THE ♥♥♥♥ HAD THIS IDEA? WHO?!Oh and movement abilities got changed too.Now,you can't ride your bike/fly around the hub at a speed,where the game can't even handle.No no no no no.Now you can go half as fast a Housain Bolt.Whitch means,that the avarage speed of a human.(I have something f-ed up to say,but I wan't to keep it to the end.So what's next on the naughty list.Oh Infinity system.Remember the Omega system?Where if you achived level 60 (max level) as your hero,you can now earn Omega points from leveling up the omega bar.I remember getting an omega orb chest after every boss.You can get thousands of them,and you can change the way your hero fights,or the defensive stats or like that.But now we have the ♥♥♥♥♥tain the is the Infinity system.It's similar to the omega systam,but much worse.Instead of earning thousands of points,you can earn hundreds of points.And you can change the ways too,but they are not as creative as the ones in the Omega system.Oh and don't forget about the team up changes,no no no no.They changed them the same way as they did with the heroes.So let me explain it.So you are a new player,you just got done watching the latest Marvel movie,and wan't to play some Marvel games after that.And then you find out about this game called Marvel Heroes.You create an account,you download the game,you boot it up (do people still say that?),and you select your favourite hero.But oh no,you realise that you can only get 400 SHARD HEROES.WHO THE ♥♥♥♥ CAME UP WITH THIS?!And you know how you can ""unlock"" the other heroes,so that you can unlock them for who knows how many shards?By buying something in the game,for real life money.And same with the team ups!You are limited to 400 shard team ups.Just why Gaz why?First,you shut down your amazing kid friendly game called Marvel Super Hero Squad Online,because you wan't to focus on Marvel Heroes...You guys are deffenetly focusing on making the game better.So here is that f-ed up thing.I heard,from some fans,that Gaz made the decision to change up the Marvel Heroes team.(the devs of Marvel Heroes) Well really nice choice Gaz.Real nice choice dummies.And just please,if you are new,DO NOT PLAY THIS!And if you are an old player,or a veteran.Maybe come back if you wan't to,but please don't.So here are my thoughts about the big pile of ♥♥♥♥ this update is.Have a nice day.Diker out.

												The Biggest Patch ever just ruined one of the most fun and diverse action RPGs on the market. Everything has been nerfed to oblivion. There is now so little choice on your heroes' builds it's become pointless. Hero powers now play like Diablo 3; level up, get automatic access to new skills, get higher levels, add a modifier to one of your skills, and that's it. Also, there's only one skill bar now so you have a fixed number of skills allowed per hero. Movement powers either have a replenishing number of charges or have a charge time to initiate. The overly complex Omega system was replaced by the Infinity system, which is basically Diablo 3's Paragon system. Instead of 4 categories in D3 you have 6 and you only have about a 1/10th of the Infinity points as you had Omega points. They decided to separate costume cores from costumes and make a new slot for cores (now called catalysts) which was unnecessary. Story missions are now so on rails they are boring. The revamped story chapters have zero interractivity with other players and no area events. Finally, attributes no longer give any damage bonuses, only defensive bonuses so increasing attributes like fighting/strength/energy doesn't give you any of the value like before.Everything about the game is slower. Combat is slower, movement is slower, and the fun is pretty much gone. I got a 25% off G coupon prior to the patch that I was waiting to use to see how this new patch worked. I'm not using it nor will I ever buy another G pack for this game again. Thanks Gaz for dumbing down this great game for the consoles.			"

												These people are advertising things that are not in the game. Raids, and PVP are still in beta and neither is even close to fully functional. Mr. Fantastic and Silver Surfer are not even on the test center yet. Trading has been disabled since the 2015 ""Launch"" due to technical problems. Over half of the heroes that are actually in the game haven't had their 52 reviews (essentially meaning they are not finished).      In addition the folks at Gazillion have a nasty habit of banning folks from the forums that they have disagreements with. This wouldn't be a problem except that if your forum privledges get revoked so does your ability to play the game. They don't tell you that this is their policy however just recently my friend went through this and lost his account, not for any in game infractions but for somthing he said on the forums. When I began posting about his situation on the forums  I received private messages from over a dozen other players who lost their account access in similar fashion. Later that day my thread was deleted with no explanation given.Quoted DIRECTLY from Marvel Heroes Terms of Service: ""If a user communicates in any language other than English within the Service, Gazillion holds the right to suspend or terminate the Account.""Seriously that's how crazy these people are, they are banning people for not speaking english. Several of the PM's I received cited this as the reason they were banned. Final Verdict: In fairness its not a terrible game, at times its a lot of fun, but doesn't deliver on whats advertised. Too many AARPGs in the market to put up with false advertisement, and Gazillions forum despotism.3/10			"

												This is your basic diablo style game that tries to go deeper in a way that looks good but gives no real improvement. That's because the game never feels challenging. It's there to waste time. The story is there, but it's improved by the game by zero percent. At times, I found myself actually wishing I were reading it instead of playing it. The characters tallent trees have depth. It sounds good. If the game were challenging AT ALL, it might even be fun. As it is, there is no reason to even do the tutorial. It's not needed to learn anything because you can just run through and hold down the mouse button. You can get into high difficulty, but even that will be you with some other people, running through while holding down the mouse button. On the highest challenging scale, i'd give it a 3 out of 10. On the fun factor, 0/10. The only reason this is a game is because it has a dc skin on the outside, but it only has crap on the inside. I see this as the cheapest way they could have went with a game and still make some kind of money. It's a sad attempt at giving us what we want in no way what so ever. If you enjoy Ben Afflek, you may enjoy this game.			"

												I've been playing since Open Beta and seen everything this game has gone through.  The launch that came 6 months to a year too early.  The lack of even the most basic systems at launch.  They didn't really have a concept of what leveling should be let alone endgame.Over time they added great improvements like Eternity splinters, which allow you to unlock the heroes you want jsut by playing.  They added ten man raids as a way to get better gear.  They added story chapters and other content to keep things interesting.But something happened.  They stopped adding interesting content and instead jsut reskinned (patrol) zones they already had.Jump to 18 months ago.  The current CEO stepped in things changed very drastically.  New raid conent stopped.  Heroes started getting released at longer intervals.  As of a year ago, almost all content development stopped except for mini events that were just in tehre to promote Marvel TV and film projects.It has now been leaked, unofficially, that they have been working to port the game to the PS4.  Normally. this would be seen as a good thing as it could open the market to many more players.  but they chose to divert the PC developers time from adding content to redesigning the game from the ground up.  Companies that care about their customers create a team to handle the port, this allows existing devs to keep delivering content.  Veterans were left with nothing left to do for over a year, and that's not changing any time soon.  Their most popular streamers have left, veterans have left.  Gazillion has abandoned the veteran PC playerbase in the apparent hopes of replacing them with console kids.The latest update was a lettdown in most regards.  Mobility was crippled for little reason as they didn't change any actual mechanics.  They just boosted health and dmg of mobs.If you are looking for an ARPG with rewarding endgame and developers dedicated to improving it, look elsewhere.I reserve the freedom to change this review if they eventually start treating their veteran players better and show commitment to them.  Until then, this review stands.			"

												I have 1k+ hours in the game (I played a lot on Gazillion's client, not Steam's). Honestly the only reason to play this game is because of the IP. The game itself is mediocre at best, but playing as Storm is awesome. If you ignore that Storm throws a lot of visual noise on screen and nothing dies and you have to dash around constantly to not die while nothing else dies. It really makes you feel like you are a Marvel hero!The reason I played the game for so long is because there was a brief period in time at around the time of the rebranding when the game was actually fun. Since then, it's continually become less and less fun as the devs alternate between giving the community everything they want and ignoring the community while adding no new content besides new playable heroes. Marvel Heroes is extremely clunky. To be a ranged hero you pretty much have to hold the ""shift"" key down to stay in place and cast your powers without getting in melee range to the point that my hand will start to hurt. To be a melee character you also have to hold down the ""shift"" key if you're using attacks bound to mouse buttons because the hitboxes are tiny and/or buggy and if you don't tell your hero to stay still they will continually move around instead of punch. If the enemy moves, they'll just sit there punching the air. Many attacks don't properly aim so you have to aim at a place other than the enemy to hit the enemy. With the new addition of limited dashes and charge up on travel powers the game is even more clunky. Three dashes is not enough in a game where everything one-shots you. I never died while trying out the changes, but it slows down combat to have to gingerly walk out of the enemies' telegraphed attacks. Not to mention how fun it is to be completely surrounded by enemies and be unable to escape because you're all out of dashes and your Marvel Hero needs to take a nap!  The charge up on travel powers is less than a second, I think, which doesn't sound long. At first it annoyed me, then I accepted it's existence, then it went back to being annoying. With the amount of times you activate travel powers in this game to get past the long, boring maps, a wait period on traveling slowly builds up to be insufferable. The heroes move really slowly, enemies can cancel the cast animation if they're around, and you will be traveling constantly since most of the trash is pointless to fight and your damage is so low nothing ever dies. Speaking of nothing ever dying, every hero feels weak. I build glass cannons with no defense and all damage, and it takes years to kill even trash in the ""cosmic"" difficulty. So much of your damage relies on layering regardless of hero that it makes your attacks feel like nothing is happening. Playing at Storm, you can make hailstorms of tiny white dots that do nothing. You can unleash tornadoes that whirl around the screen doing nothing. You can summon a cyclone that may pull all the enemies in the center of it (the game is really inconsistent about whether or not powers that move enemies actually move enemies) that does nothing. If you keep cycling these abilities, something will eventually die, but if you're playing this game because you love Storm you'll find your mind wandering to all the times she's taken it crews of people with a gust of wind and struck down a foe with a bolt of lightning in the comics or even the movies. If you're playing because you like ARPGs, you'll find your mind wandering to the last time you were truly happy in the arms of Torchlight 2 or Diablo 2 when you're lightning attacks actually did something and looked awesome. If you like both, you'll just wonder what you're doing with your life because you spent all this time killing trash and it drops absolutely nothing and the boss has run off screen, taunting you, because they also drop garbage. It's even worse because now that the game limits dashes, you need to build for defense. But as a glass cannon nothing dies anyway, so building for defense will only extend the hellish existence of being a Marvel Hero that fights the same enemies for eternity, with none of them dying. In addition to your attacks doing nothing, they tend to look like they're doing nothing. The visual effects are noisy and the game focuses on increasing the duration of these layering damage powers instead of increasing their damage. So these effects will be on your screen forever if you do things right. Which gives you a lot of time to wonder why a hailstorm looks like a snow flurry in Marvel Heroes when in Torchlight 2 it looks like you're raining icy spears down upon your enemy, and the enemy actually dies. I know I keep harping on this, but it's amazing how many godawful effects you put down in the game just to watch enemies ever so slowly lose health. The effects are extremely sluggish and their doesn't seem to be a connect when they actually hit enemies.The art of the game is bad. The environments are ugly as sin. There's is no delight in looking at the environments you play in, they are just hideous. There is no consistency in character model's quality or even style. The game actually does have some beautiful work on some of the heroes and costumes, but it only serves to show how inconsistent the models actually are. One artist will produce something gorgeous, and another will produce something that doesn't even look like it belongs in the same world. Even for two beautiful models, if they were done by different artists they don't seem to match. Look at Rogue's constume selection. Her default, 90's costume, Savage Land costume, and 1602 all have vastly different faces, hair quality, and bodies. To compound the problem, the old costumes (and often the most iconic ones) are the worst and in the two years since I stopped playing, they have not been updated to match the game's new ""style"". Not that there's much of a style because the environments are ugly and bland and have no detail while the character models are all rather realistic but with no consistency and the effects are highly stylized yet ugly and nonsensical. Have I mentioned I haven't played the game much in two years? I stopped by to check the Biggest Update Ever and I was expecting fixed costumes, new costumes, and, oh, I don't know, new content. Nope, in two years there is ONE new terminal and a handful of new costumes with all the same problems there were when I got bored and stopped playing. Except now there's new ones because enemies either have more health or my heroes do less damage. The fans of the game insist that the problem is the BUE isn't finished and there's going to be all new items and such to make me stronger! Well, then why play the game now? All my progress is garbage, playing now would be even more of waste, and I'm not excited about running the same exact content with the same exact bad environments and the same exact bad damage, now with inhibited traveling and dodging abilities. Not to mention the laziness and recycling in each hero's design. So many powers are just copied and pasted from another hero. Jean Grey and Psylocke have the same ultimate, Jean Grey and Invisible Woman have the same knock up attack, Vision and Cyclops share the same laser beam attacks, every jump up and slam maneuver is the same as everyone else's, every hero has a circle of damage they put on the ground, etc. and even amidst all this copying and pasting, they cannot balance the game. None of the heroes actually feel like themselves. I'm an X-Men fan and honestly the X-Men Legends games did a better job then Marvel Heroes did, and they didn't have the benefit of patching or a community of fans that provide long write ups and scans of the character's feats. I'd write more but the review system has cut me off. Play Torchlight 2, Diablo 2, Marvel Ultimate Alliance, and X-Men Legends instead. Even Path of Exile if you want the ARPGMMO experience.			"

												Let me start this off by saying I've spent a lot of time playing this game and would've given this a HUUUUGE thumbs up prior to all these changes.But now that they've implemented what they said were for the better, it has me really hating the game now. There this part of the game called Cosmic Prestige and that requires what felt like hundreds of hours of work, and it's all for nothing due to these ""better"" changes. The devs made this game better for new players, but they've given up on their old players and it's going to cost them dearly. We were the loyal ones who devoted our time into prestiging hero after hero after hero and you've really just screwed us, Gaz. Hard.This used to be awesome because heros actually reflected their Marvel Universe counterparts, but now they want to balance the game, which really is pointless because the PVP aspect is utter crap, and it's really taking away from the game. Heroes who used to be fun are being nerfed so that others can appear just as good.The ONLY way I will ever redownload this terrible game is if they revert these changes, and that's not likely.			"

												After the update coming this game has nothing to offer anybody. There is no quality fun you cannot get more quickly and efficiently elsewhere. This is an addiction which reduces your productivity, attention span, and free-time. You are becoming more bitter, narrow-minded, haughty, and old. Quit now and delete this game. There is nothing here but slow, lonely suicide.I'm not telling you to get good. I'm not telling you to go outside. I'm not even telling you to make friends. Just quit NOW before its to late.

												Just picture an overlooked character that you had to relentlessly farm and try your best to get the highest gears that you can ever farm, and finally turning hawkeye into a killer machine. Damn he was very fast, he was literally a killing machine. the enemies used to die without even noticing the arrow going at them. I have spent a lot of bucks on this game by buying costumes for him, cards, heroes and whatnot.. Bought deadpool and made him my second main hero, got him to be a killing machine as well... now it's all gone, after the biggest fail ever. They put a ♥♥♥♥ing countdown on hawkeye's most used ability and his damage was totally decreased. Not to mention they regardless took omega system down and put a for-10-year-old-kid infinity system which completely took all control you have ever had over your heroes, and butchered all them...After around three years playing it, they ♥♥♥♥ed it up......

												Movement change is the deal breaker. I really enjoyed the game before (I have a lot more than 762 hours since I latter logged in on its own launcher which hours played didn't count. And I had spent thousands of dollars in this game because I liked it) but they insisted on the movement change whereas in the past they would always consider players' opinions and make adjustments accordingly. I gave it a fair amount of time and testing, but still couldn't stand how slow it played.I hope the slow paced gameplay is gonna keep new players as intended because many vets have already given up. Poor design. It's unfortunate. The rest of you can enjoy it all you want, still can't cover the fact that most people hate it.""People just don't like to change"" is an invalid argument. We WANT changes-we always ask for changes and we were always given what we wanted. but not this big update. They kept most of the design despite a lot of negative feedback while testing. That is not to say you shouldn't try this game. Try it and see for yourselves only if you have spare time. If you are new you'd probably not notice the difference anyway. Though if you are looking for a game to majorly devote your resources into, I would not recommend it. You never know when they'll do ♥♥♥♥ like this again in hopes to improve but instead completely ruins the fun for the existing players.			"

												A disastrous update that cripples a game that before was a strong contender against Diablo as the most enjoyable Action RPG.Now the gameplay has been ruined by a completely stupifying array of bad decisions, weird design choices (removing all lore-related uniqueness from each Hero), and a monumental reduction in moving speed, making the action (key component in an ACTION RPG) feel sluggish and very disengaging.If there are private servers out there running the old version, find that. This version is more punishing than fun to play.Please note that all positive reviews and accolades are rewards for the OLD game, not the current version.			"

												My feedback on this game is, undo the latest patch, make the characters feel like super heroes again, bring back ultron 6 summon blade drones, bring back Doom 3 perm Doom bots, think a year about any ""big update"" befor implenting it knowing fully well it sucks and will ♥♥♥♥ people off, slap everyone in the office in the face, kiss them on the cheek, praise Signal Studio's and Hi-Rez because they dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about their games either, and then if you still implent what ever you as a company thinks is good better make back-upsbefor the update so that once the ""new biggest update ever"" rolls out and lot of people say they hate it because it ♥♥♥♥s them over without giving a kiss or a flirty looks, you can roll it back with some delay. Aslo as this game being about ""SUPER HEROES"" I never saw hulk,iron man, cap am, or any of the heroes in a movie go like, ""Let me stand here in the middle of a fight while powering up for 25 seconds for me to move out of harm way just to repeat that wait for my travel powers to load up.""PS. The game is about super heroes but with the latest patch those super heroes feel like turds wrapped in wet paper. Its so sad to see the company pushing players to those unofficial private servers. Awell their lose because I rather support by donating money to private unofficial servers of the game then the official one because those are actualy improving on the pre-patch build. (1 private server was happy to reroll its build back after they also updated it with the current patch, but people playing on that server complained and were listen to).			"

My experience:When I first played, it was thanks to a sale for iron man and captain america. These two characters gave me a good start and a good experience. After playing my first few hours and got the feel for everything, I started to find myself grinding. Many players to help you on your adventures along side team-up partners to help you in fights. Exploring the world of Marvel was fun, even for none comic fans, you can skip video's if needed. You have a top down view but it works very well with the gameplay. In the options, i'd recommend checking it all out, it can help with inventory space, picking up items and more. There is a random feel to the game both missions & towns / citys. Ingame achivements in the 10k ratio & for Steam under 100. Gameplay value is pretty good considering the price is free. Entirnty & cube shards are pretty good to remember and always take them as they pay for characters and uniqe unlocks.Loot / levelup system:The item loot system is intresting, the level system in play is very intresting. I found myself wanting to levelup characters to 50 and earn omega points as fast as I could. You'd have to check it out for yourself to better understand it.In-game cash shop?:Yes, it has a shop. I currently have spent 15$ on this game & feel it was worth it. You can buy your way up, speed up gathering or take chances on finding rare loot. Fix buy's such as costumes, powerup tokens & boosts. Buying stash is a thing too. The S.T.A.S.H is probly the most decent price set at a fix 5$ USD. Remember, most of the items you do actually see in the cash shop can actually be awarded via loot, chance or ingame shops, Events & in-game cash or prizes.MMORPG Aspect:It's a MMORPG indefently. I think the only downside for most MMO users for this game is the lack of character customization. I mean, you can't create you're own character, you unlock characters and have fashion.Boss fights, dungeons, battles?:Many random boss events throughout Marvel heroes. You can fight good guys too. The bosses normally fought in citys or danger rooms require help, can be very tanky, deadly but rewarding. Most cases, if your running terminals suspificly green or red, you should be great even on solo runs. This game is Solo lonewolf supportive for those die hard solo runners.Terminals:These are somewhat the dungeons you run as you grow to lvl 60. Terminals are very rewarding and can have random aspects. Run terminals 1 of each a day to gain cube shards and rewards. Green is easier, red more difficult. Danger rooms:A unige dungeon creation processing room that allows you to generate or create tickets to portals of simulation. Each ticket can have random properties such as con's and pros. Its very random and has a very intresting feel. Danger rooms can be very difficult and shows difficulty ratings before you create the portal. You can sell them for alot too. Each ticket has its own rarity and can be located within the game off random bad guys, bosses, or cosmic enemys. The danger room from what little i've played has me intrested in playing more.Is this more PTW than it is FTP?:I'd have to say no, it's a choice. If you want to save money, you can buy the stuff you feel you want or need. You also get much more gameplay value if you don't spend money in the cash shop however, There is many PTW options but there is many FTP ways around these PTW options if you got the time to spend. Most people would rather just spend the few bucks tho to get comfortable. Therefore i'd say it is open for PTW. I must add tho, not all of it is PTW and must be achivied within the game. There is many good ftp options that is some what a must for all.Gameplay?:Coop. It is based for coop. The game is prefect for friends and users that rather team-up gameplay than fight one another. There is pvp and has the word Beta, I've never tried it. It has a PlayStation 2 console game feel to it. I remember seeing some of Marvel games top down view back in the day. They seemed good and always had good sound fx, gameplay, features.Rating:Gameplay: 8Soundfx: 8Graphics: 6FunFactor: 8Total: 8.7Sidenote:Umbrella Korp approves this game. "

												As an ultimate founder and supporter since late alpha I have always been somewhat disappointed by the direction this game has taken.  The promise of ""give it a little more time"" or ""well they haven't finished this yet"" or ""this system hasn't come online yet"" or ""we have to do this for the health of the game"" has kept my interest and kept my money flowing.  Until the last few days of evaluating the most recent (Jan 19, 2017) update (on their client since Steam was DDOS'd all day yesterday!)Obviously, I enjoyed this game despite all it's flaws.  In additon to my Steam hours I put in at least another 1K hours on their client as well as thousands of dollars to collect every costume, hero, and team up.As an ARPG in general it plays well though pretty basic when compared to something with the compexity of D2 or PoE.  The number of characters replaced the deep and engaging itemization systems you find in other examples of the genre.  The trappings of the Marvel Universe is very appealing to a lot of people though it does seem to have problems deciding if it will participate in the Marvel Cinematic Universe or the Comic Universe.  There are some bits to get past, like ""Why are there 100 Spidermen?""However, I should have realized from the very beginning, when they rebranded the game from Marvel Heroes to Marvel Heroes 2015 to run away from the horrid reviews they earned from launch, the company was on a bad path.  The most recent incomplete update shows this once again.Others have gone into the micro-detail of the update changes but for me I'm more concerned about the overall macro treatment and direction the game and company has shown since the launch.- When it comes to ""Play to Win"" the company stretches the boundaries of good ettiqute for a western company, IMO,For example on change in the most recent update removed stats from costumes and turned them into items which had to be stored in inventory, yet didn't increase the inventory space.  This required people to either delete items or purchase more inventory space.  This is just one minor example of many, many examples.  Others have talked about the Bonus Item Find (BiF) system which is a pure Pay To Win grab in it's grossest form.And this is the system which replaces the broken Rare and Special Item Find system which they pimped for years knowing,  behind the scenes, there was virtually no value to these stats no matter how many dollars a player put toward boosting these stats.  It didn't stop the company from shamelessly hocking the items on their store.- They have a tradition of performing half-baked and not fully thought out updatesFor example in this most recent update, regardless of if people felt it is good or bad, there are at least three critical things that were not completed which needed to accompany the update and were communicated as being part of the update.  Itemization, costume closet, and the consumables update.  While the beneficial items were removed (such as the vendor exchange program) none of the replacements were added.All of the ""pain"" but none of the ""gain"", so to speak.- They have no tradition of quality.  Each release is equal parts update and introduction of bugsIn additon they, for some reason make the rookie mistake of continually updating on Thursday and Friday then taking the weekend off.  This means the players are left over the weekend to soak in whatever bugs were released with their update.  Very poor practice and I'm not sure why they go counter to every other established precedent to update late in the week.- The game introduces new (non-paid) content in dribbiles and the small pieces it has released are typically rehashes of existing content and mashups of old assets.On occasion there are larger content updates but, since the Asgard update nearly every FREE update has been recycled assets with the exception of a few mobs.  Ultron?  Civil War?  Skrull?  Clever recycling but considering the pace I fail to be impressed.None of these things make the game a bad game per se but it does make me wonder what sort of game and company I want to support with my time and dollars.Games change, I can get over that.  Heck, Blizzard does it all the time.  The difference is that when they do a release it is usually COMPLETE.  They don't kick the can down the road on things like leaving out half the critical systems and saying they'll come out at a time To Be Determined.  It's like buying a car but 2 of the 4 wheels aren't ready when you go to pick it up.  You sort of need them all.As much time and money as I've put into the game (and I still have over $100 in game currency on my account) I can't give this game a thumbs up.  The game may, for a while be fun but it is not supported.It is not supported in content, it is not supported in quality, and it is not supported in a way that leaves the game healthy for players in the long term.  When the best way to play the game is to find out when they are doing big updates then LEAVE for a few months while they work it out that's no game I want to play anymore.			"

												This is a great game.  When it first came out I was very hesitant about trying this game out.  At a first glance it looked like a knock off of the marvel games that had come out on the xbox.  And then there was the insane prices for the heros and hero packs.  Well anywise i decided to give it a shot.  And i was truly surprised and delighted with what I found.This game plays alot like the diablo games but with alot more additions, in essence its what diablo could have become.  The skill trees also synergize as in many skills will be upped in effectivness if you have other skills.  In addition there are lots of characters to play.  Every character you play in addiiton will add a synergy to all other characters which you must choose....these are an added bonus for using differing characters.  Like added damage or more defense or more health.  Music is not too bad and the game play is very smooth.  Graphic-wise its actualy fairly detailed considering its a diablo like game view for most of the play time, but you can zoom in to see the detail.  The only draw back any person trying this game might have is that they can only select one character to start.  And if you choose one you dont really like playing...that can be very frustrating.  No matter what you will unlock more characters as you play.  You can bypass having to play to unlock things by using the cash shop....but thats purely up to the player if they want to do that.  I recommned this game for people who like marvel...also those who like diablo like games.  If you have played diablo 2 you might recall rune words and sockets...well these types of things are available. They also have a cow level....believe it or not.  When i say this game is what diablo could be....I mean it doesnt have the same limitation of only you with 3 friends on a map.NOPE! You can play with huge groups.  I was beating on an enemy with 8 other heroes earlier before i wrote this review.  Anywise this game is free...so why not give it a shot.I could have artificialy said this review was helpful or edited my game time like some other reviewwes but decided not to.			"

												So, the most prominent changes for me are1. The worst control scheme since SF Zero2. The ""Traits"" system way less intuitive, probably changed to ♥♥♥♥ us off3 (And every number after. THE WORST CONTROL SCHEME SINCE SF ZERO, AND LIKE THAT GAME WE AREN'T ALLOWED TO CHANGE ITAll in all, i'd be happy the guy who thought of these lost his job. An employee of the dev company or the publishers, we shouldn't let greedy old men come into any form of contact with videogames. But they won't revert the changes.

												The recent patch to the game is the absolutely most disappointing thing that has happened to this game since its release back in 2013 and recently on Steam. The patch changed several things: the movement system, skills, and the infinity system.The movement system forces most characters to be extremely slow. It takes several seconds to charge up a dash that barely moves you half the screen. More often than not, the melee characters feel unresponsive due to how terrible the targeting is when things overlap. Basically, you have to hold shift down to get anything done since you can no longer move to reposition yourself on a regular basis. They throw lots of trash mobs at you that get in your way, but if you hold T to activate your long distance travel power, you can luckily just skip over everything anyways. You get more experience in the long run just grinding in one of the patrol zones with experience orb drops since they essentially increased the length of time it takes to complete the legendary terminal quests.The changes to the skills feels like they killed a lot of builds. Skills are now automatically learned upon leveling up and you can only change ""traits."" The ""traits"" that change the behavior of some skills forces you to basically choose between a few skills each time because of how they interact with one another. Some traits will also disable other skills. Hybrid builds are terrible because most character has one primary stat and a few have two stats, but hybrid builds essentially require all the stats now to actually work. Characters feel like they literally do not have the stats nor the skills to support their own builds and that is just ridiculous. Lastly, the infinity system has increased the grind to absurd levels. Unlike the omega system from before, you gain points in the infinity gems in rotation, forcing you to invest into each category. However, it is unlikely that you will find more than three of the gems useful on any character (assuming it is hybrid, other characters may only find two gems useful), resulting in many more wasted points with points that are more than ten times harder to earn than before. The result is that your characters are going to be weaker than ever before because they get far less out of each point.The worst part of all is that the game changed the stat system without updating the items for the characters to match them. More likely than not, the unique items that you get as drops will not have stats that you need to match your character's build. It feels like the game was updating halfway, and then they decided to stop and just implement what they had instead of waiting until they were actually done first.In summary, the game has slowed down and diverse builds have been eliminated in favor of something more streamlined. Build customization has been eliminated, resulting in trait combinations that are actually worthless when used together (they literally cancel each other out). Characters feel slower and more clunky than ever before along.			"

												Most explosive diablo-like dungeon crawler in the market.Let's be frank - at launch, this game was a mess. But the developers turned around and actually managed to fix their mistakes. What we have now is a brilliant , fun to play loot-focused dungeon crawler with lots of interesting characters. Sure its not as good as, let's say Path of Exile or the other grands, but Marvel Heroes 2016 provides the much needed break from ""srs"" dungeon crawling, allowing you to blow absolutely everything up while playing as your favorite comic book hero.

												Great game with a great community and constant developer feed back.  They are constantly adding new characters and working towards constant game improvements.  They have added two raids with more to follow, two patrol zones with cosmic/epic versions added, as well as a number of one shots (think encapsulated side stories apart from the main plot line of the story), and revamped the story mode to allow leveling from 1 to 60 in story mode.  Literally everything in the game can be obtained for free simply by playing and collecting in game currency called eternity splinters, with the exception of bank space (David Brevik announced that there will be a limited number of bank tabs that can be unlocked with the splinter currency in a future patch) and cosmetic items such as costumes.I have edited/updated my review in light of the fact that the original was posted well over a year ago and had insights/information that is no longer current.

												​A pretty bland and uninspired take on arpg's. The focus here is on heroes as the game doesn't have much to offer in terms of content. The Marvel IP is the only reason to play and serve mostly as an excuse for the developers to sell heroes and costumes and to hide the fact that game plays no better than a Korean grindfest devoid of any intelligence. On top of that you have to endure bloatware ""updates"" with tons of bugs and questionable design choices that can wipe all your efforts without notice. It is a frustrating experience to say the least. If you don't mind the autistic gameplay and you like Marvel you can have some fun and some heroes are really nicely done but honestly I can't recommend it to anyone else.			"

												There are alot of ups and Downs when it comes to this game. I'll probably just do a Pros/Cons list, Cause i personally think there the best to understand. Just know that this is comeing from a player who has been with the comunity for about 2-3 years.Pros- An Impressive Roster. From Fan Favorites such as Spider-Man and Iron Man, to some heroes you may never even heard of, such as Squirrel Girl or Moon Knight. The game includes, currently, almost 60 different characters. Which is for a game of this style rather impressive.Perhaps one of the best designed heroes/villains/costumes in a Marvel game. I think this is where the game shines: It's Design Team. Some of there works are absolutely breathtakeing.Roleplaying. I'm not interested in that kind of stuff, But there are severel guilds, (Called 'supergroups' When it comes to this game) that are based around Roleplaying. If you've ever wanted to pretend your Spider-Man, then go for it.Excellent Voice work. When it comes to a heroes' voice over, They know who to cast. While some may not be perfect for the character (Venom being the shineing example here. {Did i mention they started adding villains these days? Gobby, Venom, Doom.} ) A large majority of them are from the person who made there roles famous. Liked Drake Bell as Spidey? Well he does Spidey, in his younger aged costumes. When it comes to older, we have Cristopher Daniel Barnes, The voice actor famous for voiceing him in the 90's Cartoon. Not only that, The comedy orientated characters have some really witty, funny lines (Yes, Deadpool's lines cant be beat.) And some rather epic lines between more serious characters(DD the best example of those here)A Large amount of content. The names wont quite matter, if you havent played the game, but it's important to note How many options you have when it comes to end game.FREE! Literally, If all of this dosnt appeal to you, Download it right now. It isnt going to cost you anything. You get 1-3 heroes of your choice at the start of the game, for Free. Besides things like Costumes, alot of this game is free. Dont like it? Dont spend money on it, and uninstall. The only thing you wasted is time.Yes, For a game with alot of pros, It also has a good amount of cons.Cons-A rather pessimistic Community. Dont tell anyone i said that :P While most people will disagree, because 'Ninja Gifters' are a thing(I think you have a good idea what those are) The community isnt great. Granted, it's no LoL when it comes to terrible communities, but it's still not the most likeable. People arent makeing terrible jokes, no. But they will be more then willing to scam someone, or do everything they can to annoy another player. Dont let this push you away from the game though, it's a thing in ANY Online game you can ever play. Some heroes arent portrayed exceptionally well. Venom........ To Devoted fans of the character, you'll be sick to see how the game did him. His lines were so bad, severel of them were removed when he was first revealed. And that's nothing to say aside of all the lines that stayed. But we also have heroes like Luke Cage, extremely limited in his powerset(Atleast right now he is) or Taskmaster, who though it fits his lore, is rather limited in his playset, and has very, very few lines. Slow. This game can be played on weaker computors, But it simply isnt as fun. This is a game that unless you have a good computor, Expect crashes, long load screens, and crashes. Lowering the graphics helps, But then you wont be able to see all the amazing designs in there full glory.My Opinion: Download the game. Like it? Buy your favorite hero a costume. Dont like it? Uninstall and give an honest answar why you didnt enjoy it. And to any new players: if you need advice about the game, I'll gladly take friend requests from Steam/Ingame, and i'll give you tutorials on anything you require. Enjoy the Game!P.S. Not sure if i mentioned it in hee already but i feel like saying it. This is a game with a hiatus tends to be healthy :p Stay away from the game for a few months, then come back with tons of stuff to enjoy.			"

												Marvel Heroes was a very entertaining game when it first debuted. One of it's main developers, Brevik, was one of the forces behind Diablo II, so it's no surprise the two games were very similar in many aspects of mechanics and gameplay. But unfortunately as he fell into disagreements over the direction the game's development was taking, the project went off in what I consider more of a up-sell mode, constantly pumping out new heroes and new zones without regard for game balance. This proved to be it's fatal flaw, as the game became graphically bloated, slow, and the pool of heroes was hilariously tilted toward those that were popular (those that sold). Characters like Deadpool, Spiderman, and Ironman were absurdly powerful while others remained virtually unplayable (Daredevil, anyone?)I haven't played the game for quite some time, as it became so bloated and slow that the most fun areas (Midtown madness being my personal favorite) became virtually unplayable. Not to mention the characters and gameplay became more and more polarized, to the point where you either one-shotted everything or everything one-shotted you.I don't recommend this game, unless you can somehow find a version of it from 2 years ago. That version was really fun.			"

												I was a huge fan of Marvel Heroes.  But sadly the ""Big"" update on 1/2016 took away from the fun flow of the game.  Now it's a sluggish grind that sadly, just isn't fun anymore.  I have over 20 characters lvl 60, and i think i'm done. Guess I will go back to Path of Exile.The really sad part is that Gaz is screwing thier game up to get it to console.  Thats like cutting off your head to cure a headache.  This is most likely the start of a downward spiral.  I was actually looking forward to the update, but now am very let down by the results.I will wait for a few patches to come out, just to see if Gaz will fix this mistake.  Elite Dangerous screwed up thier game with an update, and they had it fixed in a week.  Maybe the devs care enough to do that as well here.			"

												Sadly, Gazillion took a great concept and threw it in the gutter to replace it for gold covered ♥♥♥♥. Most of the builds were fun and reasonably, if not perfectly, captured the image of the heroes! They stopped releasing new heroes that people paid for over a year ago(Thankfully I am not one of them) just to release the ""biggest update"" that completely destroys peoples progress(My max omega points went to 1k total Legacy points which is a pale rip-off of D3 legacy) with the game and ruins the characters into simplified dull imitations of their former playstyles. I have spent so many hours on this game and fell out a year ago for work but after seeing this update and what my mains have become Im finally calling it quits and uninstalling. I can see some people liking this if they are newish or their favorite characters were untouched by mine got destroyed. Cannot recommend.			"

												Update patch 2.03Sadly this is not going better :- heroes balance is constantly being reworked - achievements fixed are not- team up were changed without any slight tests : now they keep dying A LOT, even with the best gear of the game- new paid boost are WIP (yes, really)Gazillion is severely lacking in term of QA testing : we have beta patch after beta patch on an early access game... If you like that, go, you will have fun, but if you prefer like me a more polished game as it was before the Bugfest Update, avoid at all cost.......It's time for me to write a small review of my ex-favorite F2P : Marvel Heroes 2017.The name is more now Marvel Heroes 2.0.the good :- Marvel Universe- F2P- And that's it...the patch :- Most of the heroes have breaking bug in their skills/talents actually- the story mode revamp is bugged (blocking) and was not tested correctly by Gazillion- The patch is only half a patch : missing a lot of features before having a complete smooth game experience- for an ARPG you don't loot anything interesting : it's actually a grind fest for nothing- the characters were nerfed to the oblivion but not the boss : this is not even difficult, it's like fighting Bob the Sponge, but less funny...- Most achievment related to instance/old dfficulty level are simply broken : god only know when it will be corrected...- and so on...The major problem I see, is that now, we have an early access game not labelled as such..And like me, when you know the reactivity of Gazillion to correct the problems that matter to their players base...My advice : wait for the F2P  console version or at least 6 monthes before trying the game on PC if you don't want to be disgusted by the problems that exists actually in the game...It was a great Marvel Heroes game, it's just a painfull beta phase now...JPR out!

												For those that don't know, Marvel Heroes is an ARPG in the Diablo style. David Brevik, one of the lead devs on Diablo 1 and 2 is the President of the company and was involved in the games development. For whatever reason, I find MH to have more of the old skool D1-D2 playstyle than D3 does. D3 didn't hook me but MH did. The game features some rudimentary MMO style additions to the genre and many have dubbed it an MMOARPG. These features are pretty simplistic compared to a game like WoW but they do add a little something out of the norm for ARPGs.The game had a really rocky start. I initially played it for a few weeks and quit once completing the story through. I picked it up again about six months later and there have been numerous changes to the game. New gameplay modes have been added aside from the regular story mode. There are group modes currently for 2 or 5 players that you can queue to run, as well as standalone maps that can be played through at any level. They also fundamentally changed the way you can unlock new characters. Previously heroes had to be either bought for cash or you had to get lucky with a random (very rare) drop for a new hero. Now you are guaranteed to get eternity splinter drops which can be used to unlock new heroes. They don't come all that quickly though, so it will take awhile to unlock all of the heroes if you choose not to invest any cash in the game.In a way this game is a little like Diablo meets Pokemon. Half the fun is in collecting the different heroes and leveling them. It is very ""alt-centric"".  There is a syngery system in the game that grants bonuses based on how many heroes you have at level cap as well as levels 25 and 50. This means that over time you will get substantial bonuses to XP earned as well as your heroes abilities. This makes leveling multiple characters get easy over time and can become quite addictive.The game has weekly patches that usually involve some sort of server wide event. Some of these are great and some are a little underwhelming but it's nice that there is always something new going on. Content keeps being added and 10 man raids are coming soon. Caveats: It's a free to play game which of course means theres a store that you can crack out on if you aren't cautious with your spending. Heroes and costumes are expensive although they frequently have bundles and special deals that reduce the cost. It's expensive vs a standalone game but less so than a monthly MMO unless you go super nuts. I highly recommend that if you enjoy the game, at least drop $20 or so on some upgraded bank space (known as stash). That's one of the only things that you cannot get just by playing the game and is very useful.			"

												This used to be one of my favorite games but then the lead designers all left and it was taken over by ex EA employees that had no idea what they were doing.  They screwed the game up by removing the free exchange of prestige costumes.			"

												Any Marvel fan would enjoy this game. A diablo style MMORPG where you get to use iconic Marvel heroes & villains.In-game events are based on movies/comics released, which is super cool!Developers are very active in game forums, so feel free to leave your feedback on the game or whichever character you would like to see on the roster next.

												This WAS one of the best games i have ever played! i would play it for long periods at a time then it would get a bit stale so would go play something else then a update or new hero would come out i would try it out and sometimes buy them and go at it again. Then it became really boring and i found myself buying a lot of stuff just to make the game better and it was still the same stuff!! So i quit and then this new update came out and i said why not lets see if they made any really good changes. So i downloaded it again started playing it and was like WHAT THE HELL is this garbage!!!!!!! I can not believe they made the game worse, I MEAN A LOT WORSE!! All i can say is OMG what the hell are you guys thinking over there at Gazillion Entertainment you took a game that was great (slow and boring at times) and made it a large piece of ♥♥♥♥! All the changes make no sense and you have made all of the heroes slow and weak!! I dont know what to say besides i hope the people that play this are just as angry and everyone just stops playing and or paying for anything. Please stop supporting this company that is not doing anything to help make the game better or to make it what we want to play.			"

												After the ""Biggest update ever"" the game is about as interesting as watching paint dry.  I don't regret the money I sunk into the game in the past, but I probably won't be playing, let alone paying, in the future.  I'll give it a go again once they add in omega items, which REALLY should have been in the game with the patch, but I'm not holding my breath.  Itemisation has become completely boring and I don't expect their next tier will fix it.As it currently stands, I can't recommend this.			"

												Hmmm not a fan of the new update.. sounded good on paper but after trying it out all my toons feel slow, sluggish and just very watered down. Many of the powers I liked are gone! Those that remain have new conditions to use or timers which ruined everything I had been building towards. Equipment is totally wasted on a few of my lvl 60s. I am also irritated that they are implementing changes that essentially force people to use the cash shop. I don't mind spending money on a good game but I don't want to feel like I am being bled dry. Very unfortunate really ... I used to have a blast playing the game. My wallet and I are back to Path of Exile! "

												Marvel Heroes is an absolute blast to play! So many diverse characters to choose from (with a new one added each month!) and several different game modes to play as well. Best of all you can get all the characters for free using in game currency which is easy to collect! Players don't have to worry about being ""left behind"" either as there's a variety of content for players of every skill and character level with more to come.The game has come a long, long way since beta thanks to weekly content additions and updates from one of the hardest-working and most community interactive dev teams I've ever seen. Heck, even Gazillion's CEO streams regular play sessions of the game and gets involved with the community! The devs have a passion for Marvel and for games, shown by an amazing level of attention to detail and quality control.Speaking of which, the community in this game is one of the best bar none. So many helpful and friendly folks it's a welcome change of pace!I highly recommend the game to not just Marvel or ARPG fans, but to anyone that wants a fun and engaging MMO to play!And did I mention it's free? ;)			"

												I once loved this game.  I got hooked back in beta, and was entralled from the beginning.  It was the closest thing any of us had to an updated version of Diablo 2, and Brevik even brought his famed hidden cow levels with him.  As of this review, I have 767 hours in the game, and probably about $150 in it.  My friends and I have enjoyed it for hours on end, and I even had an entire inventory tab purchased to hold items for giving to friends who tried the game for the first time, to twink their characters a bit.Now?  I could never recommend this game to someone unless I hated that person.  Gazillion removed everything that made the game special, including Brevik, and instead have adopted all of the worst traits of a forgettable Diablo 3 clone, (which itself is a very mediocre game with a much better company behind it).  It has always been Marvel's MO to screw writers out of their rights to make a quick dollar (Google ""marvel comics screws writers""), so maybe that's what happened here, and Gazillion rolled over because they just didn't know better before making a deal with the devil.  Or maybe Gaz is taking Marvel's name through the dirt in some elaborate revenge plot by Jack Kirby, I don't know.If you hate yourself, and want to see slow, pathetic parodies of your favorite Marvel heroes characters, then sure, get a spoon and start digging into this pile of ♥♥♥♥.  If you don't desperately need mental health services, and if you're looking for a proper game similar to Diablo 2, Path of Exile is worth a look.			"

												This game was a brilliant game designed by a man who not only helped invent the genre of ARPGs but stood strong in continuing to design great games. David you are sorely missed, but this update explains why you left.The game is now simply terrible. It is a shallow husk of what it used to be. It went from a great game where you could make meaningful decisions about character building to a blizzard-esque d3 design. Choices are meaningless. There is no depth of choice or spec. Everything has cooldowns on it for no good reason. They even just ripped off WoW crappy talent design, the one that made gamers leave WoW.This clearly just a cash grab trying to get the money off of the 11-teen year olds and soccer moms blizzard caters to.Shameful Gaz, shameful.

												When I first played this game, I was like, ""Sweet! It's a Diablo-style Marvel game! Awesomeness!"" Being a fan of both, I started devoting several hours to the game almost every day (and have since sunk over 500 hours into it). Then they started making changes...The first big changes I noticed were the removal of difficulty settings (which I'm glad they've now changed back) and that costumes stopped dropping. The difficulty was permanently set to ""stupidly easy"" everywhere except level 60-only areas, so I needed to mindlessly grind to level 60 before anything was even remotely challenging. I say mindlessly because I'd have to actively try to die to even fall below 75% health. I could literally sit still and have my team-up do all the work. Then, I'd open up the level 60 areas, some of which had the difficulty sharply increase to ""frustratingly difficult not to die every 5 seconds"".I'm not sure if costumes were always an ultra rare drop, but before that update, I had two or three just from drops, and never did once after that. I read somewhere it was something ridiculous like a 0.2% chance from cosmic bosses if you max out special item find, or whatever. At any rate, I get that it's incentive to fork over cash to just straight-up buy them, which is fine. However, I've read that they've since reinforced their ""Give us money!"" incentive by making costumes even harder to get in-game, which, is that really necessary? I feel like more than enough people were paying players, so that's just ridiculous. Maybe I'm wrong?Then, there was ""the big update"". Lots of hate went around. I liked the return of difficulties and grew to somewhat like the simplicity of the new power trees and infinity system, so I kept playing. My big problem with the game, and what makes me ""screw this game, I quit"" level of angry after putting over 500 hours of my life into it is that they're even more strongly sticking it to casual free-to-play players (like me) by making things you used to be able to acquire with in-game currency entirely impossible to get without paying real-life money. I saved eternity splinters specifically to acquire a certain handful of team-ups (I wasn't in a hurry, since I had other ones to level up in the meantime, so I was saving to buy them all at once). I logged in today to find that I cannot. They're just not available anymore, apparently. I'm so angry about this, so, screw this game, I quit.			"

												Worst mmo I ever played, played for 81 minutes and it was more than enough to understand how crappy it is. you get tons of people right at the start of your game (after the tutorial ofc) so you can't see squat what you are doing , you don't get system feedback on what you loot or how much, the tutorial it self lacking a lot, the explanation bubbles have a cooldown ( no hope for slow readers), no explantion on what are the skills, styles, etc. most mmos have standards and this game lacks a lot of them. usually in a mmo game you get to choose your first character, here you can't. you have to pay some currency to unlock your very first hero. where is the freedom here for newbies? I get it that you get to unlock all the heroes eventually, but you have to have the freedom to choose your first hero your self (even it is from a limited list) FOR FREE!!! and not buying with currency (whether is in-game or real money) to unlock them. also the game doesn't start with an options menu, which right at the begining starts WAY too loud, and with the wrong resolution (check with other people as well). A Major Disapointment!			"

												Not at all happy with these changes. It was good, why do this massive and unwanted overhaul? I've heard tale it's prep for a console port, but why change a core mechanic for it? I'm going to keep playing for now, see if there's a light at the end of this tunnel. But so far it's just long and dark with no end in sight....Update: there were TONS of post patch bugs that literally stopped people from progressing, my friend and I basically had to leave it alone for a few days until they sorted their ♥♥♥♥ out.Update 2: Having gotten over how they ♥♥♥♥ on several of my characters and builds, it's ok, but just ok. It's literally Diablo 3 with marvel heroes now, and like Diablo 3, once I've played all my characters and seen what they can do, I'll probably get bored cause all that's left is tons of overly tedious grinding.

												My playtime is all over the last week, making me a new player so my point of view  will be a bit different from many other players.I quite enjoyed the game before the update, I was having fun,  I got Deadpool to max level, and was having fun doing random stuff to gear up.Then the update came and my fun disappeared.I had managed to scrape together 2500-ish damage on my character, when the update dropped so did my damage. To about half of what I had the day before. Now I have trouble dealing with basic content I was clearing with ease the day before.When the server went down for the patch I looked up the sorry excuse for patch notes and immediately thought they were turning the game into something more akin to Diablo.Which I most certainly didn't want, why would you want to make your game like Diablo, a game that is relevant for 3 days whenever a new season starts when you could just have a fun game?I'm not sure I'll be continuing to play this game, not  the way it is, I'm sure the developers will try to convince their playerbase that the patch is still a ""work in progress"" which is devspeak for ""Lol we messed up look at us try to put out the fires lol.""Oh well, plenty of other games out there, and surely some of them must have developers that aren't absolute morons.

												I was actually really excited about the Biggest Update Ever, after my friend told me about it. Mind you, I didn't even know about it, so I did not know about the testing they did or feedback user's have given. But when I tried it out the first time, I was honestly disappointed. It feels like they took a step backwards instead of forward, again, that is what I feel and is my opinion. I did not spend as many hours as quite a few people, but I played quite a lot of the game and enjoyed it most of the time. I gave this update a few tries, but after feeling really bored trying out all of my heroes, I have not had a second thought about launching the game. I will wait until the Omega items are released, which I do not know why it was not released with such a big update already, but anyhow, I am not someone who knows what decisions some companies make. It isn't even just the movement change that really bothered me, that is something I could get used to, but it just isn't fun anymore. I don't have any 'goal' to reach for any of my heroes I play. I tried re-gearing some of my heroes, but after doing so many times and trying out different variations, I just had to stop and really think ""What do I do after this?""Again, I am not someone who put hundreds of hours into the game, but I played a decent amount and was not done with end game content before this update and was anticipating it once I found out about it. My review may change depending on what content is released in the near future hopefully, but for now, it will remain on the negative side. If there are new players, do not take the review as ""This game sucks"", please do try it if you have any interest in it, as it may be fun for you.			"

												I played a decent amount of hours in this game, because for the first hours it's rather funny, and then you continue just hoping to discover more in depth dynamics and content. But just no, in the end you realize that this game has really no depth at all.You level up to 60 your toon and then it's just grinding, and grinding, and grinding again and... did I mention grinding?The missions are really all dumb and repetitive after the end of the campaign (the campaign is not great but at least it's ok). Then you are hit by the lack of fantasy, lack of challenge, lack of meaningful skills, lack of articulated and immersive stories. The only challenge of the missions is the material difficulty to beat enemies that are above your level. But you only have to grind more for that. The most difficult thing about missions is to understand how the mission tracker works (and you end up discovering that often it simply doesn't work as it should).BTW, also the social part is very poorly implemented. And be careful to what you say in the game chat. Mods are really trigger happy in banning people without advice.PRO:- Marvel superheroes fans could like this, because the graphics are nice, although poorly optimized (but even a lot of hardcore fans will get bored soon by the lack of content).CONS:- Plagued by servers lag and bugs.- Heroes are not well balanced, some are OPs, some are just bad.- Missions are really repetitive and boring.- When you hit the level 60 cap, the game fun basically ends, because it all gets confusing and repetitive, and you have no more a clear feeling of the character's progression.- The social part is severely lacking. The chat is very basic and confusing. Chat moderators are trigger happy with bans.VOTE: 5/10 (could be a 6/10 or a bit more if they would release more endgame content and italian language)                                   -----------------------------------VOTE UPDATE: 4/10 after the january 2017 patchThey eliminated the only thing that made the game still interesting after leveling up your toon to 60, the Omega system. The infinity system is just a streamlined way of making you grind a lot more hours (or to make you pay to win) to acquire few points, and then not allowing you to chose where to spend your hard earned infinity points.Also, all the toons movement powers have been nerfed down to the level of unplayability, and all the powers unlock  automatically based on your level, so goodbye to custom characters builds.

												What used to be an amazing game was ruined with recent update that took evertyhing fun and interesting out in order to dumb down for an apparent eventual console launch.  It feels like a desperate hail Mary that shows that the developers do not care one iota for the people who have supported them since before launch.The Marvel brand might retain a few of the die-hard players, but most of the once-loyal folks have been chased off in droves.

												So far i been playing quitealot but without steam client which is happened because steam gets buggy cant load  stuff and sometime cant even start the damn game so damn you steam :PGazilion team is really dont disappoint anyone  they making new heroes  almost every month  reamking ""old"" ones the last one was Deadpool if anybody know deadpool we all know he is the awesomeness :D  probably when the movie out we geting some new skin for him too the latest addition Black cat to the  roster is well liked by the comunity wich kinda suprising  since most off the heroes  always had some ppl who didnt like them  some got changes reviewing etc and gazilion really makes it so you can actualy like what u are doing  i know  sometimes u have to grind or find a supergroup to do raids but 80% time the ppl are helpfull 20 is when ppl dont see it or to busy with their own ""fight"" but no one can blame them the  game graphically not the best  and its not like we expect it to be  most ppl are playing because of the so many fun heroes you can have.Personaly my Favourites are : Dr Doom i dont think i need explanation for him he pretty strong with all kind of setups sumoner or energy (didnt try melee because its not my thingy when a hero can be ranged ) , Wolverine / X-23 : im fan of the ""wolverine"" character so no mater who what say he and she is awesome and really fun to play for me at least, Vision after i saw the age of ultron i imediately had to get my hands on him i really like his skillset and his powers some are flashy some are not but still strong even though u can  mind control a machine with it for me he is more fun than emma frost maybe just me but i dont really  like her skillset for somereasonScarlet Witch: was my first  hero i choose and she was quite strong for me before the review and she feels a bit stronger than before or maybe of the synergies i dont know but i like her the rest i really liked : magneto,juggernaut,ant-man ,star-lord,rogue,psylocke, ghost rider,deadpool,Doctor strangeOverall anybody who lakes marvel universe this is  a game that must be tried out and have lots of fun (this only personal opinion of the game)Thank you for reading			"

												As a 3k hour vet of the game I have to say the latest patch pretty much ruined the high end of the game.  While it is a fantastic patch for new users anyone that wants to take the game to a min max level just bail now.  I have been with the game since closed beta and this is the biggest kick to the face of all.  The new patch simplified the heores in the game but did nothing to the mobs.  It's a gaz cash grab and prep for console nothing more.  shame! (ding ding) shame! (ding) shame (ding ding) etc.			"

												With over 2700 steam hours in this game and close to 500 hours on standard client (without steam) i can say the game is in a very difficult place now.  The movement nerf to all heroes as changed this from an Action RPG to just a Drama RPG.  Its much slower, infinity system for end game is very bland.  I wanted to give this a chance but the dynamic freedom of omega system was apparently too much (and too expensive) for devs to handle.  They had such a great dream.  They continued to win so many awards.  Now it's a bland version of what it used to be.  I can't recommend this game in the current state.			"

												- Revamped Infinity System is a joke. The conversion from Omegas to IP is not worth the time invested of veteran players.- Character damage nerfed to the ground, fighting feels dragged out for way too long.- Movement change makes gameplay 10x slower.- Bugged quest (Taskmaster) preventing new players from advancing in the story.- 'Biggest' patch but no actual new content added, ie. Raids. Only modified skills/items and visual updates to some characters.Overall disappointing experience from playing the new patch. Would not recommend at its current state.			"

												I'm a long time hack'n slash, ARPG player. Yes I was playing Diablo 1 when it went out, and of course Diablo 2 and the 3rd.I tried also plenty of other ARPG, Van Helsing, Grim Dawn, Path of Exile. I like them all, as all of them bring something different.But then I discovered Marvel Heroes ! I don't consider myself a fan of Marvel universe at all. But the game is fun, good, as you can switch to heroes easily, you can unlock heroes just farming ingame currency, although supporting this great game is also cool.I made several videos of Marvel to introduce the game, and help people have a real good overview.

												I've played for a year so I can give you my honest opinion:This game could be better. It's Diablo MMO style but in marvel universe. People complain about the fact you can't create your own character and you have to use the standard marvel heroes and you will find thousands of ironmans flying arround. But actually this is not the main problem in this game.I really don't mind to be forced play with the marvel characters and have to look same heroes everywhere. The REAL FACT of why I don't recomend this game is: Pay to Achieve/Unlock, but definitely not P2W.You will start with one of ""starter"" heroes that, with the exception of Captain America and Punisher, aren't so popular between the fans. The most popular heroes are the most expensive and not available for starter heroes choice.The only way to unlock those heroes for free is collecting Eternity Splinters, kind of special coin droped in map when you defeat enemies. The drop rate is 10 per hour and this is a big problem, because:Most popular and cool heroes cost for free: 600 eternity splintersMedium popular heroes: 400 eternity splintersComum heroes: 200 eternity splintersIf you want to unlock Ironman for example, you will have to play for long 20 hours doing the same thing: walking arround, killing mobs and collecting stuff....IS THIS GAME PAY TO WIN?No. All heroes have a great potencial in diferent roles. All will depend of your playstyle, equipment and skill. You can buy the expensive Thor with real money or eternity splinters, but you still can be defeated by a cheap Black Widow.IS THIS GAME PAY TO FUN?YES. unless you like to play with the same heroe the entire campaign and expend weeks farming eternity splinters. I UNDERSTAND the company has to pay his taxes and this money have to come from somewhere. BUT EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME IS MADE TO MAKE YOU BUY SOMETHING, YOU DON'T ACHIEVE NOTHING BY PLAYING THE GAME ITSELF. THERE IS NO CHALLENGE, NO OBJECTIVE, NOWHERE TO GO... JUST COMPLETE THE CAMPAIGN AND BUY OUR STUFF IN STORE BECAUSE YOU KNOW, IT'S MARVEL UNIVERSE, WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE YOU ENJOY THE GAME.In other words: Spend your money or get bored.They already have the heroes and costumes market, the boosts and special services like portable crafter and power point reset. Is Eternity Splinters really necessary? The company will fall if the players could unlock the heroes spending in-game credits? The answer is no.This game still standing only because it's Marvel. The good free to play games must follow some standards:FIRST play the game and enjoy;SECOND spend some money because you really liked the game.I'll take Neverwinter as an example of a good F2P game. The game is free, but is so creative and funny that make you spend money just for love by the game and the company.Marvel heroes just make the oposite: you will hate the game first and after spending some money, you will love it, a perfect example of a bad free to play game that should be a paid game: FIRST PAY AND SECOND HAVE FUN.

												well another great PC game dies so they can launch an Xbox version.  everything dumbed down to the point where every hero is a cookie cutter with no personalisation. I have 1000+ hours on this game and now a cant even be bothered to play for 10 mins before i get fed up with it. I can only really recommend this if you love Xbox games, in whih case why are you on steam? basically they have taken Diablo 2 for the marvel Universe and turned it into Diablo3 for marvel.  Well i'm off to find something new to play.			"

												Marvel Heroes 2016.  This is a Free to Play Action RPG.  If you like Action RPGs and Marvel Comic books, then give it a try.  Players starts with 1 Marvel media character.  Everyone plays a Marvel character.  From Marvel Comics and Media universe, has a mix of 60 playable superheroes and supervillains  while fighting other classic supervillians and meeting other characters as NPCs, questgivers.  Has other heroes as fighting companions that you can add.  Devs have given out free certain characters for Marvel characters movie and tv releases. (Currently, i have 23 heroes, 7 companions, 3 bank boxes and 7 pets for FREE after 662 days of logins, have not paid any money).PROS:- Level cap is level 60.- Combat and questing is easy, and new gear falls regularly. - Game has events that increase the amount of loot dropping and buffs that do the same. - Has good graphics, voiceovers and sounds. -  Has a daily login reward system, which also gives character unlocks and shards.- You can try out all characters to level 10, but that is not long.- Certain loot ( Eternity Shards ) in game can be collected to eventually unlock another character (costs 200, 400, 600) and those shards drops regularly (1 per hour played). CONS:- There is only one story, so once you finish it with one character, you have seen the story.  - Replay value is only in grinding each hero you unlocked to level 60 and the end game grind for gear, to play harder Co-Op end game missions.  -You will run out of room in your bank, might be forced to pay money for bank space, unless you wait for bank box giveaway events. - There is no reason to team up, till you reach end cap. - Devs completely changed the gameplay after the last major Update (jan 2017), according to the recent negative reviews. Devs are changing this PC game to be a console game. 1. Quickbars have been reduced from a rotating 8 slot quickbar with 3 other sets to a Single 8 slot quickbar.  All characters have way more than 8 powers that a player will want to use.2.  Devs Nerfing or Destroying certain popular hero builds.3.  Devs making the gameplay Slower than it was before the Update.Try it, maybe you might like it.  New players might not see any problems with the game.For more info:

												So I don't know where to start.  I guess I will start with I have 1300 hours between 2 different accounts.  The first time I just got really burnt out, got rid of the account and made a new one and have played that for hundreds of hours, probably about 5-600 on the new account just until a few weeks ago, I'd say 2 weeks past the ""big update"" was the last time I played the game.  The Issues I have with this game is a lot of the same that you read from every other review, I don't do reviews but with the announcement that came with marvel Heroes Omega I figured it was time to voice my displeasure, and doing so on the forums tends to be removed or knowed down by the fan boys.The game lacks serious content, there are 3 one shot's, 2 differnet raids (green and red difficulty for one, the other only green (been probably 2-3 years since red was promised) 3 patrols where 90% of where you spend the game just killing trash mobs and the occassional bosses, a decent chunk of terminals, which last between 3-5 minuets, and then 10 chapters of a story where the company basically expects you to spend your time because that is what they want to focus on.  End game is just grinding mobs for gear, that is it, just gear collecting you can prestiege to different colors to restart your level grind, but no paragon mode, no extra difficulties, although we were told that will come eventually.The Pc version of the game is still missing a serious amount of content to satisfy and not burn out a player, yet they announced the ps4 version which is coming with half the heroes, half the content, so we will have to sit back while they play catch up.  So for the forseeable future there is no new content on the horizon, no new heroes (the past 2 heroes: Black Bolt and Nick Fury were rushed, and fury is plain awful.)Lastly this was a response in a pm I got from one of the staff regarding One-Shots ""We love them too, but due to their size and the time it takes to make new environments, it is really hard to justify the time spent on them."" I wonder what other aspects such as raids they feel the same way about and we will not get.			"

												As I write this review I cannot recommend this game right now. New content takes forever to come out and when it does, like chapter 10 for example it can be cleared in less than 20 minutes. Their tournaments for the danger room are poorly executed where as only a select amount heroes can achieve top time instead of  any hero properly geared. Heroes are highly unbalanced where some like Luke Cage who has been in the game since launch is so bad, or rogue who is over powered and doesn't get tuned properly.  Most content is just about how fast can you kill things. Despite the whole defense system rework nothing changed people don't gear more defensively and heroes like Nightcrawler are still squishy as hell.  Now they are reworking the blessing system, cause everyone uses the same blessing (Hela Blessing) From the math people have done a lot of people will still use the same one after the rework which now accomplishes nothing. They redesigned the prologue for the 3rd time now which really didn't need that instead of fixing what is in dire need of being fixed. With the omega system 90% of the nodes are not used because they are useless. Everyone picks  % damage or fighting burt or crit damage and hit, and stats like speed are useless.  New characters like Ultron are just copy and paste of other heroes mashed together. The trade community doesn't know how value of items work as it constantly fluctuates  week to week 1 minute a gok(gem of the kursed) is worth 2-4 blessing then a event happens and they go up to 15+ instead of going down due to  more currency being available. The Devs as a team have really went down hill since David Brevik and Doomsaw have left. Anytime asked about something you get the vague answer of we cant promise anything or we will look into it. Coming soon a lot of the time never comes.  Gifting people some times leads to a ban(my friend gifted a friend of his and got banned for they suspected he was working with 3rd party vendors.) Over all its not a terrible game and it has a very large cast of heroes even if more then half are either poorly done or just been ignored since release. The game from2014 to 2015  was head and shoulders in changes, but  2015 to 2016 has 0 improvement. This is IN MY OPINION of why I cannot recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Remember when you would spend countless hrs grinding in Diablo? Well, it's all here, just using your favorite, and some lesser known, Marvel Heroes! Now for a closer Diablo-esk like experience I would send ya to Path of Exile, or maybe Grim Dawn; these you will find your familiar warrior type classes. As for Marvel Heroes, you get to be a SUPER!

Good game in general, frustrating froma low-level (read: high-detail) perspective when you actually look at how balance is done. How the fug does a single-target character like Wolverine do less damage than a ranged AoE character like Storm? Things like that pile up. Still a good timewaster though.			"

												Dear lord, what a mess. I came across this while looking for Marvel games, and decided to give it a shot. Trying new heroes sounds good until you realize it takes years to grind for the stuff needed to get a random hero... or you can pay for it. Costumes from Age Of Apocalypse and House of M sounds cool until you realize it takes years to grind for the materials for a random costume... or you can pay for it. See, it's ♥♥♥♥ing pay to play. Going the TF2 or CS:GO or Payday 2 or whatever route you want to mention may look good now, but you get a reputation of being a greedy pig looking for the dollar. It's such a shame it had to be this game, but what can you expect at this day and age? Disgusting. ♥♥♥♥ing disgusting.			"

They have gutted this game.My playtime is not reflected on steam, I have well over 3000 hours in this game since it came out. I update it outside of steam however due to issues with the steam update.This game is undergoing a half ♥♥♥♥♥ port for console and as a result they are basically copy and pasting systems from D3 into the game (i'm not sure how there isn't a lawsuit in the works really, paragon system the torment level slider etc). They have removed everything that contained the flavor of the original game including the movement. Imposing ramp up times on movement powers, timers, restricting teleport ranges and adding counters to limit how often you can use them. Now instead of feeling like a super hero you feel like an invalid. The basis for endgame progression, uniques and omega points are now gone converted at pennies for dollars to a paragon system like d3 where the points you had control over are now divied up between 5 nodes. I had 10k omega points and could feel the effect of every one I allovated. The new system gives me 170 in each node and I honestly can't tell the difference if I forget to alloccate them or not. The original Devs are gone and along with them all the good will from their playerbase, visit their forums and reddit and you will see an overwelming groundsurge of protest against what they are doing. Not only don't they care, they have been banning people for dissention and closing threads left and right censoring any and all posts that fly in the face of their new world order. Not only will I never play this piece of garbage again but if Gaz ever developes another game I will avoid it like it's poison.			"

												So hard to stay interested in this game.  I mean, it's all Marvel heroes and villains so I should be ecstatic, but the gameplay is so monotonous and not at all engaging.  I suppose when you fight the mobs you're supposed to feel super-OP, because you're a super hero and they're just goons.  Wasting wave after wave with barely any effort does not keep me engaged at all.Maybe I'm comparing it to City of Heroes too much, but IMO that was the greatest superhero MMO ever.			"

												Although I cannot recommend this game to people at the moment, the changes made in the last few days are not what is killing the game for me. I feel that many of the recent negative reviews are targeting the wrong aspects of the game. While the concerns are somwhat justified, many criticisms are half-truths. So many people are not explaining why these specific changes are an issue for the game as it has been for the last year. I played this game during beta and early release, left, and then came back to it in 2015.  While the movement changes certainly have negatively affected the speed of most heroes, it makes sense that heroes such a Hawkeye, Cap, Taskmaster, Iron Man, etc aren't just zipping around the map with their dashes. Did it honestly make sense that Iron Man or Warmachine would just dash around a map instead of flying? It does suck not being able to move across the map as quickly with some people, but one of the reasons that map movement was so crucial is because few mobs in this game are actually worth killing. Minions and other small mobs simply do not offer the player anything. It is not worth killing anything that isn't a boss because they will simply drop nothing for a player. I have never seen this in any other arpg and it has been this way since I came back to this game in 2015. After leveling, bosses are pretty much the only things that will drop significant enough xp or items. You needed the movement to get to the boss as soon as possible and then kill the boss for your very small chance at loot. Sure, smaller mobs in other arpgs usually don't drop anything, but in Marvel Heroes, the only thing worth killing is a boss unless the game forces you to kill them in order to progess. A change to the way non-boss mobs contribute or provide xp or loot would make it feel worthwhile to stick around and actually kill them, thus reducing the need to constantly be moving to the next objective as quickly as possible. Another change that people have criticized is the damage done to build and item diversity. While I feel that concerns are valid, my opinion on these matters is probably different a great deal of the community. Let's take hero builds and the removal of ability points for example. Ability points were an interesting mechanic, and are something that is not present in many current arpgs these days. It is sad to see it go, but they didn't povide as much build diversity as you might think. For the past year and a half, most heroes have had somewhat predetermined builds.  When I came back to ths game, Punisher had just recently been reworked and the game was already showing signs that build choice would come down to talents. Punisher was given two diverging passive traits that augmented different powers. You could not pick both, you had to pick one or the other and maxed your powers based on these choices. I don't know if this trend was started earlier, but I feel that power choice has been somewhat limited for a long time. If you were min-maxing, chances are that the hero you were playing had a few trait determined builds, and you maxed the most efficient powers for that build. Most of the time, it was not hard to figure out what was worth maxing and putting on your bar. A lot of the slots were pretty set in stone as well. You maxed your sig, your offensive passve, and possibly your defensive passive(41-61 points). You left travel powers and dashes at one point, and then you went from there. The biggest change with the talent system is that it only allows you to use up to 1 bar. While this doesn't hurt most people, it does a select few who could utilize more than one bar. Heroes such as Rogue, Dr. Strange, and Iron Fist were able to utilize more than one bar, and this made for some very interesting game play. Now, those builds are gone, and it does hurt their gameplay for some people. In addition to this, it still feels like hero balance is way off. I have not had enough time to test most of the heroes, but I have seen drastic performance rates in those that I have played in the new cosmic content areas. If you don't have someone who can either tank up the damage, or dodge abilities, cosmic areas have too much hp and just one shot you. I've found a few exceptions, but some of the heroes that I've geared significantly can't do it easily. As far as gearing goes, let's not kid ourselves, guys. Gearing in the last year or so has pretty much been: Fragment, skrull hammer, crossbones rifle, hero unique slot 1; x-men, darkhawk, sinister, or hero unique slot 2; coat of skull, monarch cloak, hero unique slot 3; batroc's, skrull uniform, or hero unique slot 4; mask of goat, djinn, octobot controller, or possibly hero unqiue slot 5. Unique item choice was not really unique. There was a ton of gear that used to be okay, but was rendered garbage by newer hero uniques. Many any hero uniques were just straight up vendor trash. They served no purpose other than being traded in for credits or runes. Invuln cores were absolutely necessary. Artifact choice had some diversity, but you had specific sets for phys, energy, multi damage, or summoner. There was also the issue where fighting was the one stat that everyone stacked. Fighting was #1 on pets, most omega points, and even some artifacts. I don't think the update hurt artifact or unique diversity at all. My biggest gripe with the update is probably the Infinity system. While it does have some choice, it is nowhere near as indepth as the previous omega system. I also still do not like the fact that it is ""infinite"". It just reminds of Diablo's paragon system, and the paragon system has so many issues. Stacking stats endlessly is not something I agree with. Sure, there is slightly more diversity here, but it's not enough, and you will eventually end up taking everything anyway. It either needs more nodes, or a limit on how many points you can invest into each category. If the game continues as it is, this is going to be a huge nightmare for end game balancing. This leads me to what I believe have been the biggest issue that this game has had over the last year or so. The endgame and general gameplay have so many issues. When I joined, I was excited about the aspect of raids in this game, and red raid and green axis were somewhat tough at first. They got so much easier as time progressed and better items and heroes came out. It didn't help that no harder raid content ever came out. Gaz initially promised red axis and more raids, but those were thrown out in favor of more public zones and event areas. There is no reason to party with your friends outside of raids, because the only objective of terminals is to rush to the boss and kill him within one rotation. Even public zones don't really require a party outside of completing daily objectives because there are either too many people, or you could just solo the boss. As I've said before, there's no reason to kill non-boss mobs because they just don't drop anything worth picking up 99% of the time. There are so many outdated game modes that just don't offer too many rewards at the time. Even a public zone like industry city, which was new when I came back to the game, is not worth going into because it just doesn't offer much compared to midtown or hightown. Outside of somewhat rare danger room competitions or events, there just isn't much reason to switch up builds or play different heroes. It's been a long time since anything in this game has required you to party up with friends and fight something difficult. Oh well, I've ranted enough. Testing out new builds and combinations is fun for now, but the game has a long way to go before it's going to grab my attention for any significant amount of time again. If anyone actually managed to drag themselves through this wall of text, thanks for listening to my rant about how a game I loved has slowly been dyiing for over a year. This update is just disappointing and fixes few things.			"

												I've put about a billion hours into this game in the last two or three weeks because it's scratching an itch that had begun festering after I got sick of Diablo 2 and never really reached. Path of Exile was too muddy and I'm not playing a god damn all-passives sphere grid like some degenerate Final Fantasy clone. Torchlight 2 is fun but it's more a game of mods than a game of game. Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is fun but makes my tower fan scream and weep because it is full of bad optimization ghosts. Marvel Heroes is a free-to-play Diablo-like that feels less free-to-play than Diablo 3. The character choices are fun and wildly varied. The Punisher threatens to shoot Spider-Man if you idle next to him in base. Emma Frost passive-aggressively snipes at everyone.It is an enjoyable game, for me, a huge nerd.			"

												ENGNo new characters, but there is a meaningless ""biggest update"" makes the game worse.Initially, there was a good idea not to nerf the characters, but make the new OP, then slightly loosen them, then pull the remaining heroes by patches, it is motivated to take the new characters, the play was fun. Now, for the sake of balance lost all fan.And who then need this balance, is that hardcore MMO?The main game developers moved on to other projects, more probably be a last attempt to extort more money. RIPRUS.Новых героев нет, зато есть бессмысленный ""самый большой апдейт"" делающий игру только хуже.Изначально тут была удачная идея не нерфить персонажи, а делать ОП новых, потом немного ослаблять их, далее патчами подтягивать остальных, это мотивировало брать новых героев, играть было весело и фаново. Теперь же в угоду балансу на фан игроков положили.А кому тут нужен баланс, это что, харкор ММО? Основные разработчики игры перешли в другие проекты, дальше видимо будут лишь попытки напоследок выкачать побольше денег. RIP			"

												A great concept brought into the Marvel Universe. It's like a cross between World of Warcraft & Marvel: Future Fight (Mobile Game). I'm glad they chose to include heroes from both the X-Men universe, Avengers universe, Fantastic4 universe and lastly other heroes that you might not know even existed unless you read Marvel comics. It had a really great cinematic introduction at the start, like all other games do, but afterwards the rest of the storyline are being told like you're reading a comic book with audio, which is a really unique take into a game that has a storyline. This is, also most likely the first game I've seen so far that is MMO + a storyline behind it. However, the game can be further improved if even more heroes are added, and I'm really happy about the ""choose any hero to play until lv 10"". But, I'm really disappointed with the fps issue that I'm receiving from a game like this, and I have to play on Medium quality or lower, but sometimes I still get choppy frames. Of course the game runs smoothly, but there are times when it lags out or freezes especially when you're at a Hub, due to the high traffic. Also, I hope a more opened-world can be added, as the game feels like a board game, and also if we could rotate our camera, as when I zoom in to my character to make it more realistic, I can hardly see where I am going.Overall, a really good game, and it has improved a lot since it officially first came out, as I did came across this game when it first came out, but had many doubts on it and saw many bad reviews on it. I'll edit the review as I progress throughout the game, and hopefully some of the common bugs commented by other players can be fixed in a upcoming update(s) soon. I'm rating it 8/10P.S. use deadpool because he is OP			"

												Marvel Heroes has a bad reputation due to it's launch and beta, but I can assure you, it's well worth trying out if you're a fan of ARPGs. The game is well developed, Gazillion has by far the most fan interaction on their forums of any game company I've ever seen. They do weekly patches that include bug fixes, holiday events, etc. Monthy large patches, usually with a new hero and other various content. Must play for ARPG and Marvel fans. It's incredibly fun, vastly underrated, and littered with content. Try it out!February 6th, 2016 mini update: The game continues to improve somehow, I always end up coming back to it eventually.

The short version: Fun MMO/ARPG/Loot Dropper (Diablo, Torchlight, Sacred, Path of Exile, etc) game with a Marvel skin that's free to play (F2P) and pay to look good. Fun and pretty good about in game purchases.In DetailAt this point, I've played two characters (Cable & Dr. Strange) fairly extensively but not to max level and some of the others up to the level 10 cap. You can of course pay (either real money or time gated in game currency) to uncap other characters and it seems worthwhile to do so (the slow free option does anyway) since every character I've played has felt different from the others even if they function the same way. There also isn't the overused tank, dps, support character type mechanic which for me is a plus (though some characters are definitely tankier than others).Being F2P, there are of course some things that you can't get (or are very unlikely to get) without paying real money. Unlike many games with this monetization scheme, it doesn't really bother me as most of what's on offer is cosmetic or a variation on something you can get through other means and isn't pushed too hard (at least so far).The gameplay itself is repetitive but fun. You'll take on hordes of enemies, most of which will die from a single shot if you're playing an area at level, with a few tougher ones thrown in for something to use your powers on besides a boss. Difficulty varies depending on the character as some are significantly less durable than others, but this generally fits the character as expected and as long as you can keep an eye on your health while fighting actually dying is a rarity.On the whole, I'd recomend it as an F2P title since it doesn't have any ""pay to win"" mechanics that I've seen (yet) and is fun to play, especially with friends.I'll probably update this review when/if I reach Lvl 60 and see what the end game is like.

												This is a great game in my opinion. Everything can be unlocked in time without the need to pay. A very long time, i'll add but in time. It can get a little repetitive if you're grinding levels, but even that can be fun as well. Overall I recommend this game. A very fun portal to the realm of Marvel comics, and includes many of the most popular heroes and villains. Definitely room for more characters, but they remedy this with occasional character releases. All in all, a very fun and thrilling game with a high replay value made better by it's price. Definitely worth a shot.			"

												TL;DRFun Factor: 6/10 (for the first few hours)Gameplay: 7/10 (for the first few hours)Overall: 3/10 (After the first few hours)For anyone whom has never played the game before and is thinking about trying it out:CONS:- I'm 16 hours into the game and managed to go from level 1 to 60. And it got really boring getting there.- The game doesn't really teach you how to play it...? So you're just kind of overwhelmed the whole time.- There are not a whole lot of guides online for this game so you're kind of on your own. The ones I did find were apparently outdated and didn't even show the right information (such as the skill trees, talents, etc).- It's fun just to play the game off and on. You'll find it to be extremely repetitive and a lot of the side quests are not very informative on what you should do. It's like the game is missing map markers for those quests or something.- Some heroes are extremely underpowered compared to others. I got lucky when I chose Iron Man.- Expect to pay at least $20 USD to unlock a hero and level it past level 10 unless you farm for a week to get the ingame currency to unlock the hero yourself.- The huge number of different stats take a long time to sort of understand and getting an idea of what your hero needs to be stacking stats-wise is pretty much impossible unless you read A LOT online.- Fighting becomes extremely cookie-cutter by the time you reach level 20. After that you're just hitting the same buttons in the same order for every single fight...- 99% of the time I played with chat completely disabled because I saw that everything being said was total cancer. I guess that goes for most games. Out of those 16 hours I said a total of 2 words and that was ""You're welcome."" after helping someone.PROS:- Somewhat addicting for the first few hours as you explore the different heroes.- Fighting is fun and unique at first.- It's cool to fight the various villans and blow stuff up. It gets old, but it's fun at first.- Definitely play with the game sounds on, the voice lines from other heroes as yourun past them are pretty funny.And that's all I've got for PROS.

												This game is a blast!  I played at launch and wasn't too impressed.  However, since then they have made many improvements and added a ton of heroes.  I will list the PROS and CONS from my experience so far:PROS* Plays great on even lower end hardware* Graphics are surprisingly good.  The character models aren't amazing, but the spell/power effects and such are a lot of fun to look at.* Combat is fun and fast-paced.  Some issues will be listed in CONS.* Hero build diversity is the cornerstone to this game IMHO.  Each hero is its own distinct class.  How many ARPGs out there have so many classes??  And they're from the Marvel universe to boot!* Story is comic-style and pretty fun.  It isn't really required for more playthroughs, but fun the first time.* MOST content is obtainable via ingame currency.  You can earn heroes and most good stuff if you play enough and play smart.  There is something here for casual and hardcore min/maxers alike.* Heroes can be played for free to level 10.  Then you can pick 1 for a free unlock.  So much better than it was earlier in the game's lifespan.CONS* It can be a little overwhelming and complex for new players.  I suggest checking Youtube for new players, especially those new to the ARPG genre.  Wilfred Wong is my favorite presenter on there as he explains things well, while still having some endgame knowledge for those looking to optimize.  Don't look to him for min-max, but he's a very nice guy and worth a look for beginner/intermediate players.* Inventory is insane.  You need to really understand what is and isn't worth keeping, which will take time.  If you have a large roster of heroes, it is EXTREMELY difficult to avoid having to buy space from Gazillion.  But, the game is free, so I personally don't mind paying for something, it's fun afterall.* Like any MMO-style ARPG, open world content can be a little nuts.  It's usually a zerg race to bosses/quest targets, as better geared players can melt down just about anything in a couple seconds or so.  But respawn isn't terrible and you can get what you need if you watch the map.TLDR: It's a fun game for Marvel fans and ARPG fans alike.  I say give it a little time if you feel overwhelmed with it all.  Check the Youtube I mentioned and hope you have fun!!!			"

												I've played this game since Beta, I had overall 3000 hours playing it. That pretty much sums up what I think about it. Constant updates, great new content every month, and a super cool and awesome community and Devs.If you love comics, and you are looking for a great mmoarpg this one is for you. And you don't have to pay a penny if you don't want. That makes it better than DC Universe Online by a distance.			"

												This is out soon and I've long been a Beta Tester.  It's come a long way from the game I first saw, and with it being free there's no reason not to pick it up and give it a shot.  It's probably the most free free to play game there is with 99% of all pay items being cosmetic and obtainable through play.			"

												There are plenty, more verbose, reviews. However, I cant recommend this game now.Too many changes all at once guys, I really dont like what this game has become. I know I dont have thousands of hours like some here, but I've invested time and money like everyone else, and the recent update was so radical it's just completely changed the feel of the game overall. I dont see why the change was so needed - who exactly are you competing with? This MMO was at the top of it's game and such drastic changes have alienated a lot of the regular long term players, and I cant see how any of the changes will lure new players to the game.All in all, confused, and saddened at what this game has become.To those who enjoy what's currently going on, more power to you, but I for one cant abide it.Peace.

												Although I don't have many hours, even I can tell how handicapped and crappy my Heroes are with the new update.  I'm glad I was too busy a week ago to finally sit down and do some real playing.  I'd already thrown some money at this game in the past for a couple heroes and was about to give them some more money, but decided to hold off and now I am glad I did.      The developers adopted all the negative aspects in their improvements a few other MMO's have added in their own games (FtP and Monthly subs) in the past the made me leave those as well.  Now I can, in good conscience, un-install the game and not worry about the large patch downloads anymore.			"

												I am not a fan of this genre. That is why I was so totally surprised when I really enjoyed this game. It's a blast! The heroes are really what makes this game shine. They all have their own attitudes and the writers do a good job of making their lines fit each of the heroes. A lot of the heroes play similarly to each other but they have enough of their own flavor to stand on their own. This game has a wonderful cash shop. The whole game is playable for free and you can earn currency to purchase heroes. This is a game I have been willing to put money into because the cash shop is so fair. It boils down to buffs, costumes, and heroes if you don't want to wait to get the ones you want. Gazillion has done a great job of introducing heroes with incredible frequency and even heroes that a lot of people feel are underpowered are still totally viable for leveling if they are a character that you feel strongly about. You can't go wrong trying this game out.			"

MH2015 has no EU server.This game is terrible for me, I want to like it, I want to play it and I think thats why i'm so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off it's failing to deliver.why is it so bad?100+ms latency.thats it, that one problem completely ruins my experience with this game, it doesn't become aparent how bad it is till you play a character that isn't meant to take hits and get to about 30+ in level.I like the game but I can't play it in it's current state, my average ping is 120ms, thats atrocious for this kind of game where you need to react fast so If you are reading this and are in the EU, please skip, it's painful.(now i've seen on the forum's that some people think this is a non-issue. Go on industry city patrol, fight a few bosses and tell me you arn't getting hit by things you shouldn't be)Other than that it's great, so if you are from the us and want to know more about the game look at some other reviews for what endgame is like, the massive stock of heroes makes the game really interesting to me and I would love to experiment with them all.

												Being a very very very picky gamer, I actually love this game. I used to play Dream of Mirror Online. I like anime/cartoon style games and this satisfies my taste fully. I'm especially a Marvel fan, growing up with every action figure known to exist and collecting comics and really love that this game brings heroes and villains that I haven't seen in years to life!! It may sound uber geek, but when I first fought Mr. Sinister, I think I may have yelped like, ""oh snap, I had him as a toy when I was a kid!"" Now next to nostalgic reasons for playing this game, I'll list below the reasons why I actually love the gameplay and content.This game doesn't have a really tough grind to level up to 60 scale. It's fairly easy but fun in the process as you learn so many mechanics that are built into the game. From designing the build that best suits the skills you like to use, to hunting for unique items and skill combinations that work best. It's a great game. As far as content is concerned, there has been a weekly event each week I've played so far and the release of new Heroes and Teamup Heroes. The devs at Gazillion are putting forth effort to revise characters that may need a review suggested by players of the game from what I can tell. It's very well balanced and has many different angles to play the game which keeps it fresh.The characters in the game are many, which is great and once you level up to 60 you can Prestige your character up to Prestige 6. The more heroes you bring up to 60 the bigger experience bonuses you get to help level other heroes you get. It's not a pay to win game as anything in the game can be purchased by playing the game and saving up. I willingly purchased inventory space and a costume because I found one of my favorite characters to play with, Dr. Strange!!All in all, I suggest giving this game a shot as the community is very helpful and fun to chat with. This is by far the best game I've played in a long time and so much to learn and do in the game, I can't seem to put it down and do homework! lol Again the community freakin' rocks!! So yea I'm not sure about other reviews and they're gripe with the game but the ones that play and are in-game love it. Try it for yourself and make your own educated decision :)			"

												First off, it's an ARPG not an MMO, so don't go thinking it's WOW with Marvel characters. Secondly, your customisation options are very limited - it's a Marvel game and they're ferociously protective of their characters' images, so apart from the preset costumes you're basically limited to cosmetic effects like glowing auras, you can't customise your characters' appearance to any real degree.In terms of gameplay, it's a pretty solid Diablo clone, the different characters all play sufficiently differently to each other to make it interesting, and you can unlock all the characters for free if you're patient enough. There's some things you can't earn ingame - such as additional bank slots - and some like costumes which you can theoretically earn in game, but the drop rates are absolutely terrible. But it's just cosmetic and quality-of-life stuff which you need to buy, if you don't mind a bit of grinding you can unlock everything else without paying anything.Ultimately it comes down to how much of a Marvel fan you are - there are better ARPGs on the market, but none of them have such a strong brand behind them, and if you're even a casual fan of the comics, cartoon series or films, being able to play as the characters will probably be all the counragement you need. And if you're still not sure, it's competely free to play with no restrictions on what free players can access, so you may as well give it a go and see for yourself whether you like it.			"

												Marvel Heroes is the absolute average of average with nothing actually going for it, and is simply riding on the theme which is its one redeeming quality. The fact that Marvel Heroes is an MMO and a F2P one at that, heavily undermines the actual experience. The story is neither interesting nor boring – nor is it hero specific giving you little replay reasons, and you won’t ever get immersed into your character. The way they handle F2P means they want you to buy costumes – for ridiculous amounts of money, and as a result gear is absolutely boring and you’ll look like almost every other hero out there. Had Marvel Heroes not been an online F2P game, had this been an on- and offline game with a one-time purchase, I could see this being a ton more enjoyable and worth playing. Or even simply allowing you to pick from any of the super heroes on the list at the start, while pricing them all the same, would have been far more reasonable.As it stands, Marvel Heroes is boring in its combat, boring as a loot hunting game and boring as an immersive experience with an incredibly unfair microtransaction system.

												What do you get when you take the base gameplay/advancement system of diablo 2, spend another year developing end game content, and wrap it all up inside a skin of Marvel Superheroes? You get an excellent game, that's what! The game is truly free-to-play requiring nothing to be spent for anything in the game (except time played if you want to buy more heroes). Of course like any good f2p game you can optionally spend money to buy exactly what you want when you want it. No matter what though, either way you approach Marvel Heroes 2015 you are in for a treat. The only real downside to the game is the same downside to every single ARPG. I gets VERY grindy at the end. Fortunately rather than just grinding the end-game indefinitely, new heroes (classes) are released every single month. On top of that so far a handful of new game modes have been added every few months or so as well. For fans of ARPGs, and especially those looking for a f2p game that doesn't feel or play like you would expect a f2p title to feel/play, Marvel 2015 gets a VERY easy recommendation.			"

												Its a really good casual action-rpg game that I would hop on to play for fun. I don't worry about seriously gearing up to min/max etc. I don't have to. My incentive to play the game is for fun and to earn more characters to play through eternity splinters. I was in beta and the way the cash shop and Free to play system worked was terrible. It is much improved. The only thing you really need to pay for in this game is STASH Tabs for quality of gameplay purposes as well as convenience. The costumes are optional and for cosmetic purposes and the best way to obtain it is via store. I haven't bought any costumes because I find paying for STASH tabs are more productive. Leveling,Earning more characters to play, eternity splinters, and Fun, is reason enough to hop on and play from time to time. I however wouldnt play this game to a hardcore extent, its a hop on and hop off type of game.9/10 ""Great Casual A-RPG Game""2016 Review:I would edit the last part and say that I would play the game to a hardcore extent cause there are now options to do so with raids and grinding for artifacts, its a really fun time.

												After playing through the story mode and leveling my first hero up, I figured I'd post a review. I thoroughly enjoy this game. It's made by the original creators of Diablo and Diablo II so it has that feel to it, which works surprisingly well in the Marvel universe. Although a lot of the content can be paid for to unlock, you can also earn 90% of it in-game, without having to spend a dime. It's pretty well balanced, so that it doesn't take a ridiculously long time to earn something. You don't feel like your hand is being twisted to buy things with real money, which is a breath of fresh air in games like this. The graphics are above average, if you don't have a decent PC it will struggle a little bit. The gameplay is pretty much identical to Diablo and similar action RPG games. There's a lot to this game I could spend hours talking about, but overall I would definitely recommend it. After all it's free.			"

												I have more then 700 hrs spend on this game, but most of it was outside of the steam. I must say this game was always bad, but somehow fun. It always had thousand little problems (bugs, crashes, server errors,terrible lags...) but nothing to serious that could ruin the whole game or could not be fixed and still it was a very fun game plus it's set in marvel universe. With this newest update this game lost it's fun factor and all that remains is boring game with lot of problems.So is it enough for you that game has just marvel logo and nothing to show-off, or you want something more? Well for me it's a last straw.			"

												Imagine ""Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction;"" but with Marvel characters and an MMO-style gameplay.F2P to me is normally like this;""There's a catch. I have to pay millions."" - BUT!This game is nothing like that. It's very rewarding and totally free; but you're gonna have to be a sucker for grinding, loving Marvel and also if Diablo 2 was one of your favorite games back in the day, then this game is perfect.The game has a lot to offer, but it's very confusing since no one is holding your hand like in most other games. You have to learn and also adapt to the game; it won't adapt to you. Pick your free hero out of the entire roster of heroes - except the newest one, they're always locked as a ""new hero"" until the next new hero is released - once you get your favorite hero. Play. Understand. Adapt! You'll also get 400 Eternity Splinters for free after your second day login, which you can use to buy another free hero and you won't have to pay for any new ones unless you want to.It's great fun and very addicting! :)Thumbs up from me!

They patched the game with what they called the biggest update ever and ruined the game.  I won't even go into all the things that are wrong after the patch because it has been covered in all the other recent reviews.I have 160 hours into this game and many others have much more than that so they better roll this update back and reaccess because there is no way I will play or recommend the current build of the game.Steer clear until you start seeing a steady flow of recent good reviews.

												This game has problems, most of them quite boring.So let's talk about the interesting problem, immersion.In a universe where players can control the Hulk yet are still mortal, can be Iron Man or Thor yet need to walk around iron fences in their path or be Spiderman yet never have a convoluted dance sequence, there is something wrong.Having players be the big-name heroes is the main appeal of the game, but also its main problem since they must be weaker than they should be.The fact that there are thousands of Spider Men players walking around is explained by Doctor Doom breaking reality, and honestly the source material is sufficiently out there that it actually works, but Vision being knocked out by half a dozen of street thugs just breaks immersion.The solution? Pick somebody that doesn't really have super powers, which in my case was Black Widow.Suddenly things felt a lot nicer. Overcoming challenges felt more in line with the character, and beating a C-List villain after a long boss battle feels satisfying instead of weird.So, if you try out the game, do yourself a favour and pick a character that ""shouldn't"" be that strong, and you'll have a far better time.Beyond that very specific gripe it's a decent, if very, very run of the mill isometric MMORPG. There's a decent main plot, tons of barely distinguishable loot, a pile of monetization mechanics (but no ""stamina"" or avoidable revive penalty or something, so it's not quite that bad).As a free game it's worth a look, whether you stick with it is very much dependent on your resistance to tedium.

And if you have a few dollars to throw their way you are rewarded with cool perks, new costumes, and upgrades that don't leave you feeling like it is ""pay to win.""

												It's a good but short game. I played through & hit level 17 by the end, I believe it goes much higher. The PvE aspect appeals and consists of 8 chapters, but the game doesn't like you replaying these on the same character & the endgame is purely PvP arenas which I'm not into. Enjoyed playing it and learning some of the lore, but I'm not fussed on going back & replaying as a new character.			"

												Do you enjoy the loot fest of Diablo? Do you wish Torchlight 2 had a constant community to interact with ingame? Do you enjoy Path of Exile, but sometimes want an easier and less hardcore experience? Then Marvel Heroes might be your go to game this summer!Don't let reviewers shy you away from the game because a lot of its problems from last June have been fixed (mostly). The game does still have its problems and shortcomings. As of writing this they still do not have a proper trade menu, which every MMO ever has gotten right if they were made in the past decade. Characters are imbalanced but a lot of the free starter characters offer fun diverse playstyles. After completing story mode you'll be offered the ability to get another free one. Heroes are no longer random drops, but rather awarded to you for playing long periods of time. The only real thing that only money can buy is storage space.Yes this game is not as great as Dota2 or Path of Exile at the Free2Play Model, but it isn't the worst anymore. All heroes have been marked down since the original release and are (for the most part) priced fairly for the amount of time a person invests in the hero. There's also a server called Test Center that allows you to test out a character at the max level, to see if you'll enjoy the character before ever buying them. Something that was a major problem at the game's initial release. Honestly the game has come a long way since last June. However the lack of a trade system, quickly running into inventory management, no autosort option for items, weird chat UI, and lack of partying incentive during the grind from 1 to 60... really holds the game back from being a major recommendation. However if you're a fan and want to try a new Diablo style lootfest, Marvel Heroes might be worth your time.			"

												Pros+ARPG like Torchlight/PoE/Diablo+Marvel Super Heroes!+Comic lore+So many characters to choose from+You dont need to buy anything to play effectively. +Raids!+Endless wave modes like X-defense and Midtown!+SO MUCH LOOT!+Plenty of endgame content+The Developers are dedicated everyday to making this game better and always adding more content! Cons-Needs more optimization.-Sometimes there are little glitches within the story scenes, but easy to overcome.-Not enough room for items considering all the characters in the game that is free. You have to buy the extra spaces for more storage, but its not that bad of a price I guess, considering how you play.-No real punishment when your character dies. I guess that would be aimed towards the casual player vs the hardcore?-Some character balancing issues, but most often fixed. So I guess its nothing to get worried about too much. -Crafting is not the greatest, but its there. Yay for options! -Trade system needs a lot of work. Totally worth the FREE! Very good game for the Marvel fans! Gazillion has done a superb job on delivering a really good videogame. Overall, a really enjoyable experience.			"

												The game is fun but it does have its limit on the fun. Despite all the negativity it received, the Marvel Heroes 2015 plays like a different game, far fetch on how it used to be.I started off with my all time favorite one liner Rocket Racoon and had a blast pew-pewing through mobs afte mobs hunger for loots but such cycle starts to get bored fast after a certain time and you will eventually hit the wall and cry for a break before the urge of playing comes back.Unlike any other games you play, MH2015 plays near identically close to Diablo franchise and the storyline takes a couple of quick hours to be completed and the rest of your time spent on will be on Midtown Madness or any other challenges just to name a few.MH2015 can be fulfilled as a short-term entertainment but lack of the motivation to stay long as your primary game. I would still recommend the game to anyone who are interested in playing and it may not fit well in everyone's shoes.Its a free game, there isnt any harm trying. Give yourself a week of play time to see if MH2015 is for you.			"

												Boy, did they turn this game around! I played this game when it first came out, and even though it was OK, it didn't impress me that much. However, I heard TotalBiscuit recommend the current version a LOT, he basically rediscovered the game and was playing it a ton. And, well, I tried it and was hooked quickly, and the improvements made to the game ever since it was launched make it a LOT better. So, basically, this is a Diablo-type game, kinda ""Diablo in the Marvel Universe"". However, IMO, the game makes you feel much more powerful than Diablo ever does. You will run into screens absolutely filled with mobs, and then commence to blow up that screen with your powers. There is tons of loot, and inventory space can become an issue, so I recommend to set the option to auto-destroy grey and white gear. You can also level your pet by ""vacuuming"" up gear you don't need, and you wanna donate a ton of gear to level crafters for better item mods etc. Anyway... the game is SO much fun. It's not deep or anything, it's basically ""run around and blow up everything"". But gosh, you DO feel powerful. It's a blast. Each character really is different, plays differently. You have ranged guys like Cyclops or Hawkeye, each with different abilities, or you can smash enemies as Hulk or Colossus etc. It's quite impressive how they came up with that many different character-abilities and ""styles"", as they actually DO feel a lot different. Example: Both Cyclops and Iron Man can be specced for long range fighting (or melee), and they do feel different, so it's not just ""two ranged guys who just look different"".Even more off-beat chars like Ant-Man are cool, that one is a personal favorite, and so is Deadpool, who is, appropriately, totally bonkers. The game actually IS F2P. You can play for free, and when you start, you can choose ONE character to level beyond level 10 (you can play most characters to level 10 at any time). You can unlock more characters by grinding for Eternity Splinters, or buy them at the store for ingame-currency. If you are into cosmetics, you can buy several very cool or even legendary costumes for those chars (esp. Iron Man, Cyclops, Spiderman, Cap etc.). However, those are cosmetic, so this is not ""P2W"" or anything. I am not much into the endgame, so I am just having a blast running around with some of the characters I have loved since childhood, enjoying playing them a lot, regardless of which one is best for endgame or whatever. Sure, the game can be grindy, but it is very alt-friendly. Each char you level unlocks special perks (you can choose which ones you use) for your alts, and leveling speeds up the more you level your characters. You can either play the story-mode, grind the legendary quest and challenges, or simply do stuff like ""Monday Midtown Madness"", which is a rush.I am not sure whether this is the kind of game you wanna ""binge-play"". I love to play it for an hour or so each day to blow off some steam, get my mind off of things. As I said, it's not terribly deep, but terrific fun, so it's a great game to just run around and blow up thousands of mobs. And- if you are a Marvel-fan, this is like paradise.So many iconic characters and costumes (like from classic comic issues, or the Ultimate series, or the movies etc.), so many references to the comics... just amazing. If you are into Diablo-type games, give this a try. If you are into Marvel, same. If you are into both, knock yourself out, I am pretty positive you will enjoy the heck out of this. Performance is good, even though slower PCs might struggle with screens full of mobs and explosions. Loving it, and big kudos to the dev team for turning this into a much better game and putting so much fun stuff and so much Marvel-lore into this. Just... FUN!Pros:- Great variety of heroes, which all feel different- Lots of Marvel lore- Nice visual style- Actual F2P. You have to grind for more heroes, but you CAN, even without investing money (unless we talk about inventory)- FUN- Great performance even with gazillion mobs on screen on a decent PC- Lots of events and references to current comics and movies- Solo-friendly if you prefer that- Alt-friendly (VERY)Cons:- Inventory space will run out VERY VERY quickly. Your heroes share bank-and bag-space. If you wanna collect relics and legendaries, crafting mats and items you might use later (some items are char-specific, some can be used by any char), you will most likely have to buy more space. This is the only money I invested here. - Can be grindy, YMMV- Some quests might be bugged. COuldnt complete chapter 1 yet because of a symbiote mission in a police HQ			"

												I've used the -nosteam shortcut so Steam only shows hours played for when I've launched via Steam to purchase G's at times and DLC's, but I've 600 days played, all the Heros, geared, had max Omega Points (10K), and the game used to be so much fun!We had freedom of movement, good damage output to help us through tougher content, an Omega System that, while a bit complicated at first, did it's job despite some issues, some essential life-saver items (Invul for those stupid 1-shot mechanics bosses have), multiple power bars to give us the ability to use a good variety of powers (Dr Strange players have probably quit already now we've just one bar!).Now... teleports that are slower to get to position than dashes are and both teleports and dashes are limited to 3 times before you need to stop and catch your breath for a few seconds, and travel powers that have a charge-up time before you even start moving.  An 'Infinity' system that limits your choices of where to spend points by splitting their allocation down amongst different types.  Severely nerf'd damage output and reduced defense against damage taken.  One power bar, one, to fit a very limited number of powers in out of the 20odd each Hero has.  Slow, clunky, tedious gameplay.There were so many people on the forum basically begging the div'elopers not to go through with most of these changes but got ignored, as a company they've always been a bit arrogant but they went above and beyond their usual.  And good luck posting anything on their forum, one of their moderators is a total moron who's first language clearly is not English due to how he dishes out warnings for innocent threads that he doesn't understand.This, when first announced, felt to me like it was purely being done to dumb the game down for consoles and now there's zero doubt that's the reason.As for recommending the game, I can't anymore.  I'm struggling to find motivation to play and what little I have is due to having put a lot of money in to the game over the years.  However, everyone is different and you 'may' enjoy it in it's new 'Nerf Heroes' format, but not so likely.			"

												Marvel Heroes is essentially Ultimate Alliance 3 with a more Diablo bent. There's a large cast of characters and they're all different.  You have to start with one though, but the game gives you a nice starter roster. I've been playing as Punisher and its been real fun. Other characters cost money or you need to find a certain amount of in-game items to purchase them by beating the campaigns or by enemy drops so you best stick with a character you'll like unless you want to put in the time or money. Really its not a big deal though because the Free to Play elements are well utilized in the sense that you can just casually enjoy the whole game without spending a dime. Definitely worth playing, and because its free you have no reason not to.			"

												Let's be honest, when Marvel Heroes first released there were some problems. Limited amount of unbalanced heroes, not much variation in content, and more. Gazillion however have listened to feedback and have improved the game tremendously since then, and so they rebranded to mirror the advances made. I'm usually against rebranding, but in this case it's justified. More heroes, more content, more LOOT! It's a great timesink as evident by my playtime, and I highly recommend it. The prices for stuff is still a bit too high, but most of it can be bought for ingame currency.

												Marvel Heroes won't win any prizes for originality, but it is an extremely fun game in its own right that makes effective use of the license at its disposal, and it's always refreshing to encounter a free-to-play title that is intended to be precisely that.You can play Marvel Heroes through without spending any money on it, and it will be a decent experience for you. However, the inelegant handling of multiple characters, along with the lack of any real difficulty means that it doesn’t quite reach the heights of other games in the genre. But it is the only game of its type where you can play as your favourite Marvel characters and that is certainly something that will draw many people in.			"

I´m actually having a lot of fun playing it!There´s a large selection of heroes and they play/feel different enough to make you want to unlock multiple heroes.The free to play model is fair... you can unlock every heroe just by playing, although it takes a ridiculous amount of time.Only things you can´t unlock by just playing are extra bank space and some costumes for your heroes.If you enjoy action rpgs, Marvel Heroes is worth taking a look at.The game is fun to play, looks good, animations are well done, the devs are very active on the forums, the community is very nice and helpfull and heck, you get to play 30+ different heroes from the Marvel Universe.Granted, if mindlessly killing waves upon waves of mobs looking for loot is not your cup of tea, this might not be the game for you. But if you are looking for a game to fill the void left by the trainwreck that was Diablo 3 and don´t feel like dealing with Path of Exile over complicated talent tree and (IMO) ugly graphics, Marvel Heroes provides a good, satisfying time for casual players.

												Fantastic game all around.For everyone who's marvel fan and arpg genre fan i'd highly recommend this game. There's planty of characters to play where each of them have unique gameplay. The payment system is pay to speed things up so even if you choose to go full on f2p you won't notice any difference in gameplay quality between you and someone who spent tons of money on this game. Also i'd like to add that you coulnd't ask for better community then the one that's playing this game, so whenever you have something to ask feel free to do so in general chat, community will be more then glad to help.

												Marvel Heroes ReviewMarvel Heroes launch wasn’t the best but has definitely changed from an average game to a fun and enjoyable game. Marvel Heroes has a large roster of heroes to choose from and while you can acquire them through micro-transactions it is completely optional, you can get all the heroes through collecting “eternity splinters” which you can trade them off for heroes of your choice. While getting heroes can be done at the cost of nothing, getting “fancy” new costumes for your heroes does cost money. Marvel Heroes has a large storyline which you can play through and the developers constantly add more and more chapters, might I say you can play through the whole storyline for free if you’re wondering. Marvel Heroes is if you haven’t guessed yet is a lot like Diablo so if you’re a fan of that game and a fan of marvel then this game is perfect for you. There are lots to do in Marvel Heroes from occasional events, players vs. players and lots of different things you can do after you have finished the story. Overall Marvel Heroes is a well made game and because it’s free, there is no reason not to try it out.			"

												The game is masterful.  There are tons of characters to choose from and it is put together with David Brevik at the helm.  Gazillion is the most active development team with the community right now and I love the effort they are putting into this game.  This game was horrible when it first launched and now, it is incredibly good.  If you're wondering if this game is for you, ask yourself if you loved Diablo 2.  That's what this game is trying to become and it's getting closer and closer with each patch.  I'm much older now than when I was a teenager playing Diablo 2 and even I wondered if this would scratch that nostalgic itch.  For me, it did and it is my favorite game out right now.  I'm not a comic reader and don't follow anything in Marvel at all, but I just love this game.  It's my perfect ARPG and I can't wait to see how it progresses over time.  I'd recommend this game to ANY ARPG fan out there since it's free and it's only getting better.			"

												My true number of hours is not right, i've got a few hundred in reality with 15 different 50+ characters and i have to say, after all that time casually playing this game and now, with this update, im done. This update is complete trash, the characters have been over-simplified into cookie-cutter toons that makes me feel im playing a mobile device game and not on my PC. Where once all characters could be tweeked thanks to the infiity system and points spent into skills, now you jsut have a few traits and talents to choose from (15 different power modifers, once chosed at each tier). What once was a robust post 60 skill tree in the Omega system is now a rigid, restrictive Infinity system with little choice in comparison. it feels like someone in corporate development thought to key into the movie franchise and try to draw a connection, and in the process trashed the game. I do hope that someone in the halls of gazillion reads these posts and says to themselves ""We made a mistake"".			"

												Clearly this game need a re-rate!! After stopping for sometime, decided to load it up and see what is new :) glad i did. this game is very well a gem at the moment. It has a bad launch with un-optimised engine, bad contents, bad special effects, bad balance, junk inventory items (e.g. crafting items). Just bad of everything. I actually managed to get few friends to play with me during that time. All left with a bad taste in the mouth after a week or two. It was because of the inventory hog and has the feeling that developer just wants you to spend on the F2P game. Now all of these crafting items are more managable with stacking. but somehow they have reintroduced another inventory hog- Relics.. sigh.. There are now a lot more things to do in the game and more items to collect for you hero item slots. Also lots of modes has been introduced. Midtown Mahanthan is just brilliant. You can be in there the whole day clearing the mobs there. mobs are also more varied than it used to be. There is also Heroic and more difficlt modes for you to relive the story mission and get better equipments.There are lots more contents but i am no real reviewer.. :p i would give this a 80/100 for what it is now.Be going back to my marvel game now..

												First off, don't let the Metacritic rating scare you off.  Everyone who played it at launch fully admits that the game was ♥♥♥ on toast then.  Currently, Marvel Heroes is a fantastic ARPG well worth looking at.Unlike a lot of ARPGs that have come down the pike since Diablo 2, what the devs at Gazillion rightly realize is that the reason that D2 was so beloved was that it's just plain fun to mow down gigantic hordes of mooks like a hot knife through butter, slowing down only to sort your loot or focus on a boss (or four).  The source material fits perfectly with this gameplay - of course Iron Man or Hulk can smash through absurdly large numbers of foes without breaking a sweat, something would be wrong if they couldn't.Couple this with attack effects as flashy as you'd expect from comic books (and the fact that you can't help blowing up/breaking virtually everything in sight) and it's basically the perfect ARPG for the ADD set.Moreover, Marvel Heroes is massively generous as a free to play game; you've got 9 different characters to choose from at start and every single character in the game can be unlocked for free just by playing the game.  Sure, you can buy characters with money if you want but don't feel like you have to in order to play the game, most of the starters are perfectly viable.  The only thing that absolutely can't be gotten via just playing is extra stash space, but by the time you've played long enough to really need/want more you'll probably have gotten enough entertainment value to lay down a few bucks.Gazillion is a developer that patches and updates the game incredibly often (sometimes too often, but they're getting better) and they're fantastic with communicating with the playerbase.  New heroes are coming out pretty much every month.This is not the hardest ARPG around, and it can get a bit repetitive at times, but it's well worth checking out and a lot of fun.			"

												Marvel Heroes combines two of my favorite things, Diablo's ""Kill things get loot."" formula and the Marvel Universe. For the new player you make your account and you're given a selection of starting heroes to start you out in your adventures in this Diablo style MMO. These nine heroes are Luke Cage, The Punisher, Captain America, Black Panther, Black Widow, Human Torch, Colossus, Storm, and Hawkeye. All of which have their strengths and weaknesses. From here you load into the game and are started on your first run through of the story. In honesty the story isn't outstanding, but it's written in true Marvel fashion and has the good ol' Super hero fun. You play as your hero who starts out in midtown New York doing his/her hero thing when they get a call from Jocasta stating that Nick Fury needs your help. Hydra ((Most recently depicted in the recent Winter Solider movie)) is up to their usual shinnagins and is attempting to break out super powered villains from The Raft. A Famous Marvel Universe prison designed to contain super villains. From there you go places across the universe and aid various factions all while be treated to voice acted comic slides that progress the story.Additional heroes are unlocked through ether the cash shop for various prices or by collecting ""Eternity Splinters"" which can be a grind but you'll spend at least 60 or so hours leveling your starting hero to the cap of sixty. this brings me to what impresses me most about this free to play game. The only things that require real money is buying additional tabs for your storage, buying the exact character costume you want and certain consumables. ((Some of these are quest rewards that you can gain three times per hero, one for each difficulty.)) Other then that everything is completely obtainiable ((Albet some of it extremely rare)) within the game's normal playing. Random costumes can drop or be crafted at your crafter once you level him up for example! Well I hope those who read this decide to give the game a shot!			"

												Great, a slightly below average quality marvel ""RPG"" that has 90% of its content stuck behind nearly $300 dollars of DLC. thanks. I mean who would want an actual Marvel RPG with custome characters and well a integrated story that makes us want to play as much as possible? DC got pretty close with DC universe which i dont even think exists anymore. This game is a blatent cash grab, and while i understand its a company that needs to keep up a profit, they dont seem to have tried at all with this game. it feels like one of those crappy JRPG's that you find on the adds on the side of random websites. they advertise it as ""the best thing ever"" and when you play it its just a basic template with differant assets pasted on top. see, if the DLC's were $2 or even $5 i wouldnt have an issue, thats a reasonable price. but prices from $12 to $40 for a few characters, some costumes, and some in game boosts is insulting. its like every bit of DLC is the price that the whole game plus all of the DLC should cost. if the game were $40 and had all the DLC in it i would be perfectly ok with it.

												This is one of my most favorite Action RPG games! It has an awesome gameplay! The graphics aren't all that demanding and even at 'Low' settings the game has a pretty nice look. There are over 45 heroes to choose from, a lot of PvP content, survival mode, raids, dungeons etc. This game is the best free-to-play game EVER(in my opinion)! I've played since the same day it came out, June 4th, 2013. It may get repetitive at some times, but I guess that's normal for an Action RPG, still it's AMAZING! Try it and enjoy the game! :) It's awesome. I highly recommend it and I would give it a 10/10.P.S. Steam time = Not all the time I've played the game.			"

												Fun game overall but you're going to need to play a lot if you want to try out different champions without spending money. And you'll most likely need to spend money to buy stash (items storage slots), the only thing that is not available for free besides costumes (unless you're lucky).Good graphics but quite bad optimization for low-spec computers.If you like the Marvel universe, go for it, every character is different from each other and they are quite respectful of the ones from the comics.

												Whatever this game was on launch is no more. Much like whatever godawful Jean Grey/Dark Phoenix metaphor you've thought up, Marvel Heroes rose from the ashes, washed the sin from it's face, and became the most fun MMO I've played in a while. Packed to the gills with References and Service for all stripes of Marvel fans, and helmed by David Brevik, this is straight up the best bits of Diablo and everything similar to it weaponized. Plus, anything in the Marvel Universe that makes use of Squirrel Girl is worth your time.			"

												More 'maybe' than yes. Read on to find what I mean by that.(NOTE: this is more 'what you need to know about Marvel Heroes' than a review.It includes tips, info, & me explaining features of the game. If you want in-depth pros & cons, there are other reviews for that. thanks.)OverviewMarvel Heroes MIGHT be worth you checking out. I have 'played' this game for 415 hours so far, but I have a hard time recommending it unless you...1. like...marvel's heroes A LOT & 2. have a friend or 2 that will play it with you sometimes.3. have means/money you can add to your Steam account when the time comes Basically it's a fun Action-RPG BASED ON BEING (A) CERTAIN CHARACTER(S).IF you enjoy being said character & don't care too much about level design or story, then you will enjoy this for its gameplay and FEELING LIKE said character(s).but you have to have really good self control. The game rewards you with Eternity Splinters that let you buy/unlock more characters. The main negative is you will be tempted to buy a lot of things with real money (in currency called 'G') -especially more STASH- OR you will constantly have to clear out your storage spaces (which is what I do all the time always, even though as-of this review, I have 9 STASH's +3 character-specific STASH's). The upside is they are constantly updating it, adding playable characters, events, team-ups, etc.Key Features to knowBODYSLIDE: this is a teleport that takes you back to a HUB at any time. It has a cooldown of 10 minutes. It can be used twice before the cooldown starts: once to take you to the hub and once to take you back (to the spot you bodyslid from).ULTIMATE: every character has an Ultimate power/skill. To my knowledge, they all unlock at Lvl 52 (max lvl is 60). The cooldown for the ultimate starts at 10 minutes (but you can put points into it to be less).key TIPS to know:you have to LEVEL YOUR CRAFTER (by donating items to it): this is just a tip, but it's an annoying thing considering much of the early game you are left wishing your crafter was a higher level, but all the crafter is really good for IMO is tranfering an item over to another character. And also for upgrading blue gear to purple.You get a LOT of LOOT: So plan accordingly. Until you get a 2nd stash, I wouldn't even think of getting a 2nd character, but that's just my advice. Once you get a 2nd STASH, then you can start another character, maybe even 2 if you can handle limited storage.there are a LOT of different items in this game, including artifacts, costume cores, 'crafting items' (4 different types with 8 different tiers for each), boost potions, pets, rings, runes (used in crafting with URU gear), URU gear (1 wearable per character, can't wear until Lvl 25), medals, medallions, and a few more I can't think of now.*update1 [05/13/2015]* - I feel I should mention the cost of things in this game*update2 [06/18/2015]* added in 'crafting tab'  to pricing list below, & its price/value/usefulness*update3 [07/04/2015]* added introduction to try to better explain my goal of this 'review.'PRICINGSTASH (regular) : 500 G ($5.00)Character-specific STASH : 350 G ($3.50)Crafting Tab: 200 G ($2.00)^The first 2 are the main 2 tabs you should ever 'NEED' to buy in this game.I recently realized how valuable crafting tabs are later in the game, since I had a TON of runestones and crafting items that can be stashed there. I didn't know Runes (aka. runestones) were allowed in that stash, but NOW that I do, I think they are a good deal if you have 4 or more rows of runes sitting around (that you don't want to get rid of).That said, MH only lets you buy Gs in 'bundles', otherwise known as lump sums.There is 500 G bundle, 1000 G bundle, 2100 G bundle ($20), and so on.This is an annoying model and I dislike it very much, but what can you do about it?The only thing I will say in DEFENSE of this model is the fact that it's KIND-OF like a subscription fee...only you actually get something in return, and if you look at it that way, it's not so bad. Especially since you are NOT forced to pay anything to play this game.---------TL; DR= if you have a friend playing this with you, & you like a certain Marvel hero a lot, try it.....if you have no money to buy anything, you probably DON'T want to try it, because you will be muy (very) frustrated.***********POST-SCRIPT. ADDED 11/15/2015*Originally I rated this game a 'Yes', but now I definitely lean more towards no. Maybe my tastes have changed. maybe I've simply beat the game too many times. Maybe I haven't given the 'endgame' a decent try (I really haven't). but whatever the reason, I don't feel like playing this game anymore. :(			"

												Well its been about 6 months since the last time I wrote a review on this game (gave it about a 5.7/10 as it had many flaws), and I recently just got back into Marvel Heroes and felt that it was appropriate to update my review on the game. Marvel Heroes as a game has grown a whole lot since its really bad release. Various numbers and formulas have changed for damage calculating, and heroes have been revamped (making OP heroes less OP while making the boring and weak heroes a hell of a lot more fun).Since my departure from the game, I can't say that a whole lot of content has been added, because it hasn't. However, end game content has been revised and the game as a whole gets better each week thanks to the Devs working really REALLY close with the community in terms of QA and asking the players how each Hero feels with each and every new patch that is released.In terms of the f2p of the game, the heroes arent as pricey, they are all much more acceptable with most of them costing less than 10 dollars, leaving a small few which include IronMan, Deadpool and Spider-Man (and maybe one or two more I cannot remember) costing around 12 bucks. With costumes still being roughly the same price they always were (varrying from 10 for the average skin and 20 for a Enhanced skin) as that is now their main source of revenue. But this is all because Heroes are much more easy to obtain in game now with the addition of a new currency that the player earns as they play overtime. With the currency players can now save up to purchase their desired hero (for varrying costs) or can opt-in for a much cheaper ""gacha bag"" option where the player buys a random hero at a reduced price.All in all I recommend checking out this game if you are at least a fan of ARPGs, its not quite on the same level as Torchlight 2 and Path of Exile just yet, however I have no doubt that it is getting there. If you don't believe me check out their weekly patch notes, its crazy how many things are changed each and everytime.7.6/10....for now!			"

												A surprising amount of content and depth for a free-to-play game. Although It becomes VERY grindy once you start getting into optimization and unlocking new characters, and there's a lot of stuff that's poorly explained in the game, like all the currencies, the genosha reputation, the crafter/vendor/enchanter levels etc... it gets a little confusing.

												So, maybe you've seen the metacritic review, maybe you played in the beta and never came back. What you would behold in these PoVs is what most people would say is an ""okay but not great, still feels unpolished"" ARPG featuring the Marvel cast. No one would blame you at all for putting it down, and simply walking away.But things got better.Oh my stars and garters things got better. Updated power trees, rebalanced heroes, a damn transfusion level injection of sustainability and playability! Seriously, I really have to commend gazillion for all that they've done with their game. It went from a ho-hum beat 'em up to a full realization of what expected at the beginning, and it's just getting better with every update.I will grant you, that updates aren't 100% complete, and some heroes still fill just a twinge undercooked (I'm looking at you Cyclops), but that said this is still, I feel, an absolute must-""buy"" for fans of Marvel, Diablo (the first 2 at least), and co-op smashfests in general.Still not convinced? Well, it IS free....sooo.....it'll only cost you the download time and hard drive space.			"

The heroes are great it is a really fun F2p game.  The characters feel authentic, and  have pretty good diablo for the most part and their are also events every week or so.

												Well its been about 6 months since the last time I wrote a review on this game (gave it about a 5.7/10 as it had many flaws), and I recently just got back into Marvel Heroes and felt that it was appropriate to update my review on the game. Marvel Heroes as a game has grown a whole lot since its really bad release. Various numbers and formulas have changed for damage calculating, and heroes have been revamped (making OP heroes less OP while making the boring and weak heroes a hell of a lot more fun).Since my departure from the game, I can't say that a whole lot of content has been added, because it hasn't. However, end game content has been revised and the game as a whole gets better each week thanks to the Devs working really REALLY close with the community in terms of QA and asking the players how each Hero feels with each and every new patch that is released.In terms of the f2p of the game, the heroes arent as pricey, they are all much more acceptable with most of them costing less than 10 dollars, leaving a small few which include IronMan, Deadpool and Spider-Man (and maybe one or two more I cannot remember) costing around 12 bucks. With costumes still being roughly the same price they always were (varrying from 10 for the average skin and 20 for a Enhanced skin) as that is now their main source of revenue. But this is all because Heroes are much more easy to obtain in game now with the addition of a new currency that the player earns as they play overtime. With the currency players can now save up to purchase their desired hero (for varrying costs) or can opt-in for a much cheaper ""gacha bag"" option where the player buys a random hero at a reduced price.All in all I recommend checking out this game if you are at least a fan of ARPGs, its not quite on the same level as Torchlight 2 and Path of Exile just yet, however I have no doubt that it is getting there. If you don't believe me check out their weekly patch notes, its crazy how many things are changed each and everytime.7.6/10....for now!			"

												I don't really play this game currently but look at how many hours i wasted on it.Its free to play but i could have get a car with all the money i used on MH for the swag.Right now,my only concern is that even with the content they make,the characters don't feel as epic as they should. Most of the characters you can build however you want of course, but for good dps,there's are certain skillsets you have to use. Look at the official forums,and you'll see im right.If you end up getting rare items,then of course you can almost get away with lackluster builds.Now you might say,""why are you recommend the game but you're just saying negatives about it?""You got me there,but it's a free to play game, and there's a lot of content to pass the time.Lots of characters to unlock with splinters that you can acquire at a decent rate.That being said, there are downsides,but it's worth checking out considering the amount of content you get. Final verdict-I know I'll go back to this game down the road, but I'm waiting for a lot of serious changes before I do.You get incredible content for a free game,and you can't really pay to win in this one cause the pvp is dead anyways.8/10			"

You can unlock heroes without money in an expected amount of time. The hardest thing to do without spending money, is inventory control. You won't have access to a ton of inventory slots so you would need to be careful. But the game is worth 40 dollars. I had 50 hours in easy. No plan to stop. So throwing 10-20 bucks at later on for quality of life is a no brainer. I have paid a lot of more games that kept me a lot less entertained and of a much lower quality. Heroes is excellent. Beyond that, the crew that works on the game is amazing. The devs join in on streams, they listen to the community. We vote on new hero releases.

												Fun game. One major problem so far: the game is extremely easy. There is a lot of potential for some fun battles if there was more difficulty. The fast paced gameplay is outstanding but without tougher opponents it seems pointless to utilize it. You can stand still and tank most enemies nearly endlessly without dying (and I'm playing a ""glass cannon"" character who is supposed to be very squishy compared to others). I'm hoping it gets harder later on but from what I've read, it does not.			"

												All of these negative reviews you see are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Don't listen to them. This is a wonderful game that is absolutely worth your time, especially if you're a fan of ARPGs such as Diablo, Torchlight, the Sacred series, etc.It plays EXACTLY like them, but in the Marvel universe, with marvel characters. And boy, are there a lot of characters to play as. There's over 40 I believe, and they just keep adding to that number semi-frequently. There are three difficulties to play. You start in normal mode, and as you complete the campaign mode, you'll unlock the other two. The higher difficulties will give you better loot drops, more gold, more experience, etc.This game has a lot of unique things going on that make it even more sensational. There's an omega system, which is basically paragon levels from D3, but it's really interesting, and there's a TON of variety, which in turn, makes customizing your character almost an endless affair. You can do so many things with one hero, it's amazing. There's this feature called ""Team-ups"" which I think are pretty cool as well. They're essentially pets, but in the form of other heroes that'll tag along with you. However, you can outfit them and customize their abilities as well, so it really adds even more depth to your ever-growing ARPG OCD :PThere's also PvP and group play, which is to be expected from an online game. Group play is pretty cool, as you'll drop down in an area and team up with nearby heroes to take down tough baddies. Don't worry though, there's no fighting over loot, it all drops seperately for each character. Honestly,  it's just great fun. If you love superheroes, if you love ARPGs, it's the perfect match for you. You can purchase every hero/team-up in the game for free. The currency, eternity splinters, drop frequently and a person is more than capable of not spending a dime on this game. That being said, you have nothing to lose, and I guarentee you'll have some fun if you give it a shot.			"

Don't worry though, there's no fighting over loot, it all drops seperately for each character. Honestly,  it's just great fun. If you love superheroes, if you love ARPGs, it's the perfect match for you. You can purchase every hero/team-up in the game for free. The currency, eternity splinters, drop frequently and a person is more than capable of not spending a dime on this game. That being said, you have nothing to lose, and I guarentee you'll have some fun if you give it a shot.			"

												What other game do you get to play as Dr. Strange, Black Panther, and Nightcrawler, that's also penned by the legendary Brian Michael Bendis???  This game is f2p but you'll find that you need to drop around $20 to have a good time, which isn't bad considering I've spent $60 on crap games that I've barely touched. Although everything is unlockable by playing the game, so there really is no need to drop any money, but the drop rates are really low and the splinters (in game currency) take some time to farm. However considering I've sunk more time in this gem than about 98% of my game library, I don't mind throwing the developers a few nickles. Also the developers are always running promotions, updating content, adding new material, listening to feedback, and constantly improving the game. Bottomline, if you're a fan of Marvel or even like Diablo-esque click+loot+click games, then you owe it to yourself to check this ""Thing"" out (Eh, eh, see what I did there).			"

Anyone who even remotely likes superheroes (the Marvel universe in particular) owes it to themselves to give this game a try... I mean hell, it is free, after all.

												As a huge fan of marvel and a person who (aside from Diablo), is not that crazy about MMOs, I say this is a great game that has marvel oozing out of every crevice. The price structuring is not perfect, those of you who like perfecting builds will find it long and arduous, and this game has not yet reached its full potential yet. However, when you find your favorite marvel heroes you will grow to love and enjoy their playstyle and their personality and will be happy to find the first marvel game with all of the iconic powers of a character accessable. I truly love this game even though it needs a lot of improvement and none of my friends enjoy it, but I say even without reaching full potential I'm enjoying and say it's worth a shot.			"

												I definitely recommend this game to any diablo and marvel fan...however don't set your expectations too high.   Many of the characters have very simplistic power mechanics and a lot of the powers are ""copy and pasted"" from one hero to another.  That is to be expected in game with the Marvel universe Canon and the expected amount of playable heroes.  But, when playing it really seems they relied heavily on older mechanics and really went for nothing innovative or new and that is REALLY dissapointing.  but once again, for a free to play game-where every hero can be won or purchased using free in game currency, it is definitely (at least) a must try.

												No Idea where people are getting some of their reviews from. must be playing a different game to me. Firstly Since release there has been alot of improvements to the game and plentry of content released. They tend to release a new playable Hero each month as well as weekly bug fixes and some other content such as weekend events etc. In terms of Content it is releasing PvP and Raids in Beta with Raids being out of Beta in a few weeks. Also other game modes are added such as X-Defense which is a wave based mode which was not implented on release. One Shot terminals which are small story arcs. Shared Quests that allow you to group up. Plus there is other stuff coming in the coming months such as Endless Dungeons.Now to the Free to Play part. People who say this is pay to win are clearly unaware that all heroes can be bought without spending a penny. Yes it will take time to earn but the game is by no means pay to win. the only thing you will need to purchase is bank space and even that is not a necesity if you can keep your inventory tidy and are willing to not horde items. Finally the Devs. Anyone who does go on the forums for this game will be aware of how active the devs are. They take alot of community feedback on board and try to gear the game to be enjoyed by the player. If your not a superhero fan then maybe this isnt for you as much but it is a great way to get into the universe of Marvel. Brilliant Game and Enjoyable for most ages in my opinion. 10/10 and best superhero game i have played			"

												**PROS AND CONS BELOW INTRO**When Marvel Heroes first came out it was fun for awhile but I eventually got bored with it. With its new Marvel Heroes 2015 edition where they have been remaking/updating all the heroes with New 52 models, I just cant stop playing. It does remind me of the old days of getting home after school (at the time) and rushing to play Diablo 2 with my friends everyday. PROS:+Lots of Characters to Choose From+Many different playstyles to fit anyones prefered taste+Great Graphics, still good on even the lowest settings+Capable of Unlocking any Hero without having to pay+RUNEWORDS! (I loved Runewords from D2 lol)+Crafting/Enchanting+Lots of Fun Events by the Devs, especially during Marvel Movie Releases+Great Promos/Giveaways+Devs/GMs Actually listen to the players as a wholeCONS:-Public Maps can be VERY bad for FPS if too many people are on it-Limited ""Bag Space"" unless you spend money-Can be very boring without friends to play with over long periods of timeNEUTRALS:These are points that may be interesting to others and worth mentioning. I personally just love leveling Characters in games and not the biggest fan of these points, I may enjoy them once in awhile, but its not my reasons for playing the game and wouldnt care if they get taken out.-+Raids-+PvP			"

												I've played since beta and I do admit i wish i had bought into the founder's pack then.  The game wasn't the greatest but Brevik and team did not give up and the game is worth what i have spent on it.  I bought a large amount of Gs which I have barely spent any.  I'm not a costume guy or feel the need to get every hero soon as they come out.  So the $100 or so I've spent which has kept me occupied for at least 6 months and prevented me from buying a new game has been worth it.  The actual review:  If you're into Diablo and the endless item grind that it is then this game is for you.  The amount of heroes will never end and make this game the most repetitive game ever played.  I do enjoy it as a game that i can pick up and play anytime and there is at least something new be it a hero i have yet to get to or actual content.Actual content added within the year:  1 Midtown madness an endless instance which isn't the greatest content.  2 x-defense wave like survival mode for 5 players.  Holo sims wave like survival mode for 1-2 players.  3 Omega & Synergy systems that equates to more grinding the same content (account leveling).  4 Enchanting a new crafter5 Asgard content (thor dark world content)6 Man ape one shot story (actual content)7 Muspelheim raid (actual content but hard to get in unless you're part of a large group)So as you can see as far as actual new content and new stuff to do its very limited.  Compared to releasing 1 hero a month (and now team ups) you can tell where their focus was and continues to be.  This game to me feels like it's still in beta since they still haven't completed the full review of the starting heroes.  But it's on the right track and the next year is/will be exciting with the release of villains and another one shot that's on the list for sure.			"

												Marvel Heroes is a ActionRPG type game by Gazillion and from the original creator of Diablo. Some of you might remember playing Marvel: Ultimate Alliance back on the PS2, this is very similar to those types of games except you’re playing with lots of other people and have a massive roster of heroes to choose from.There is a crafting element to Marvel Heroes where you can level up vendors and crafters to unlock new recipes and gear augmentations. There are a few things to do besides playing the story missions of the game such as the open public dungeon Mid-town Manhattan and specific challenge terminals with a boss at the end, you can also queue up for X-Defence which is a survive as many waves of enemies as you can solo or with a group, and the Fire vs Ice PVP arena. More content is arriving monthly with new story missions and challenge terminals and of course new heroes and new costumes.FREE TO PLAY:When you create an account over at https://marvelheroes.com/ and login to the game from Steam you will be able to select one free “starter hero” from a pre-set roster. Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Thing, Daredevil and Storm were the original starter heroes you could pick from at launch several months ago. I’ve heard from other people that Gazillion has changed this a little and that certain heroes have been added to the starter hero roster, namely Captain America. I can’t confirm this because I already have Cap in my main roster.Yes Marvel Heroes is free to play, you don’t need to pay for new heroes if you don’t want to… but you will be required to grind fairly hard if you want to unlock your desired hero. A special item called an Eternity Splinter can drop at random at any time during the game when you defeat an enemy, you will need to collect anywhere from 400-600 of these to unlock one hero of your choosing. Your best bet to play as the hero you want is to actually purchase him or her, the average single hero pack will run you around $20 US currency or less.. There are some benefits to doing this. -You unlock your favourite hero right away, no grinding for weeks to earn Eternity Splinters.-You get your heroes STASH tab, this is an extra inventory tab in your shared STASH locker. Stash tabs at the moment cannot be unlocked with Eternity Splinters.-You get an additional costume or two for your hero. Costumes at the moment cannot be unlocked with Eternity Splinters.PAY TO WIN: Yes and No. There is a cash shop in the game where you can buy new heroes, stash tabs, costumes and items such as temporary XP boosters or Retcon devices which reset you’re heroes skill points so you can re-allocate them. The only real advantage a paying player has over a non-paying player at the moment is the XP boosters so they can level up a lot faster and the ability to buy more stash tabs for inventory space. There are usually a fair amount of seasonal sales in the cash shop throughout the year.HEROES and VILLAINS:There is a large roster of heroes to choose and play as, like..Iron Man, Hulk, Ms. Marvel, Captain America, Black Widow, Thor, Cyclops, Wolverine, Jean Grey, Gambit, Emma Frost, Storm, Colossus, Deadpool, Cable, Spider-Man, Rocket Raccoon, Ghost Rider, Luke Cage, Punisher and many more. Including some upcoming heroes and villains that have been announced for a release in 2014 such as Magneto, Juggernaut and Venom.Each hero for the most part plays differently than the next and has many different skill trees to put points into as you level up. You can literally have two people playing as Thor with two very different skill tree builds leaving you with two very different play styles.The basic types of heroes are you standard melee and ranged heroes… and those who are a hybrid of both. Spider-Man is a great example because depending on how you spend his level up points you can build him as a pure melee or pure ranged hero.VERDICT:If you loved Marvel: Ultimate Alliance on the Playstation or are a comics fan and loved the Diablo series, then you will feel right at home here. Marvel Heroes continues to get better each month in terms of re-balancing and content being added, this game has come a long ways for a “Free to Play” game in one short year. It is almost criminal that this game is free to play because it is very fun and addicting, especially if you are willing to pony up the dough and purchase a few of your favourite heroes.			"

												A definite re-review of the game's score is necessary. Being able to fling Squirrels at enemies and seeing them explode makes this game an automatic 8/10. Everything else added on top of that averages out to be about 20/10. A little unfair perhaps? Perhaps you don't judge squirrel flinging as astutely as needed. The game follows the Diablo format while adding plenty of reasons to actually spend money on it. You can, in theory and practice, play this game for free. So go ahead. Yet, when you want to join in on the squirel chunking antics, go ahead and drop a few dollars on a great experience. This game is executed better than the new Diablo, but still feels like the design team is missing out on a few things. The UI could use some work and finding your way around feels too chaotic considering their attempt at a flowing narrative. The story seems to follow one straight line, yet they seem to have multiple instances of HUBs and a confusing array of shops and needlessly difficult crafting options. With the amount of loot the enemies drop, you'd assume a better labeling system would allow you to sort and pick better. It doesn't. A simple Green or Red arrow would allow me to see if equipment was better or not. I understand that each bit is entirely unique in some cases, but mostly, the amount of judgements I have to make is a little tiring compared to other titles. Ignore Metascore and try this game. After you've ""Hulk Slam'd"" and ""Squirrelpocalypse'd"" a few times, then judge for yourself. I have enjoyed it so far.			"

												I'm loving this game. It's top down Diablo style. Knowledge of the Marvel universe is not really required as everything pertinent to the game is explained.

There are boosters there, and special costumes, but you can unlock every playable hero via in game drops, or with a dropped currency that allows you to buy them.

												 Back in June of 2013 a game called Marvel Heroes was released and received a metascore of 58.  This Marvel Heroes is no longer that Marvel Heroes.  The developers have dropped everything bad and put in much more of the good, resulting in a game that is both a fantastic example of an ARPG and a free-to-play game doing it right.			"

												This game just keeps getting better. Rule of thumb with this game is, if you haven't played it in two months or more then it is a completely different game from when you played last. Also if reading this before June 4th make sure to start playing by then. One year anniversary is around that date and they plan on giving 365 gifts to each player during their anniversary week.

												Marvel Heroes is a ActionRPG type game by Gazillion and from the original creator of Diablo. Some of you might remember playing Marvel: Ultimate Alliance back on the PS2, this is very similar to those types of games except you’re playing with lots of other people and have a massive roster of heroes to choose from.There is a crafting element to Marvel Heroes where you can level up vendors and crafters to unlock new recipes and gear augmentations. There are a few things to do besides playing the story missions of the game such as the open public dungeon Mid-town Manhattan and specific challenge terminals with a boss at the end, you can also queue up for X-Defence which is a survive as many waves of enemies as you can solo or with a group, and the Fire vs Ice PVP arena. More content is arriving monthly with new story missions and challenge terminals and of course new heroes and new costumes.FREE TO PLAY:When you create an account over at https://marvelheroes.com/ and login to the game from Steam you will be able to select one free “starter hero” from a pre-set roster. Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Thing, Daredevil and Storm were the original starter heroes you could pick from at launch several months ago. I’ve heard from other people that Gazillion has changed this a little and that certain heroes have been added to the starter hero roster, namely Captain America. I can’t confirm this because I already have Cap in my main roster.Yes Marvel Heroes is free to play, you don’t need to pay for new heroes if you don’t want to… but you will be required to grind fairly hard if you want to unlock your desired hero. A special item called an Eternity Splinter can drop at random at any time during the game when you defeat an enemy, you will need to collect anywhere from 400-600 of these to unlock one hero of your choosing. Your best bet to play as the hero you want is to actually purchase him or her, the average single hero pack will run you around $20 US currency or less.. There are some benefits to doing this. -You unlock your favourite hero right away, no grinding for weeks to earn Eternity Splinters.-You get your heroes STASH tab, this is an extra inventory tab in your shared STASH locker. Stash tabs at the moment cannot be unlocked with Eternity Splinters.-You get an additional costume or two for your hero. Costumes at the moment cannot be unlocked with Eternity Splinters.PAY TO WIN: Yes and No. There is a cash shop in the game where you can buy new heroes, stash tabs, costumes and items such as temporary XP boosters or Retcon devices which reset you’re heroes skill points so you can re-allocate them. The only real advantage a paying player has over a non-paying player at the moment is the XP boosters so they can level up a lot faster and the ability to buy more stash tabs for inventory space. There are usually a fair amount of seasonal sales in the cash shop throughout the year.HEROES and VILLAINS:There is a large roster of heroes to choose and play as, like..Iron Man, Hulk, Ms. Marvel, Captain America, Black Widow, Thor, Cyclops, Wolverine, Jean Grey, Gambit, Emma Frost, Storm, Colossus, Deadpool, Cable, Spider-Man, Rocket Raccoon, Ghost Rider, Luke Cage, Punisher and many more. Including some upcoming heroes and villains that have been announced for a release in 2014 such as Magneto, Juggernaut and Venom.Each hero for the most part plays differently than the next and has many different skill trees to put points into as you level up. You can literally have two people playing as Thor with two very different skill tree builds leaving you with two very different play styles.The basic types of heroes are you standard melee and ranged heroes… and those who are a hybrid of both. Spider-Man is a great example because depending on how you spend his level up points you can build him as a pure melee or pure ranged hero.VERDICT:If you loved Marvel: Ultimate Alliance on the Playstation or are a comics fan and loved the Diablo series, then you will feel right at home here. Marvel Heroes continues to get better each month in terms of re-balancing and content being added, this game has come a long ways for a “Free to Play” game in one short year. It is almost criminal that this game is free to play because it is very fun and addicting, especially if you are willing to pony up the dough and purchase a few of your favourite heroes.			"

												Superheroes are a weird subject for an ARPG/MMO-lite type game since those tend to be so gear-focused but MH makes it work. The game isn't without its flaws. In transforming it from its previous, universally panned incarnation to the present one, the devs have developed about a billion and a half systems, thrown them at the wall, and seen what sticks. Some of them are pretty half-baked or make power creep an ugly inevitability. But there's enough genuinely awesome stuff going on that MH mostly succeeds despite itself. And with a zillion characters to play and counting, you're sure to find something that matches your play style.			"

												After spending a few hours playing this game, I can say with confidence that it is probably the best F2P game I have played. To be fair, I don't typically play F2P or MMO games but within my limited experience, I can say that this happens to be one of the good ones. Gameplay is similar to Diablo series which is awesome. Graphics are good but nothing special.So far the Community has been pretty nice in my experience. The F2P aspect is what it is. At no point have I felt that I NEED to spend any of my real money in order to enjoy the game. Costumes and characters beyond the first one you pick will all cost real money. Alternately, you can find pick ups that can eventually use to get a new character, but it seems like it may take an eternity to do so. The bottom line is that I do recommend this game. If you are someone that cannot abide F2P in any form, then I suggest you save yourself some pain and play something else. Otherwise, I do believe there is fun to be had here. As of this writing, I have yet to spend any money at all and am having a great time. I do, however plan to purchase a costume for my character and think the time I've spent and the money I will spend will add up to good value.			"

												MH2015 is an a-rpg of sorts. Don't expect your tipical mmo game here. It's a fun and quick game but not without its drawbacks.The pros are as follows:You can play as one of a sizable cast of characters. You get to choose a starter and a second one the next day. You can also earn the rest of the characters via a farming system.Each of those character has different skills making each one a potentially unique experience.The maps and enemies are quite fun to play. Things like a a goon saying ""aww, just get me to the cops already"" are quite amusing.The cons are:The game is very repetetive. By the time you play your second character you'll know it by heart. The game is limited to only a few maps. This is a shame because every one of these maps has many events and easter eggs which lead you to wanting even more.The game tries to solve this repetetiveness by every now and then changing the directions of the map, which is endlessly annoying.A lot of farming. If this annoys you, then this is not a game for you. Final verict.I had a lot of fun in my time with the game. Many heroes were enjoyable and played well, better than i've seen them before. However one thing that stuck with me was the lack of variety. The same old same old eventually meant that i played the game less and less.Do NOT play if farming or repetetiveness frustrates you.Do Play if you want to try playing a marver character in an action game, this is where the game shines.Make SURE to use the funds for the free hero unlock you get on the second day to unlock your Favourite hero, it helps.

												It's a grindy F2P Diablo2 clone with some modernization updates as well some F2P trappings.-Get free second class citizen/hero at start: CHECK!-Overpriced heroes/ARPG classes: CHECK!

(1 Eternity Splinters drops every 4-6 minutes on average, 200/400/600 buy you a hero).This game sucked sweaty, ♥♥♥♥-slathered sloth shaft back in June/July when it was released.  In a desperate attempt to save their careers, Gazillion has taken the awkward, and hopefully forced by a higher IP owning hand, release game and made the game not vivaciously thumb a dirty brown eye like all reviews make it sound like it does.  Seriously, the game has had immense amounts of post-mortem content and polish that might not get much visibility unless people actually play it and feel sorry for Gazillion enough to hand them money.Bias: I paid $20 during the beta, regretted it until November when the game stopped being bad.

												This is officially my new sick addiction lol. The game had a rough start with its bizarre F2P model but just about everything has been reworked since then. No longer do you have to pray for a random hero to drop as loot or get the 2 more lame starter heroes from beating the story. With the implementation of Eternity Splinters and Cube Shards you can earn for FREE new Heroes and alternative costumes. You can have hours upon hours (I'm almost to 100 hrs lol) of fun playing this game without ever spending a single cent. I recently did buy $20 bucks of in game currency to buy a STASH box and mostly just to support the Devs that made this fantastic game. Its rich in the lore of Marvel and the X-Men. There are currently 29 playable heroes with each one playing entirely fresh and different from the last one you scrambled through the game with. In 2014 we are getting an additional 12 characters with some being infamous playable Villans such as Venom, Magneto and Juggernaut. Nightcrawler is the next character due out and Ghostrider just became playable so in my honest opinion this is the best time to try this game out or give it another shot if you were unhappy with the model when it was first released. Oh and did I mention Deadpool has an unmasked attire, Hulk can SMASH in a Santa Hat, and Emma Frost can charm enemies into fighting along side her? I'll leave it at that :D			"

Well boot this game back up, pick you hero and start taking on the forces of Doom or whoever one more time because after several patches and updates that occured since launch, Marvel Heroes feels like a completely differant game. And in this case, thats a VERY good thing. Taking some of the best parts of the first 2 Diablo games and Marvel Ultimate Alliance, and giving us a diverse and constantl growing list of heroes to use, this game will have you stuck to the screen for hours.

												Let's be clear about this, when Marvel Heroes launched, it was an unfinished mess. Leveling was grueling, many characters were simply not tuned to be at all effective and the loot was pretty bland. Somehow though, I still put 50 hours into it because there was something there.Six months on, and the game is practically unrecognisable. New areas, systems, characters, pvp, loot types and dungeons have been added. All characters have recently been rebalanced and seem fun to play. For players who like to play a single character there is an interesting prestige system which allows multiple playthroughs on one character and for altoholics like me, there is a hero synergy system which adds decent benfits depending on which characters you have leveled.Combine all of this with one of the most responsive dev teams I have ever seen in the MMO space and an extremely friendly community and you have a really excellent game. Highly recommended. "

												The Marvel Universe has a character for everyone to enjoy, and you can pick from a lot of them from here, and the list is growing still.  The gameplay is fun and satisfying, I don't notice much of a grind just loving running around smashing AIM goons' faces in with elbow drops from She Hulk or an uppercut from Ant Man, or just eating them as Venom.  I actually have had more positive interactions with social chats than any other game I have seen, but of course, chats can get toxic as with anything else, be ready for those small moments.  Game is pretty simple, but still has some things to delve into.  You can choose to grind for THE BEST gear, but honestly, you don't need to.  Game is free to play fair, I got two heroes I really liked for free, and played them a lot, but then when I felt like I loved the game, I payed for some inventory and a few more heroes I really wanted. If you like MARVEL this game is great!  If you want to get into MARVEL this is also great!  If you want a time killer with some fun and simple combat Diablo style, also great!If you somehow can only see any game with loot as a farm fest, then no, but then you wouldn't even look at a game like this, let alone a review, right?

												What can i say about this biggest update ever..Biggest nerf and grind ever would be more accurate.The heroes are now tedious to play, their movement has been artificially hindered and its clunky as hell, the game has been systematically removed on everything that made this game a great free to play (free costumes gone, Splinter story boxes gone, Daily login bonuses gone, hotbar gone, boosts nerfed etc, much more) Honestly the teamups are busted, the heroes are neutered the story is now a grind of korean style, omega system has been changed to an epic gring in the infinity system (its infinite and new players will never catch up unless they join now)Everything is now Pay Pay Pay..Latency and servers are just unplayable with 400ms - 4646ms freezes, disconnections and login issues..To be honest do not bother people its become a big no, not trolling its terrible now.

Came back to the game 6 months later, and oh my lord, i am so glad I did. new content is constanly being added, and the developers always have some kind of event going, to keep players happy and interested.If you love all things marvel, get on this game as soon as you can.

												Diablo for comic nerds.  Is there anything better?  It's easy to ignore the flame wars on the social chat by turning it off, but find yourself a good supergroup and you're in like Flynn.  I love the controls, though it is a very click-heavy game (carpal tunnel syndrome will result after too much playing).  The mechanics are fantastic, Gazillion are great with special events and upgrades, and there is continually new content.  For a free-to-play game, they do a fantastic job.  A must have.			"

												Overall this is a really good game.  They have weekly patches that contain events and fixes. New content is added pretty quick compaired to other games.  Crazy amount of heroes to choose from if you pay for them, they can also be aquired in game with currency that drops but it takes 200 - 600 eternity splinters to get (which 1 drops about every 6 minutes). Hero packs are well priced for what items you get with them.  Muptiple costumes for each hero, which is really cool (They can drop but is very rare. Also can be purchased).  This is an ARPG/MMO (Setup similar to Diablo).  The first couple heroes you level will be a bit of a grind, but you really learn how to play the game in that time frame.  I would recommend getting your Crafter and Enchanter leveled up for upgrades as you level. Check this game out if you like ARPG games or MMO style games.  Pick a starter hero for free and try it on!			"

												PROS:-A huge and ever expanding roster of your favorite Marvel heroes-All heroes can be obtain through playing the game-Story mode is a good length and fun to play -Endgame has improved tremendously since launch-Constant updates monthly -New PvP mode-Fun combat-Free-to-PlayCONS:-Game needs solo/group dungeons outside of reusing story mode instances-No hardcore mode-No ladder resetsSCORE: 8THOUGHTS:Let's get right to it. When the game originally launched back in June of this year the reception wasn't great; okay it was bad. The game gave a bad first impression to new players that didn't participated in the beta. Marvel Heroes has a lot of heroes to choose from (27 heroes and counting) and at launch the only way to obtain more heroes outside of rare drops (which were pretty damn rare) were to buy them with real money. Okay, that doesn't sound to bad right? Wrong. The pricing for the heroes were outrageous at the time, costing upwards of $20+ for some of the premium heroes like Iron Man and Spiderman. This left a bad taste in a lot of peoples' mouths. But now, this has all changed. Gazillion Entertainment has listen to their community and brought prices down to much more reasonable levels. Top tier heroes will cost about $9 to buy, much better than $20+ dollars back then. There are packs that may cost more but that's up to the individual on if it's worth it to buy. But the best news was how Gazillion added an ingame currency called, ""Eternity Splinters"" that you can farm and use to purchase the hero that you want, without paying a dime. This was a welcome and needed change. Now players can get every hero in the game just by playing the game!Some of the other things that Marvel Heroes had a bad rap about was the combat was boring and there was nothing to do once you beat the game. Well, Gazillion has been busy reworking heroes and changing visuals and making combat much more exciting this time around. I remember playing Iron Man on launch day and thought to myself that he was kind of weak and dare I say it..boring. But when I came back for update 2.0, Iron Man felt like, well, Iron Man and he was so much more fun to play. The endgame was lacking as well like I mentioned before and once you beat the game you were either running the same terminals over and over to grind to max level or you were leveling an alt. Gazillion has added much more things to do this time around. Along with your daily terminal runs you can also replay the game in two other difficulties, Heroic and Superheroic. Or you can farm items and grind levels on huge maps like Midtown Manhattan with other players or play a survival style game in X-Defense where you protect students from the Xavier School from an invasion. Also, a new addition to the game is PvP called, ""Fire & Ice"", which is still in beta where it's a 5 vs 5 where you protect your giants and attack other players and their giants onto destroying their base to win the match. On top of that, Marvel Heroes is now starting to add more chapters to the game, starting with Chapter 9 in Asgard. In the coming months there will be more additions to Asgard as it expands, for now, we have a small taste of what's to come.Gazillion is doing a tremendous job listening to their players and making changes as quickly as possible to ensure quality. As well, as giving us new content and updates every month. If you played the game when it first came out or are discouraged about its low Metacritic scores, don't be, the game has improved leaps and bounds since then. Gazillion has a determination to make Marvel Heroes the best ARPG ever, you can be sure that greater things lies in store for us in the near future and the best part is that's all free! Give this game a shot (or another shot) and you won't be disappointed.			"

												I tried Marvel Heroes when it first launched and thought it was freemium, pay-to-win garbage. I'd heard it had greatly improved over the last 5-6 months and was much better, so I decided to give it another shot. I'm glad I did.It's a really fun ARPG with frequent content updates, a sane pay model (all purchasable content is either completely cosmetic [costumes, pets] or also available through playing/grinding), regular events (with bonus XP/loot), and a decent loot/crafting system. Although you're playing on servers with other people and while there is support for groups (and talk of raid content coming in a future update), it also seems to be one of the most solo-friendly ARPGs of recent years -- nice for when you're feeling antisocial and just want to grind some loot. Marvel Heroes can be a little rough around the edges in spots but overall it's a really enjoyable game, regardless of how much or how little money you spend on it.			"

												Not bothering going into the 'It's Diablo, but with Mavel!' since everyone else can.  Overall, it's a fun timePro's:-It has Unusuals-It's fun and engaging-Voice cast is great-A lot of contentCon's:-No hats-Havent taken any of the great features from Torchlight or Diablo (pets can sell stuff, good visual item compare, etc)-Pay-2-win in some ways (there's this currency that drops in game every 10 minutes or so that you can use to buy characters, costumes, and these crates that contain super buffed weapons - you can buy crates (cards) that drop the currency so you can buy the crates, and basically never worry about fighting anything)-Horrible grind in other ways (that 10 minutes to get 1 eternity spike when everything costs 40+ spikes is ughhh)-In-game things aren't explained well (Crafters - why should I give the crafter my items? What do the recipes mean? How much are the items worth to the crafter if I donate them? etc)-MMO rather than single player with co-op (It's a con for me because I hate people)-Can't be Agent-X			"

												I play using -nosteam so hours are not accurate. I like this game and play it a ton but it definitely has some flaws as an ARPG. It is held aloft by clever use of the Marvel franchise.ProsGameplay Free to play.Wide array of Marvel characters to choose from, new release monthly. Different types of game modes, up to and including MMO style raids, with varying levels of ""difficulty"" and time commitment.Flavor! Popular classic and new costumes, variant costumes, ENHANCED costumes that do things like gender swap, character swap, power color swap, VA swap. Many Team-ups that can tag along with you. A few cool visual effects you can add to your costume. MMO style build trees with unlimited resets allows some variety in power sets. Plus Omega Point system allowing further stat customization with tons of choices.Cybernetic pets add a small extra possibility for stat customization along with the ability to ""vacuum"" (eat) loot off the ground plus the actual pet following you around when summoned.Design shift towards for easy travel with vehicles, fast running, flying, teleporting at low or no resource cost.Play solo or in a group.GraphicsAt max settings there is a nice colorful style taking the middle of the road between gritty realism and cartoony. The dynamic lighting and shadows are quite nice and the motion blur effect is not overdone. With full effects on this game looks absolutely bonkers. You actually really need to turn them down or you can't even see your own character!Constantly improving character and costumes design. Many older characters are starting to get reworked looks to be of much higher quality than release.AudioBeing an official Marvel approved franchise they have some great known VAs and realistic lines for fully voiced heroes, Team-ups, and villains.Indicators for certain rare drops.Pricing and Misc.You start out with one free hero and by earning in-game currency you can buy any hero or Team-up of your choice without $. Through log-in rewards  you are given enough currency to buy a medium priced hero or Team-up and then other things like bonus exp, power tree resets, and even some special pet and Team-up items after 100+ days.There are multiple special events that run almost constantly with special rewards and/or server side boosts.ConsGameplayAs with any ARPG, grinding is the name of the game. You can buy $ boosts but the drop rate of most things you want is so low you won't feel  an appreciable difference until you have 4 or more $ boosts going.""Difficult"" another trap of the ARPG this is largely based on your gear and Omega points level, not skill. I would say MH falls into artificial difficulty harder than any other MMO and ARPG games I have played. Especially the largely disappointing ""boss"" fights that exist outside of raids that have less to do with the boss and more to do with not standing in stuff on the ground.Balance with 40+ heroes on the roster is a tough job and the variance between top and bottom is quite extreme in both dummy TTKs, live DPS efficiency, and especially TTL. Newer heroes and recently updated heroes are largely better off in all departments. Some old characters excluded from current raid content entirely.Lots of multi-tree heroes only have one build that is considered viable and this is not a problem with power design but simple numbers tuning.Power sets and especially buff durations and debuff durations are becoming completely normalized and homogenized over time. This makes future balance easier but it also makes heroes feel less unique from each other.Some of the game modes have such a lack of reward and tuning that they are abandoned at the moment by the players AND the devs until they can be modified and improved. (X-DEF, Holo-SIM)The stylistic choice of real world size villains is understandable but with some villains and heroes even being the same, and the huge amount of spell effects flying around, tracking combat (mainly where the boss is facing so as not to stand in front of it) can be very difficult.Crafting is outdated and tedious. One of the remnants of release MH from before the 2015 rebranding that is simply too low on the priority totem poll to be adjusted. One of the main crafting ingredients, Runes, have too many rare drop rates for useful Runes and too many completely useless Runes which is both pointless and confusing for new players.Omega system is bloat, most options are useless and it's new player unfriendly. It also encourages EXP farming over loot farming if you want to cap points.GraphicsEverything can be turned off but I'm not sure there is actually much gains for doing so. When I had an older CPU I could play perfectly on the TEST Center but had extreme lag on live, so poor server performance can exacerbate CPU usage of MMO type games which are already notorious for being CPU heavy.AudioAccents tend to be questionable at best and quite inconsistent. The same VA used for multiple characters in some situations and unfortunately it's obvious.A few characters have a disconnect between the mix of eras their look and voice and lines were pulled from. EX: Rogues default look is modern but her voice sounds very young and rebellious and her lines are like OG completely scared of her powers and unable to control them, yet her power set has no instability, She steals and uses whatever she wants whenever she wants.Some characters have a lot more lines than others.Low pool of lines for villains.Pricing and Misc.Expensive. A hero, Team-up , costume is ~$10 per. Boosts ~$1 per hour per. Playing just one hero is not something most people do because you run out of content variety very quickly.Costumes and bank space are $ only.No lowering the price of old content. That means that this old style release costume[i.ytimg.com]  is the same price as this new style 2015 costume[glasscannon.ru]. Team-ups were made the same price as playable heroes because they took the same work, and I respect that in part, it just doesn't make sense from a consumer stand-point for those two things to be the same price.The actual gameplay time involved in getting even one hero or Team-up from free currency is significant.DevelopmentBalance, improvement of older AI, outdated modes, and graphics, restructuring of outdated systems, all take a backseat to new content and the all-important Release Schedule.Hero balance comes in monthly single characters reviews. That means unbalanced heroes remain untouched for over 6 months at a time. But ""OP"" builds get nerfed within a week, and often into oblivion.They clearly had and have a huge vision for the scope, but it comes more and more at the expense of current gameplay. Almost everything from the original release needs to be updated or reworked and this happens much much more slowly than new content which comes with its own issues and bugs.So many bugs reported on TC and purposefully released to live, to be fixed at a later patch date. It seems that Marvel approval interferes occassionally and Gaz is forced to take the blame for it. Some of the devs can talk and act unprofessionally when interacting on social media, making personal and petty insults to customers and taking criticism, while understandably personally, poorly.  "

												Mahval Heroes is a Diablo style rpg that you play as various heroes/anti-heroes from the Marval universe. The game underwent a massive rebuild because the old game was boring, and you didnt get to play who you wanted to. As of now you can play all heroes up to Lv 10 and unlock anyone from the start.Now game play wise I find it to be a very relaxing pick up and play type game, no stressful things like dps gates/hours of required grind. There is alot of variety in the people you can play like Venom who can be a hybrid ranged/melee who is all about regen to Storm who is a walking AoE (Area of Effect) with well storms. Now some heroes are still not up to date to the new current standard of fun but they are being worked on. The cash shop is fairly standard like League of Legends $10 more or less for heroes and costumes (with exeption of ENHANCED that change model voice lines and ability flavor). Small boost comsumables etc.Now the game isnt for everyone if you dont like dungeon crawlers for loot this it not for you. If you are concerned about the END GAME there are raids and cosmic trials/danger room that ups the difficulty, two raids currently in game more on the way. If want to feel powerfull kill tons of goons and get loot this may be the game for youTLDRPros - Most heroes feel strongJust about everything can be earned in gameLarge variety in playable classesDecent storyFor Marval fans lots of fan service between costumes and character interactionsCons - Storage Space is a large problem free players dont get that much (This is they only thing they dont give away in spades)Just starting out everything can be a bit slowIf you have bad RNG it can take a while to get what you want			"

												This game had a bit of a rough start but I can honestly say the team at Gaz has really outdone themselves. Think Diablo with super heroes, what's not to love? Between constant updates and more heroes being released, this game has a ton to offer for no money down. The questing, loot and skill systems have all been vastly revamped and improved in everyway. Many boring heroes are now exciting to play and the newest ones continue to impress as well. There's no P2W model here (pay to win) and you can obtain just about anything you want simply from playing the game (heroes, costumes, etc.).I highly recommend you give it a solid try despite all the negative reviews of which were mostly conceived during the early stages of Marvel Heroes.

												390 hours in and this is still a super fun game.PROS:- It's a free, fun way to pass the time.- They recently added achievements to the game, which is pretty cool for a completionist like me. - This game is a lot like Diablo 3 (which I LOVE) so it's a good game to play when you kinda want to play D3 but are also in a Marvel mood. CONS:- While you do get to play a handful of heroes for free, most of the really neat ones you have to pay for and the prices rarely go down much when they are on sale, either.- Not many new areas to visit past story mode. There are now some ""one shot"" areas but those get boring real fast.			"

												Average Diablo-like that uses exclusive mouse only control.Immersion breaking experience as you watch 30 of the same hero wander by.Zones are open world, you will not be having an instanced Diablo experience like they tote it being. Its just really akward.Your starter heroes are: The Thing, Scarlet Witch, Dare Devil, Hawk Eye, and StormYou will recieve an additional hero after the tutorial, but it seems to be random.As is melee is at a huge disadvantage, turret style bosses rely on tagging them, fleeing, repeating. You won't be slugging it out with them regardless of character.Biggest greivance is there is no hero preview system, you are expected to shell out cash for a new hero or wait for it to random drop before you get to play it.

												Very fun game that I would not put into the ""pay-to-win"" category. Yes there are some benefits to spending real dollars, but all required in-game material can be played for, heroes and costumes includes. You can use real money to take some of the randomness out of what hero/costumes you unlock, or to simply remove the way all together. At the current state of the game you will have 2 free heroes within your first two days. Once for simply trying the game out, the other for you day 2 login reward. You can choose from ALL of the heroes in the game (over 50 at the time of this review) except for  the most recent addition. Very Diablo / Path of Exile like in the loot grind and game design.

												Well, I felt the need to clarify some things as recent reviews have been negative, and there is NO good reason for this.The Draws:A must for Marvel comic fans, as this is very true to the source material, while still including enough of the Marvel Cinematic Universe references to delight the fans of only the movies.The art and banter in this game are fantastic. This game is chock full of flavorful tidbits that delight in every sense.The customization for builds is nearly limitless and the same hero can be in a group with two different builds and feel like two totally different heroes.The endgame is MASSIVE. There are a lot of things to do once at max level, and the game even has options to rerun the level up process for your favorites, with some cool benefits for those who choose to do so.Solid gameplay and controls. This game feels very polished and complete. Brevik's team knows their stuff.The game is genuinely and oftentimes GLORIOUSLY fun.This is how Free-to-Play SHOULD be done. You have access to most things without ever LOOKING at a store to spend real money. If you are willing to put in the time and effort, you can get access to whatever your heart desires (for the most part).The Turn-offs:Lack of fresh content. Though there is a full storyline mode, it feels short (which the game has on 3 difficulty modes, so you run it 3 times to totally complete the story on a character). The One-Shots and Raids have their own storylines, but they are mostly setups to boss fights, and not a ton of character progression. The new Ultron game mode also has a story, but it isn't anything to be impressed about.Depending on who your favorite character is, you may be completely useless in a raid setting, being forced to level up a raid-appropriate character to run on if you wish to participate in raids.Repetition. This game has it. In spades. This game has it. In spades. Repetition.Summary:This game is worth playing through and is a very solid MMO that is fun. There is stuff constantly being added to the game and plenty of events in which to participate. So Assemble your team and get to Smashing.Excelsior!(P.S. Plenty of cameos. Including a few by his royal Generalissimo, Stan The Man.)			"

If you're not sure what it is, it's basically Diablo II with a Marvel theme.That said, the game is undergoing a rather substantial redesign right now (early indications suggest the game is becoming much more like Diablo III and much less like Diablo II).

												A worthy contender to torchlight but with superheroes and villians. This game is in the same genre as diablo and the afermentioned Torchlight. The game is a aciton hack and slash but way more colorful. I am happy that this game came along way. the first version had some big problems mainly the way the heroes worked. You had to buy the hero first and if you didn't like how they played well your screwed. The new system to me rivals smite and is another option for all those who want to go free to play. You can tryout any hero not the newly relase ones but anyone for free up to level 10 and you can choose one you like and they give you that one for free. I am telling y'all it is a great experience and really fun the chaos of the colors can be a problem but just step away for a sec. The game does support controllers and you can map the buttons anyway you want. I can go on all day but as a warning there seems to be a lack of content and considering it is MMO is kinda dishearting but dude you can play deadpool stomping a mudhole in loki's ♥♥♥ while spidergwen assist you in the murder just go have a ball.

												I recommend this game to people that are in to Marvel and MMO style games. The game is well designed and has a mixture of both action and humor. You do not have to invest a lot of money in this game like you do with most games in this style (such as Final Fantasy and World of Warcraft).It is a great game to play with friends, but you rarely have the ability to make friends on here. Most people keep to themselves and do not bother others. There is so much to do allowing there to be endless fun. Now that all that is said, I will now address the small downsides to the game. The graphics have a lot of stress on a computer. I recommend lowering the settings. If you are not sure exactly what to lower, you just need to hover your cursor on the text and the game will tell you what the option does and if lowering it would help.The game is rather confusing at first. The 'tutorial' at the beginning should explain more than it already does. It only explains how to move, attack, and things like that.The game can get rather boring without friends. There is a lot of options to do, but most are very much alike. Over all, this game is very worth getting. I highly recommend it.			"

												Upon the release of the new Travelling update, and another dozen or so hours of the game under my belt, I decided to revisit my review.If you're a comic book lore-lord, there's probably plenty of fanservice and fun bits to sink your teeth into. Plenty of opportunity to play as heroes or villains that aren't often playable in games.For someone that doesn't have any sort of emotional investment in Marvel though, it's....pretty average. The core gameplay loop is more entertaining than what Diablo 3 is doing these days, since there's a fair amount of variety in what you can do for end-game progression. Rather than provide you an endless progression ladder in the form of Greater Rifts as in Diablo 3, Marvel Heroes offers multiple acceptable paths for leveling, and several systems to interact with to gather gear, some of which is harder than others. The power curve is a little smoother - Diablo 3 has you feeling useless until you collect set items, at which point you power increases exponentially, whereas Marvel Heroes is content to let you feel strong right away, with some higher difficulty content gated off until you've reached certain gear thresholds that vary from character to character. Since we've already gone into the diablo comparison - Blizzard put a lot more love into their spell effects and making sure everything has a nice, meaty feeling of impact. Spell effects and the way your abilities interact with the enemies can leave you feeling impotent at times, even if some of the spells or skills have large or flashy graphics associated with them. In general, the aesthetics are lacking a certain level of polish. Characters in Diablo can generally succeed without someone 'tanking' the hits, since if you're not powerful enough to manage without something distracting the enemy, you're playing on the wrong difficulty anyway. Marvel Heroes has a 'team-up' system that lets you call-in a sidekick of sorts, which serve different utility purposes - some may tank for you, using their abilities to quickly jump into the fight and stun or slow foes, giving you time to kill them or control them yourself before they've leapt into your face. Characters that don't need a tank or can summon one as one of their innate abilities are free to take a team-up that can debuff the enemies, or simply add to their DPS. I'd say it's a nice middle-ground between the mercenary system present in Diablo 2 and 3, as you have many viable options that can fit a variety of roles depending upon your needs.The travel system has been dramatically improved. Before this most recent patch, you had to spend points in your travel power, and it started off with a base speed of 500, barely faster than your default running speed. Now you are automatically granted a travel power at level 10, and you can assign it a dedicated button independent of your hotbars. Better yet, it doesn't take away any of your skill points, and now everyone has a power granting them a movement speed of 650, which feels great. Heroes that can teleport still have a movement advantage, but with this travel update, the game still feels plenty playable and satisfactory, even if you can only run around on foot.The game follows the korean MMO model of inventory management. That is to say, they give you a pretty small inventory and a pitiful stash size to work with, and then procede to shower you with more loot than you know what to do with. There are systems in place to help alleviate this, such as automatically trashing items below certain quality thresholds, and a pet system that requires you to feed them large volumes of drops in order to make them more effective at what they do for you, but this is a band-aid at best. Finding items doesn't feel cool, because there's so many stats, variables, and levers that each gearslot can be pulling, that comparing a new drop to what you're wearing feels tedious. Even after a few dozen hours of play, the best solution I've found is to ignore anything that's not at least ""cosmic"", and generally only spend time evaluating new items if there's a large level gap in what i'm wearing vs what just dropped, or if it's unique and has stat bonuses or perks specific to the character i'm playing as.Costumes are pretty expensive, too. They're asking roughly $10 for a single costume wearable by one hero, which is out of the impulse buy range for most people, myself included. You are also only allowed one free hero per account. To be fair to them, they do have a form of in-game currency that can be used to buy new heroes, and the drops feel slightly generous - between what you pick up in the course of regular play, and what you're awarded for doing side-quests as you work through the main story, you can expect that you'll be able to buy one new hero just about every time you level a character from 1-60, assuming you do so using the campaign. It's worth mentioning that the side quests are pretty grindy and depend upon random spawns and timed events to complete, which can be tedious to wait for and complete. I suspect that this is by design, giving you a way to measure whether it's worth your time to get this secondary source of splinter income, or just drop some cash on heroes.For what it's worth, there's daily login rewards too, and on your 7th day of logging in, you get a large sum that's enough to buy 1 or 2 heroes. If there's anything in this game that encourages you to keep going, it's the drop system they've implemented so you can unlock more heroes. On every 10th and 30th day thereafter, you get a login bonus of 10 shards too, which really starts to add up.As a paid title, I'd be wary of recommending it. But it's free to play, and has a pretty ethical (albeit expensive) business model that never sells you in-game power. If you like the Marvel universe or don't consider yourself above playing an average callback to games like Diablo, Torchlight, and Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, it couldn't hurt to install this and give it a shot.

												I have seen negative reviews of this game when it first released.One night I was bored, and decided to dig in to Marvel Heroes.I am glad I did, and even though it is years later. That may be the best thing. Now they have a preview option for the characters before perming your choice. I had lag in one instance, however upon going to another it was cured within the same game. The beatem up linear style is usually something I am against. But due to the MMO style fan base where you can see others, and have them help you along your journey makes it even more entertaining allowing it to go above passable.The loot system to me is a bit complex, but I played MMO's when Warcraft was first releasing so I may be out of my league until I get more up to snuff which I am sure will happen easily with time. That isn't a fault on the system, just me failing to easily become familier with it in a quick amount of time.The end game seems decent enough, I have yet to achieve it due to the level cap and how long it takes to reach it with a single character. However I hear very good things, and if that isn't your flavor you can always swap characters trying a new one out.One downside as with most Free to Play titles, is after you choose your character. You only get one character, that you can fully level up. With out putting in some good amount of time, or money you will be stuck to this character. So make sure you choose wisely and test each one to ensure your good experience.Path of Exile with Marvel. That is what it feels like to me, maybe even a bit simplified which isn't a bad thing.Best game I have seen Free To Play wise, and with a controller it is a fun way to spend some hours messing around at the very least. I would give this game a try even for casual beat em up fans, that have some what of a back ground in being a Marvel fan. Because the Marvel cosmetic really keeps the game fresh to another extent. At least it does for me.			"

												It's like Diablo III if you had 50 character classes to play from. Each character playes different enough that you don't get sick of playing. Free 2 Play done right. No ""pay to win"" and almost everything you can buy can be earned in game in some way (with the exception being stash space, but I hear they are working on that)Give it a try. It can be a bit daunting to start but stick with it and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.			"

												For free or low-spending players, this game is great to experience, but might not be one you stay with. The heros are pricey for anyone who feels the desire to collect, BUT you can play with ANY and ALL heros up until they are level 10, and to progress further you either buy them or use points you very slowly collect in the world.It's like Marvel Ultimate Alliance, except that each hero has far more depth and diversity within their skill trees, so like a mix between that and Diablo 2.Happily, your first fully unlocked hero can be ANYONE. Don't just consult any simple list of ""reccommended"" starter heros, you can go my route and unlock Rogue, who can steal powers from ANY other character in the game, giving you a first character that is amazingly diverse. Then I had enough points to unlock Emma Frost for free, and she can mind control any minion or monster in the game to be her persistant pet/bodyguard.  :))))I LOVE this game.			"

												I have played this game far too much since it's release, and it's come a long way since then! Six months ago I would've not recommended this game and not given it a second thought. I'm really glad I decided to pick it up again recently, all of the new additions to the game have made it much more fun and a bit addicting. I'm often hesitant about free to play games of this style as I have found they usually tend to have a large amount of important content that needs to be bought to really play the entire game. I have found that's really not the case here. While there may be a few convenience issues for non-paying players (primarily in STASH space) the payment model is actually quite fair, with nearly everything in the game available through in-game currencies, including every hero and team-up hero. If you like the Marvel universe, or ARPGs in general you should definitely give it a shot.			"

												Game started out with little to do other than level your Gazillion characters after post game on a boss run. Since release the game has improved with their monthly patches adding more to the story and endgame content to make grinding less monotonous with multiple ways to level and find loot. Developers listen to the community and constantly makes improvements with to the heroes and game play. Starting Hero's are decent but be careful. Once you select one of the starters you will have to stick with that one until you find one via the drop system or buy one via collecting shards in game or real money. I think they should give you 2 starts to try to avoid slight stress on what to pick first. It's a fun game. I would give it a shot if you want Diablo with Marvel characters. I spend a few hours on it a week. Its a good time killer if anything. I expect this game to grow and maybe reach enjoyment and serious levels of an mmo like DC Universe Online. Also there is no cow level :p			"

												Really good MMO , the best isometric RPG in steam (own opinion dont cry).It has SO many characters (around 58 last time i checked) and you have the choice to use all of them up to level 10, so you have a bit of play with each one of them and get to know their powers, style, etc.The story line is incredible and very understandable even if you aint a marvel fan (have you been living under a rock?) although i must say if you are not used to mmo´s its going to be a tough run the first 15 levels,specially if you want to fight in Midtown Manhattan (MM).Overall a great game for mmo lovers and marvels fans. you do not have to pay to play but if you do want to buy costumes or uncap new characters it will cost you in-game money... to be fair they deserve atleast their micro transactions for making such a good game.11/10 #Teamironman			"

												I've been playing this game off and on since Beta, and it's one that I've grown to be very happy with. Marvel Heroes 2016 is not the Marvel Heroes that was released straight out of Beta. When I first played it I wasn't sure if I really liked it. I would have given it mediocre at best. But as it stands today with the amount of content it offers, this is quite possibly the best Free-to-Play game on the market - especially if you're an ARPG fan as I am.Yes, I said Free-to-Play and NOT Pay-to-win. Just about everything (if not all) in Marvel Heroes is attainable in some form or another without needing spend a single dime. But I do admit it can be time consuming, and if you're hoping to get a specific costume for free then pray to RNGesus. I put money into the game because it's a game that I love and believe deserves it. The only thing I still don't agree with are the costume prices, but at least they have no bearing on gameplay or how well you perform. I've played just about all the current ARPG games out now and Marvel Heroes is still my favourite. It offers a cast of characters that I love, gameplay that is really addicting and fun, and varied modes that keeps it refreshing. At some point I'm sure I'll wander off to play something else, but I know I'll eventually be back for more.			"

												I was introcduced to the game by my son, who was looking for something free to play and fun. And boy oh boy it is just that. There is so much to do and anyone who likes a diablo style of game will enjoy this immensely. In fact having diablo 3 and this I would much rather play this game. The artwork is fantastic, very well done yet still feels like the comics from where the game came from. There is so much to do and so many characters, I doubt it will be a game that you bore from quickly. 10/10			"

												This is Diablo 2's true spiritual successor. Forget PoE and Diablo 3.  This is Diablo 2 set in the Marvel Universe and feels much more fresh than D3 or PoE due to it's visual style, setting, and combat system (lol @ D3).  Upgrades come frequently, and there's a very definite path to acquire upgrades.  Not as customizable as D2 or PoE, but there is enough to keep you busy.  Oh, and lets add in mmo style raids in an Action RPG.  Free to play and pay for convenience is the name of this game.  And an awesome system to leveling alts that every MMO should copy.			"

												When Marvel Heroes first came out in 2013, I didn't really think much of it.  The P2W aspects were completely in your face, the grind was horrendous, it paled in comparison to Path of Exile and even Diablo 3, and it just wasn't fun.Three years later...dear god.  I've never seen a game go from a 50 to a 100 in such a way.  It is very clear that Gazillion has immense passion for this game, and it shows.  So many things have improved, and now Marvel heroes is easily one of my favorite ARPGs ever.Pros:- Over 50 iconic Marvel characters, each brought to life by excellent VA and superb writing.- While several characters are similar to each other, they're all unique in their own way just enough to make each new character a new experience.- TRULY free to play. Back in 2013, getting new heroes without shelling out real money was a pipe dream at BEST. You could only get them by finding Hero Tokens that had a .01% chance of dropping.  Now, however, every Hero and Team Up can be purchased with Eternity Splinters, which generally drop from every 10th enemy or so.  The prices are reasonable, and the payoff is well worth it.  But as for real money, this is pretty much the ONLY F2P game I have no problem spending money on, because I honestly believe the devs DESERVE it for all the hard work they've put into it.- Extremely flexible gameplay. Most of the ""big"" ARPGs tend to be gated by having endgames that completely decimate you if you didn't build your character's skills and/or stats in an EXACT way.  Marvel Heroes though?  You can do whatever and you won't get penalized!  Want to make Doctor Doom or Ultron pure ranged DPS and not a summoner?  Go ahead!  Want to make Cyclops melee only?  No problem!  The list goes on, and the possibilities are near endless.- Extremely active dev team and community: Like I said, Gazillion clearly has passion for this game.  Every other week, a new event goes live that grants you unique content, such as items, costumes and even Team Ups.  Their 3rd anniversy this past June was, in my opinion, one of the best MMO events I've ever taken part in.- The new level scaling system.  Not only does it make leveling much less stressful, but it also keeps everything at a consistent challenge level.  No more breezing through each Hero's ""Vs Doctor Doom"" achievement for you.  Now you have to WORK to beat him before the three minute mark!Cons:- Maybe this is just me, but ever since the Avengers Tower revamp, several areas tend to be very lag heavy.  Or maybe this one's just my internet connection.- March to Axis is WAY too hard!  If you ever read this, Gaz, please consider toning down the health for the HYDRA Hulkbusters.  Or at the very least, get rid of the massive dps AoE they use when at half health!- Still no Ultron achievement for the steam version.  Hopefully it will be added when Angela goes live.Overall verdict: 9/10			"

												This is possible the best game out there right now, ergo that's why loads of people play it. It's short told a Diablo-game the way Diablo 3 should have been. It's Diablo 3: Marvel Universe Edition. The CEO of Gazillion was the guy that worked on both Diablo 1 and Diablo 2.It had a rough start, as all MMOs do. And Gazillion has done so many great things since launch. Improved it extremely much.It's a F2P game in which you choose from 9 heroes(previously 5) at the start, then you run through the game in story mode, and you get to about level 22-24. Then you can either run the story two more times in order to get to max level, which is 60. Or you can start doing PvP at around level 20(but it's still in in beta), it has this MOBA-style map and combat, and more to come. You can start doing terminal, which is essensial dungeons which you recognize from the game, when you ran through it in story mode. Two types of terminals are currently in the game, green and red. Red being the harder version of the terminal.While you play you will have several drops that are mighty important. Eternity Splinters is the in-game currency in which you can buy and unlock more heroes, and you can buy gear and respec potions for it. I'm told you should get at least 1 ES within 8 minutes, and you have more ways to improve this. Other drops that are important is relics, which drops after you get level 25. These stack to about 1000 and will increase your characters stats by alot and the type of your choice - even when you're not playing that spesific character you can still ""boost"" the stats of the character.After level 25 you will also be granted legendary quests, which drops alot of experience, money and most importantly Odin marks. Marks can be traded in for legendary items, items that level up with you, and get extremely good at rank 5(5 levels).All the heroes play differently, and they are working to get several build options for each that is viable. It's so fun to be a part of this game, and Gazillion really listens to the community. And has some really cool heroes coming(Ghost Rider, Nightcrawler, Beast, X-23++), and the next chapter of the Asgard patch will deliver loads of things, raid is one of them.Several friends of mine play, and some are quite surprised and angry with themselfs that they didn't get into this game earlier. I'm throwing all my money into this, because I do support a good game, and wouldn't want to stop the fun factor of it, supporting and funding the game all I can, but you don't really have to!			"

												I only recommend this game because it is free, as initially it was a lot of fun and it is very addictive, but the replay value just wasn't there for me and the in game items are laughably overpriced (Unlock Ultron + his skin from the movie = £15, £6 for one skin). The characteristations of the heroes are excellent, they are all represented very well in terms of their powers and how they use them for example as Spiderman you will be swinging and flipping everywhere at warp speed, as Hulk you will be plowing through everything, as Ultron you will be spawning waves of drones to fight for you etc and as I said initially this is great fun. My main issue with this Diablo style gameplay is that there is simply no skill whatsoever involved, endless waves of enemies come at you and you simply demolish them one after another, the only enemies that even require you to dodge their attacks are 2 or 3 of the ""boss"" villains, the rest of the game you can just stand directly in the middle of a full screen of enemies clicking the left mouse button and if your health starts to drop just press ASDFGH and you will have killed every enemy on screen and regenerated all your health (don't believe me? give it a try!)Also it's not an mmorpg, it's basically a single player game with a chat box. Nobody does anything together (you don't need to) and there is no interaction between players save the global chat.It's fun as a Marvel roleplay experience to a certain extent, but after you have reached level 60 and completed the story there isn't anything else to do unless you like grinding. If you are confused because this sounds like a negative review, it is. The only reason I recommend the game because it's fun for the first few hours and it's free so if your connection is quick enough that you can stomach the 20gig download for a few hours of running around as Captain America then give it a try!

												Of all the ARPGs I've played lately, this one does an amazing job of making you feel like a total badass. If you're looking for legitimate, tension-filled challenge, play Path of Exile, if you're looking to be a friggin' Superhero and pound some bad guys, play this. Lots of great voice acting, lots of character customization, fun comic book style cutscenes. In terms of F2P, this game is very generous. You can try out every character up to a low level cap, and purchase them with an in-game currency or with real cash. The in-game currency always comes at you at a regular pace so if you keep playing you will be able to get the hero you want. Quite often there are events that give you free heroes and other free cash shop stuff. Right now, just logging in gets you Luke Cage for free since his TV series just hit Netflix.			"

Stay tuned.... though none of you will. =POriginal Review--Ignore for nowGames--analog or digital--should, in some merry measure: 1) challenge and make you improve in useful ways, 2) facilitate social growth and interaction, and 3) entertain.... Or at least slow down mental and social decay.Being your typical inbred AAA title, Marvel Heroes 2016 does none of these things: it provides a mindless, skilless, souless, and solo timesink.Will someone please put the Multiplayer back into... eh...

												With a huge roster of Marvel superheroes - and after some serious game-improving patches over the last year - this is a Diablo-like fans of the genre wouldn’t want to miss. You pick from a decent handful of starter heroes, like Punisher, Black Widow, Captain America, Colossus or Storm, then go about fighting through a nine-chapter campaign either by yourself or with friends. If you’ve ever played Diablo, Torchlight or other games in the genre, this is exactly like that except a bit more bombastic. Overpowered doesn’t even begin to describe how it all feels, but it fits the topic well.As you play, an in-game currency drops with regularity which can be used to unlock additional heroes. Or, if you’re impatient, you can buy more heroes with real money. But I’d recommend just saving up the in-game currency for the hero you want, it doesn’t take that long. Once you finish the campaign, you can replay it on increasing difficulty levels for better drops, or hit up a variety of end-game content types like horde-style holo missions. There’s even high-level raids, but those require max-level characters and a firm understanding of how to play.Before the “2015” patch, I was hesitant to recommend Marvel Heroes to anyone. But to Gazillion’s credit, they’ve overhauled the game dramatically, and now it’s a must-play in my book.			"

												TLDR: Marvel Heroes is an excellent ARPG, and is well worth the download.The Good:-Free to play, and not Pay to Win. You can earn everything in game without cash. Including costumes (however, costumes are extremely time prohibitive to earn, and random besides.)-Large roster of playable characters, with a new character coming out every month.-Older characters don't get forgotten, every month an older character also recieves a review pass, ensuring that they're keeping up with the new guys.-Tons of stuff to do, including pvp, terminal missions, neverending zones with progressive difficulty ramp, story mode, one-shot story lines (side stories not related to the main storyline), numerous items to farm, several collectable currencies, crafting, enchanting, etc.-Characters often have multiple builds that work efficiently.-""Team Up"" sidekick characters with multiple skill paths add variety.-Constant updates, with significant progress, and a willingness to listen to the playerbase.The Bad-Story mode gets repetitive, however several story quests give permanent bonuses to your character, forcing you to complete them if you want to max everything out.-The fortune card system is just aweful, and needs to be rethought.-PVP is still in 'beta' and needs a lot of polish.-The sheer number of Iron Man costumes taking up my stash space.-Some costumes are just re-colored versions of the original.The Fugly-It can get repetitive. Of course, it Is an ARPG, where repetitive is the name of the game....-Grouping and guilds need more content, which is starting to be adressed with the release of raids.-Pvp.-Stash space is bought with real money only, making it the only thing not attainable through in game means.In conclusion, I think Marvel Heroes is the perfect backup game, the game you play when you want to take a break from The Elder Scrolls Online, or League of Legends, or whatever it is that floats your boat. The way it's built, and the rate at which it's being actively developed, even if there's something you hate, if you come back a month or two later, odds are if it isn't fixed, it's at least different. I've been playing since closed beta, and have gone through spurts where MH is my main game, and spurts where I'm addicted to other games, and go back to MH when I get bored. It's kinda like your wife, really. When you get tired of your hot mistress, you can count on her being there, waiting for you at home, with your dinner ready for you.			"

												This game is an innovator. Like anchovies and cherry Jell-O, Marvel Heroes has dared to combine two ingredients that were conventionally kept separate: MMOs and ARPGs (aka Diablo-style games). Any challenge, story, or sense of skillful execution that previously existed in the ARPG genre has been thoughtfully removed from the game, so that the player may enjoy a more pure experience of applying their mouse skills onto a screen that is marvelously flashing. Nostalgia seekers rejoice! The talent trees in Marvel Heroes have rolled back the clocks on modern MMO talents that focus on important decisions and noticeable changes to gameplay. Instead they embrace the charm and whimsy of early-era talent trees that provide incremental damage increases and minor improvements to existing abilities. Don't worry about needing an abacus to figure out the talent trees though, it's literally almost impossible to make a decision of any sort as you fill in the points.The challenging and exciting dungeon crawl experience that we all remember from the peak of the MMO era lives on Marvel Heroes. The challenge of coordinating carefully and skillfully with your team mates to overcome incredible odds has been seamlessly replaced with the challenge of racing to keep up with your team as you all swing, slide, teleport, and sprint for the center of the next room. And you'd best master your simple movement ability quickly! You want to get to the next room while enemeis are still standing so you can begin pressing your strongest AOE attack! It makes colors!While the excitement of hard-earned triumph is only a faint memory, the pulce-pounding thrill we felt as we peeked into a slain monster's treasure horde has been generously shmeared across the entire experience so that it never violently peaks like that again. This leads to a very mellow, constant influx of unexciting rewards. Ideal for today's anxiety-prone gamers.Take a step away from the pressure of needing to learn complex ""mechanics"" in your game. I don't even know what a carburetor is. Something in bread that makes you fat? Whatever, leave the science to the ""hardcore"" gamers. Sit back, prop up your mouse hand, and take a stroll with a reasonable approximation of some of your not-quite-favorite ""super"" ""heroes"".			"

												This game, is one of my favourite F2P games I have played for a long long time. Besides Warframe, I enjoy this game HIGHLY, because of this lush enjoyment and it's variety. As a fan of Marvel and Comics in General, I love seeing the references to Marvel's Lore and all sorts of Marvel things, which makes this game the more entertaining.This game is said to be similar to Diablo III, which I haven't played so I cannot comment. Though I have played for only a short few hours (In game terms, it would be short), I have so far had fun with the Hero I had started to play with, as well as the one who I am currently levelling along side with my Mid 30's Gambit char (I got Gambit, Punisher (Defunct) and Psylocke). That being said, it can be quite a bore just levelling, but then again, this is minor due to the variety this game gives.A few cons for me would be the Eternity Splinters, the alternative to the Pay To Win route in this game. I admit, I paid for Gambit and Psylocke because both of these characters was a major want for me. But, for something like a Team Up char, I want to use the in game alternative. Why am I complaining? because the spawns are set on a timer and they only ever spawn once every few minutes (Sorry I do not know the specifics) and you can't farm. That's fine, but I really think they should atleast add extra splinters for reasons like increased difficulty boss fights, X-Defense etc.Another would be some forms of repition, mostly because sometimes the Midtown patrol spawns the same bosses or the same enemies without giving you more challenge. This is minor, because it can be fixed wiht a simple difficulty change from Normal to Heroic (Hard).Overall, I really enjoy this game, and thats suprising because I never always liked Free To PLay games (AHem. APB. I am looking at you.) and I never liked Pay to Win, but this Pay to Win is a good system.			"

												The game seems good.  I actually recommend trying it.Controls are choppy.   There is also something else I can't quite put my finger on but the game couldn't hold my attention more than a couple hours.  It's a weird one for me.  But just how it makes me feel I have to give a down.			"

												I was enjoying this game although as of late they have been releasing patches which have caused so many issues for me and have ruined my enjoyment of the game.  Between the server dropping me as a player several times in the one raid they have available and whil working through the leveling process on other characters.  So after spending a regrettably long period of time play this game and investing a reasonable amount of money into it I think it is time to put it on the shelf and come back to it in a years time or never.

												Funish diablo clone, play as your favorite marvel hero's (If they're implemented), I would reccomend against spending money though, especially towards buying heroes, they change things often enough that after about 2-3 months the hero you bought will turn to ♥♥♥♥ in your hands, but if you didn't spend any money you didn't lose anything right? Consider yourselves lucky.			"

												This game has had very little development within the last 2 years.  All of the things that are coming ""soon"" are about 50% likely to see the light of day, in my experience.  The game that is here is not terrible, but it is very dry and quickly stales.  I regret the money I have spent in this game and every time I get hope for what is coming it either gets ""indefinitely delayed"" or comes out so broken I cant enjoy it.  I have played since beta.

												Not quite as polished as Diablo 3, but it brings a hectic, arcade environment that is hugely entertaining. Heroes all play significantly differently, and there is a huge amount of replay value as well as regular content updates. After playing through normal mode, I had no problem picking up some in game purchases to support the game. Try it!			"

												Wow yeah, where to start.I will give this game a fair review from my perspective.This f2p game is actually quite good since you can get all the things in the game without paying for anything except for stash, with that said you will have to invest alot of hours into it that way.There is alot of Heroes to choose from, some are unique, some heroes got the same skill as another but reskinned and some are just uninteresting.The power effects that the heroes have are in most cases really good, it looks good to destroy the screen with lightning, magic and laser beams.This game is an arpg much like Diablo 2, it got a story mode, it got kill everything you see zones, it got raids and diffrent levels of difficulties.Everything which will feel very repetitive after awhile as you are trying to get the item drops that you want.I can't help to feel that this game is shallow somehow and I have tried to like this game but it just doesn't connect with me.Then we have the store in this game.It is really, really overpriced and I don't see an excuse to why it is that expensive.If you want to unlock all the characters in this game without spending alot of hours, then it will have the same price as 3-4 AAA games at release. This game is good for being a f2p game but it's not that good that it will overshadow 3-4 AAA games worth of price just to have access to the whole game, as in being able to play all of the heroes.Stash will be your biggest problem as a f2p gamer in this game, you will not be able hold alot of items in this game as a f2p gamer.You have several diffrent relics that drops, runes, artifacts, crafter items, gear and what not.Trust me it will fill your singel free stash space quickly and yes stash space costs you real money.So now to a problem I stumbled upon in this game is the very sensitive nature of the chat in this game.If you invest money in this game then stay away from the social/public chat in this game because your opinion or something that you wrote might very well be taken out of context and have you banned, either 7 days ban or permanently.This server is hosted in the USA and their ''freedom of speech'' is heavily moderated.Don't engage in religion, political, racist or sexist discussion or jokes, someone somewhere is going to get butthurt.Someone might report you and you might lose all your invested money into the game if you get permanently banned.That is going to sting since the store prices are really overpriced.I got banned for 7 days for something I wrote that was cut out of its context and thus the text I wrote was seen as hate speech, admittadly I did have poor choice of wording and that together with cutting my sentence out of its context that the rest of the chat was invested in got me banned.I fooled around in chat like I do in several other games but never have I been even warned or banned for that matter in my whole life as a gamer.My best guess is that I have never been playing on server hosted outside of Europe and thus never felt the crazy restraint of speech before like I have done from a server hosted in the USA.As an exampel I did some research about it and found that a guy got 7 days banned from writing in the chat that ''Hulk is gay'', whether or not that is true I can't confirm but I wouldn't be suprised if it was.I am thankful and happy to be living in Europe and God bless all the nations in it and the people.TL;DR:  Test the game you might like it but don't engage in the chat about outwordly things even if the chat is called SOCIAL, some americans are very touchy.I don't recommend this game because for me its a money grabbing game but it's worth a try if you truly go f2p.If you decide to spend money in the game then for the sake of your wallet don't engage with the chat, you might get banned.

												The game is good despite the developers incompetence. The forum moderation is heavy handed to say the least with any actual or perceived criticism of the game met with bans. They constantly promise things then don't deliver on them, There hasn't been any real end game content in over 16 months.  Customer service is awful to put it nicely and they constantly use false advertising, release new heroes that aren't even finished, and is generally a poorly ran company and game.For a game with crappy graphics it runs horrible as well. Poorly optimized. If none of this bothers you, give it a try.			"

												If you want to play this style of game, Torchlight II owns this. Found ti to be ridiculous seeing 100 versions of my character. The mechanics are ok, but not great. The graphics are incrediably dated, was very disapointed. THe owning of heroes is a con, should have just charged a one off fee for the base game and made expansion packs for the characters, and not at the insane prices that are on offer in its current format. Know when you are being ripped off people. This should have been marvel meets WoW/Swtor style of mmo, or even reinvneted the genre, this is a basic game, for the eventual money you will pay out, due to the boredom of the free ones.I for one, gutted. THis could have been a good title.5/10			"

												I started out not really getting this game or having a solid idea of why it could be fun.  Honestly the idea of lots of the same heroes running around a zone with the same skills seemed a bit weak.  It took a good friend of mine to push me into playing the game that I started to understand the underlying mechanics of the game.My advice to those of you still on the fence.  For a free game this is a great game, hell for a pay to play game this is a great game.  Give it a try and pay attention to the crafting, pets, sidekicks and hero bonuses and you will start to see the depth and the level of customization that is possible.Have fun!			"

												This game ranks as one of the best free to play games on Steam as of this writing.A game similar in feel and gameplay to the Diablo and Torchlight games, only you get to play through as your favorite Marvel heroes (and a few villains) - with new characters being introduced regularly. The initial character selection is limited to a few basic heroes, but complete the story mode and you will unlock another random hero for free. Additionally, while you can pay real money to unlock any hero you want (as well as customizing them with various costumes), you can earn every hero in the game for free by collecting Eternity Splinters that drop from time to time.Gameplay is pretty straightforward. Click on an enemy to attack them, with up to six special ability hotkeys (and plenty of skills to choose from). One downside is that many heroes play very similarly at the earlier levels, though you do begin to see some differences as you progress and unlock new abilities, with every hero having a unique ultimate attack that can be unlocked and upgraded.Loot is a big draw here. Like all Diablo-style games, loot will drop regularly and in the familiar rarities (grey garbage, white normal, green uncommon, blue rare, purple epic) as well as a few others (yellow cosmics, red artifacts, gold uniques). Old loot can be sold or 'donated' to a shopkeeper which will, over time, upgrade that shopkeeper so that he or she will offer better items or services.Another benefit of this game is that there are many events that take place which offer chances to get items for free that you might otherwise have to pay for. And speaking of paying for items... this is hardly a 'pay to win' game. Sure, you can pay for an experience boost if you want to level up faster, or you can pay for a potion that will give you a better chance at scoring really good loot, but most pay items are cosmetic. Costumes, pets, and so forth. And while pets can give you small boosts to your stats over time, you can earn free pets that do the same thing.While it isn't exactly breaking any new ground or stepping into new territory, Marvel Heroes is a great game to pass the time either solo or with friends, and if you ever get stuck, the community is generally quite helpful to newer players. I'd recommend this game to anyone, even non-gamers.			"

												I personally love everything Marvel so I love everything about this game, except the fact that you need to pretty much pay to get multiple heroes past level 10 but it's by no means as bad as other games with microtransactions, especially since this game is free, so the developers need to get their money somewhere. If you like Marvel, get this game, if you are indifferent about Marvel, get it anyway and see what you think of it, if you hate Marvel... yeah, this probably isn't the game for you.			"
