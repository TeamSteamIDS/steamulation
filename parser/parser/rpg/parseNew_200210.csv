												At one point this was my fav game ive ever played and then the devs got bought by kabam and kabam made this a pay to win like no other. and pretty much all the old players quit, and you can tell kabam only wants money from this.    sad to see that happen to one of my use to be fav games.r.i.p   Realm Of the Mad God(EDIT for those who dont really understand)ok i admit its all 100% a pay to win.its more of a pay to have fun, and make any real progress.pets to heal you, regen all your stuff, and attack for you, gotta pay to make them work.theres, backpacks,potions, item drop enhancers, very powerful items right off from the start. only way you can get any of these is with money. NOW , i wouldnt mind, skins, colors, things like that you know? like the old days of this game.			"

												The game WAS amazing....back then.Before when Wild-Shadow-Studios owned the game the game was made for the players. As soon as kabam took over they completly ruined the game. To explain what they ruined: Ruined Ammys making them scammys, Making UT's untradeable, so we cant make back your ingame currency and finnaly, Making it pay to win-what do i mean by pay-to-win? they have implemented the feature to get items with real money, which makes the game no fun, as newbies will completely mistake the game and over take us long time players.if you dont pay you wont win.Over all if you think im out of my mind, im not, ive played the game for over 600 hours, Im a red star,and ive lost over 20 max stat charecters most of them where 6/8 and gave over 2000 fame. I also own a guild.Before when Wild Shadow Studios owned it- 120/10-------------Now because of Kabam- 4/10------Because of this i do not recommend this game anymore.			"

												Before you say I have no experience with this game, I have played for a good few hundred hours on the browser version.This game USED to be good. It really was. Back then, a company called Wildshadow owned the game. It was truly f2p, with skill and no money required.Then, a company called Kabam took over. They changed the game into a cashgrab. Skins? Buy gold. Vaults and characters? Buy gold. 1-life weapons or keys? Buy gold. Everything is gold gold gold. Updates are rare, and even when they come they just add more items to be purchased with gold. In fact, the way they 'celebrate' holidays is by creating cheap weapon reskins for more people to buy with.. you guessed it, gold!!You might be thinking, at least there's player interaction! No, there isn't. The game is infested with hackers, scammers, enemy draggers, spambots, etc. Kabam doesn't care at all. After all, you don't make any money from clearing away hackers, so why bother?TL;DR: Stay away.			"

												Used to play this back on Kongregate (I believe it was on there) and a bit when it came on Steam. Was probably the best perma-death RPG game you could find. Didn't have demanding PC requirements, cool and clean pixelated visuals, easy-to-pick up hard-to-master bullet hell-style gameplay. Overall, it was great fun and I enjoyed my time with it.So I thought this game had died out a while ago (some time since I had played it regularly), but it turns out the game is still going strong...really strong actually. I was pretty excited and saw that this game has the VERY POSITIVE rating on Steam. As I was strolling down to read some of the top reviews, I noticed a new publisher called Kabam in the game's description area. Interesting. So I finally make it to the reviews and what I see is a bunch of negative reviews about how pay-2-win this game is after Kabam took over.I couldn't believe it was THAT bad so I tried it out myself a few weeks ago. Downloaded it through Steam, loaded it up.....Wow. Another example of an amazing game ruined by greedy companies tainting the free-2-play model. No one wonder people are hating on free-2-play games when we got so much greedy companies these days. But Kabam really butchered this game. Everything good requires money. Skill is irrevelant. I can't believe they actually managed to take the skill factor out of a bullet-hell game. What's the world coming to....I.Rather.Have.Perfect.World.Own.This.....Hell.I.Rather.Have.Nexon.Own.This.Than.KabamNever again Kabam...never again.			"

												I used to play this game a far long time ago, back on Kongregate. It was a good game, plenty of fun to be had, and the perma-death, while annoying, only made me more determined to do better in the future, work with my friends, and pursue a higher goal.But that was a different time entirely; a golden age long since past.So, around 2 years later, being a more experienced and wisened individual, I decided to check this game out again, seeing it was on Steam. I went into the reviews, and noticed...a surprising negative reaction among a bulk of the players, even ones who've spent over hundreds of hours. I thought to myself, Well it just can't be as bad as these people say, right? People love to use hyperbole to make a point. In my lack of judgement, I decided to play this again...I regretted said decision.[GETTING STARTED]So I started up the game after a shockingly-fast install time of roughly 2 seconds. Flash games, gotta love'em. I start things up, go into my character menu, and realize that half the screen's dedicated to selling me crap. That's not a good sign...I start up my one character slot, and I go through the motions of picking my first hero, a Warrior. The tutorial's straight-forward, I blitzed through fairly quickly, and reached the point where I named the account. For review sake, I'll disclose my account username in-game was DMNTDxNem.[MY EXPERIENCE]When I first started up my warrior, in the first server I selected, things went overall decently for me. I stuck to the beach, like the game said to, and leveled up to 3 before taking on a little deeper in the forest areas. Reaching around level 5 now, fighting against not only the enemies, but the server lag, I decide a quick respite at the Nexus was in order.Now, from when I was playing this back on Kongregate, I used to love the Nexus! It was crowded pretty often, yeah, but there tended to be a lot of friendly player interaction; people helping each other, constantly working in each other's benefit to get better gear and equipment, there was always strong community there.But on my return trip to the Nexus during this refresher playthrough, I realized the game's first critical issue:Bots! Bots everywhere! I couldn't speak to any of the players, as few as there even were around, without bots running up and drowning us out. I cannot tell you how much I desperately wanted to kill some of these players; physically. In real life. I was that angry.Aside from that, though, there was also the issue of the shop items. Originally, pre-dev change, the shop items, while difficult to acquire, were completely do-able, and it was rather straight-forward; you earn coins, you go to the shop, you spend coins on an item you want (and eventually die and lose, but I digress,) and you got said item. Now, shop items range from the hundreds to the thousands in coin value! And if you came back into the game with 50 coins earned, many of the shop items that were once 50 are now 51, meaning you'd be forced to pay for one more bloody coin! Slowly, I was realizing that people's anger was rather justified.Enough about the Nexus and the broken shop, though. I went back in, enjoyed my time fighting through enemy territory, until it appeared the server I was on had a server-wide boss battle occurring. Everyone was teleported into a dangerous, high-level world dungeon: Oryx's Castle. I, among many players, was ill-equipped for the encounter, so I ended up dying along heaps of other players, who all probably experienced the same game-breaking lag spikes that I did. Congratulations, RotMG; you, a flash game, made my high-performance gaming computer buckle onto its knees...Second go, another warrior, and I was definitely getting the hang of things. I beat a few dungeon bosses, went into the ruins and killed a few mini-bosses strewn across the world, and grabbed some decent equipment. Things were going good, and the whole thing went just as I'd hoped. Barring the several passing exchanges I gave the bots advertising their crummy products, to which I had some choice opinions of them, I finally came across an actual, breathing player; they were running around like the flash, and when I strolled up, they told me about a dungeon where they could help me get some better equipment. Now, I'll say in advance that I read the reviews extensively, and knew there were players who got their kicks off of getting people with good characters killed. I thought to myself, Well, my guy's crap, so he'd be wasting his time if he just wanted to off me.How wrong I was.First off, the dungeon he dragged me into was from some candy dude that was prancing around like the Gingerbread Man. I insisted on being the one to take him down, so a little Looney Tunes-style chase went on, me using mana potions to keep up like Lance Armstrong used drugs for the Tour De France, and finally was able to dead him to death. Me and the guy go in, and before my eyes, he vanishes through a wall...and when he returned, every enemy he could alert in the area was with him. Running as far as I could, not long, considering I used up all my mana, I was eventually shot to death by a unicorn pinata barfing rainbows. And so, at level 9, Sir Gullible II was found dead due to overdose on vibrant colors. The last words he ever heard were from his once-thought ally, typing in ""#rekt"" about 7 times. Fun times were had..[GAMEPLAY]Now, the fact the game now being a botting trollfest of epic proportions notwithstanding, it's still incredibly functional. The base game works as intended, and the system hasn't changed all that much since 2 years ago. Now, I'll admit the difficulty curve's definitely become harder to cope with, especially how the higher-tier equipment is even harder to acquire than ever before, unless you throw your wallet at the screen, but by the by, it hasn't really changed all that much. You still work with other players, you still try for the best loot, and you still fight towards the ultimate goal of taking down the Mad God.You have your four slots, weapon, helmet, armor, and ring, and equipment is divided amongst different classes, rings being the only ones where any class can use anything they find for that slot. Each class has different advantages and disadvantages; warriors can buff allies and face-tank, wizards can do solid damage, archers can hit multiple enemies at once, they're all viable for different reasons.Remember, of course, about the perma-death mechanic; once a character's dead, they're dead. Anything they had, if you didn't get it sorted out or saved, is gone, so it's incredibly important to manage the equipment that you find, so that the next time someone throws a death-spewing unicorn at you, you'll have plenty of equipment for the next character that hits the ground.[SUMMARY/FINAL THOUGHTS]In all, the game's as it's always been: you play, you die, you improve, you die again, the cycle continues. Granted, there are the more-than-occasional hacking players that either screw you out of loot, or, in my experience, send sentient pinatas to murder you with rainbows, so the cycle is a bit less off a circle, and more of a triangle, where every corner is a slap to the face. You get your first slap when you boot up the game, and you're being asked to buy crap you don't even need; you get the second slap going to the Nexus, once a sanctum for player cooperation, now a den of botting inequity and a broken economy; and the final slap, rounding this merry-go-♥♥♥♥-yourself out quite nicely, is the afore-mentioned hackers, honing their trolling skills to a weaponized level in the goal of wanting you dead.I have it on word that things have changed hands, and that the game's improved somewhat. I intend to take a look at things again sometime, but for now, the review will stand until I do.			"

												Hoo, this game.  Was a lot of fun for the first 60 hours...before the company got bought out by a bigger company.  Apparently that company had big ideas in terms of monetizing the hell out of this fairly enjoyable free to play game.  I enjoyed it back when it was catching on, but I think the game has definitely taken a turn for the worse when it got bought out.  The design is more focused towards getting your money than making the game more enjoyable.  When a game does that, even if I already invested 60 hours, I walk away rather than get treated like a bag of money by the game's designers and publishers.			"

												Alright. This game. I used to play it on its website, but I downloaded it on here to review it. Realm of the Mad God used to be one of the games I played the most. However, when the company Kabam bought it, it instantly became a store. Kabam are just greedy, money grabbing rip-offs, and they are the exact reason I have stopped playing this game. The main lobby is just a store, showing off weapons, armor, pets, and other things that can only be bought with coins, which can be bought with real money, or can be earned from dieing with a decent to good character who needs good stats to actually earn the coins.Feel free to play this game, but prepare your♥♥♥♥♥♥for micro-transactions and updates that only benifit people who love to spend money.

												Oh god, I remember first finding out about this game while it was being made for a competition on TIGsource. It was great fun, and I suppose it still is, but after a while of not playing it and coming back to see so many changes, It has definitely taken a turn for the worst.The basic premise of the game is pretty much a multiplayer 'bullet hell' style game, most of the action (PvE) takes place on a randomly generated continent which is really big and possesses many diverse environments. This means that there's not a shortage of bosses and mooks to kill, and temples  and castles to raid for loot. The item system is pretty easy to understand, with gear being divided on tiers, a higher tier meaning rarer and more powerful items. Initially, you are made to choose a class and dropped off in a tutorial with only a basic weapon and a skill item. The game itself is pretty fun, and you can play for hours without it getting boring or repetitive. Here's where the game starts falling apart. Most of the action that happens later is just plain old grinding. Even for the hardest monsters getting item drops is really hard, as the item drop rate is extremely tiny.The worst thing that's happened to this game was the developers being bought by Kabam. It has pretty much become a pay-to-win affair. Before, you could buy cosmetic items and pets with real money to support the developers. Now you can get the rarest armours and weapons with a few bucks. Like I said before, the item drop rates are ridiculous, so selling weapons and items for real money feels kind of cheap.All in all, a good game ruined by 'freemium'. If you play it, expect to grind a lot, or pay up.			"

												tl;dr The game used to be good but the new company that owns it, Kabam transformed it into a pay to win game rather than having players rely on skill.As an experienced player of this game I cannot honestly not recomend it. Ever since Kabam took it over it has transformed the game from an awesome fantasy rogue like bullet hell, to a generic pay to win mmo. Everytime I play it I feel like it's missing a purpose, and that all I'm doing is running around with underpowered gear attempting to kill bosses, and often failing in doing so because of the way Kabam has remade the game. It is only really fun if you play it with friends, or if you play it for about 10-20 minutes, which really breaks my heart because it used to be one of my all time favorite mmo's back before I ahd a nice computer. 3/10			"

												Fun... one day it was. Not only has the new owner of this company, Kabam, has not only turned this game into a cold-hard pay-to-win, moreover it is extremely careless about anyone who plays this game. The game is infested by many 'hacked clients' of people dashing trough walls and using various other illegit tricks, sometimes just to take away your chances at phat loot, sometimes purposely drag huge mobs of enemies on you trying to get that character of yours killed. Let's not even mention people sitting on the most powerful enemies in the game, taking no damage at all, and calling people to teleport for interesting stuff - instead they teleport to an instadeath. another character wasted.If you would be able to look past all these downsides there is plenty of fun to be found, and i have found it, before this curtain of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t appeared.

Thats why all the servers are 10x emptier now. Nice job kabam... (note that I have little hours on the game because I played on Google Chrome, not steam).			"

												Realm of the Mad God (RotMG) is a great game at certain times, but then you can feel like you have wasted too much time on it. Once you get to level 20 the game is going to give you a cookie, then kick you in the shins and take the cookie back. Generally speaking in a neutral point to review, this game will most likely pull you in once you put some time into it and you will grow to hate the game when you die, and then find it creeping back on your a few weeks/months later and have a sudden desire to play again. Once you die there is no way to recover your character or any of the items, which is the most frustrating part of the game. However, you can pay real money (which I'm not a fan of, but in no way would I consider this a pay-to-win game) to get more characters slots so that you can still have the other guys when you die. Play this game if you have a lot of extra time because it will pull you in fast.			"

												Realm of the Mad God, one of the most addictive 2D MMORPG I've played. I've got 3 years of this game on my belt so I'd like to think I know the pro's and con's.The game publisher, Kabam. Money fiends. They take advantage of permanent death. Having the game focused around the age group of  little kids and their parents credit card details. With $20 USD you can purchase 2600 gold coins for in game. However these coins majority of the time will not last more than 2 days if not 1. If you wanted the best items from the beginning of the game (Yes you can buy the best 'tradable' items right away!) for a warrior for example, that'd cost 2360 gold. Once you have purchased anything you are more than likely going to die due to a lagspike.Through my 3 years of playing Realm I've had my fair share of seeing the occasional hacker, however occasional is a bit of an understatement. After contacting Kabam staff multiple times about hackers, I was told to video my gameplay. Staff replied with and I quote, ""Thank you for writing in with your concern.

												Game is decent, unfortunately updates consistantly wipe progress, so expect that. Publishers are known to not give people microtransaction refunds after a character wipe.--(Dec 2015 Edit: Not sure if wipes still happen, however I'm technically locked out of my account and support has stopped responding to me, so for Steam users that never migrated to an email like me, our items are officially locked out, paid or not)--Every time there has been a character wipe, they say they will correct it next time, but they never do and it's been this way for years. It's come to the point that people just accept it and most people don't even complain about it anymore. Unfortunately it's not something you will see listed on the store page or in their microtransaction shop.Recently there is a new issue with this game. Some steam users that didn't link their account to an email are no longer allowed to access their RotMG account. I happen to be one of these users, yet another slap in the face. As far as I know this only is affecting steam users and those affected have no way to play the game through their steam account, they can't even start over.If you are absolutely certain you won't be spending a dime on this game, it might be worth a try if you like dungeon crawlers, it's about as good as dungeonland but with worse graphics. Otherwise stay away, spending cash for temporary items is no fun, losing all your hard work is even less fun still.""""""""Steam account can't connect - 02072900Thank you for contacting us.

												I played the browser version of this a lot. It was plenty fun, grinding pots with friends, maxing a char, dying, crying, vowing not to be overconfident again, then repeat. It would still be fun right now if Kabam actually puts their effort into balancing the classes and dungeons and all that, but noooo they only care about their sweet money.

												I've been playing this game for 5 years now. One thing is for sure, once you get your first white bag, it's like a drug. You want to kill more and more bosses for that chance of getting a beautiful white bag. The loot aspect of this game is very well done. When you get a very rare item it makes you look super pro compared to other players. These items, event items, in particular are honestly a bit too rare. Like I said, I've been playing for 5 years. In that 5 years I've only gotten two of these items. Getting each one was one of the happiest things I've ever experienced in a game, but of course I ended up dying with them, because everyone dies in this game eventually. You invest hours and hours of grinding into one character to have it die and dissapear forever. When your characters are alive it's somewhat fun, grinding for rare items, but when you die it is literally one of the worst feelings you will ever have. After dying over and over again, and then dying with an item I grinded months for, I've decided that this game is truly not worth the time I've invested into it. The game has brought me more grief than happiness, that's for sure. If you want to grind for hours and hours on end and then have all the work dissapear in a micro-second, play this game. Oh yeah, and the community is absolute garbage. It's full of mean people and annoying kids who spam harambe and doge memes in the chat.			"

												I've been playing this game for years (even if not through Steam), and I can say that, through time, it has evolved to provide many unique and exciting features:- Severe game balancing issues! Land tons of damage with one class and steal loot from other poor useless players!- No serious updates in years! You can play the same dungeons again, and again and again! And then some more! - Rampant cheating! And if this doesn't still sell this to you, also know that the company now managing the game, the infamous Kabam, totally ignores cheater reports!- Poisonous community! Scammers? We got those! Leechers? Of course, the game actually encourages leeching! Racial and homophobic insults? Goes without saying!- Pay to win!!! You think you can max your pet without spending real money? Think again!!! And if you don't feel like buying game gold, just check out the black market spambots that make the game chat window completely unusable!- Much, much more!			"

												I have a love hate relationship with this game. After dying, you sort of chill (not play) for some time or so depending how long you spent building that character.Usually a 0/8 character is equivalent to a few days of chill, while dying as a 6/8 would be rage inducing to the point of a few weeks of chill. I know, I know, you're probably thinking it's just a game, you shouldn't even rage, yea, yea ""Git Gud"". But, because it's permadeath, you lose everything, everything you've earnt. Let me tell you, when you get attached to one character, you are one with the character, and when you die in the game, it feels like dying in real life.   It’s not a bad game, proof? Well you wouldn’t see people play this game for hundreds of hours if it was a bad game. In addition I played way more of this game on the internet version. Yea it consumed me (not as much as it did for others though). Like I said, I have a love hate relationship with this game, and you’ll begin to understand me when you at least clock up 50-100 hours of the game.			"

Posted: September 1, 2014
												Realm of the Mad God is a top down free to play MMO mouse aim shooter with a simple art style. It has been around for a few years as a Flash game. You start the game easy enough, by selecting from unlocked classes such as rogue, warrior, priest, archer and so on. Each class plays the same, you fire projectiles. Have a sword? You shoot projectiles. The only difference between the classes are the stats and the equipment they can use. You can unlock more classes when you reach certain levels with the base classes. Each enemy gives you some minimal experience and leveling up will only improve your stats. There are no new spells and no choice of improvement. It all feels very dull and too simple for a MMO.The controls are like every other mouse aim shooter, arrows to move with mouse aim and click to shoot. You have a special ability and potions too, but for the most part you can just use your normal attacks. Speaking of the mouse aim, it feels very inaccurate. I can stand still, fire the projectile and the projectile will miss even when I shouldn't. Maybe there is an accuracy stat or something. It feels odd when enemies very accurate. Luckily you are quick enough to dodge projectiles. Again, maybe its a stat and I need to have better gear, but there is nothing on the equipment that shows accuracy, just range and attack power.There are a lot of enemies, each with different stats and attack patterns. For the most part they have enemies simply shoot at you. Most have single shots, others have double and triple spreading shots. Still some fire a sort of 360 degree bullet shield preventing anything from getting close. The bosses aren't that different from normal enemies. They just have larger sprites with other creatures swarmed around them.There are quests in the game, but I mean that in the vaguest sense of the word. All quests seem to be kill the big monster. No one tells you to. You just do it. The game points out the direction of the big monster when you enter the location.The maps feel a bit jumbled randomly with trees and foliage with a path drawn through the map. It just feels like lazy or quick map design and not 'randomly generated.' Some enemies will drop portals to different areas which is a fun feature, but since the areas look just thrown together its always just another randomly thrown together area. You have a mini map that will reveal more as you explore, but if you leave an area and return, you need to explore it again to show it on your mini map. At any time out in the wilderness, you can instantly warp back to the town / nexus with the click of a button. The locations might look like a jumbled mess, but the town / nexus looks great, but its all just a big store to sell you stuff. All of the stores have items visibly showing you everything so you need to walk over them instead of having an easy to use menu. Another problem is to see the stats of the item you need to hover your mouse over the 'buy it' button. Don't accidentally click that button though. You cannot sell equipment, so you're forced to drop it or trade it with other players, but for the most part the equipment feels useless when enemies drop it all. Plus players are kind enough to just give stuff for free since everything is so abundant.Normal games would have you kill enemies for gold, but in Realm of the Mad God, you need to buy gold with real money of course. Everything is right there in town / nexus for you to buy after a brief tutorial area. What do you buy with gold? Name changes, more characters, armor, weapons, rings, boxes with random items, keys, pets, extra storage, building materials and everything. Did I mention that when you die you lose all progress and items? So if you spend real life money into a free game and you die, you've just lost everything. Do you need gold to have fun? No. The town / nexus has plenty of people selling gold via their website for real money and it floods the chat for some servers drowning out any real discussion.This feels like a really dull game that is out for your money. Not just that, but it seems hastily thrown together. The quick simple art style, the slow grind for experience, the awful map design, no real quests, the laggy input, and the inaccurate aiming, all makes me not want to be in the game let alone buy anything in the game with real money.

												This weird pixel graphic action mmo dungeon crawler with rogue-like elements was created a long time ago by a small company called wildshadow. After years of awesomeness they had to sell it to kabam to keep the game going, kabam kept it going for some more years also, and now finally it's in the hands of Deca(Thankfully being revived by them after kabam's dark era). I've been with this game for so long i keep coming back to it, the 1000+ hours i have here are only with the steam account(had 2 older accounts before this one). I'm mentioning this so you get the idea that this game is very hard to kill, the people just wanna play this ****. If you're thinking about playing this game let me transfer some of my genuine info to you :). The game is extremely grind-based, so if you're not someone who likes to grind for endless hours everyday then this game should be a pass for you before i even go any further. Now for some pros and cons.+ Huge variety of enemies/bosses/events with unique variations of butt-clenching bullet hell patterns and tactics.+ More than big enough player base( very active game)+ Huge variety of items that adds to the already great replayabilty value of the game.+ The game is based alot on team play and as mentioned above there's always people to play along with.+ The game is being properly revived by Deca games and right now is the best time to start playing this game. (Month of the mad god, a special month, will run from 21 july till around the end of august).- The community(Like most gaming communities) can be very toxic at times. Not as toxic as moba communities don't worry :)- Lag in this game can punish you extremely high as it is a perma-death game. You need to take caution from both server lag and your own internet lag as not to lose a month work in a second. If you have a decently stable internet connection you should be safe from a lag related death most of the time though.-  Client users/Hacker/Dupers/Bots love to manifest this game; BUT Deca(unlike kabam) is already showing alot of promise in making this a thing of history(fingers crossed).Conclusion: Definitely a strong recommendation from me, i absoloutely love this game, and you won't have to pay a dime to try it so you should definitely do that. 9/10			"

												It used to be a fun/addicting game, but it Kabaam (the company that bought out the game) is all about stuffing money into their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fat bloody pockets.  It was so much more fun with non soulbounded items, no insanely high tier items in the store, and no stupid pets.----EDIT---- Updated Review as of 5/9/16 12:53 AMSo I decided to go ahead and play the game once again since I flew back home for my 1.5 weeklong summer vacation after college.TL;DR: The game is fun, but holy sh*t, the gold spammers got worse and there are minimal amounts of effort to update the game.  So yeah, it's fun, go ahead and play it for a bit if your internet doesnt' suck.  However, I still can't recommend this game because Kabaam continues to demonstrate a classic example of a company that buys out another company, providing a minimal amount of effort to make any improvements to the game (because, ""why make improvements when you can do nothing at all and still make money off of the 12 year olds that fall for this pay2win scheme?"").------------------------------------------------------------------The game has gone through a laughably minimal amount of updates since I had last played this game, over a year ago.  For a 2D MMO with a lot of potential for interesting, frequent updates, I thought that perhaps some unique new gamemodes, some cool improvements to the hub world, and new classes would be released.  Did I see any of those changes in the game:no, not reallyWhat I discovered in my +25 hours of playing (while on vacation):-USWest3 Server is still just as cancerous as before.  Chat comments fill up half of your screen and text from the advertising bots just spam it so hard that comments whiz by at the speed of f*cking light.  Fortunately there is the handy star requirement filter you can apply to chat (2* seems to do the trick), but it is still incredibly annoying that some bots still manage to whisper me.-Trading still sucks a-hole...  Like honestly, how has trading not been somehow improved in this game?  We have RealmEye which is great and all, but it is still such a hastle to try and arrange trades with other players, especially when you are playing and someone pms you and you go back to the nexus and forget the username of a player that pm'd you.  Every time you go to the nexus, an annoying bot will pm you, making it impossible to reply to the person who had just pm'd you since you can only reply to the last person who sent a pm to you (so the bot overrides the last pm).  Then you get to play the fun waiting game to try and find out if the person who had pm'd you will try and pm you again or not.-Chat....   Related to the first two points I made above.   Why is there no option to add a custom filter to the chat?  If players could filter out the ""WWW"" or "".COM"" sh*t, the issue with chat going bonkers would be solved.  The star requirement filter is nice and all, but I realy don't want to force the req over 2* to filter out the annoying bot that whispers ""Visit blah blah blah.com"" (I am unsure if the star req even affects private messages).  Putting any star requirement is hiding away potential people who might be selling something that I need or players who are trying to negotiate with me.  Hell, just enforce the restriction to post WWW, W W W, COM, C0M, and all other variations by default to stop these annoying bots from ruining the game.-Daily Tasks.  This is a nice addition to the game that is actually pretty cool.  You can get skins and also loot potions which last 30 minutes.  My only complaint would be how long it takes to farm for some of these low tier weapons (T7 usually) which is honestly more difficult for me to find compared to t6 and +t8 weapons.  I am yet to complete the second stage of the daily quest.-A few new dungeons.  OK, at least something was added...  Like most dungeons in the game, these new dungeons don't feel very different from any of the old ones.  Moving along then...-New weapons, armors, items.  Most of the new weapons are situational, but it's still nice to see a variety of UT's added to the game in the last year and a half.-Armor sets.  Pretty interesting idea.  Of course you can try your luck getting these by either running a sh*t ton of dungeons (which I have no problem with) or just paying a couple bucks with a lucky box thing that can make your character completely OP at the cost of your wallet and RNG (I have a problem with this).-T13.  I don't believe this was added before, but I do like the idea of T13 items since they don't appear to be sold anywhere in the cash shop.  This is sort of meaningless though, since the armor sets sold in the cash shop have the potential to include some weapons that are on par -if not better- than t13 weapons.-Ressurection Amulets are gone.  Those things were pretty OP anyways (they had a chance to let your character be ressurected after death.  Players would have characters live indefinitely).-Custom Cursors. Finally :DAnd that honestly wraps up almost all the major changes I have seen in game.  I'll still play it till the end of my vacation.  A game worth trying, but this company is reminiscent of EA.

Bullet-Hell RPG where the wrong step (or lag spike) could end your lifeRealm of the Mad God, a very simple and easy RPG to pick up and learn, but quite hard to master. Bullet-hell like twin-stick shooter games combined with a top-down RPG mechanic where you only have one life. Team up with waves of other players to take down many of the bosses that plague the realm. First you'll learn how to level up to level 20 (the max level) reliably which for a skilled player will take about 10-30 minutes, but that won't be the end of your adventure. You're going to have to learn how to max your stats which requires you to learn many of the dungeons and where to find them which could take several hours or even days. The journey will be hard and you only have one life to do it, but fear not! There are some things available to make your adventure easy. You have a vault where you can store your awesome finds in for your later characters to use. If you're lucky enough you'll find a pet which will stick with you throughout the whole game and all your future characters. Do invest in them, unless you're MLG Pro who don't need no man... uhm sidekick. Pros: Very good replayability It's not Pay2Win. All the equipment sold can be obtained in dungeons. Paying does help you progress a bit faster at least with pets. I spent $0 and I'm an orange star who can get 6/8 stats maxed. Very easy to find other players to play and do dungeons with in-game.Cons: Storage space is very limited, though that shouldn't be a problem until you get better at the game. No PvP, if you're here for that then this isn't the game for youReccomended To:People who enjoy perma-death mechanics. You masochistPeople looking for a fun co-op game to play with their friends. Even if you have 20 of them.It's even free and a small download, so why not try it?Side Notes:If you're going to get into trading, use RealmEye.com very useful way to trade. Just put up your offer and go back to enjoying the game. No I'm not being paid by RealmEye to say this.Turn star requirements on to 2 or 3 in the settings so you won't see those spam bots.Gimme my Steam Awards Nomination Committee 2016 Badge, Steam! "

												--- PLEASE READ FULL REVIEW BEFORE VOTING!! ---Realm of the Mad God is a game that is completely unique in how it actually works. I have never seen a game that is similiar to this one. All the items are really cool, all the misc. items are unique, all the dungeons are insane fun. Overall, It is a well-done RPG but I have some things that I do not like in it. Even though the game is Free-to-play, it is also ""Pay-to-win"" if you know what I mean. You can still play and enjoy the game without giving any money, but if you want to play seriously and become a ""pro"" you will have to spend some money. For example, when you start off, you can have only one vault chest, which isn't enough for anything. It holds only 8 items. You need more storage than that. So you have buy more chest, each of which costs 500 gold coins, which are worth about 2.7 Euro. That is cheap, right? Considering you need at least 10-15 chests to store all of your UT's (Ultra Tiers) and all of your Stat Potions, there is no way of that being cheap. You also need more than one character. Each character slot costs 1200 gold coins. You can color your character, which of course also costs gold coins. Dispite the fact that the game is ""Pay-to-win"", I still had an absolute HUGE ammount of fun with this game with my friends. Leveling up, killing gods, completing dungeons etc. The game is insane fun even if you do not pay any money.  I also have one more thing that annoys me. Server-side lag. My internet is really fast and I have no lag on other multiplayer games. But in RotMG sometimes because of the server-side lag I die, losing my character and all my hard-earned gear. That is something Kabam has to work on.Final Rating: 7 / 10Good			"

												Imagine your favorite movie is on TV. Now imagine someone walks into your house and wipes **** all over the screen. Your favorite movie is still on TV, but now you have to watch it with **** on it, and it stinks as well. This is what happened to ROTMG. I've logged probably about 200 hours on the browser version over the course of about 5 years. I've been playing on and off for that time. After about a year without playing the game I saw that it was on steam and since it was free I downloaded it. Like I said earlier it's pretty much the same game I used to love, but it has **** wiped all over it. In the main lobby there are a dozen spam bots all screaming for you to buy high level items from them. You walk past rows of stores with items that can only be purchased with bought in game currency (with real money of course). If you want more storage you have to pay for it, it you want extra character slots you have to pay for those as well. This wouldn't be as big a deal, but $5 will only buy you 500 gold, which will not get you very far at all. Each character slot costs 1000 gold, and the vault chests cost 1000 gold as well. On the server there are quite a few hackers. To conclude this game is P2W, but you absolutely do not have to do so, everything that can be bought can also be achieved through hard work.			"

												I had to play long and hard to decide whether to give this game a positive or negative review, and I have made up my mind. having over 1k hours into the game, I think I can make a very good review based upon my experience. This game is fantastic, it's fast paced, it's fun, and if you don't mind perma death you can have a blast, but there's one thing dragging this game down and down to rock bottom and it's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community. They hold no respect for other people, they troll, they spew unfunny and overused memes, and they are generally uptight pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. This game can only be fun if you have friends. I cannot, however, and will not continue playing because the community (in an mmo) is absolutely abysmal. I wouldn't recommend you to play unless you have all chat options turned off, and are playing with friends.There are also some things other people say about this game which simply aren't true. ""It's pay to win,"" is one quote I see frequently, and it makes absolutely no sense. Paying money does almost nothing to make you ""win"" the game. You can't buy stat potions, you can only buy equips which any noob will lose. It's not pay to win, and too many idiots who are unfamiliar with the term throw it around.			"

												I've played this game since the beginning. You won't see that on my profile, because I played on the browser, until I recently went to check it out again. Big mistake. All this game does is♥♥♥♥♥♥me off anymore, and not because I die over and over, that's part of the fun. What pisses me off is seeing a game I used to love being ruined and turned pay-to-win by Kabam. Kabam has done nothing but ♥♥♥♥ this game over completely since they bought it out. It's focused on how much money you can dump in the game, rather than how good you are, and how much time and effort you put in to FINDING your gear. You used to have to hunt forever to get a good set, now you can just slap a few bucks down, and walk out of the nexus like hot♥♥♥♥♥♥ Not to mention how they completely screwed the loot system. Not only did they add ninja, which would be a good idea, if it weren't for the fact that they added a new weapon type, instead of using one of the ones already in the game, but I swear they also lowered the drop rate on gear. For those who don't know about the game, the ninja's unique weapon means that about 75% of weapons that drop are completely useless. Before ninjas were in the game, 66% couldn't be used by your class. This is because ninja weapons drop as commonly as the other 4 types, even though the other 4 have 2-3 classes using them.As for the lower drop rate, I can only assume that's so that they can sell more gear to people.I really wish I could still like this game. I used to play all the time, and I had 3 8/8 characters, full tops/UT, including alt weapons and abilities, and tons of♥♥♥♥♥♥in my vault. The sad thing is that I can't in good conscience tell anyone to play this game, because it's evolved into what I can only describe as a Facebook game.Please, Kabam, I know you must have a heart. Please give control back to WildShadowStudios, they knew how to run this game better than you guys ever will. You are ruining what used to be my favorite game.			"

Then trash your money on this game.I wouldn't say it's Pay2Win. Since getting loot, grinding for items, getting the satisfaction is what matters in my opinion. Everyone buying items, well, have fun. Must be a good type of satisfaction pressing on ""Purchase"".---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------***OLD REVIEW BELOW***""This game is pay2win"" Guess where the items pro players use come from? NOT the store, they play, get drops, store them.I love this game. Playing it is like a rollercoaster. You get scared when it gets dangerous, you get alot of satisfaction riding it. But for every char, no matter how good you play, there is ALWAYS an end.But you know what? It's a game, ofc, you lose your items that you were farming for weeks. But hey, now you learned what you shouldn't do at that place you died at.If you're going to play this game for hundreds of hours, read this:Do not buy weapons / armor, any type of ingame item. Do buyCharakter slots, Vault slots. After getting a few of them, you basically bought the game.			"

												Man where do I even start with this game.. I started like 12867 years ago when it came out on Kongregate and it was awesome! Wild Shadow did everything perfect with this game.  Then Kabam bought them out and turned it into more of a pay to win.  Kabam did some good, but mostly bad.  They owned Realm for a long time, but very recently a company called DECA bought it from Kabam.  DECA has been incredible in my opinion.  They have released more updates in two months than Kabam did in 5 years.  New things and skins and map changes, it's exactly whatneeded to happen.  So, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants to play it right now.  About 6 months ago I would've said not to bother.  I just hope DECA keeps with it			"

												With so many moving parts to learn and a seemingly infinite breadth of options to explore, diving into any new MMO is a major investment of time and energy. It's exhausting, really, which is why I appreciate a game like the free-to-play Realm of the Mad God. This fantasy-themed, co-operative bullet hell MMORPG is beautifully simple, yet deep enough to keep you chained to your PC for days on end. It takes only a minute or so to get right into the action, and, once you get a taste for running around with a gaggle of your fellow pixelated-warriors raising hell and slaying beasts across the online realm, it's hard to stop. Like any of the other thousands of players populating the bustling game world, you've been summoned by Oryx the Mad God to serve as dinner for his hungry minions. Of course, you've got other plans. Venturing out beyond the safety of the hub nexus, your mission is to blast beasties, collect loot, grow more powerful, and then stick it to the evil deity. Spraying magic projectiles around the screen while dodging incoming fire from blocky sumo wrestlers, dragons, goblin wizards, and stranger creatures you encounter takes on a classic, arcade-like quality. The straightforwardness is appealing – move, shoot, collect – and when you weave in exploration, obsessive loot hunting, RPG character growth and the camaraderie of smiting evil alongside other adventurers, sessions grow intensely hypnotic. Even if you never survive long enough get reach Oryx's doom lair, there's a ton of fun to be found in collaborating with other players in battle and unlocking cool new classes to play. Each of Realm of the Mad God's 13 unique character classes are accessed by reaching certain level benchmarks in other classes. Above all, this is what kept me glued to my keyboard playing for hours at a time. You start as a mewling wizard who can fire blasts of magic in any direction, but as you play longer and level-up, you eventually open-up more interesting classes like the necromancer, huntress, mystic, and assassin. Every class has its own set of weapons and items, magic powers, special abilities, and perks. They all play differently, and I got a thrill every time I unlocked a new one to try out. This adds tremendous replay potential too, since unlocking the coolest characters requires you to spend some serious time with each class. Perma-death layers-on an intense roguelike element to the already zany large-scale bullet hell RPG slugfest unfolding on any given server, and it seriously ups the challenge and risk factor. Getting careless will get you killed and force you to re-start your current character over from level 1. As frustrating as it can be, death is sometimes a welcome opportunity to try out another class, since you can only have one character at a time without using microtransactions to purchase additional slots. But when you're committed to keeping your favorite character alive, the threat of losing all your hard-earned experience and loot gently nudges you into working together with other players and forming impromptu gang of warriors to tackle the tougher swarms of foes as a group. Realm of the Mad God's streamlined approach to MMO gaming also changes up player interaction in good ways. Since there's no PvP, everyone in the realm is after the same goals – slay, loot, and level-up. As you come across other players, the desire to tag along and pitch in for tougher fights comes intuitively. You share the experienced gained from defeating foes as long as you hit them once, and there's generally plenty of loot to go around. Typing in chat text makes a speech bubble appear over your hero, and communicating in short bursts is effective for concocting plans outside of the heat of battle. When you do find other comrades you want to stick with, you can highlight nearby players and lock their names to your menu bar, allowing you to teleport to their location instantly if you get separated. It's a simple and easy-to-use system that works well. The realm itself is surprisingly vast, with a diverse landscape that holds more dangerous and inventive foes the further you venture away from your spawn point. Weaker baddies, like scorpions and pirates, populate the sunny beachside. But push through the thick forests, crumbling ruins, and mountains beyond, and you'll find powerful god-like foes capable of slaying low-level adventurers with a single strike. It's these formidable opponents you have to defeat in order to reach Oryx. Thankfully, when you need a break from battle or a quick getaway, tapping the insert key warps you back to the safety of the nexus where you can trade, use fame points or in-game cash to purchase special items, form a guild, and heal-up. It may be vastly different from its big-league brethren, but this stylish indie MMO has loads of staying power to match its unique concept. Realm of the Mad God&#Array;s accessible arcade-style bullet hell action blends with RPG nerdiness in some truly potent ways, and the lovely pixilated world holds an abundance of adventure that&#Array;s ripe for the taking. Easy to jump into and damn near impossible to quit, this unusual free-to-play MMO hybrid is worth every second of your spare time.			"

												Don't waste your time, any fun this game had months prior to coming on steam was very methodically removed by the devs. The very over inflated cash shop prices help drive the point home that this will never become anything awesome either, just a vessel for cash scam.The original concept of the game was a simplistic fun game that allowed large groups of people to collaborate into an army to eventually topple the mad god. People would band together in very large groups to help level each other and take down bosses. A fun concept but due to the simplistic nature of the game, hardly something you want to dole out money for, especially considering the game is built largely from graphics that are open source. Cash shop perks however created the rise of the ""cashing loner"" who could do alone what 50 or so players could accomplish. That also created these loners to corner anyone getting good equipment, creating a large rift in the player base, this essentially leads to 3 options in the game: 1) hack your way to the gear. 2) be forced to cash. 3) spend ages fighting for any progression.Now these 3 routes are actually pretty typical of a free to play. Except Mad god has one more aspect that makes the taste even more sour, permadeath. Again with original concept of the game, permadeath wasn't so bad. The game was very pick up and play again, you didn't mind starting over because you never really had a lot of content to chew through so you never got too invested into any one character and there was other classes to try the game over from a new perspective. Now there is a lot more content to the game so dying for a free player even if they do as much planning as humanly possible, is a major setback, cash players can buy additional storage and even have soul bound items so they aren't exactly starting over every single time, adding to the gap between the players.In all this game was a fun concept that was bled dry for every cent they could get and it shows plain as day.

Sure, You can pay for cosmetics and some useful tools. But I havent spent a single dime on this game and I have collected most items in the game. But I do warn you. Don't start playing this if you don't have a disciplined mind. This game will steal all of your time. And most people don't have the strength to pull away. Help me... Help me now...			"

												It's a top-down Bullet Hell MMO, What do you expect?The same damn song loops over and over and over again and never stops.If you die, it's permadeath, all of your loot and levels are gone unless you stored them.You can teleport to other players which 9 times out of 10 leads to your instant demise.And there's pointless microtransactions, you can buy new skins for your character, but like everything else you lose them if you die, making them completely worthless.If they fixed any of this since the last time i played, good for them, but i'm never going to play again.As a side note, no matter what class you pick and what weapon they use, they always shoot. Got a sword? it shoots bullets. Dagger? bullets. Book? bullets.			"

												This game, being one of the available free to play games on the market, looks nice on the outside as it looks like an 8bit MMORPG, but as it turns out, it's much worse than that.You start with 40 Gold, which basically means you can't do or buy anything useful. There are a lot of fancy upgrades available to the player but you need to pay for them in U$D.It's an open world adventure game like Everquest where you explore places and complete quests, but no one tells you what to do or the goal of the game.You have one of 20 choices of characters to choose from, which is only available without paying. My guess is that its main goal is to survive as long as you can. but the enemies' AI system is just horrible. In the tutorial part you are then asked to defeat enemies with godlike aimbot skills. If you die, you start all over again, with a new character.The music in this game is the very same music you hear from the beginning, and it just goes on and on like a loopbox.The chat box is full of spam messages telling you to buy Gold in order to get fance deals.My suggestions: This game needs more detailed instructions as to how the game should be played.My rating: 2/10			"

												Honestly on the outside this game just seemed like another regular 2D pixel game, but my friends insisted that I try it out. I gave it a whirl and I am glad I did. Let me advise you first this game is no short term game, If you are going to play it get yourself fully immersed in it. It has more enemies than you can count, many dungeons that you can explore, way too many items to count, and a friendly community. At first you will try your best get the best gear you can and get to lvl 20 and you will think ""this game Isn't long term I have already finished it,"" your wrong. There are things called stat potions that increase your stats by 1 - 5 depending on the stat potion. This is when you can max your character's stats although, it can be hard to get there without a pet, you will eventually get one that will help you along the way. Now that I am done just rambling on and on about how great it is, GO PLAY IT (never buy items with real money how ever tempting it might seem, it ruins the experience and the game becomes boring). Also, if you need more help I will be on the server USwest2, and I will willing to give you advice. HAVE A GOOD DAY :D !!!!			"

												To sum this game (me in a skype call); Guys i think i'm actually doing well. I'm finally able to solo this abyss and get some decent loot without putting money into it! *server lags, gets stuck into wall and gets gang banged by 6 demons, then dies and loses absolutely everything*To be more detailed, this game is fun if you survive the constant server lag and other stupid bugs. Other wise your♥♥♥♥♥♥♥against a wall by demons. Also, the community is almost♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's full of children (yes this is basically a childs game) who cry to their mommy to put money into it otherwise they'll cut themselves for having a unfair life. I have picked a few out of it who are nice people and want to dungeon, but the game itself makes it impossible to give a good dungeon experience, unless you somehow  manage to what the community calls ""8/8"" which is basically playing non-stop until you finally achieve being a god yourself. But halfway through this you'll probably die from a wall. Even then, you've gone through the hell of having to rely off yourself since this games mostly Solo until your the best of the best (without dying by a wall halfway to 8/8)  you basically will be put in a guild with either children or adults who have also gone through the hell of ROTMG. So this game is addicting and a waste of time unless your like me and have nothing better to do but die by a damn wall. Also, if you have something for stronghold kingdoms, strongholds and this game share the ""Dying is apart of the game"" concept. So if your reading this and are getting ready to install, you'll regret it.-----------------------------------------------EDITED---------------------------------------------------------------------------So realm is the same after playing again for 3 more weeks, but i finally got a 6/8. What i found more disturbing is the community. Either kids who still say noob just to go jerk for the first time, or grown men who spend money on the game because why not. The real challenge realm has, is trying to ignore the community even though alot of the game is in the trade system, which btw is always changing and full of scammers.I think I'm officially done, leaving my character as a cruddy priest who actually has some decent gear, but even then, a garry's mod rp server has a better community than this game.

												A very addictive, hella fun ""bullet hell MMO"" game.  I started almost 4 years ago with this game and I just can't give it up! No matter how frustrating it can get with the ""perma death"" aspect where you lose everything you worked hard for, there'll alway be friends to chill with you/help ya out and when you get good you'll learn to stock up on potions and items that can make ""remaxing"" not such a pain.  The community is generally really nice but it's also full of those not so likeable people which is the case with any game.  Well the second owners of it, Kabam, finally sold it to DECA Games after having a good run with it themselves but eventually losing interest in it and not updating or fixing issues much.  I must say that so far DECA has done a great job with keeping things lively and updated for the players.  Can't wait to see what they'll do to improve the game and I hope they get around to fixing the many connection issues that sometimes plague this game. Highly recommended! Give it a try, you'll probably end up liking it. :)Take care all and hope to cya in-game,Lex			"

Customization? Real money. You can't farm or grind because the one chest you get to store stuff in is only 6 slots or so. There is no way to get in-game currency without paying, so without using alt accounts as chests, there is no way you can actually have fun with this game, especially if you don't want to bother signing in your alt everytime you need a different weapon. If you want to spend money on this game, then it might be more agreeable to you, to everyone else who at least wants SOME chance at getting better than slightly worse than horrible, don't play this game.

												For people thinking about trying this game: If you like RPG's where you can loot up, play with friends and get amazing items as well as drink potions till you max that class and play many classes and rank up on your journeys this is the game for you, but TAKE CAUTION for if you die, you will lose all the items on that character, you can also put items in your vault to keep for future characters. Upgrade pets and teach them to heal you and give you mana, or attack enemies. This is all around one of my most favorite games and I have played over 1,300 hours in under 2 years.			"

												I have been playing this game for four years now. ( I have more hours logged than it shows because I play on Flash projector now ) I've logged probably around 2000 hours. The game is A ton of fun. But it is slowly and sadly dying because no devs work on the game anymore. I just hope they put a dev or two on the game, or sell it to someone who will. Long live rotmg. Get the game, try it out. It's enjoyable. "

												Before you question my sanity: Yes, I have played this for almost 200 hours, as of writing this review. And I do not reccomend it. Why?Well...Realm of the Mad God is obviously a very addicting and fun game, but not for the faint of heart. Basically everything you do in this game is pointless, as eventually you'll die. It's like all the game is about is preparing for other versions of yourself. Which also will be preparing for OTHER versions of yourself.I never really feel like I make progress in the game. And in fact, I don't. Nobody does. Sure, there are new classes to unlock and get better at but it never comes to a conclusion. The only permanent items you can get are basically skins, and because of this the MMO feeling of ""Hell yeah I got a rare item and it's mine forever!"" getting destroyed, the game becomes boring as hell.Combining an MMO with a roguelike, and adding Bullet Hell to that DOES make this game hell of adrenaline rush, but eventually you start to see all the flaws of the concept. They don't fit together at all.Because of all of this, I simply can not reccomend this game. You'll think it's fun at first, but eventually it gets repetitive and boring. Despite all of this, I am probably gonna continue to play anyway. Because it's SO FRICKIN ADDICTIVE.(EDIT: Also, I should mention this game is pay to win. INCREDIBLY pay to win. Simple things, such as creating another character slot or buying storage space even costs real money. Not to mention, the ""Gold"" Currency, which is what you buy with money, can ONLY be achieved by purcashing it. Yep.)TL;DR: Nothing is permanent, you can't make progressOverall Grade(s):At a point when you feel like the game is fun: 8/10At a point when you feel like the game is boring as heck: 1/10			"

												I know people are going to call me some dumb noob complaining about the game because I'm bad at it or something.. but that's fine. They're the type of people who like this game and that's cool. This game is for a different kind of person. I personally didn't like this game because I felt the amount of time it demands is not worth the fun or sense of achievement it offers. You can play on a character for a full year without dying and the end result is still the same. The most you could hope for is getting on the leaderboards. That's the #1 end result to hope for. The rest of it is looking for loot and obsessively maxing your stats. I just don't think that's worth hundreds of hours. Not only that but the game is pretty P2W and that's kinda lame. The one positive is that this game is quite unique and its simplistic design makes it easy to pick up. Overall I give this one a 4/10. Though I'm sure others would tell you this is one of the best games ever made. These are the same people who will consider me a ragenoob.			"

												This game WAS good. Then the Kabam nation attacked. They made it severely Pay To Win. When Wild Shadow owned it and oversaw the game, it was great, there was almost no pay to win elements in the game. Now, it is almost like an IOS game that is freemium. Sure, skill is still involved, but you HAVE TO PAY $$$$ to be good. It is literally impossible to be good at this game unless you spend some money. You cannot be nearly decent at this game until you have a few character slots(you start off with one!!!!), a few vault chests(again, you start off with on!!!!), a good pet, and EXPENSIVE items that upgrade that pet. As someone who has let their wallet vomit a bit too much( >100$ spent in game), please for the love of not supporting this disgusting Pay To Win Freemium game model, don't get this game. And if you have it, dont spend $$. If you do, you are telling developers and cash grabbing companies that these kinds of games are okay to create and release to the good folk of the gaming community.			"

												Review from a White star if it matters to anyone :P-Quit for a couple months now-So okay I have 1000+ hours on it on steam alone and afterwards, went to adobe flash projector for a couple hundred hours, so hopefully this review will help many of you decide whether or not you will like this game.This game is permadeath, when you die you lose all your items, equipped/anything in inventory aswell. Game is very hard to pick up, consider looking up guides on YouTube or steam workshop for reference.Pros:Gameplay is extremely addictive! Dying isnt so bad and you ""usually"" learn from your mistakes! (atleast I do)If losing all your ""Precious"" items will be too much for your heart to bear, this is not the game for you. (Permadeath)All of the classes are worth playing, maybe except for a few. As for the community, its up and down. Mostly filled with children. Rare to see anyone over the age 18, so you can imagine what the chat is like. Not saying the community is bad, people will sometimes help you out, and you can make friends via guild system. But most guilds will only invite you if you are actually good at the game, which is cruel, but w.e.Getting loot is so satisfying, especially those yummy white bags.Cons:Event notifierAmount of bots (inevitable in a f2p game, but bearable with the new feature that can auto- hide the chat from low ranked players)I always have a my chat filtered so I only see ranked 10stars or above basically since I hate seeing my chat flooded from either children talking/spamming, or trolls.I don't know if this is still out there but there was this thing that was out that would notify you via realm if there is a special quest of your interest that spawned in. This-was-the-breaking point for me... The times where I would be chilling in my home realm and see (Sphinx/Hermit) I'd be so hyped, nowadays when the event spews out ""A sphinx entered the realm"" atleast 60 people from from other servers drop in to get the chance to get some awesome loot.So onto the hate for the company Kabam...They started up pets which helped alot of new players, but made veteren players very upset. It was a new system that tries to get you to spend your real money on ""feed"" to feed your pets to make them heal you more or make other abilities better. If you have the bank account, you can make this game so easy, that the only way you die is by being extremely dumb, or getting armor broken, or doing very very hard dungeons. Now I do understand the company has to make money to keep the game running so im not upset about what Kabam is doing. There are packs they release that are understandable and pretty tempting to purchase but of course you dont have to. Now If you understand how the game works this game can be played without using your precious money but the most tempting deals would be chests/character slots. Everything else can be avoided, unless you are really bad and need to get the best items to be able to play the game. (I exploit this and load up on pots to buy top items from kids who use parents credit cards to buy items)IN MY HONEST OPINION, Kabam is not a bad company...they need to make money somehow right? If they weren't releasing these items/keys/deals how would this game still be alive?Overall this game is for me was great when it didn't have the event notifiers, but since they are out, the game has been getting worse and worse. There are probably many more cons than the ones I listed but those are the two main ones that upset me.Rate: 5/10Anyone with questions can ask here, im open to all feedback good/bad.			"

												I'm going to get a lot of hate for this.

You'll get torn to shreads with no hope of unlocking the next class. I'll say that if this game had a better way for better gear I would gladly play it more, but I'm not going to suport it unless it changes in some way.			"

												I told myself that I would never not reccomend a f2p game, unless given serious reason. I've been given serious reason. This game, as it is right now, is playable and there are quite a few fun aspects of it. However, since Kabam bought RotMG, they bought crappy servers so we would die to lag, causing us to do the following:They made the game HEAVILY based on p2w, as you can buy bonus packages containing a ton of crap, the ability to buy ALL OF THE TOPS(for ridiculous amounts of money, and people do it), and then there are also the people illegally selling earned items and accounts within the game. Plus, someone came up with the brilliant idea of an event notifier so there are a ton of people around EVERY boss like the Hermit or Sphinx. They focused on adding more content instead of polishing the content that they have already put out. They added pets into the game, and if you fully level them at legendary(heal and magic heal), you become almsot invincible. Hackers are everywhere, and i havn't seen Kabam do ANYTHING to fix this problem. This game went from a real gem, to THIS. I still play it because, again, there are definitely fun aspects to the game itself. But, if I had 3 wishes to spend on games, I would use one to give Wildshadow back RotMG.			"

												Okay, before I start this review I have but two things to say:-I have very little hours on this account, as this is my alt account, that was made for Csgo.-This review goes a lot off of my personal experiences with this game.Ahh, RotMG... This game kinda brings me a sense of nostalgia... This nostalgia brings on a lot of mixed feelings; I've had some of my best laughs, met new mates and plain and simple, had something to come back to when I was bored.However, I also have bad experiences with this game such as the permanent death feature - don't get me wrong this doesn't make the game it's self bad, it's just not for me personally - which has made some of the angriest and most regretful moments of my gaming life.There's also the pay to win path that I followed for a short while before realising, ""WAIT! I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥and keep dying, why am I spending money on crap I'm gonna lose in 2 days?"". To be fair I DID know that you could get all these items playing legit, but my low level newbie self didn't know how damned easy it was! Like seriously, $12 or something to get a dagger that one, I'm never going to use and two, would take about 1/2 hour of farming to obtain. So yeah, if you are going to play this game, avoid all the equipment shops in the nexus at all costs ;c;Heres one that I've never really seen anyone but myself complain about; the classes are extremely unbalanced. People only ever play knight, warrior, wizard and possibly a dbow archer, with higher level players - unlike myself - having maxed every class, and still choosing to play these characters. Why? WELL, let me explain...Now, I'm pretty sure the original devs of RotMG, Wild Shadow Studios, never intended the game to be like WoW with full on raids and♥♥♥♥♥♥ However, I'm pretty sure they wanted a teamwork element. These teamwork elements do not exist for multiple reasons:-The two classes that have the highest defence in the game, also have some of the highest dps... WTF?!-Kabam added pets which attack enemies, but most importantly; heal, rendering the weaker defence healing classes USELESS!-Private loot. In other words, the classes with the highest dps - which again apart from wizard, have the HIGHEST defence in the game!? - are the only ones to get drops.-Some of the classes are utterly usless to the player, let alone a whole team.It's because of these reasons that people only play high dps classes which are practically invincible, destroying the whole concept of teamwork.Finally, there's the player base. I remember when I was a newb I had a 3/8 come up to me and give me some hydra skin armor. I didn't know what it was worth at the time and i was playing knight, so I couldn't wear it anyway, and my friend offered me a crossbow - a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥item - for this hydra skin - a legendary item to a newb - and being the newbie I was I accepted - the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ XD. Despite looking back fondly on stories like these, people who create stories and friendships in this game no longer exist. Ever since a RotMG YouTuber by the name of Kalle quit the game - the first real major game figure to leave - the whole veteran community left. By that time I was a mid level player, stranded in a waste land of guildless people keeping to themselves and not talking to anyone. As a result, me and my mates slowley started to quit the game.In other words - the friendly community is practically dead ;c;Overall, I did enjoy and make memories on this game, but that was back in the golden days of early 2013. It's the 3/1/2016 as I am writing this - happy late new year everyone! - and I jumped into the game a few weeks ago to see if any of my guildies still played. To my (sarcastic) surprise, the guild was disbanded. I was left a PM on the RotMG forum:""G'day Eoghann how've you been? How's school been or whatever?You know what, I'll cut to it. We've disbanded as a guild due to the sheer lack of enjoyable community. Most of us are moving onto WoW and we were wonding if you'd like to join us? If so, contact me here: *nopenopenopenopenopenope*~Regards, *nopenopenope*""3.5/10			"

												Realm of The Mad God is not a game for everyone, it is a grindy game which i usually don't like in a game but this is an acception due to a few reasons1. the community in this game is one of the best i have ever seen in a game2.the constant trading within the main realm3.the tiny steps you slowly progress on with in this gameI started off dieing at level 5 every time and i quit but a few days later i came back and died some more but the third time i got to level 20 and i was on top of the moon and then thought what now? Then i realized the full depth of the games with the godlands then the dungeons then the tier 4 dungeons and i fell in love with this game. ever since i could not get enough of this gameI would recommend this game for people who enjoy the little things in life and don't mind dieing a bit to get there			"

												I know it may seem like I have no hours, but in reality, I have at least spent 1000 hours on this game in browser. This was one of the best games at the time with variety, but now everything is corrupt. It used to be, play for a while to get good with somewhat good stuff, but now, rich noobs can just buy the highest tier weapon and armor, or even just go on a website that constantly spams to get a maxed out character. With no experience what so ever, they can ravage the community easily and destroy pretty much anything easily. After the update, I wont recommend at all.			"

												Cons about playing this game-rampant spambots-rampant hackers-rampant scammers-nothing done about any of the above-paying to have more than one character slot-paying to have more than 8 item storage-half of the character selection screen is the week's advertisement (WOW! 10 ambrosia for only 90 US dollars!)-inactive company posts on forums-fame (the earnable currency) has literally 2 uses: pet feeding and guild upgrades-its marketed like its not a P2W-highly unbalanced pet system-the only way you can actually start having any lasting fun in this game without spending money is making multiple accounts-most recent update's only purpose was to render an item unusable because it was being exploited (so take that as you will)Pros of playing this game-its crack-literall crack-really the concept of the game is actaully pretty great but all the cons get in the way of truly enjoying itThe reason I am making this review now is that, before, the game was relatively tolerable but now the quality of co-players has just degenerated completely to the point where there are as many hacking players are there are legitamate players and Kabam has done, and will continue to do, nothing about it.

												I enjoyed this game for the very short time I was able to play it.I'm giving a bad review because of a game-breaking bug leaving myself, and many other players stuck out of the game, completely unable to play.The developers are aware of the bug at this point, and after having many conversations with support about the issue, it seems that they simply don't care.The bug in question, is getting stuck on the black screen with the grey 'Loading' ribbon across the bottom. Even if left for hours, the game will never actually load. I initially contacted support about this back in February, and I've had to make multiple tickets due to previous ones automatically closing.To this day, the issue is still unresolved for me. I'll update this review if that changes, but I'll probably leave it as a negative because of what a joke the support team is.Get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together, Kabam, you're only harming yourself through losing potential customers.

Now i believe that it is surpassing the zenith of its current stature thanks to all of the new developers at DECA game.Further more i really reccomend this game it is really fun and suprising it will make you furious at time and happy or shocked. i think that you should try the game its definately woth the time ;)P.S thank you so much to the new develops keep up the excellent workP.P.S the main account i use, he in game name in NeonRyse "

												so after Kabam was done with their♥♥♥♥♥♥and finally left, i decided to try this game out again and rewrite my review.well first of all, the Community has changed. A LOT. when i first played this game, it was full of exploiting trolls who loved seeing people die with their 1000 fame or more characters.now theyre just ♥♥♥♥ing gone. i dont know what happened, but for once i can finally play without a troll following me with a thousand mobs behind him.random people may teleport to you when youre low-level and offer you trades, accept them. its free♥♥♥♥♥♥most of the time xDGuilds became much more organized, even though theres still people spamming invites in the godlands.to be completely honest, this is one of the best communities i have ever seen.if you need help all you gotta do is ask.next up, FINALLY a Friends tab was added. since people in-game have different nicknames from their Steam accounts, it wasnt too easy to find eachother on Steam if you want to play with someone again. ive met a few great people through RotMG.the new dev team is trying to make this game as less pay2win as possible, even though you can still buy OP items by donating, you can get sliiiightly weaker items just by playing normally. with the only pay2win thing being Character Slots (you only start with one) and Vault Chests (you only start with one as well, letting you keep only 6 items in the Vault.)in other words, buying gear with real money is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing useless since you have to unlock Vault Chests and Character Slots.wait wut? you dont even know this game at all?okay, let me explain.its a Perma-Death game. you lose EVERYTHING when you die. except pets, skins, unlocked Classes and gear you store in the Vault.the Gear in this game is divided by Tiers, you start from lvl 1 by killing weak mobs, getting T1/T2 stuff, then moving on further into the island where theres harded mobs that drop T3/T4 stuff, etc.theres an Ultimate Tier, which doesnt always mean that its better than the normal tiers (max normal Tier is 12). Ultimate Tier gear has special abilities with it, such as shooting Presents instead of Magic Bolts, or a ring that upgrades 2 different stats instead of 1.there is a TON of different classes, each player to their own. there are close/medium/long ranged classes. each with their own abilities, my favourite being the Rogue and Sorcerer.previously id give this game a 4/10, but now i give it an 8.5/10 for the huge improvements.look, i know the game's graphics and animations look simplistic as ♥♥♥♥, but trust me, thats one of the reasons that make it great.

												This has got to be one of my favorite free to play MMOs of all time. It has great coop gameplay which relies on skill to stay alive, and staying alive is very important because it is a PERMADEATH game. It runs in Flash, so its compatible with almost all systems. The graphics are a retro pixelated masterpiece and will definitely bring on the nostalgia. The game has no ending, making it very addictive. This game is still being updated regularly and new content is being added all the time. There are 14 classes to unlock, loads of items to be found, dungeons for all skill levels, and a guild system to help encourage cooperation.This game is also full of bugs that are difficult to fix, given the nature of the coding. The bugs aren't game-breaking but can get annoying at times. There is an unsolvable issue with memory leaks that will force you to restart the game every hour or so. Spambots advertise for websites that sell items illegally. Do not buy anything from them. The items they sell can be farmed in the game without spending any money. There is a trading system which you can use to buy, sell, trade, or gift items with other players. Do not spend money on items, it is a waste!Some people, including myself, experience a bit of lag when playing the Steam version of this game. If you have issues such as input delay, I encourage you to give it another shot by playing it at its home, www.realmofthemadgod.com.With all that in mind, I still thoroughly enjoy this game and support its development by buying extra vault space and character slots. I would recommend it to anyone who likes skill based shooters and MMORPGs. Did I mention its FREE?!Update: Since I quit playing RotMG regularly, a lot has changed. The old management is out and new people have taken their place and seem to be doing much better. They seem to make much better use of their resources and have their priorities in a much better order. The game and owners/developers are making much needed progress and deserve a little recognition.			"

												It's a fun game , it's permadeath , but you have a vault where you can put stuff for your characters if you die. Only one chest if you're F2P like me. The game itself is hard and requires some getting used to. Dying is normal in the game, every character dies eventually, even if you have the best armors and weapons and you're maxed and have a legendary pet.So buckle up for this 2d bullet-hell farmfest , where you farm for gear and potions, which you will lose eventually.

												Meh. They really need to have ""meh"" as an option. After playing this game for 6 hours I still have no strong feelings or opinions one way or the other.On the bright side this game is fast and frantic, you're not held down by all the tedious things that most games will bog you down with. There's pvp, co-op, all that stuff as well.The down side? 200% pay2win. Most games will have two forms of curreny: An in-game system and a ""special"" currency you have to buy with real-world money. There's absolutely no way of earning any money in this game, none, no monsters will ever drop so much as a single coin for you. Buy, buy, buy. That is the ONLY way of making any money in this game.Oh and just to make things more ""fun"" (for the game devs) it's perma-death pay2win. Let's say you spent $500 on your character and then die? Sucks to be you, everything is gone, buy it all over again. Whatever fun I may have by playing this is balanced out by my unwillingness to invest any real money into this game. The end result is me being perfectly neutral towards this game. I can easily just give this game a thumbs down right now, but I'm feeling generous.By the way this game has nothing to do with Legends Of Yore or Hack Slash Loot, I made that mistake too. The graphics are just public domain or something. (Probably a game making engine.)			"

												2012 review:AMAZING game!!! First ever truly FREE game, where supporting the creators doesn't give you an unfair advantage. Very good game!2016:So yea.. that was awhile go wasn't it? Alot has changed.... for the worse.The game is not truly 'free' anymore, there are numerous pay2win factors in the game. The game is still good and fun at times but it has some serious issues.I pretty much quit, I come online now and then to run a couple dungeons and then I'm off. Sometimes I go for longer when I decide to stream abit.I feel like this game does not deserve any players and should just die off already. What kabam is doing to the players and the game is horrible. From reading the forums you see alot of people that are done with the game. They either want to quit or ask questions about the longevity of this game. And there's certain people that keeps feeding the community this idea that as long as you support the game (buy gold) it will not shut down.Now maybe this is correct, but I dont think we should promote and feed such a company.They have literally done nothing for the past like year?No new content or adaptations of dungeons, no promised changes. And dont even bring up the 'that was another team'. If they trash ideas, communicate this.It's ridiculous how infested with cheaters this game is. I bet over 50% of the players are cheaters or have cheated at one point to build up their accounts.Not to mention the game being overrun with multiboxers.I think people go easy on kabam because of their love for this game. The game is good and enjoyable. But it is also an MMO, and such games require maintenance and regular updates to keep stuff fresh and exciting.I'm getting the same vibes when hacking first became visible widely and people just basically ignored it because it did not hurt them. And look where we are now.Yes they have put on some sort of fix for event notifiers. But not after ALOT of complaints, we can wake them up if we really want them to.I'm truly amazed at the people that can still religiously play this game every day. How do you not become bored after an hour?Is it because you are addicted? Have nothing else to play? Because trust me, there are ALOT of great games out there with developers that DO care.Of course we do not KNOW what is up with kabam, maybe they are rewriting the entire game?But the fact remains, there is no communication whatsoever. And they've basically let the game run on autopilot.So if you want to play a bullet hell, permadeath mmo then by all means play this game. The game is still good and you can do fine without buying gold. But I will also tell you to not get invested in this game, it honestly does not deserve your time. Once you've reached the endgame stuff will become stale rapidly. If you can endure the cheaters and multiboxers and lack of communcation/updates from the developers that is.DECA has taken over from Kabam now.So far it seems to be going in the right direction. They have fixed a duping exploit fairly quickly and made some additions to the game suggested by the players. Let's hope they keep this up.			"

												Realm of the Mad God is both one of the best games I've ever played and one of the worst. I first started playing the game in April of 2012 with a couple of friends. Initially, I wasn't hooked—pixel graphics, permadeath, MMO, bullethell...none of them exactly appealed to me. I drove the game from my mind completely. But a few days later, in a bout of extreme boredom, I decided to hop into the game. Gave myself a name—Nathansbud—and hopped into the fray. And by God, it was FUN! Sure, I was horrible, but that didn't stop me from having a great time running around the lowlands. After that point, I was hooked through and through. I played the game for nearly a year without really getting ""good"" in the least, until I finally maxed my first character (which can be accomplished by drinking enough stat pots to hit the max, items which drop from a variety of enemies and dungeons), an Archer. I had this character for months, and it ended up being my first character to hit 5 Stars, or 2000 fame (experience, essentially). Fast forward to now, 4.5 years into playing Realm of the Mad God (with a year break in between). The game has had its ups and downs, good times and bad, some overtly P2W features were implemented at times, but all in all, the game is certainly worth picking up and playing. And if you do end up giving it a shot (which you should, as the game is free), shoot me a PM. I'm Nathansbud in game.Overall: 9/10			"

												This game has been my favourite game for the past 5 years and still to this day has been able to keep me intertained and in love with this game. Even after losing the best charecteur you've had yet, this game can and will bring you back to it. There is never a dull moment and always has room to improve. This is a massive game that has survived for many of years and it will be obvious to see why that is. Whether you just died on your by far best charecter or have just started playing for the first time, this game will always give you the need to come back and play. This is an amazing game that I would easily recommend to all types of gamers.			"

												RotMG is an MMORPG where the player is thrown into a wide world where everyone just wants to hurt you. Why? No idea. I was too lazy to read the lore that we have posted on our lovely site of RealmEye. However, the overall game is a great concept, where you slowly get better, pick up items, drink potions to increase your stats, and then.. well.. die. If permadeath games trigger your anger senses this game isn't for you. But, if you love grinding (stats that is) and watching yourself get better slowly over time, then this game is a great choice.With a new company in place, we are going to be seeing a new era as the game changes to their views. It's a great time to start playing as Month of the Mad God, a celebration of the game's release, is in place.			"

EDIT : by the way i literally had to open this game in steam and let it sit there and do nothing for 5 whole minutes before it would let me post this review.     10/10 would sit and look at debug information again .

												Kabam rigged this like a demolitions expert.Let me elaborate. This was a nice local resturant, with a speciality meal hardly seen before.It was a mix of rogue-like and bullet hell. There were bullets everywhere and if you couldn't handle the heat, it was back to the start. But starting over isn't all bad. You got fame, a currency that could be used on goods to get yourself running hotter. You could also unlock new classes for a spin on the taste. It was a nice resturant, filled with a jovial atmosphere.But then the owner handed it over to a rather greedy man.Now it is a pit of money and shame, filled with people looking to scam and the food reminicent of a fast food resturant.Nobody was happy, but the owners.

[Almost] Anything's better than Kabam!So yes, there are nasty reviews still left over from the Kabam age, and changes yet to be made in-game.There has never been a better time to join than now!

												{Rant} Game used to be one the most fun games I will ever have played but new developers have ruined it to its core. Too many micro-transactions and a lot of focus on paying to win basically. Pets are the key to survival which are insanely hard to get up to speed without farming trench's or etc. for a long time without paying money. And all new dungeons, and items, and in general game updates are focused around spending money for top tier gear whether it be the mystery box with a low chance for an extreme payout, or buying ""tops"" straight up. 8 ""8/8's"" no longer feels like I earned it since anyone can buy tops and farm fairly easily (but most likely die and give me a good laugh), UT's drop frequently and the game just feels like a massive, overpowering player base with no challenge any longer (especially with pets) and is just a waste of time to farm.{Summary}Large changes such as UT's being non-tradeable or the disappearance of amulets is not what ruined the game, it's the most recent p2w schemes, aka mystery box of profit that tear away from the core point of farming and finally having the RNG in your favor for that moment when you've achieved a great set after good work, not having exclusive items in the mystery box that won't be in a dungeon for 3 months...{Suggestion}I love Warframe and League of Legends, for some reason a LOT of RoTMG players left for league, not sure why but I was hooked also so check them out, realm is just not worth the time any longer. And Warframe gives a perfect feel for the payout for time you put in farming, very Face of Mankind esque but updated constantly and very satisfying to play unlike another great games downfall.(The Big Lebowski)Has the world gone crazy?Seen too many games go to♥♥♥♥♥♥...

There is permadeath so all of your levels, items and cool skins you got are gone ad you have to restart again. you can pretty much BUY all of your gear making all of your stuff have no value at all.

												be dyin' erey day yo, still ain't mad. But yeah, this is a REALLY, REALLY addicting game. It's gonna be very hard NOT to spend money on it, but it's worth it if you like the game enough.(edit: a year after i wrote this)i still die every day, my characters literally do not last for more than 5 days. my mind practically revolves around this game and i've spent around $300 on it. i've invested around 700+ hours on this piece of rainbow♥♥♥♥♥♥and my deaths actually do frustrate me now because i'm actually maxed. but anyway, this game is better when playing with friends, or if you have a guild. when it's late and you're the only one up, you can just relax and farm in the godlands. even if you're rich as hell, npe's with friends will help ease the boredom.this game also has its own economy, not like cs:go, tf2, or dota where you could trade via steam and steam chat, but in the game itself, and the company that owns the game will help you with all your problems but they do not care about trading itself, only bug fixes and blah blah. trading in this game isn't as profitable as godlands farming though, due to the amount of time it takes although you could always go on realmeye which is similar to tf2outpost or cs:go lounge to post trades and wait for someone to PM you while youre actually playing the game.the main goal in this game is probably to max. 6/8 is a start to new players. for players who already have all 12 characters 8/8 maxed with all the gear they want, they usually make another set of backup characters or start a collection - like all the ut's in the game or all the treasures or all the tops.i see nothing wrong with the community besides (i say nothing and besides in the same sentence ironicly) some chat spammers who could easily be ignored, and even notifers seem to be a problem but i don't mind them. the people are fine though, except for the leechers, but can you blame them?-update 8 months after i wrote the second update:i like how they fixed the notifers. i didn't understand it at first, since i thought any time you entered a realm you'd have to wait 2 minutes but it makes sense on how you could just nexus in case you almost die or store some pots in your inventory and re-enter the realm without having to wait.anyway, realm lag. it's not your internet, it's realm, it always has been realm. i haven't played in months (though i have around 1,300 hours on it including my hours on steam) and i can see that the lag is slightly better, but not all the way better. there's still only around 3-4 lucky hours of the day where there's no noticable lag. i'm sure with the hella loads of updates they did a month or two ago this summer that they tried fixing it, still i don't see why they can't add more ram to the servers with the amount of money people spend in a month of just playing the game.i think that's one of the main reasons people stop playing realm. the first reason is that realm is the gamer's heroin and you should probably only play under an hour a day, 3 days a week or you'll get sucked into the vortex of neverending gameplay and the financially broke life.

												I thoroughly enjoy playing Realm of the Mad God. Gameplay is crazy and fast paced and I love the 8-bit graphics! The only downsides are that it's a little 'play to win' and lag spikes might cause your character to die - and dying is permanent here.			"

												It's my favourite. The graphics are very well done; so well done, my eyes were baptized upon seeing the amazing quality this game has provided. Along with graphics, the definite story-line was amazing. The final boss was so well designed using his amazing powers such as shooting rectangular and circular pixels. The difference between the bosses and normal monsters is that bosses shoot more and do more damage. I thought this was a well-thought and creative attribute, providing originality. The characters produced were also fantastic, not being the most generic characters at all. Characters such as ""mage"" and ""knight"" were concepts I wish other games would use. The characters were 100% unique and never before seen in any other game. Overall a very creative game.  5/5 stars for sure, without a doubt.			"

												A narrative review of such a memorable game...Realm of the Mad God or ROTMG combines a bullet hell experience with loot galore, infused with an retro 8 bit art stylew ith the soon to love repetitive theme tune... Your thrown straight into to ""realms""  of the game after a stress free tutorial. Free to roam around the games enviroment being spawned into a beach type enviroment. One either treks inland or finds the function of teleport on the map and clicks towards the center of the map. Then the first grey screen hits you. You have been killed by...(insert reason here, most likey gelatinious cube or dank oh no its a tree). Then one is probably gripped onto the fully realised experience of perma-death mechanics within the game and perhaps either addicted/hooked to the progression that one can achieve-the mighty challenge. Or straight out ""I quit"". Although the idea of returning might come apparent.After a few hours one will aqcuire the knowledge of peer to peer trading, the meeting of the varied community presented, ""beggers"" who play the game to ask for items, and the meeting of the grim reaper ;) and the surface of the ROTMG experience. Digging below that surface will come the  many dungeouns and events and of course facing Oryx-the mad god.  Or throw your wallet at the screen and buy the gold purchasable items for real money...but the satisfaction of such would be nill. Pets also fit under the pay to win section in some essence as your realise bringing up a pet is new entire game in itself. Vaults and character slots will need to be purchased with gold as well. So non-buyers may struggle. The game is frustrating, annoying and depressing after death. Yet dancing in the ""Realms of the Mad Gods"" is seen super fun, especially in those naive exploring stages. I think many past and present players will be able to relate and agree. Who knew death could be so gripping.			"

												To be honest if there was an option of recomending it and not, i would choose that. I mean this game is just that to me, 50/50. See, let me start off by saying i played this on Kong back in  October of 2011, loved it. A few laggy moments but that was because of an overloaded server (which is very unlikely to happen). Than summer of 2012 came. And oh boy, did it start to change. I have been noticing the monoplizing of the market place, everything was very steeply priced, and i couldn't afford it. So i played as a noob for about a year or so. Left ROTMG, left Kong. And came to steam. And then i found ROTMG, i was exstatic. It was very nostalgic for me. But then i noticed the market, it got HUGE, little portals to smaller markets, eggs, food, and dungeon keys, it was very surreal. And then i finally gave in, and bought some vaults (because i started getting good and had little to no area to put my loot). Big mistake, that was when Kabam milked my steam wallet dry. I mean it was my decision, but my back was against the wall, the game that i loved back then, or other games. And that is why i don't recomend ROTMG, it started out play to win, now its just pay to win. 4.5/10			"

												I know everyone is Upset with the Pay2Win mechanics of the game, but I assure you the game is still fun. Most people who pay for their gear arent the greatest and will eventually die with it anyway. Playing through the game and getting better with each dungeon will tone your skills. I have only ever spent money on some extra vault space and character slots with the Noob pack, 200 hours of Game play and I am using the top tier loot and have leveled my own pet up without paying. Don't blame those who Pay2Win as a reason for ruining the game. I do think Kabam should remove Tops from the store though.			"

												I am a very old payer of this game, ever since WildShadow owned it and there was the old forums. This game used to be amazing, fun, interactive and enjoyable. You had to put time into the game to get anywhere, and even then you could lose it all in one death. Regardless of that, it hooked almost all players of this game who were willing to put 5+ hours a week. Personally, I was very addicted to this game during 2011 and 2012. Then, doomsday came: Kabam bought Realm of The Mad God. Everything was transformed into buying gold to achieve things. Back in the old days, you had to grind dungeons to get an incantation to just maybe get a tier 12 item in the wine cellar. Now, just buy realm gold and get tier 12 items in nexus. It's ♥♥♥♥ed up.Unless you're rich as ♥♥♥♥ and don't care about money, don't get this game.			"

												One of the most greedy companies out there, Kabam, has FINALLY sold this game to a new and much more promising one: DECA games. This is somewhat of a godsend if you ask me, as Kabam had given up on the game a while ago and weren't active at all. In the short time that DECA has been at the steering wheel, they have already made miracles happen and shown that they aren't afraid to take the game down for a day while fixing a few things. This proves that they're capable of changing things Kabam didn't care about and that they are quick to act when crisis strikes.Due to Kabams inactivity, they game had slowly began to die out and lose most of its dedicated players. With DECA, the game has been revived, and A LOT of players have returned. The future is bright for the Realm.			"

												Okay, this is a tricky game to review, so bear with me.     The people think that the game is just ""pay to win"" now aren't exactly right.  Of course there is still buying items and you can't get some items without buying them with USD or other currency, but that doesn't mean you necessarily have to buy the items to have fun in the game.  You can have just as much fun without buying items.      Second, you can't just play this game for 5 minutes, die by a sumo wrestler and review this game bad.   You cannot be good at this game in a whiff, practice is needed       Some people seem to forget the difference between a terrible game and a really hard game.  This is not a terrible game.  Kabam has not ruined this game, they have just tried their best to make a profit on Realm of the Mad God, because they bought it, you think it's going to be cheap buying a popular game?       Anyways, it has mindless fun.  Once you become good with this game, it gets fun doing the events like the Lord of the Lost Lands, and see the new dungeons like the Ice Cave and the Puppet Master's Theater (yeah, you like those dungeons don't you guys, they were from KABAM!)  And the most satisfying moment is when you go to a dungeon hoping for something rare and   you get what you want.   It is so satisfying.    The features of the game  Vault      In this game, when you die, you die forever, and you have to make another character, and you know what that means.  Anything that your character died with, goes away,   FOREVER    The vault, is a place where you can safely store your items so when your character dies, or has a full inventory, they can put the items in the vault.  The vault is the same size as the character's inventory (8) and each account starts out with one vault.   Pets      This sometimes gets some hate.  Pets are little creatures that hatch from  Pet Eggs [www.realmeye.com]  Each pet has different abilities, some being able to heal your magic power or health points.  Some people say that it makes the character Paladin render useless.  You can feed pets, and the more feed power the weapon, the higher level abilities they gain.  Pets' tiers are common, uncommon, rare, legendary, and divine.  It is extremely hard to even get your pet to legendary without buying pet food, which has a lot of feed power for money.   Character Slots      If you're playing this game, and you're tired of playing the same character, but you don't want to kill your current one because he has good loot or he has  maxed a stat. [www.realmeye.com]  Character slots are right down your alley.  Character slots, (for realm gold, which requires money) allow you to have more than one character alive at the same time.  Each time you buy a slot, the price goes up a little bit, so don't waste all your money at once! The bottom line      Realm of the Mad God has a lot of great gameplay and features, but it has lost a lot of players due to Kabam making the game supposedly ""pay to win.""			"

												This used to be a fun game back when it came out but it is showing its age now.Realm is a bullet hell game with perma-death! Mess up once and you are done for my friend, it is all the way back to the beginning with you, or is it? Well yes it is but let me explain. You can go anywhere at anytime and reaching the level cap is not very difficult so end game revolves around maxing your character via potions that increase your stats.Get enough potions and you will max all your stats and that is it, nothing left to do. Or at least it was until pets were added and pets last between deaths so that was a welcomed addition but honestly the game is solely about min-maxing and once you have done that their is nothing left to do. This is compounded by the fact that not only does maxing your stats take a very long time but the dungeons you run to get the potions to max your stats are usually pretty lethal so you will rage quit quite a few times when your 4/8 character dies. I had fun with the game originally but I used joy2key to make the game playable with a controller and that was very imperfect but I found it a step up from the default control scheme and that is a big reason I don't recommend the game.The screen is extremely zoomed in so you are normally attacked by things off-screen before you even have a chance to see them so you are dodging many bullets while guessing where they are coming from. Increasing the screen resolution does nothing to help (it doesn't scale) and enemies can come from any direction so you need to be on your toes often which can be fun when you first start out but when you are at the stage of trying to actually not die, it is just plain fustrating. Why controller support hasn't been added yet is mind-blowing. One of the appeals of the game is that you can play with other players too, you know like an MMO but this is a lie. Other players exist but whoever does the most damage to a monster gets the loot it drops if it drops anything at all (low drop rates, of course) so naturally you want to be in the front line performing lots of damage right? Well yes you do but go look at the screenshots for this game and you might notice something which is all the sprites are flat and 2D and nothing seperates your characters from all the 100s of others so other players will actually be your biggest cause of death many times, rather than something you want to actively seek out since you can't even tell where you are when a 'omega death blow' homes in and kills you with a dozen other players just blocking your view.Overall its a game you can jump into and enjoy but as soon as you try to really take the game seriously you will realize how shallow and fustrating it really is and the fact it hasn't improved over the years really doesn't help.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

With a massive amount of money grabbing from corprate run devs, you will be bombarded with it. However, with enough skill you can get passed the money aspect of the game, and simpily buy items with player made currency. It's beautiful if you think about it. Oh and if you die, prepare to cry.

												Now, where to begin with this game. Since the start this game, it gave a lot to its community and to the game. It thrived on people willing to accomplish tasks without dying or 'rage quitting', one can never simply 'give up' on this game, as you'll always find a spot for it.  In the past few years, there have been a few changes, for the better or not these changes have affected the RotMG community and the game directly, and as a result of this the somewhat downfall of Realms came to exist. Some things seem to mean more than others as the game gets easier and more toxic, items are no longer rare and items are more easy to obtain now that bots are about as frequent as the encounter of a real player.  All in all, this game was once wonderful and it thrived, and it still is, just not as good ;)I would reccomend you try out the game, just have fun while you play it, try to ignore the things that ruin the game as that'll only ruin your game.Have fun Realming !Tham.

												Pros:Not to sound biased but... None I can think of.Cons:- Permadeath. In an RPG. With inventory loss.- Awful graphics, even for me - and I love pixel graphics.- It's pay to win. Enough said.- Most of it is just going around the same areas killing different enemies.- You get almost no help whatsoever.- The gameplay is so simple its just boring and repetitive.- Skill won't help you win. It's mostly relies on luck.- Hardly any content. How do I know? The entire game literally took 3 secs to download with average internet.- Much like WOW, you have to pay real money to anything. Even changing your name. - Speaking of names, you can only have a name 10 characters long.So, overall, my opinion of this game is that it's terrible. I recommend you find a good rpg instead, like Neverwinter. Even though that's pay to win too, it at least gives you a chance to actually play the game - and enjoy it.			"

												This game is very enjoyable, its been able to entertain me for 72hrs so far... and others more.. yet they go on about how microtransactions ruin the game; you don't even need to buy anything.  You can earn all the things that are being sold by just putting some effort in the damned game and feel better about it too.  Although, you can buy things to advance yourself without putting much effort into the game, which is, of course fine.  But anyhow, the game is very fun.  It's extremely lengthy.. you can play it for virtually forever lol.  Going around, starting over, killing, farming, getting your character to maxed level which is 20 then going and getting potions to upgrade your character is quite an experience; you have to invest lots of time into the game; and its worth it, because in the end, you feel like you accomplished something especially since some people just quit because it's ""too hard"" or ""frustrating to lose everything when I die"", when its fixed to the point you lose everything when you die.. it makes it more intruging, you actually have some insentive to not just say ""♥♥♥♥ all"" and run around like an idiot without a care and to actually play smartly and do things correct... The game isn't for all, but for the some who it is for, you'll enjoy it greatly; just as I do! :)			"

												I can only find two problems with this game. Unfortunately, both problems make the game virtually unplayable.1. Too much Pay 2 Win. Seriously. This is the WORST pay 2 win I have seen in ANY game. EVER! Even EA is shocked by the excessive Pay 2 Win (Fun Fact: I actually like EA.). Half the game's content needs the coins, which it's hyper hard to get any unless you're shelling out money for them. Without coins, you have a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game with very little content available.2. The controls are UN-RE-FREAKING-SPONSIVE! I disabled shadows, I set the game to windowed, I disabled text bubbles, and I even closed everything off except for this game, and the controls are still barely managable! My character, for no reason, decides to go left when I want him to go right. sometimes, he doesen't even move at all! Literally ALL of my deaths recently was because of the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor controls.This game isn't a bad concept. However, these two problems are both equally bad, and bad enough to turn the game into a complete mess.			"

												I played this game for more than 3 hours to get a character to max level. Upon reading some guides, I realized that the game is quite broken because of the training methods in god realms. Even a level 1 could not only survive but reach max level in less than an hour without shooting, and you even get rewarded for that. I actually enjoyed playing this game, good for short breaks.			"

												If you can get passed the micro-transactions that allow plays to become maxed immediately, then there is tons of content and gameplay time you can get out of this. It is not pay to play, every item you see in those shops are obtainable from playing normally and it's really fun once you start to get the hang of the game.Pros-Can be played in a massive group or solo.Several weapons/armours/abilities/rings to farm for per class.Large community for help.A steady learning curve, you will get better.A pretty fair game when it comes to the permanent deaths, you shouldn't have many unfair deaths that make you ragequit.Cons-Spam botsHave to pay to unlock more character slotsHasn't been many major updates for a very long time.This game just isn't for everyone, but it's free and definitely worth trying out. I'm not that into games with 3rd person view but I have hundreds of hours of this game on the ROTMG website.			"

												Don't be fooled by 68 hours, My main account most likley has several hundred hours of gameplay. This game offers so much, but it's rather difficult to get into, while being incredibly easy to get in to. Starting the game and exploring is fun and you can do it from day one, at first glance it's a fun game, but nothing you'd spent much time on. Now If you look past that, there is actually so much. The leveling system isn't what determines a character. Maxed stats are. In game ""potions"" are used as a sort of currency in the trading economy, along with gear and other items. These potions are obtained by defeating difficult enemies and completeing certain dungeons.  To problem is, getting this far takes practice, detrmination and grit. Death is inevitable, dont let it set you back. Learning how to rebound from deaths becomes an integral feature as you make characters that are more and more powerful. Even the most powerful characters who have all 8 stats maxed are prone to quick deaths, the game in unforgiving, and requires skill, but offers much in return for those who deliver.			"

												Realm Of The Mad God(RotMG) is one of my favourite games is steam right now.You willl be facinated of what classes to unlock and what items the game Has in store For YouAt First, you will feel Bored but when you get to lvl 20 your life will be change forever.This game is a retro 8-bit style game.It has Alot of classess to be unlocked and lots of items.It is a perma death game too. so if u die then u must create a new character again.But this is thetype of challenge that we want in the community and it will be rewarding after you kill Dungeon Bosses toget Soulbound bags.What are Soulbound Bags? Well they are loot that are in a specific bag color. The colors ranges fromPurple , Cyan and white. White Bags Are the hardest to get but has good stuff inside and you have pets too who has alot ofabilities which can aid you in battle. the places you should avoid unless you have better equips and at least lvl 20 which are Godlands(glands).You can die Pretty much instantly by some gods like Medusa(Snake Head Lady),Leviatan(Blue Creature) and Djinns(blue creature that shoots snowballs) and more.Whenever you feel your screen shaking, its time to meet Oryx.Oh and expect death whenever that happens because he is the hardest boss in the game and alot of players die by him.so i recommend you to nexus or die a brave person.Whenever you die, dont be sad just think about what your next character is gonna be and start over again.Remember Guys, EXPECT DEATH!!-StxofDark(RotMG Username0			"

												If you don't mind dying....like, a LOT, and if you like old Gauntlet-esque ""bullet-hell"" type of games, then this is the game for you. Even though you WILL die, and lose high-level stuff quite frequently, (this game has perma-death) it still has an addictiveness to it, that keeps us all coming back for more punishment. It's deceptively simple gameplay, enables a quick learning curve, while retaining difficulty, and replayability. After reaching a high level with one class, and farming the ""godlands"" for high-tier items, and stat potions, unlocking new classes to play as, that can use said items becomes the desired goal. The trading system in the game is also very addictive, and higher level players tend to give away high-tier items quite often. I've played over 80 hours, between my different accounts, and it's still quite enjoyable to me. That, couipled with the fact that it's free, makes this game a must-try for everyone.

												Since the game was bought out by Kabam, it has become incresingly more about getting money rather than making the game more enjoyable. The game however is still VERY enjoyable IF  you simply ignore the purchasable content, I would definitely recommend it.			"

												If you don't mind dying....like, a LOT, and if you like old Gauntlet-esque ""bullet-hell"" type of games, then this is the game for you. Even though you WILL die, and lose high-level stuff quite frequently, (this game has perma-death) it still has an addictiveness to it, that keeps us all coming back for more punishment. It's deceptively simple gameplay, enables a quick learning curve, while retaining difficulty, and replayability. After reaching a high level with one class, and farming the ""godlands"" for high-tier items, and stat potions, unlocking new classes to play as, that can use said items becomes the desired goal. The trading system in the game is also very addictive, and higher level players tend to give away high-tier items quite often. I've played over 80 hours, between my different accounts, and it's still quite enjoyable to me. That, couipled with the fact that it's free, makes this game a must-try for everyone.

												The game, surprisingly, has many layers. There, of course the spam when you first log in, the people trying to pedal you items for real money, all of which you will eventually lose. Which is actually one of the things i like about this game. You're going to die, otherwise, what would be the point of those leaderboards? You don't want to die? Too bad, Oryx says you have to. The first time I logged on was when the entire server was being ported to Oryx's castle, and, needless to say, i died instantly. I just laughed at myself a bit afterwards, and stopped playing for a while, but picked it back up anyways, when a friend I had introduced to the game wanted me to. It still held that first aspect, but my friend opened my eyes to the more, i will say ""MLG"" side of it, for lack of a better adjective. It gets very fun, yet frustrating at times, especially when that character you got really lucky on suddenly dies because you lagged while fighting a big boss.			"

												RotMG is a very unique MMO. It manages to combine teamwork, bullet hell, and dungeon crawling in one neat package. Hope right in and watch as you quickly level up and gain power, then suddenly be killed and lose it all, then hop in again and get it all back! Server strain is a big issue, but as long as they aren't full you should be able to manage. Maxing out your class of choice is quite a challenge, and should keep you entertained for quite a while. The aforemented Mad God is also quite satisfying when you do get to attack it. The hilarity of watching a whole server scramble through his punishing dungeon is very memorable indeed.If I had to say what this games biggest flaw is, it would be the turn towards pay-2-win it has taken. This unfortuantely was not always a problem; realm gold (the game's premium currency) used to just be good for buying cosmetic dyes and pets, or extra storage space. Now, with all sorts of high-tier gear being offered for it, the game feels more hollow and less rewarding. The adventure is still there, but it seems redundant when you can bypass it with the wave of a credit card. This is what personally keeps me from getting back into the game (along with technical difficulties with connecting to my Kongregate account), but if you're fine with it, don't let me stop you! It's still a wonderful game, and i'd recommend at least giving it a shot. It's free, after all; what have you got to lose?			"

												Changing my opinion entirely, first lets get things straightWildshadows (creators of RotmG) sold their game to KabamNow that's out of the way lets talk about why i changed opinionFirst now you can basically just pay for your items and that ruins the fun of the game, you could literally buy all the best stuff in the game as a level 1 and whoop a god's♥♥♥♥♥and maybe even onyx's Second, I cant even log in to my RotmG account now which had alot of good equipment on it, and did i mention the game isn't in update anymore? thats right the only ""updates"" we get are ""What was your favourite time in realm"" ""Buy booster packs!"" News feeds and much more useless crap.Next, about 66% of the game is populated by bots saying ""Buy your pots and weapons at ""Swaguniverse.com"" where we are 100% trusted and wont scam you at all...""The game is slowly dying even as i was typing this review, and personally i dont think this game is worth it anymore even if it's free.Even alien swarm is better then this now and its an ""inactive"" game now			"

												This game is one of the most fun and unigue games out there. However, it is kind of pay2win since people with a lot of money can just buy realm gold and other stuff. It also sucks that you can't trade almost all the UT items. I'm 13 now; stopped playing this game on Kongregate when I was 9 and came back to try it. So many things have changed and I'm not even sure whether it was for the better or worse. If you like a game that is kind of pay2win but still fun and can put up with that, this is your game.			"

												This game is not a very forgiving game in any form. Those that take the high risks get the High rewards, but in a perma-death game, the rewards are easily gone with a simple mistake. After 60 hours of playing thi\s game, you hope to have a clan that will back you up, you get some of the best gear, and don't die by a Night Elf. Micro Transactions will get you the best gear in the game, but that takes more of the fun out of it. If you spend your coin (real life cash) then unly by from special deals, and make it storage or extra character slots, things you can keep after death.			"

												Gone to complete♥♥♥♥♥♥shortly after Kabam acquired the game. Should have expected it, judging from all the other terrible games it published. If you decide to play and ignore all the money grab the game, then its fun enough for a while but having 1 character slot gimps you a lot, especially for new people who die a lot. It also sells you highest tier gear in the cash shop, which lures in new players who buy and then instantly lose $10+ from dying. Also, having a good pet costs tons of money, so be prepared to spend lots of time grinding out fame or paying for better pets. Its not necessary to have a pet but it makes everything so much easier and increases your survivability, which in a game of permadeath, is very important. A maxed divine pet is $500+. The game has perma death so dying is pretty devastating. If you decide to buy anything, stick to character slots and vaults.			"

												I enjoyed this one way more than I was expecting to, and so did everyone else who tried that game out (that I know of)What you have is a bullet hell MMO, the max level is 20, and is easy to reach within a short amount of time, after that, instead of exp you accumilate fame instead which can be used to buy a few in game items. And leveling up characters is how you unlock other classes, so you could play for a while before unlocking them all. It's just jolly good fun, really. Also when your character died, he's dead forever. Not that it matters since you can have another one up to the same point within the hour. it's free, so give it a go.			"

												A simple rougelike MMO, which even now I wonder how such an awesome idea didn't come to be sooner.Unlike other MMO's your character does not respawn.  This means that you must make a new character everytime you die.  That may sound tedious, but there is no character customization outside of the class you choose so you can quickly start playing.  This makes becoming a high level player a measure of a players ability to decide when to attack, when to retreat, and when to call your friends to gang up to get protected loot.For those of you who play MMO's just for notoriety there are leaderboards for highest level in different time ranges.EDIT: This game is very freemium now, but you can totally play the game just fine without paying for anything.  Everything you buy is extra to what the game originally was.			"

												-=WARNING THIS GAME IS FOR PEOPLE THAT CAN HANDLE DYING=-This game is extremely fun, but you will die ALOT. This game is permadeath..sorta. You see when you die you lose all the items you had equiped but there is a vault witch keeps your stuff between characters in the chest. Witch means you always dont want to equip your best gear because your afraid of dying.i have only just finished getting to lv20 for the 3rd time and after that dont go running to gods rightaway you want to stay back do enough damage to get loot. Players in RotMG have a thing called 8/8 it means 8 out of 8 of thier sts are maxed. To max a stst you have you get sts potions witch drop from gods yet since your not 8/8 its very difficult to do. If your new to this game dont go asking people for stuff or YOU WILL BE YELLED AT.Overall this is a very good game but very difficult to ""beat"".I give this game a 8/10 for its very fun gamplay and the community that comes with it.

Paying in this game won't make you automatically win, you still have to have enough skill to survive, BUT paying for things such as extra character slots or extra storage space is super helpful. After playing this game, you feel inclined to purchase things, instead of forced to. You can easily have a fun experience without spending any money.			"

												One of the best games I've played in a long while. You can either sit back and farm, or dive head-in and do quests leading up to higher levels. You can play with friends or alone, though it's a lot more fun with friends. I absolutely love the graphic styling, and the unique minions and bosses. I really enjoy killing miniosn to open Portals. It's actually a pretty good idea. The higher level enemies you kill, the higher level the enemies in the portal will be. And the fact that it's free to play really helped me be able to give this game a 10/10, along with very few other games.			"

												I am going to be dead honest with you: there is a reason why this is a free game on steam: there is no way you can charge anyone to play this game. It bet it ringed a bell in your head and you either got caught by it being free, the graphics(welp) or the gameplay premise of a MMO/bullet Hell hybrid, or all of them combined.the result is quite far, far from even being remotely interesting. randomly generated terrains that cause enemies to get stuck in the middle, input delay(in a bullet hell where you're meant to have precise controls) the overall CHAOS that is the enemy spawning and the utterly UGLY artwork of this game -and by ugly i mean look at that promo, and see how it doesnt reflect AT ALL what this♥♥♥♥♥♥is about-This piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥is nothing but a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of your average flash game poorly ported as a standalone, lacking elements as basic as a proper fullscreen mode, good controls or at least, something to do beyond the first tem or twenty minutes of holding M1.

												-=WARNING THIS GAME IS FOR PEOPLE THAT CAN HANDLE DYING=-This game is extremely fun, but you will die ALOT. This game is permadeath..sorta. You see when you die you lose all the items you had equiped but there is a vault witch keeps your stuff between characters in the chest. Witch means you always dont want to equip your best gear because your afraid of dying.i have only just finished getting to lv20 for the 3rd time and after that dont go running to gods rightaway you want to stay back do enough damage to get loot. Players in RotMG have a thing called 8/8 it means 8 out of 8 of thier sts are maxed. To max a stst you have you get sts potions witch drop from gods yet since your not 8/8 its very difficult to do. If your new to this game dont go asking people for stuff or YOU WILL BE YELLED AT.Overall this is a very good game but very difficult to ""beat"".I give this game a 8/10 for its very fun gamplay and the community that comes with it.

												(Disregard however many hours steam says i have. I have what is probably well over 900 additional hours on the web version.) Nothing in this world has addicted me quite like Realm. I love it for many reasons and will probably never be free of it and to be honest i probably wouldn't stop playing it even if i wanted to. It has one of the best free to play models i have ever seen and stands to be the only game outside of tf2 i was genuinely happy to pay money for (and my first purcahse of 10$ was about 350 hours into the game). The action is fast paced and exciting like nothing else, nothing else in the world makes your heart pound quite like an O2 fight with a melee class. And the permadeath, while being the cruelest mistress you can ever imagine (along with her partner: lag), keeps the game interesting and has been taunting me with that elusive 8/8 for years bringing me back for more every time. This is my most played game of all time by a massive margin (minecraft dosn't count) and has good reason for it but if you're looking to pick up this game know that it's a very deep rabbit hole you're falling into, one with plenty of pain along the way. And video games shouldn't be painfull, please find something else. (Side note: The general community in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible and i would be happy if i learnt that most of them died IRL. That and lag can kiss my♥♥♥♥♥)			"

												I was initally drawn to the retro-styled aesthetics and comedic, Discworld-esque world-building elements of this pseudo-8-bit MMO. However, the sheer intensity of the combat is honestly too much for my sensibilities. But hey, if you like the idea of experiencing a fantasy-themed  'bullet hell' -- or perhaps 'Magic Missile hell' would be more apt term -- then jump right in. The controls are straighforward enough even for a dexterously challenged player like myself. But the pure volume of stuff that's out to kill you makes this an ideal experience for more competetive types.			"

I've played it 4 years on and off and have 700+ hours (on steam alone). When you die with a character youve had for a long time it may make you quit, but you will probably still come back.			"

												This game is a lot of fun, and in my opinion, completely worth your time. If you are a fan of bullet hells, and perma-death I think you'll be a fan. It isn't as good as it used to be (with the addition of a large number of pay-to-win aspects) it is still at its core, a fun game. I recommend trying it out and sticking around to see what DECA (the new owners) will do to improve it. Also, play on your browser or with flash projector, Steam is far to laggy.			"

ROTMG is great for a small group of friends willing to take on the adventures hinden within the realm portal.  Work you way up though ROTMG's character levels to unlock more specialized charcters to help you through your adventure.  All around great game! Thanks!			"

I dont think this has any thing to do with the new community on it i think has something to do with the greedy developers.In the days i use to play this it use the be hard to get  t12 bow or sword it use to take time and effort if tht were still the game i would totally recommend it however now a days ty to the greedy developers any old scrub can come in with a credit and get T12 gear thts why i dont recommend this game to anyone without a credit card			"

												Deca games is making Realm of the Mad God exciting again with the events they are doing and they are going to fix this game and the problems it has. It's a good, addicting game that you should totally try out, after all it is free and takes like no time to download. If you are a new player you should ignore all the spam bots at spawn, and set your chat star requirement option to be higher once you have played a bit more to filter out some of the spammers. Even if you don't like the game in it's current state or have quit the game, it will be worth checking it out some time in the future to see the great things Deca does with it.			"

												Other then occasional lag ever now and again, there really isn't much wrong with this game. The concept is simple, but the game is fun no matter how long you want to play. You can play just for 5 minutes when you have some spare time, or you can play with friends for hours and not get bored. One of the highlights of the game for me is Oryx's castle. Once all of Oryx's minions are killed, he sends the whole server to his castle. The game also is completely free to play, and won't force you to spend hundreds on enjoying the game.			"

												This game is one of the most fun and unigue games out there. However, it is kind of pay2win since people with a lot of money can just buy realm gold and other stuff. It also sucks that you can't trade almost all the UT items. I'm 13 now; stopped playing this game on Kongregate when I was 9 and came back to try it. So many things have changed and I'm not even sure whether it was for the better or worse. If you like a game that is kind of pay2win but still fun and can put up with that, this is your game.			"

												Realm Of The Mad God is one of those rare fast paced, RPG, Bullet Hell games. The games has an old fashioned pixel art style to it, which suits it, there is a good variety of classes to choose from and many bosses to fight and items to collect to strengthen your charcter(s). I personally think it's best play this with friends for it's more fun that way, and part from the having to use real life money to get in game money to buy like anything, this game is really fun and addictive as hell.

News feeds and much more useless crap.Next, about 66% of the game is populated by bots saying ""Buy your pots and weapons at ""Swaguniverse.com"" where we are 100% trusted and wont scam you at all...""The game is slowly dying even as i was typing this review, and personally i dont think this game is worth it anymore even if it's free.Even alien swarm is better then this now and its an ""inactive"" game now			"

												I can't even describe how annoying this game is. You spend 20 minutes grinding to the point where it's actually kind of fun and challenging, and then sometimes within 5 minutes of that, you die, lose everything, completely reset, and you're back to having to grind with a new character. What's worse is the death is almost always do to a massive lag spike caused by the server dumping everyone into a final boss battle before resetting the map. This game takes almost zero skill, just luck and endless patience.			"

												One of the best games I've played in a long while. You can either sit back and farm, or dive head-in and do quests leading up to higher levels. You can play with friends or alone, though it's a lot more fun with friends. I absolutely love the graphic styling, and the unique minions and bosses. I really enjoy killing miniosn to open Portals. It's actually a pretty good idea. The higher level enemies you kill, the higher level the enemies in the portal will be. And the fact that it's free to play really helped me be able to give this game a 10/10, along with very few other games.			"

												Permadeath game warning!  If you die, you have to start over with the lowest equipment and at level 1.Realm of the Mad God is a game of skill, if you can't develop the skills to play this, you may not enjoy this game.With all that said, RotMG is one of the most addicting games I have ever played.  It is simple yet elegant in design.  Start on the beach and work your way towards the center of Oryx's realm where the strongest monsters dwell.  Along the way you will face a constant stream of monsters, all of whom are intent on turning you into their next meal.  There are quests of varying difficulty, some you can solo but others you may need to gang up on with your fellow adventurers.The combat is point-and-click.  You aim and fire with your mouse, use spacebar for your special ability and you move with WADSQ.  There are 14 classes to choose from, each with it's own special ability and stat cap.You start at level 1, and can reach level 20 in a short amount of time.  Then the game really begins.  The gods in godlands have a chance of dropping potions which can raise one of your stats by 1 point.  The goal here is to max your stats to increase your damage output, defenses and regeneration ability.  The stat potions not found in the godlands can be found in dungeons dropped by the gods or by some of the quest events.  There are 8 stats in all, which you can potentially max.Equipment can be found everywhere.  From the lowlands to the godlands you will find gear of increasing strength.  Delving into the dungeons, you will find even more powerful equpment.  Equipment, Skill and stats are the 3 most important things when playing this game.Once certain requirements are met, Oryx(the antagonist in this game) will seal the Realm and summon all players to his castle in order to wipe you out once and for all.  Will he succeed?  That's up to you.When you first play this game, you will have 7 days to buy into a very good deal.  +2 character slots and +3 vault chests, as well as 2600 gold(+5 chests is recommended) and a penguin pet.  It is recommended that you use a spare email address to make a test account directly on the website realmofthemadgod.com (not on steam), to see if you like the game.  If you like it, either continue to play through the website or make a Steam account.  Having multiple character slots and vault chests available really helps because of the permadeath nature of this game.  You can stock up spare equipment and stat pots in the chests and you can play multiple classes when you have more character slots.  They have sales on character slots and vault chests relatively often, and those are the only things you'd want to spend money on..everything else is a waste because it is either consumable or will die with your character(backpacks are worth getting even though they die with you).  Don't bother with the Steam DLC pack, it's not worth it.I play this game almost exclusively(through the website).  It's a lot of fun and is a near-continuous adrenaline rush.  I'll reiterate, this is a game of skill and is not for everyone.  Be sure to try it before investing your time and money into it.			"

Also the pets system is amazing, you can level your pets up completely with in game currency, but if you want to get a legendary or divine pet, it is definitely easier for paying users.Overall great game, it's free so why not try it!

When you die, you start everything from the beggining. You have ONE character slot. Means if you wanna try another, you have to let your other one die. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

I've played it 4 years on and off and have 700+ hours (on steam alone). When you die with a character youve had for a long time it may make you quit, but you will probably still come back.			"

I would reccomend to buy the starting pack which will give you extra char slots (that are infinite) a pet (which is infinite) and chests (which also are infinite) (YOU CAN PLAY THIS GAME F2P but it takes alot of skill you just have to run around get items find an egg and youre started) heres why you should buy these. You will need character slots later on when you max and you have nothing to do. Because you will be able to make another character you can play even more. The chests will give you a place for saving items because when you die you loose EVERYTHING except pets character slots chests and items in chests. A pet will help you ALOT in this game you CAN play without buying stuff but i would recomend paying the small amount of 17 euro.Now to the game Its a bullet hell MMO and it is NOT EASY this takes alot of time to master! and alot of practise. When you are playing you will be going around killing monsters and as you go longer in towards the middle of your little island harder monsters will come. You will sometimes find monsters that drop portals and you can learn what these portals bosses drop of items. I would recomend playing this with a friend since alot of these dungeons and monsters are hard but you ARE playing with 84 other people on the server which makes the big event portals easier since the other players will be there to help.This is basically a game about running around killing bosses getting loot leveling up improving your pet dying then doing a little better everytime by improving your skill and your pet.I would recomend looking up guides on the internet quickly like 15 minutes of your time to find out how you get to lvl 20 easily and get to godlands begin to get loot and slowly learn the game.

												I only recommend this game to anyone who has to much time to waste. Really fun game with friends, kabam sucks, its not pay to win because everything you can pay for you can just find later in the game but chests and character slots are necessary to get into this game. oh and finally if you play this game dont be a begger, everyone was in your position of having nothing once before and they all were able to pull themselves out of poverty by themselves.

												In this case less is définitely more. Simple and addicting gameplay.Only 8 spots in inventory and 8 spots in vault which seems like it's gonna be horrible at first, but then you realise that's exactly why it's so easy to trade and find stuff. People don't pick up what they don't need and give everything away when they find something better. It's actually a pretty social game, because teamwork is greatly rewarded.Pretty amazing. In-game currency is way to expensive, but if it were 6 euro's I'd say it would be worth it. You don't need to buy in-game currency to get the best gear by the way. Doesn't seem to be Pay 2 win.Edit:Nowadays you need to enter an e-mailadres and password. The login-button is dead though so I can't play. Very common problem. Maybe playing via browser works, but then I can't use my characters.Edit2: Months later it all works again.			"

												This is my single most played game.ROTMG is one of my favorite games, dont get me wrong it has its flaws but this game is all about the gameplayThe visuals are an 8-bit theme so it may not be to everyones liking but for what it lacks in depth of visuals it makes up for in gameplay.PROS-----------------LOVE the bullet hell theme-Lots of classes to choose from-Nice variety of dungeons ranging easy to hard-Easy to pick up, very time consuming and hard to master-You will always have something to do.-Replayability is pretty insane-Perma-death-Visuals are simple but not lackingNeutral----------Community can be great with a guild or absolute garbage like with any communityCON----------------Cheaters are EVERYWHERE-Scams (are you surprised in an MMO setting?)-Able to buy top tier gear right away-RWT (again its an MMO)-Multiboxers-Lag (not just a little but where you dc or lag out and die)-Overall pretty P2W (Have to buy additional character slots (Start with 1), chests (Start with 1), and pets can cost $2000USD if you want them)Overall this game I know I can always come back to. I've played it 4 years on and off and have 700+ hours (on steam alone). When you die with a character youve had for a long time it may make you quit, but you will probably still come back.			"

												Not a bad game. In fact it's pretty fun. But it's a really good example that proves that free things in life sucks. But then again, it's not free to play, it's free to play, but expensive as you want it to be.It's still fun, but weird at the same time.it has no mercy. When you die, you start everything from the beggining. You have ONE character slot. Means if you wanna try another, you have to let your other one die. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I'll rate this game 6.5/10 out of a f2p experience. Probably 7.5/10 with a 20$ thrown in.			"

												A lot of MMOs I play fall into the hole of grinding for levels. The difference in ROTMG is that it doesn't try and hide that fact. ROTMG is all about getting the nearest enemy as fast as possible and killing it to gain it's juicy, addictive, experience points. I know what you're saying ""If the point of the game is to grind for xp upfront, how is this game engaging in any form!?"" Two words. Perma Death. That's right, you have to hold onto your character carefully lest all your precious work be undone. In the end ROTMG is great for when you need a break from other games, or maybe a game you can play whilst listening to a podcast.			"

												I see a lot of reviews not recommending this game because they say it's ""pay to win"". I don't agree with this at all. I've played this game quite a bit, not only through steam but through the website itself as well. I think the reason people believe it's pay to win is because of the starting area, where the new developer put the option, right where you spawn, to purchase very high tiered gear with coins, which can only be bought with real money. I don't think this is the best idea, because it imbalances the economy some and also encourages people who don't know what their doing to spend money on this equipment, only to lose it soon after by dying in this PERMADEATH game. That said though, this DOES NOT make the game pay to win. All of this equipment is obtainable through looting or trading with other players for other loot. There aren't many things that can ONLY be bought with real money, and these things are mostly clothing dyes, alt skins, food items to grow your pet faster then normal, and things like character slots or inventory space. Not having these things won't really detract from your experience playing this game, and it is definitely not pay to win. Maybe pay to get ahead slightly faster, but not pay to win. With that out of the way, I can definitely recommend this game. Like I said above, I've put many hours into this game because, put simply, it is a lot of fun. It's a fast paced bullet-hell permadeath shooter mmo that also just happens to be free, and there's no risk in trying it out.			"

												Realm of the Mad God is an amazing game. I could leave the review there but I won't. This game might appear to be one of those games that you play once and then forget about but if you actually give it a try it is ridiculously addictive. It is easy to pick up and heaps of fun to play with friends. Realm is a perma-death game with some things that carry over between lives. These things being a currency which is only earned when you die, your pets and any items that you leave in your vault. With a change of developers and lots of free stuff and new content coming in NOW is the perfect time to start playing. Hopefully with DECA (the new developers) running the show we can expect to see a whole lot more cool stuff being added. This game is one of my favourite games to play. My steam client says I have about 60 hours on the game but my main realm account runs on a different platform and that one would show you over 100 more hours. This game is easy to pick up, great to play with friends, and is lots of fun to play over and over again. Give it a try!			"

												Used to play this game all the time- then Kabam came in. Rarely touched the game at all after that. DECA games has now stepped in and great improvements have been made. The game seems to be going in a great direction, and I can't wait to see what new content DECA will be adding. The game is a bullet-hell MMO, with perma death. This makes the game very intense (if you are a new player, that is. Kabam added in pets and once you have played for a year or 2, just by simply having a good pet nearly everything in the game is no longer a challenge) and fun to play with friends.			"

												Don't usually write reviews but with the new takeover from DECA games, things seem to be improving. No major changes yet, but this game was going downhill under the ownership of Kabam.ROTMG is overall a fun game, the permadeath keeps things interesting. I'd suggest giving it a try, especially now that it has a new owner who wants to see the game do well.			"

												This is a very simple game which involves lots of grinding, learning through death, and losing everything in your inventory when you die, so why is it such a good game? That feeling you get when you get the loot. When you see a white bag for your first time, or get a Blue bag from a hard boss, they are what keep everybody in this game. That indescribable feeling of overwhelming excitement and happiness has kept me into this game for a long time. It's a very relaxing game, very little competition, but tons of fun!			"

												This game is getting a lot of bad reviews because people see it as ""pay to win"".I'm here to fix that. In the game ""Realm of the Mad God"" there are thousands of micro transactions you can do to get better gear that would take a legit player longer. The only difference is, when you get the items from actual bosses in the game you learn the value of them, and how to use them instead of starting off with 20$+ of gear and dieing at level 15.At least they don't sell stat pots in the nexus for real money, that way someone who paid 100$ is still not better than a legit maxed character. tl:dr You can not pay and get a more rewarding experince!

												I was initally drawn to the retro-styled aesthetics and comedic, Discworld-esque world-building elements of this pseudo-8-bit MMO. However, the sheer intensity of the combat is honestly too much for my sensibilities. But hey, if you like the idea of experiencing a fantasy-themed  'bullet hell' -- or perhaps 'Magic Missile hell' would be more apt term -- then jump right in. The controls are straighforward enough even for a dexterously challenged player like myself. But the pure volume of stuff that's out to kill you makes this an ideal experience for more competetive types.			"

												Just wow.. I don't know when something as this simply-knit had last provided me with this much fun. I guess it plays mostly like a SHMUP with some RPG elements, and you better don't take time to get attached to your characters, because they're about to die. Often! Well, it's entirely free so why not go for a round, bopping around the landscape up against millions of critters, along with a group of other unfortunate souls who you just so happened to run into. And the graphical style is just cute!			"

												RotMG is a very unique MMO. It manages to combine teamwork, bullet hell, and dungeon crawling in one neat package. Hope right in and watch as you quickly level up and gain power, then suddenly be killed and lose it all, then hop in again and get it all back! Server strain is a big issue, but as long as they aren't full you should be able to manage. Maxing out your class of choice is quite a challenge, and should keep you entertained for quite a while. The aforemented Mad God is also quite satisfying when you do get to attack it. The hilarity of watching a whole server scramble through his punishing dungeon is very memorable indeed.If I had to say what this games biggest flaw is, it would be the turn towards pay-2-win it has taken. This unfortuantely was not always a problem; realm gold (the game's premium currency) used to just be good for buying cosmetic dyes and pets, or extra storage space. Now, with all sorts of high-tier gear being offered for it, the game feels more hollow and less rewarding. The adventure is still there, but it seems redundant when you can bypass it with the wave of a credit card. This is what personally keeps me from getting back into the game (along with technical difficulties with connecting to my Kongregate account), but if you're fine with it, don't let me stop you! It's still a wonderful game, and i'd recommend at least giving it a shot. It's free, after all; what have you got to lose?			"

												theirs alot wrong with this game 1. You cant close the chat                                               2. The amount of people talking i cant even play                                                3. I didnt even understand how to play after the tutorial                                               4. Cash flows through that game like blood in veins                                               5. Why would i really need gold coins just to buy a difffrent charcter and useless pets                                                6. Dying in this game is just not worth playing it at all                                               7. 999 coins just for 1 character?!                                               8. The ads/Chat is so overpopulated plz add close chat                                               9. The game doesnt tell you what to do besides kill things                                               10. The warps are to confusing and people stealing stuff like hobos over a chicken leg			"

												In this case less is définitely more. Simple and addicting gameplay.Only 8 spots in inventory and 8 spots in vault which seems like it's gonna be horrible at first, but then you realise that's exactly why it's so easy to trade and find stuff. People don't pick up what they don't need and give everything away when they find something better. It's actually a pretty social game, because teamwork is greatly rewarded.Pretty amazing. In-game currency is way to expensive, but if it were 6 euro's I'd say it would be worth it. You don't need to buy in-game currency to get the best gear by the way. Doesn't seem to be Pay 2 win.Edit:Nowadays you need to enter an e-mailadres and password. The login-button is dead though so I can't play. Very common problem. Maybe playing via browser works, but then I can't use my characters.Edit2: Months later it all works again.			"

												(Disregard however many hours steam says i have. I have what is probably well over 900 additional hours on the web version.) Nothing in this world has addicted me quite like Realm. I love it for many reasons and will probably never be free of it and to be honest i probably wouldn't stop playing it even if i wanted to. It has one of the best free to play models i have ever seen and stands to be the only game outside of tf2 i was genuinely happy to pay money for (and my first purcahse of 10$ was about 350 hours into the game). The action is fast paced and exciting like nothing else, nothing else in the world makes your heart pound quite like an O2 fight with a melee class. And the permadeath, while being the cruelest mistress you can ever imagine (along with her partner: lag), keeps the game interesting and has been taunting me with that elusive 8/8 for years bringing me back for more every time. This is my most played game of all time by a massive margin (minecraft dosn't count) and has good reason for it but if you're looking to pick up this game know that it's a very deep rabbit hole you're falling into, one with plenty of pain along the way. And video games shouldn't be painfull, please find something else. (Side note: The general community in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible and i would be happy if i learnt that most of them died IRL. That and lag can kiss my♥♥♥♥♥)			"

Once you have gotten pixelized enough, you can start setting out to fight other pixels with your new, stronger, and improved pixels. After all, this IS pixel warfare.

You can play just for 5 minutes when you have some spare time, or you can play with friends for hours and not get bored. One of the highlights of the game for me is Oryx's castle. Once all of Oryx's minions are killed, he sends the whole server to his castle. The game also is completely free to play, and won't force you to spend hundreds on enjoying the game.			"

Kabam does not seem to be coming back to in my opinion one of their best games, which is really saddening because this game is great. Permadeath makes you want and care not to die and I do my part of rageing in this game but still it is very enjoyable. Whenever I quit due to a rough death I feel like coming back. I am a relatively new player though and have spent money on this game and I do feel the boundraries of paying and not. Still worth the time and it is still a FREE game at the base of it.			"

												i loved to play rotmg on my browser for maybe a year but when i saw it on steam while just looking around, i had to get it! but i have found some flaws compared to the browser version. 1 lags more on steam and 2 when i go into a realm, the coins, fame thing is just all messed up by it all merged together on the top right of the mini map but i still really enjoy this game			"

												I have played this game for many hours and i can proudly say it was not wasted. ROTMG has brought me together with many friends that i respect and play games with regulary. This game not only has an amazingly unique play style it also has a great community! There are now new owners of the game (DECA) and they have already put out new content, Kabam the old owners didnt do much with realm for about a year before Deca bought rotmg. These new owners will hopefully breath new air into the game giving it life again. If your still reading this review why are you still here? Jump on realm and play you wont regret it!			"

												Easily one of the best hardcore 2d shooters I've everrrr played. It's amazing because it's online, fun, hard, and entertaining. You can do anything, there's no level or max stat limits to equip something / do a boss, and it's amazing to play with friends. Ninja, Paladin, Wizard master races.			"

												A simple rougelike MMO, which even now I wonder how such an awesome idea didn't come to be sooner.Unlike other MMO's your character does not respawn.  This means that you must make a new character everytime you die.  That may sound tedious, but there is no character customization outside of the class you choose so you can quickly start playing.  This makes becoming a high level player a measure of a players ability to decide when to attack, when to retreat, and when to call your friends to gang up to get protected loot.For those of you who play MMO's just for notoriety there are leaderboards for highest level in different time ranges.EDIT: This game is very freemium now, but you can totally play the game just fine without paying for anything.  Everything you buy is extra to what the game originally was.			"

												(Disregard however many hours steam says i have. I have what is probably well over 900 additional hours on the web version.) Nothing in this world has addicted me quite like Realm. I love it for many reasons and will probably never be free of it and to be honest i probably wouldn't stop playing it even if i wanted to. It has one of the best free to play models i have ever seen and stands to be the only game outside of tf2 i was genuinely happy to pay money for (and my first purcahse of 10$ was about 350 hours into the game). The action is fast paced and exciting like nothing else, nothing else in the world makes your heart pound quite like an O2 fight with a melee class. And the permadeath, while being the cruelest mistress you can ever imagine (along with her partner: lag), keeps the game interesting and has been taunting me with that elusive 8/8 for years bringing me back for more every time. This is my most played game of all time by a massive margin (minecraft dosn't count) and has good reason for it but if you're looking to pick up this game know that it's a very deep rabbit hole you're falling into, one with plenty of pain along the way. And video games shouldn't be painfull, please find something else. (Side note: The general community in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible and i would be happy if i learnt that most of them died IRL. That and lag can kiss my♥♥♥♥♥)			"

												Just wow.. I don't know when something as this simply-knit had last provided me with this much fun. I guess it plays mostly like a SHMUP with some RPG elements, and you better don't take time to get attached to your characters, because they're about to die. Often! Well, it's entirely free so why not go for a round, bopping around the landscape up against millions of critters, along with a group of other unfortunate souls who you just so happened to run into. And the graphical style is just cute!			"

												Lacks much variability and thus may become boring and repetitive at times. Can be unfair and ridiculously challenging at times, even with decent equipment. Tutorial only teaches you only basic controls and then throws you out into the open world with little knowledge of what to do. The amount of in-game purchases they try to force down your throat is quite frankly astonishing. These flaws aside, it's an addicting; fun little game.			"

												Deca, the two things that I would recommend to make this game better besides hackers and multiboxers is fix spawn rates for Dungeon drops from Quest bosses in realms and fix the loot table for everyone. Even if the game seems to be fun, it wouldn't make sense if you cant do the dungeons you love without having to spend money to get dungeons, or work really hard in dungeons you risked your character's life for only to get scammed and get a purple bag or nothing at all. I am sure we, the community, would really love that effort from you guys. Please #MakeRealmGreatAgain. Good Luck Deca.			"

												Not a bad game. In fact it's pretty fun. But it's a really good example that proves that free things in life sucks. But then again, it's not free to play, it's free to play, but expensive as you want it to be.It's still fun, but weird at the same time.it has no mercy. When you die, you start everything from the beggining. You have ONE character slot. Means if you wanna try another, you have to let your other one die. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I'll rate this game 6.5/10 out of a f2p experience. Probably 7.5/10 with a 20$ thrown in.			"

												This is my single most played game.ROTMG is one of my favorite games, dont get me wrong it has its flaws but this game is all about the gameplayThe visuals are an 8-bit theme so it may not be to everyones liking but for what it lacks in depth of visuals it makes up for in gameplay.PROS-----------------LOVE the bullet hell theme-Lots of classes to choose from-Nice variety of dungeons ranging easy to hard-Easy to pick up, very time consuming and hard to master-You will always have something to do.-Replayability is pretty insane-Perma-death-Visuals are simple but not lackingNeutral----------Community can be great with a guild or absolute garbage like with any communityCON----------------Cheaters are EVERYWHERE-Scams (are you surprised in an MMO setting?)-Able to buy top tier gear right away-RWT (again its an MMO)-Multiboxers-Lag (not just a little but where you dc or lag out and die)-Overall pretty P2W (Have to buy additional character slots (Start with 1), chests (Start with 1), and pets can cost $2000USD if you want them)Overall this game I know I can always come back to. I've played it 4 years on and off and have 700+ hours (on steam alone). When you die with a character youve had for a long time it may make you quit, but you will probably still come back.			"

												RotMG is a very unique MMO. It manages to combine teamwork, bullet hell, and dungeon crawling in one neat package. Hope right in and watch as you quickly level up and gain power, then suddenly be killed and lose it all, then hop in again and get it all back! Server strain is a big issue, but as long as they aren't full you should be able to manage. Maxing out your class of choice is quite a challenge, and should keep you entertained for quite a while. The aforemented Mad God is also quite satisfying when you do get to attack it. The hilarity of watching a whole server scramble through his punishing dungeon is very memorable indeed.If I had to say what this games biggest flaw is, it would be the turn towards pay-2-win it has taken. This unfortuantely was not always a problem; realm gold (the game's premium currency) used to just be good for buying cosmetic dyes and pets, or extra storage space. Now, with all sorts of high-tier gear being offered for it, the game feels more hollow and less rewarding. The adventure is still there, but it seems redundant when you can bypass it with the wave of a credit card. This is what personally keeps me from getting back into the game (along with technical difficulties with connecting to my Kongregate account), but if you're fine with it, don't let me stop you! It's still a wonderful game, and i'd recommend at least giving it a shot. It's free, after all; what have you got to lose?			"

												Changing my opinion entirely, first lets get things straightWildshadows (creators of RotmG) sold their game to KabamNow that's out of the way lets talk about why i changed opinionFirst now you can basically just pay for your items and that ruins the fun of the game, you could literally buy all the best stuff in the game as a level 1 and whoop a god's♥♥♥♥♥and maybe even onyx's Second, I cant even log in to my RotmG account now which had alot of good equipment on it, and did i mention the game isn't in update anymore? thats right the only ""updates"" we get are ""What was your favourite time in realm"" ""Buy booster packs!"" News feeds and much more useless crap.Next, about 66% of the game is populated by bots saying ""Buy your pots and weapons at ""Swaguniverse.com"" where we are 100% trusted and wont scam you at all...""The game is slowly dying even as i was typing this review, and personally i dont think this game is worth it anymore even if it's free.Even alien swarm is better then this now and its an ""inactive"" game now			"

												Second Life is better optimized then this game, do you know how well second life is optmized? Not at all.Look at the photos above, now look at my review, get my point?Here's my detailed review below.Pros: +Easy to learn and get used to, i can see you getting lost in this game for a while.+Multiple classes with their own feel.+Healer class, that's awesome if you are playing with a friend.+Infinite maps.+Instanced Tutorial (those are awesome)Cons:-Where did you go? Where am I? Where is that? What's going on? Oh look more enemies. (WHO NEEDS A MAP?!)-Party system is horrible.-level 100 butterfly has slain you. (Not at all epic for a monster, only Monty Python can get away with this. :P )-classes locked unless you go through different tasks to unlock them.-dear god, the lag, the horrible unoptimized lag! (Look, if i can run plenty of recent games at max then it's not me)-communication is difficult.-Hope you don't like fullscreen.Neither pro or con:= Sprite art is okay.= Instant action.= Simple-------------------------Take this review as you will, it's just here to give you perspective before you hop in, not for those expert super pro players who are already at the top of the scoreboard and have 500+ hours of the game, what are you going through reviews for anyway? It's not a popularity contest and this is what i really think about it, and that's the purpose of reviews. Shoo!Hope this helped you. :3			"

												This game is a lot of fun, and in my opinion, completely worth your time. If you are a fan of bullet hells, and perma-death I think you'll be a fan. It isn't as good as it used to be (with the addition of a large number of pay-to-win aspects) it is still at its core, a fun game. I recommend trying it out and sticking around to see what DECA (the new owners) will do to improve it. Also, play on your browser or with flash projector, Steam is far to laggy.			"

												i have been playing this game for a little bit over 4 years now and i have done pretty much everything there is to do in it. and here is a little pros and cons list of this gamepros:-one of a kind (it's the only game that is a bullethell mmorpg)-a lot of different classes-great communtiy-a lot of diffrent skins and dyes-gameplay is very fun (figthing is very simmilar to a bullethell )-being bought from kabam to a new and fresh company deca games-trading items-servers are okay-drop rates are very good and dungens have a garunted drop -almost every pc can run this game good or bad depending on your view point-perma death -pixel graphics (some like it others don't)-weapon and monster sounds are beeps and boops ( like froma nes game)-it's  very haveliy based on the grinding on pots (late game)cons:-very basic to almost no story-hacker, bots and multi boxers (which they are working on and it seems it will get better)-very badly ported on steam ( it crashes 2 to 3 times on a 3-4 hours gaming session)- some items are account bound (would have really liked it if they could make them tradeble a couple of times a year)- very short leveling time (max 20 lvl which can take 5-20 mins)-very bad soundtrack  ( it's one song and it plays over and over. i'd recomend to turn it off)i like this game i have recommended it to most of my friends and i would say that it is most fun playing with friends 7.6/10even with this rating it is still one of my favorite games			"

												Hello guys! I have played this game for 500 hours now... that says alot in itself right?Okay heres some info about this gameYou should have atleast 17 euro for this game which will give you 2600 gold. I would reccomend to buy the starting pack which will give you extra char slots (that are infinite) a pet (which is infinite) and chests (which also are infinite) (YOU CAN PLAY THIS GAME F2P but it takes alot of skill you just have to run around get items find an egg and youre started) heres why you should buy these. You will need character slots later on when you max and you have nothing to do. Because you will be able to make another character you can play even more. The chests will give you a place for saving items because when you die you loose EVERYTHING except pets character slots chests and items in chests. A pet will help you ALOT in this game you CAN play without buying stuff but i would recomend paying the small amount of 17 euro.Now to the game Its a bullet hell MMO and it is NOT EASY this takes alot of time to master! and alot of practise. When you are playing you will be going around killing monsters and as you go longer in towards the middle of your little island harder monsters will come. You will sometimes find monsters that drop portals and you can learn what these portals bosses drop of items. I would recomend playing this with a friend since alot of these dungeons and monsters are hard but you ARE playing with 84 other people on the server which makes the big event portals easier since the other players will be there to help.This is basically a game about running around killing bosses getting loot leveling up improving your pet dying then doing a little better everytime by improving your skill and your pet.I would recomend looking up guides on the internet quickly like 15 minutes of your time to find out how you get to lvl 20 easily and get to godlands begin to get loot and slowly learn the game.

												Over all the game is good for what it is, and its fun to play as long as your okay with the death of your character and losing all the stuff you had on them.So saying that I really have nothing negative to say about the game. I just wish the developers were more active and relased more updates more ofthen.Also hopeing for some feedback on this, I know you can link your steam acount to the browser version, but is there a way to link the browser version of the game to your steam account?EDIT:Every thing looks good now thanks to Deca <3, I have seen way fewer multie boxers and hackers, so good job.

												I have around 800++ hours on the game, but none of it is on steam, but I feel that the game could use a bit of tweaking *cough* necro buff + necro wis mod *cough*. Also, the game does have a very high percentage of people using modified clients, to either have an unfair advantage over others, or just to improve their performance in game. I personally think that one of the main problems right now in the game is performance, as even with good internet and a good pc, you will still have fps drops and internet lag.			"

												Seriously, I love this game. It's really fun ! But all this game is an argument to spend a lot of money for a compagny ! What a shame ! Could be fun if the game design is not all about money... I sum up : money could be spend to have some game coins, and this coins could be used to buy some weapons or other good stuff. When you begin the game, you think that it's possible to play the game without spending any money. But it's not. If you don't buy, you can't defeat powerfull monster ! And the only weapons you could find on the game for free are bad compared to them ! So, after the level max (20), you die, you don't have a choice... yeah, die again and again and being stuck quikly without seing a lot of the fun of RotMD, or pay and play the real game.A false free game ! Don't fall on the trap !			"

												A lot of MMOs I play fall into the hole of grinding for levels. The difference in ROTMG is that it doesn't try and hide that fact. ROTMG is all about getting the nearest enemy as fast as possible and killing it to gain it's juicy, addictive, experience points. I know what you're saying ""If the point of the game is to grind for xp upfront, how is this game engaging in any form!?"" Two words. Perma Death. That's right, you have to hold onto your character carefully lest all your precious work be undone. In the end ROTMG is great for when you need a break from other games, or maybe a game you can play whilst listening to a podcast.			"

												After reading all the negative reviews of ROTMG, I was just inspired to throw in some positive input. I've had mostly good experiences with ROTMG, but I have to admit that it does fall short in some places.Okay, so you're looking to play ROTMG? Here's a few reasons why it's one of my favorite games:PROS- Many classes to choose from- Vault with 1 chest free to store all those staffs, swords, daggers, wands, bows, armors, robes, rings, potions and pet eggs- Guild (clan) system- Awesome dungeons with epic loots (dangerous dungeons means better loot, obviously)- Nice quest system- Excellent community- Great to play with friends, or solo and meet some awesone people along the way- Rewarding- NPC companions (pets)- Permadeath gives an element of adrenaline and intensity (when you're 2 hits away from dying and you press the escape button just in time, you really do breathe a sigh of relief)- Excellent trading system- Constant changing environment in the nexus (winter = snow, halloween themes etc.)- Devs who care and listen to the community (most of the time)CONS- Permadeath means that you lose all the loot in your inventory, as well as your entire character (stats, armors, rings, you name it)- P2W, kind of.- Very, very, VERY ADDICTIVEYou start out in the nexus at level 1, with certain base stats and items (according to your class). Then you enter a realm. Starting at the beach, you kill some weak enemies until you reach a higher level, and move further inland as you level up. At level 20, it's good to move to the Godlands (found in the centre of the map, many powerful enemies called gods drop some nice loot). Items are bartered/bought with potions that increase your stats (usually defence pots/ life pots as they are the most valuable). There's no better feeling than killing a god/boss and finding epic loot, and then selling it/equipping it and looking like a badass.Yes, ROTMG is a F2P game, and yes, it is kind of P2W. But that being said, all in-game items can be found/traded without real money (Just takes a lot of time). The real money comes in when you need ""Realm Gold"" to buy more chests/ character slots, or when you're buying skins/cloth to make your character look like the badass you are. But that is NOT a necessity. If you've go the money, then sure, you'll be a legend in ROTMG in no time. But if not, then you will still become a legend in ROTMG, eventually (and with a LOT of grinding, blood, sweat, tears, heartbreak and perseverance).The worst part of ROTMG (or any permadeath game, for that matter) is DYING. Try spending a weekend grinding your favorite wizard, finding great loots and trading some for stat potions, and maxing most stats (6/8, for example [The 8 stats being defence, speed, dexterity, wisdom, vitality, attack, life and mana]), and then being charged and shotgunned in an Abyss of Demons and dying instantly without a chance to excape to the Nexus. Yeah, crappy, right? I think what makes ROTMG so addictive is the fact that if you survive, you earn awesome loot, and if you don't, well then you lose awesome loot. It's that simple.I think of ROTMG as being a 5 step never-ending cycle, if you will.1. Happy, enjoying the serenity of levelling up and finding some basic items to keep your character alive.2. Excitement. Finding great loot and trading with others for their great loot. Chilling in the godlands and finding stat potions, slowly increasing your stats.1 week later...3. Absolute thrill. Maxed some stats, rocking in the hard dungeons. Enjoying wrecking enemies within the calamity of events and hard, hard, dangerous dungeon bosses. SEXY SEXY loot.4. Dying. Hearing the DUM DUM DUUUUUUUMMMM of the death drum. Heart beating fast, in denial. Looking at your graveyard results and thinking ""No way. No way no way no way no way.""5. Shedding a tear, ragequitting ROTMG, exitting Steam and going to the library to find a new book to read. Thinking of taking up piano lessons.Repeat.After 50 hours of wrecking enemies, you really establish a close bond with your character. And to be completely honest with you, seeing your character die with good loot is like watching your cat get driven over by a car, and thinking, ""I shouldn't have let her out in the first place.""Oh yeah, and you begin to think of yourself as reckless and stupid, especially after those close death calls. Pheeeeeeew. But lucky for you, because that's when you know it's time to go take a shower or something (breaks are RARE, it's that addictive). You pretty much only take breaks after those close calls. All of that aside, ROTMG really is a great game. I would recommend this game to YOU. Yes, you. 8/10 ♥ I hope you're ready to spend your Friday nights (and Saturdays, Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and even Thursdays) playing ROTMG. See you in the realm.			"

												I like this game and played it a lot on Google Chrome. I recently got it on steam and have had a huge reminder of how hard it is to really have fun without making micro transactions! Lots of grinding is needed to advance further in the game but the multiplayer is fun! Its free to play so don't expect anything amazing unless you're willing to pay. Perfect to pass time. 7.5/10			"

												I enjoyed this one way more than I was expecting to, and so did everyone else who tried that game out (that I know of)What you have is a bullet hell MMO, the max level is 20, and is easy to reach within a short amount of time, after that, instead of exp you accumilate fame instead which can be used to buy a few in game items. And leveling up characters is how you unlock other classes, so you could play for a while before unlocking them all. It's just jolly good fun, really. Also when your character died, he's dead forever. Not that it matters since you can have another one up to the same point within the hour. it's free, so give it a go.			"

												This game is one of the most fun and unigue games out there. However, it is kind of pay2win since people with a lot of money can just buy realm gold and other stuff. It also sucks that you can't trade almost all the UT items. I'm 13 now; stopped playing this game on Kongregate when I was 9 and came back to try it. So many things have changed and I'm not even sure whether it was for the better or worse. If you like a game that is kind of pay2win but still fun and can put up with that, this is your game.			"

I played nearly 2000 hours.

												Frantic, flashy and fun. This game tests your relfexes and skills as you make your way through the realm of the mad god. The aim: The aim of the game is to level up, accumulate loads of fame, and to defeat Oryx the mad god. Likes: I love this game because it's fun and a good challenge, it's also surprisingly fun to play with a friend. The guild system is well designed, and easy to use/run. Dislikes: While their are a few faults with the game there are _ main problems. Number 1: It's very flashy and in your face, especially in the Godlands, so if you've got epilepsy, I wouldn't advise going to the godlands if you want to get this game. Number 2: You have to pay to get anywhere in this game. Summary: Overall I'd reccomend this game, but only if you're willing to pay a little bit. There done.			"

												This game is by far one of my favourite new games. I recently discovered it and was amazed by how addicting this fast paced game is. If you have ever played the original Zelda game on NES, this is like that but an MMORPG. You have to dodge enemy attacks in an 8bit world, while getting new equipment and fame. However, when you die it brings back another dreaded moment of NES gaming. ""Game Over"", you lose everything, character deleted, and your keyboard smashed out of frustration.I rate this game 8/10.

												It's a great game if you've played at least 20 hours or more because then you will get the jist of this game. To new players, I suggest you stick with playing wizard mainly as it's the most OP and all round character, but it's up to you. This game is very time consuming as it takes a while to max your stats and completing dungeons while staying alive HAHA. The only downside is probably that this is a pay to win game, and that dying is something your going to have to get used to. I would rate this game 8/10 mainly because it's a fun and smooth game but has some major bugs			"

												This game is addicting for those who want to git gud. After almost 300 hours of play I still get a rush out of near-death experiences and finding rare loot. I still enjoy it even despite playing solo because my friends think I'm insane for playing such an unforgiving game. Sure, I'm prone to quitting for long periods of time after losing one or more maxed-out characters over the span of a day or two, but I always seem to come back eventually. Maybe I have a problem.Anyway, about all the complaints about Kabam and their business model, I feel that most of them are more or less unsubstantiated. I've been playing since the game belonged to its original developer and, while it does feel different now than it did back then, its core is still very much intact. The only things you can buy with real money that aren't available in-game are cosmetic (and even amongst those items there are plenty you CAN get with gameplay alone). You can still grind for anything else money can buy. It's still plenty skill-based, with plenty of learning and achieving to do. The only thing Kabam has really done to harm the game has been the introduction of overpowered pets, but even those can be acquired through gameplay. I'll admit, however, that it does put newer players at a noticeable disadvantage, but it at least sets a new overarching goal for players beyond maxing out a character, since the pets keep through death. I actually think the removal of amulets helped level the playing field a bit too, since they were super expensive and the only players who could really afford to stock up on them could already max out a character anyway.All in all, the game is still just as fun as it was years ago, before it came under new management. It seems that instead of reviewing it objectively, old players can't help but look at it through their rose-tinted nostalgia goggles.			"

												Okay, so some people hate this game, some love it, so here are my thoughts. The unique gameplay and artstyle/character design is what truly holds this game together, otherwise the advertising spamming, insane micro-transactions, and on-and-off lag would ruin it all. So as you've probably figured out, this is a top down shooter, which as far as I know is pretty unique for a fantasy MMO. This game is quite challenging, it is a permadeath type game so if you die you must pick a new character and start completely over, on the other hand it isn't terribly challenging as long as you play it smart, there is also a hotkey command to bring you back to the safezone. The Perma-death can really turn you off, especially if you have good items and was close to reaching level 20, reaching level 20 will unlock a new character class or two, which is pretty much what keeps you playing. This game also has a massive amount of enemies for you to fight, many with different abilties, which is also what makes this game unique. I'd recommend everyone at least try this game, you may hate it, you may like it, and let me just say I don't play this excessively, its just something fun to play here and there. also its a very tiny download and takes a few seconds, its worth a try.

												Stay calm... stay calm... OHHH♥♥♥♥♥♥AGAIN!!This game is just hardcore! You have to level up to get stronger, but if you die you have to start over again. You have to be very careful in this game, but on the other site you should get better weapons and armor so you can survive a lot easier. Later you have to farm some dungeons or mobs to get stat pots wich inrease your stats. You can trade, join guilds or cry because you lost another charakter. It is realy challenging but a lot of fun if you are a patient person. You can unlock a lot of classes and decide if you want to play a healer, damage dealer or tank. There are even classes which combine 2 of these roles. You should totaly try it out if you like the ""retro-like"" graphic and rogue-like ""shoot 'n' dodge"" games.			"

												This game is by far one of my favourite new games. I recently discovered it and was amazed by how addicting this fast paced game is. If you have ever played the original Zelda game on NES, this is like that but an MMORPG. You have to dodge enemy attacks in an 8bit world, while getting new equipment and fame. However, when you die it brings back another dreaded moment of NES gaming. ""Game Over"", you lose everything, character deleted, and your keyboard smashed out of frustration.I rate this game 8/10.

												This game is addicting for those who want to git gud. After almost 300 hours of play I still get a rush out of near-death experiences and finding rare loot. I still enjoy it even despite playing solo because my friends think I'm insane for playing such an unforgiving game. Sure, I'm prone to quitting for long periods of time after losing one or more maxed-out characters over the span of a day or two, but I always seem to come back eventually. Maybe I have a problem.Anyway, about all the complaints about Kabam and their business model, I feel that most of them are more or less unsubstantiated. I've been playing since the game belonged to its original developer and, while it does feel different now than it did back then, its core is still very much intact. The only things you can buy with real money that aren't available in-game are cosmetic (and even amongst those items there are plenty you CAN get with gameplay alone). You can still grind for anything else money can buy. It's still plenty skill-based, with plenty of learning and achieving to do. The only thing Kabam has really done to harm the game has been the introduction of overpowered pets, but even those can be acquired through gameplay. I'll admit, however, that it does put newer players at a noticeable disadvantage, but it at least sets a new overarching goal for players beyond maxing out a character, since the pets keep through death. I actually think the removal of amulets helped level the playing field a bit too, since they were super expensive and the only players who could really afford to stock up on them could already max out a character anyway.All in all, the game is still just as fun as it was years ago, before it came under new management. It seems that instead of reviewing it objectively, old players can't help but look at it through their rose-tinted nostalgia goggles.			"

												It's a great game if you've played at least 20 hours or more because then you will get the jist of this game. To new players, I suggest you stick with playing wizard mainly as it's the most OP and all round character, but it's up to you. This game is very time consuming as it takes a while to max your stats and completing dungeons while staying alive HAHA. The only downside is probably that this is a pay to win game, and that dying is something your going to have to get used to. I would rate this game 8/10 mainly because it's a fun and smooth game but has some major bugs			"

												This game has changed me quite a bit over the few years that i have been playing this game. This game has taken over my life for the past few years. Its a very addictive however this game does have a big learning curve, Expect to die... a lot... You can't get very far in this game without spending any money at all. You will need to spend money at some point due to the limits you have with 1 vault and more importantly 1 character slot. If you haven't played this game, go try it out. Its free! You will start this game not knowing anything (unless you've watched a lot of videos) and you will die a lot even if you do watch videos. Expect raging and jealousy if you play this for a while. Thats all i have to say. Overall amazing game. Keep realming!			"

												This game used to be very enjoyable to play with friends and farm for epic loot, but now Kabam decided to make this game pay to win. If you want a fun mmo with great dungeons and a fun community get this game, but be warned: if you die you will feel like quitting. Overall it is a game I will come back to every now and then but there simply isn't enough content for me to keep playing since this is a VERY repetitive game. It is fun for a few hours once you get the hang of it but you will become very bored after awhile. In the end, it is a decent game but i would nto recommend it for the average mmo gamer.			"

												***I have decided to get back into Realm once again (through the web/client version) and it is a very exciting game. So I have decided to come back from my extremely old review (with no reason to recommend) and have completely reworked and rewritten the review.***With constant imaginative enemies fighting you ranging from cute but deadly bunnies to Oryx the Mad God himself. This game is a bullet hell - and god damn is it a crazy bullet hell. Missiles flying in every direction imaginable, enemies releasing missiles in every direction adds the challenge to RotMG as you really have to learn how to use the controls effectively before being able to imagine the higher levels. But those higher levels are extremely rewarding if you reach so it is absolutely worth the time doing dungeons.There is a natural annoyance with the business model, it has very expensive ""packages"", being sold  which can be bought with the in game payed currency ""gold"" or just money, with just the ""beginner package"" being sold for $20 for a new account and $60 after. However, none of the packages in RotMG actually need to be bought, you can achieve the same as anyone else without paying - it is harder, yes, but it isn't like it's quicker if you pay, it's just easier if you do.Overall I would recommend this game from the point of view that it is F2P so you're not wasting anything by buying it.

												This is a very nice game, not perfect, but nice. As I said, it has it's problems, but most of them aren't really nessasary to beat the game so it is fine by me. This game is by no means casual as it is perma death, meaning, if you die, you have to start all over again... But they have a vault so if you find something you want to keep, you just throw it in there and it will be safe. As the descripton of the game on... some form on Steam says ""Easy to play, Hard to master."" they were NOT kidding. While this game has easy controls, this game is HARD to get good at			"

												Here are the pros and cons of this game.Pros: It's free.Has items to purchase, but not really a pay to win.Despite only have one music theme, it's pretty good.Challenging, but not too hard. (At least for the most part)Nice pixel top down shooter overall.Cons: Despite the music being good, it can be a bit reppetitive.Not many updates. (Been a while since there's been a new dungeon added.)The community on steam. Everyone on the website version of ROTMG is more lively and communicate more. You go up to almost any wandering player and ask to team up and they'll say 'sure'. Very few players here even talk. LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG.I rate the steam version 7/11			"

												Realm of the Mad God (RotMG) is a side scrolling shooter that is amazing for being a browser game. It plays like an arcade game adapted for more accurate play with a mouse. It keeps up the challenge with the risk of dying to enemies and having to start over, encouraging players to fight alongside eachother and even includes a teleport option to any player in the region. The game as multiple classes to keep interest in the game.			"

												This game used to be very enjoyable to play with friends and farm for epic loot, but now Kabam decided to make this game pay to win. If you want a fun mmo with great dungeons and a fun community get this game, but be warned: if you die you will feel like quitting. Overall it is a game I will come back to every now and then but there simply isn't enough content for me to keep playing since this is a VERY repetitive game. It is fun for a few hours once you get the hang of it but you will become very bored after awhile. In the end, it is a decent game but i would nto recommend it for the average mmo gamer.			"

												It's a great game if you've played at least 20 hours or more because then you will get the jist of this game. To new players, I suggest you stick with playing wizard mainly as it's the most OP and all round character, but it's up to you. This game is very time consuming as it takes a while to max your stats and completing dungeons while staying alive HAHA. The only downside is probably that this is a pay to win game, and that dying is something your going to have to get used to. I would rate this game 8/10 mainly because it's a fun and smooth game but has some major bugs			"

												This is a very nice game, not perfect, but nice. As I said, it has it's problems, but most of them aren't really nessasary to beat the game so it is fine by me. This game is by no means casual as it is perma death, meaning, if you die, you have to start all over again... But they have a vault so if you find something you want to keep, you just throw it in there and it will be safe. As the descripton of the game on... some form on Steam says ""Easy to play, Hard to master."" they were NOT kidding. While this game has easy controls, this game is HARD to get good at			"

												It was ok. The fact that there is perma death is cool, but... It kinda sucks when you have 200 things on the screen at once. Also, no pause button. If you stop moving, you almost quite litterally die. I heard this game used to be good before all of the REAL money transactions became available. I'm kind of so-so about this game. I didn't play it for that long... But, almost nothing makes since. What do I do? Where do I go? Who am I? Thats what this game tried to do. It doesn't perfect it though. I always see some message come up about the ""Mad God"" but before I read it, you can pretty much imagine what happens. I don't know what level you should be for some areas (Difficulty Wise). Also, I have no idea about anything or anyone because of no explanation. Half of the tutorial is just you moving around. The other half is just killing some enemies that you can one shot. If this game had better storyline, explanations, and community, I would recommend it. But I don't. Because it kinda sucked			"

												The gameplay is overall good, but the bloody microtransactions are rediculess. They hinder and annoy you, inconvienencing you. You cannot make additional characters unless you want to fork over 10 dollars, if you want additional storage in your vault(and you are going to need a way to store your items if you want to get anywhere in the game) that would be 5 dollars a chests, which holds 8 items each. It would takes over a hundred dollars to even unlock all of your storage space. Even the big fans of the game do not buy additional storage, but instead go make additional characters on the game's website and on Kongragate to use as additional storage and are known as ""mules."" Even when using mules it is annoying.The gameplay is good, a semi-rogue like where your characters die and stay dead but you can store items to help your next character. The Nexus, the central hub of the game, is constantly filled with advertisers that will fill up your screen instantly. The gameplay is frustrating at times, especially because you can die very quickly with little to no warning, but is fun. The higher level you get, the more cautious you have to be. The game encourages team play, but it would take actual coordination to get anywhere with it.Overall, game is good, but is absolutely ruined by the amount of microtransactions.			"

												So, basically this game used to be the gods gift of online MMORPG's. BUT WildShadow Studios (creaters of RotMG) became total sellouts and practically gave the game away to a company called Kabam. Now, heres where stuff gets interesting. There used to be something called an Ammy (Amulet of Resurrection) which you equipped in your ring slot to give you both +2 on every stat and also a 2nd life. When you die, your amulet breaks and you respawn. This acted almost like life insurance but in ROTMG. Kabam turned this item into what is now known as a scammy. They are UT (which i will get to later) and instead of respawning you, they turn you into a zombie which can kill your fellow players. Secondly, what Kabam did wrong was make UT's untrable which ruined the whole purpose of excitement when getting a White Bag or Cyan Bag drop. Some items such as the CSerpent Staff are now mainly feed items as is the EP staff and Bulwark wand. Third of all, they brought in items which you could buy with Realm Gold, this makes ROTMG a P2W game. Don't mind my hours on Steam, i primarily play on the browser client which if hours were counted I would have 600+ easily. The nexus now sells WC tops and also Old tops for Realm Gold which can be purchased with real money! So noobs can pay $20, get heaps of gold and buy full tops set such as- T11/12 Weapon, T5/6 Ability, T12/13 Armor and Para/Exa rings for under $50. This is outrageous. I will still play the game however, as I am a fan on working hard to get what you want. Overall I give this game a 5/10 with Kabam ownership and 10/10 with WildShadow ownership. Thanks for reading my review and upvote it if you agree!			"

												This game is pretty ""okay"".It runs on flash which means that it never runs lag-free. (Part of it is, it being a bullethell-MMO)Even though the developers try to keep the game up to date, it rarely feels like they are really adding *new* and *exiciting* stuff.Most of the content that was added recently, had already existed before Kabam was in control. It is pretty frustrating that the only *new* equipment, they add are either complete crap or a reskin of an already existing item.About 3 months ago, I stopped playing this game since I already have achieved most of the stuff I can achieve and new content is either really boring or not important because it doesn't drop important stuff.Also RNG is a pretty HUGE factor here which doesn't make the game as fun, when your friends have 300 hours less and just get an item you have been searching for 300 hours.I am still *recommending* this game because it is pretty fun as long as you have new content which you always have when just starting the game. After achieving everything, the game is not really fun to play.The perma-death aspect of the game is interesting but can be REALLY frustrating due dying because of lag isn't that rare.

(Been a while since there's been a new dungeon added.)The community on steam. Everyone on the website version of ROTMG is more lively and communicate more. You go up to almost any wandering player and ask to team up and they'll say 'sure'. Very few players here even talk.

												This game is truly amazing and is very versatile. It doesn't matter what playstyle you choose, you'll still have tons of fun.

												This game has changed me quite a bit over the few years that i have been playing this game. This game has taken over my life for the past few years. Its a very addictive however this game does have a big learning curve, Expect to die... a lot... You can't get very far in this game without spending any money at all. You will need to spend money at some point due to the limits you have with 1 vault and more importantly 1 character slot. If you haven't played this game, go try it out. Its free! You will start this game not knowing anything (unless you've watched a lot of videos) and you will die a lot even if you do watch videos. Expect raging and jealousy if you play this for a while. Thats all i have to say. Overall amazing game. Keep realming!			"

												Realm of the mad god is an interesting game in the fact of how it can bring people together this is proven in multiple ways but one example is how people have guilds. sure some are all about ""pros"" in specific guilds while others are just for friends to be in. This game is about community and that is what Deca is trying to do, get communities together. Some things I think they could do is add more endgame content and make name changing cost less or free because 10$ (U.S.) is so not worth it. all in all tweaking that can be done and communities that can be woven together this is a great game.

												Imagine yourself climbing a mountain. You've been training for a long time to finally scale this behemoth. This is your leveling and maxing your character in ROTMG. Now imagine you are about to reach the top of this mountain and max your character. Then, oh no. Randy Orton slythering in, WATCH OUT WATCH OUT WATCH OUT. RKO OFFF THE CLIFF OUT OF NOWHERE. Not only does your character die, but you also die inside. This is the endless emotionally degrading cycle that is ROTMG.			"

												Realm of the Mad God is a great Free to Play title, and the community sometimes can be very helpful in terms of experiences and your overall enjoyment of the game. But the community is also highly critical of the game. It isnt as active as it used to be years ago, but this is mostly due to lack of content being added to the game. Hopefully in the future the game may be sold to somebody who can keep up with the community, but is still a great fast paced perma-death game. You should be able to get hours of enjoyment out of it till you start to get higher up in the ranks where things seem more and more repetitive. The community overall though is very passionate about keeping the game alive and letting it blossom. Sometimes talks of its pay to win aspects discourage new players, but you can definantly survive in the current meta without dropping any money in the game.			"

												So, first of all, I would like to acknowledge the quality of gameplay this outstanding game has brought upon me. Because of this game, it has made me want to kill myself on a daily basis, has given me the thought of joining the KKK and has made me want to vote for Donald Trump. The feelings this game has given me has opened my eyes about how cruel this world is and how better off I am becoming a stripper. Games like this have given me such unforgettable memories that I will unfortunately cherish forever. Moments that I still remember after starting this game one year ago. Where I died as an archer to a Scorpion King with its very OP family of bratty scorpion children, and the first time I've gotten a white bag, in which I lost right away after some monsters came in from the other room of an Undead Lair dungeon. After all of these overwhelming events, I reccomend this game to any toxic kids from XBox Live so they can feel just how we feel when they tell us to drink bleach. 10/10 Game.			"

												Great game, The characters are fun to play but i think the huntress is pretty useless, the stat system is easy to follow, colledting potions and beating dungeons, pets are too expensive and is why this game is considered a pay to win game, easy to learn hard to master but overal a fun, frustrating, fantasic and interesting game.

												This isn't really a review of the game as a whole, but rather of its state right now. This game used to be in a very bad place. Realm was neglected by its owner Kabam, which allowed hackers and exploiters to do whatever the hell they wanted with the game. Realm was very slowly dying, and many well known players within the community were leaving, and overall the whole experience of playing this game became a lot less fun. Luckily for us, Kabam has recently sold our beloved game to people who actually give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about it; Deca Games. In the past month or so Deca Games has done so much to improve the game and restore it back to its former glory. Right now is the best time you've ever had to start playing Realm. I recommend anyone to give this game a chance again if you already have in the past, and if you're new you should 100% give it a try.			"

												Here are the pros and cons of this game.Pros: It's free.Has items to purchase, but not really a pay to win.Despite only have one music theme, it's pretty good.Challenging, but not too hard. (At least for the most part)Nice pixel top down shooter overall.Cons: Despite the music being good, it can be a bit reppetitive.Not many updates. (Been a while since there's been a new dungeon added.)The community on steam. Everyone on the website version of ROTMG is more lively and communicate more. You go up to almost any wandering player and ask to team up and they'll say 'sure'. Very few players here even talk. LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG.I rate the steam version 7/11			"

												Simplistic Roguelike with suprisingly large open worlds where it's easy to find yourself in challening areas. The loot in this game is very situational, with most drops containing items from other classes, which are utterly useless unless you have friends or a group with you, but with the large amount of drops, it's easy to just ignore the useless ones. The game is also flooded by spambots advertising a WoW ""pay for gold"" system, which is also easy to ignore. For the simplicity and quirkyness, it's worth the money to buy this game ($0 is quite a bargain) but it's great to pick up and play for a few minutes in your spare time.			"

												This game has changed me quite a bit over the few years that i have been playing this game. This game has taken over my life for the past few years. Its a very addictive however this game does have a big learning curve, Expect to die... a lot... You can't get very far in this game without spending any money at all. You will need to spend money at some point due to the limits you have with 1 vault and more importantly 1 character slot. If you haven't played this game, go try it out. Its free! You will start this game not knowing anything (unless you've watched a lot of videos) and you will die a lot even if you do watch videos. Expect raging and jealousy if you play this for a while. Thats all i have to say. Overall amazing game. Keep realming!			"

												Okay. Realm of the Mad God...What do I say about this? well...I quite enjoy it. It's a fun addition to the Non-♥♥♥♥♥♥ selection of F2P games...If you are looking at review and haven't played the game...why haven't you played it yet? There is loads of fun to be had (Even more with friends though...we will get to that later). It's a permadeath game where you have to select a class and battle enemys around the nicely sized world (Some get really powerful and hard to kill so watch out for that) Including but not limited to, Pirates, Snakes, J-Jelly Cubes???, Balls that shoot more balls and there are even more. Now...There are also bosses aswell and this is where the game will take you down at your first couple times. Every once and a while a quest will appear with and arrow pointing to the area on your screen...This is where the bosses are. Bosses range from easy to HOLY ♥♥♥♥ THIS IS HARD quite quickly if you don't grind for levels. but this is where the lock and teleport features come in -Ahem- Okay it's time to introduce (Enter black and white television mode) Teleportation and Locking! If at any point you lock a player they will stay at the bottom right of the screen for you unless they leave the world or enter a portal (Find them out for yourself) and you can lock your friends to keep with them. You can also teleport to locked or unlocked people that are close to you. If you are ever in a tight spot or need to catch up to your friends you can teleport to locked or unlocked people like I said before! (Oh yea and there is a trading system but find that out from yourself) -Leave black and white television mode- The game does get slightly tedious at points it is still a soild experience you should definately give a go.Final Score--------------9.5/10			"

												I don't remember much but around 3 years ago when I first played this game, it was all dull and boring, and the only dungeon I remember was spider's den...However skip forward to 2017, this game is a boat filled with addictive water, no matter where you are, you can decide to go either direction.A fast paced RPG, and I've been playing it for 57 hours straight, considering I have vacation...Other than the server lags, server disconnects, stuck on loading and many more, a respectacle 8/10.P.S It's free afterall, give it a try.

												I have played this game for many many... MANY hours and here is why you should get this game and try it out for yourself. And from the guy who has been in this game since Wild Shadow was owning this game (Which is in the Late Wild Shadow Era) you SHOULD take my review as a good one. Thx and luv ya.The Pros:1) It is just plan fun in anyway. You would basically never get bored of this game. It has in store many FUN quests and places to fight bosses.2) The people here are helpful, fun, and most of all, important and needed. This is an MMO game. If there was not many people helping you in this game, you would have a REALLY tough time playing this game. This community is HUGE (Not as huge as Team Fortress 2 Sadly...)3) Perma death. Now some people would HATE losing there powerful chars. in the game. However, for me I think it is a wonderful idea. For someone who plays PLENTIFUL amounts of Fire Emblem. This teaches you to be more careful with your character as your journey continues and when you die, it is a lesson on next time avoiding that problem (unless it is lag then I can not help you out there)4) Always getting some sort of update to it in the game. This game has fun updates to it. From adding pets to it to adding new weapons to just redoing or reskining the old ones. This game gets updates like crazy. And there is always something new to the table.The Cons:1) To get stronger in some cases... requires money. Ok so I do not do this per say. But in order to become stronger for some people you NEED money in this game to get the full experience. They do not have to even try playing the game. Just spend a few bucks and BAM (get it?) you get maxed out character with the most powerful weapons. I perfer some people to not do that unless they really need it.2) Stronger and long time members of this game could steal your loot. When you fight boss quests or dungeons. People who do the most dmg. get the loot. And if you are just starting off small and working your way up. You are probably gonna have a long time before you can actually get to were the stronger people are.3) Pets. No offense. I LUV pets with all my heart. But it just makes the game easier in every way. Sometimes when I make a character i would probably never use the pet at all since it brings more difficulty to the game. It makes some classes useless in some cases like Priest and his healing ability because the pet could heal A LOT for you.Note: If I missed anything please tell me. I will add it with your name as credit. Thx.Conclusion:In conclusion, I love this game with all my heart. Even though I kind of stopped playing it when I started playing TF2. I do perfer you try it out for yourself to have the kind of experience I had when I had played that game. Who knows I might come back to it someday. COME ON! SMILE FOR ME! :)			"

												If your favorite genre is grinding and want to dodge a hell amount of bullets this game is for you.The current status of the game is A-OK due to the fact that KABAM (previous owner) sold the rights to DECA games, they will regenerate this game slowly overtime, but i want you guys to play it right now anyways, the game now has events thanks to DECA.#DECAFTW			"

												Fun if you play with friends, but boring if you're by yourself. Positive things about it include the fact that it takes a couple of minutes to learn how to play, it's not faceroll easy as there is a constant struggle to survive, it's free, there's a lot of different classes to choose from, it has a unique system for maxing out a character's attributes, and it's a very small installation.Negative things to say about this is that there's no actual currency and trading is always really annoying because of all the autotypers everywhere, there is an excessive amount of microtransactions obviously due to the game being free, there is no variety in the realms (they're all the same♥♥♥♥♥♥but with different names), and it's just overly repetative. The realms should all be different terrains with different mobs... and  it'd be nice to have something to look forward to achieving other than fame-whoring for high scores or collecting potions to max out attributes.

												Edit: I don't have 4.3 hours on this game. I have 4.3 hours on steam, but around 360 hours on the game on the web browser.This game is mostly great! It's a truely great Perma-Death MMO experience. From the monsters to the bosses, everything seems to line up and make some sort of pixely genius of a game! There are some cons of course. First of all it's pay to win to the max. You can buy max level gear and dominate throughout the game. Another problem is that it contains urgles... The laggiest thing I have ever seen in a game to date. It shoots out these orbs that make more orbs. This causes you to often die because of how much it drops your frames. Another thing is that it's Perma-Death, so if you have problems with losing all of your gear when you die, I don't recommend this game. If you add up all of the pros and cons, I think that this game deserves a good review!			"

												Don't play this.It's a p2w disguised as an f2p. I've played for four years  (check RealmEye if you don't think I'm telling the truth. NetherArum is my character's name.) I played in the web browser.I probably will continue to play because this game is addicting.However, it's stupid and broken now. Kabam has done NOTHING for the game, and in fact has ruined it. Hackers, spammers, and cashgrabs make this game pretty much unfun to look at.			"

												So I played this game for a long while. What deca (yes I'm looking at you /u/sil3x) could do to make the game better is to look over some of the community dungeon ideas. Some of these ideas are so good that they are more polished than dungeons that are already in the game. But you guys are already doing such a great job getting straight to work fixing duping and still being able to interact with us and host fun events. Keep it up :)To any new people looking at this game it is worth playing if you can get past the constant death at the beginning.			"

												This is a great MMO to play for long and short periods of time. It can be either pay to win, and play to win so i think it's quite balanced in that era. I have seen alot of negative comments about how people have spent money on the game to buy equipment and then lost it due to deaths and are now complaining about it, perma-death is a large part of this game and when you pay to buy new stuff, you should think about how you could lose it before getting mad about it, Although I do understand the stress.All in all, the game is quite fun, is well updated and has a good amount of challenges and characters to keep the players happy.

It's a pretty fun game, you unlock classes, fight, level up and play online. If you rage quit to when you loose your stuff, I don't reccomend this game. If you die you loose your characters level, items and other stuff. That's the only down side. That's why I reccomend ""Realm of The Mad God.""			"

												Overall, I thought this game was very good. The thing that really stood out to me though was that this game is just a lot of fun to play. Sure, there are much better free to play games such as ""Planetside 2"", but Planetside 2 doesn't quite have the 'charm' that Realm of the Mad God has. Pros: I really liked the perma death part of the game some may disagree and find it annoying, but I think it is good so that that game has a good challenge to it. The game is very fluid and doesn't lag; I play on usually 4-5 bars of internet and have a fairly good PC (6 GB RAM and an I7 2.4 GHZ processor for those who care). I have never encountered any bugs personally although my friend got instanly killed randomly somehow in Oryx's castle.  Cons: This game is very pay to win oriented I have found. Generally in order to get anything good or get any money to buy things you have to pay. The money pays for unlocking different classes and buying good items. That brings me to my next point; the item/looting system in the game is not very good (unless you pay) because I tended to get the same items over and over again as well as getting very underpowered items. The devs need to add in a wider variety of items into the game that can be found in the item sacks dropped by enemies. Also, I feel that this game was meant to play with friends . . . the problem with that is there are really not many functions to play with your friends. Yes, you can make a guild, but you have to have played for a very long time to create one. It would greatly increase the multiplayer party potential if they made it so that any level/money/fame character can create a guild. Overall, this game is very fun to play as it may not have the graphics of other free games like Planetside 2, but that is by far made up in the overally fun I've had playing this game. Yes, I would recommend this game. Overal though, don't expect yourself putting in over 50 hours because the game wears out after awhile though, but the game is free, takes only around 30 seconds to download hence only takes up around 250 mb of space (give or take a little I don't remember the exact amount) so what do you have to lose? I would highly recommend at least trying this game . . . if you don't like it, it isn't hard to uninstall. I would rate this game a 7/10.			"

												All of us realm players thought there would be no hope for this game, after being taken over by Kabam for over 4 years. DECA was just a tiny little speck until they took over Realm, and our community went wild. We hope for a great experience with DECA, and I hope DECA takes care of this game and makes it a lot better! :)			"

												Kabam did NOT ruin this game.Realm of the Mad God is an exellent game. I  played it for years on browser, before Kabam. It remains an excellent game today. People writing reviews here on steam are misguided about some important facts. First off, there has always been a charge for character slots and vault space. Its a free to play game, and the devs need money. But the thing that most people seem to be angry about is Kabam adding purchasable tops in the nexus. People could buy tops (and everything else) through third party businesses. Because people would have been spending real money on items anyway, isn't it better that the money should go to the devs? Also, people that need to spend money to get items will die with those items.			"

 Great F2P Game  Great Bullet-Hell MMO , which is F2P. It offers alot of classes, items , realms , dungeons , monsters and gods. It got prema death , which  made me better player overall. When u die there is no way to retrieve your character. U lose all your items and gear u had on this character. If u find good stuff u can save it in the Vault and later use it with other character. Great leveling system and ranking system. The leveling system is simple: U kill an enemy and u get XP , u got 20 levels , when u reach Level 20 , u dont get anymore XP and instead u get FAME . The fame is for the ranked system. With every class ,when u earn FAME , u complete your class quest. Every completed class quest gives u Star. When u get alot of stars , for example : 28 u get  Red Star  Which is your rank. Thats how the level and ranked system work. Alot of people say the game is P2W. Well the answer is  NO . Yes u can buy all the items from the start with real money , but if u play alot and try harder , u can take these items  from the dungeons and stuff. So the game is  NOT P2W .  There is a few bad things in the game  There is  ALOT OF BOTS AND HACKERS  , and the developers dont do anything about it.  The servers sometimes stops or lags alot Theres alot of spammers on the Nexus ( Spawn ) Overall i recommend this game , or atlest try it. Its good F2P and alot of fun.  EDIT: The game is now acquired by DECA GAMES. They promise to fix all the hackers , bots and server issues. I hope they finally fix the game and continiue expanding it !  "

It's a pretty fun game, you unlock classes, fight, level up and play online. If you rage quit to when you loose your stuff, I don't reccomend this game. If you die you loose your characters level, items and other stuff. That's the only down side. That's why I reccomend ""Realm of The Mad God.""			"

												Realm of the Mad God is a massively multiplayer online shooter video game created by Wild Shadow Studios (acquired by Kabam in June 2012, and later sold to Deca Games in July 2016) and Spry Fox. It was in public beta from January 2010 and the browser version launched on June 20, 2011.[2] On February 20, 2012 the game was made available on the digital distribution platform Steam for Microsoft Windows and OS X.[3]The game has been described as a ""massively-multiplayer cooperative bullet hell shooter"" with an 8 bit pixelated art style.[2] Players control characters who have been transported to the realm of Oryx (the titular Mad God) to become food for his many minions and abominations, which the players must dispatch. Central to the design of the game is the fact that character death is permanent. Upon death, the player's character is lost along with all carried equipment, although the player may store a number of items for safekeeping in a limited capacity vault away from danger. Different character choices in class also help make the game more diverse and help to support teamwork.The game is free-to-play with optional in-game micro-transactions. Items which can be bought with optional transactions include in-game equipment vary from high-level equipment, pets that provide aid to the player (by attacking enemies, paralyzing enemies, healing the character, restoring the character's magic points, and acting as a decoy) increased storage space, and aesthetic features such as skins, cloths and dyes.[4]This game client is written in Flash and can be played in-browser on the official site, on Kongregate, or it can be downloaded from the Google Chrome Web Store. Realm of the Mad God is also available on Steam.[5]Contents  [hide] 1	Gameplay2	Development3	Reception4	References5	External linksGameplay[edit]The game consists of players shooting projectiles from their weapons and destroying enemies to earn experience, fame, and equipment. A character moves around using the WASD keys (though other controls can be chosen) and uses the mouse to aim and clicks to shoot.[6] Contrary to usual practice in MMOs, the experience for killing monsters is awarded in full to each player present, rather than split. This, along with the possibility of teleporting to any player on the map instantly and a cooldown of 10 seconds to teleport again, makes it very easy and attractive to team up.After a certain amount of experience has been earned, the player levels up and their attributes are raised, allowing them to fight more powerful enemies and unlock more classes. The maximum level a player can achieve is level 20. The player can then gain ""fame"" on their character, which eventually grants permanent stars that indicate accomplishment and may entitle one to a place on the game's leaderboards upon death. Character death is permanent, meaning that the character's items and statistics are lost.Players begin their game sessions in the Nexus, a safe haven which can be teleported to at any time. In the Nexus, players may buy consumables using gold purchased with real-life money or they may trade with another character. Another currency is fame, gained when you die. The player enters realms (i.e. game map instances present on the server). Each of these realms are named after powerful monsters in the game(i.e. Medusa, Djinn, Cyclops, Beholder). The capacity of each realm is 85 people at once, and a full realm cannot be entered until a player in it dies or leaves. However, if many players enter a realm at the same time, it can exceed 85.Players fight a monster in game. HUD elements such as the inventory can be seen on the right-hand side.During gameplay, the player is directed to ""quest"" monsters indicated by a red marker at the edge of the game window. As they level up in the realm, they are guided from the ""Lowlands"" areas at the edges of the map, through the ""Midlands"" and ""Highlands"" to the more difficult ""Godlands"" in the center of the map. The Godlands hosts powerful monsters known as the Gods of the Realm. Completing certain quests allows ""event"" bosses to spawn, which can be killed to obtain higher-tier loot and open portals to the rarest dungeons.Killing high-level monsters can grant the player permanent stat boost potions, which are rare and exist in eight variations that correspond to the major attributes(life, mana, vitality, wisdom, defense, dexterity, attack, and speed). Consuming stat potions allows the player to improve their characters stats after reaching the highest level, which can be done until the attribute is maxed out (indicated by its text turning gold). Upon death, the size of the grave left behind corresponds to the number of stats maxed. Items could previously be retrieved from graves, but this functionality was removed as it led to players luring others to their doom to loot their graves.The 14 classes currently available are Wizard, Priest, Archer, Rogue, Warrior, Knight, Paladin, Assassin, Necromancer, Huntress, Mystic, Trickster, Ninja, and Sorcerer. Players begin with only the Wizard class unlocked and successively unlock the remaining classes as they gain experience with each class.[7] There are 8 main stats, defense, attack, speed, dexterity, vitality, wisdom, mana, and life. Each class has its own weapon, armor and ability specifications, base statistic averages and statistic caps. For example, Warriors, Knights, and Paladins have high defense and are the only ones that can use swords and heavy armor, while the Assassin, Rogue and Trickster have the highest potential movement speed and dexterity (rate of fire) statistics and can only use daggers and hide armor.Items are classified into tiers, with higher tier items having better stats. Tiers range from T0-T12 for weapons, T1-T13 for armors, T0-T6 for rings, and T0-T6 for abilities.[8] Some items are un-tiered, giving them a special classification. These items are typically unique, with examples including limited use items, powerful weapons, armor, rings, abilities, and April Fools' Day accouterments. The best items appear in special bags, known as White bags, Purple bags, Cyan Bags, or Potion Bags. These Bags will only drop for players who have delivered a certain percentage of the monster's damage, and can only be seen and picked up by the player it dropped for. Un-tiered (UT) items are currently ""Soulbound"" which means it is unable to get picked up by any other player or traded to another player.The game features guilds, each allowing for a maximum of 50 players. A guild costs the founding player 1000 fame to name and create, and has a guild hall which can be accessed by members of the guild. Upon a member's death, guild fame is earned proportionally to the amount of fame that the player earned. Guilds can buy upgrades such as larger guild halls and cosmetic features with the guild fame.[9]Development[edit]The game was originally created by Alex Carobus and Rob Shillingsburg, founders of Wild Shadow Studios, for TIGSource's ""Assemblee Competition"" in October 2009, which limited the competitors to a very small sample of art resources.[10] The developers described the aim of the game was to ""shake things up by breaking as many MMO ‘rules’ as we could""[11] It was noticed and received a good response from players,[12] prompting the developers to work on a full game. The game was finally launched in a beta stage on January 10, 2010.[10]Following the initial launch, Spry Fox joined the development team, helping bring the game to a full release out of beta on June 20, 2011.To help fund the game's development, optional microtransactions were added to the game, drawing a mixed response from players.[13] The developers defended the microtransactions, saying ""they seemed like the most convenient, customer-friendly way to pay for the game... those that passionately love the game, can spend as much as they want, helping us to grow the game over time.""The game has been			"

												A good game. There are a lot of bad reviews about it and about how Kabam has ""ruined"" the game. In all honestly, all they did was add the ability to buy items (which can ALL be obtained by a little hard work), take away ammys, and add pets. This game is also very anti care-bear... When you die you loose all loot on your character and all the stats of that character. So be careful, I suggest you find a good guild to join who can show you the ropes if you really wanna get good.

												So I played this game for a long while. What deca (yes I'm looking at you /u/sil3x) could do to make the game better is to look over some of the community dungeon ideas. Some of these ideas are so good that they are more polished than dungeons that are already in the game. But you guys are already doing such a great job getting straight to work fixing duping and still being able to interact with us and host fun events. Keep it up :)To any new people looking at this game it is worth playing if you can get past the constant death at the beginning.			"

It is a game I really enjoy despite a few balancing issues; the limited characters slot ( 1 ) and the limited 8slot vaults ( 1 ).It's worth trying for some fun, you can play with your friends, it has a few ''85 player worlds'' ( they're all the same ), per servers ( Us east, Us west, etc ).

												After about 50 hours you get sucked in. After 100 hours, you want to burn everything because you died after getting 6/8. After 150 hours, you crack and start spending money on the game. After 200 hours, you finally learn another class. And finally at 250 hours you quit because you literally lost everything. 10/10			"

												This game is fun..only after you put a couple hundred hours into it after you get bombarded with offers about stuff to buy. This game is definitely something I now think of when I hear ""pay to play"". It's only fun if you have a perfect character but then that ends up dying and you're basically screwed. But don't worry! You can get another character slot! ...by paying real life money. This game is really unique in the fact of how many classes there are. But there's also the fact that the classes are unbalancedOne person can just be a knight and possibly camp because they're so tanky which could prevent others from getting loot.If you get into this game beware, you'll eventaully end up spending money on one of the various packs that are shoved in your face cause you figure ""Why the hell not?"" but I'd advise that you absolutely do not spend any money on this game.For one thing, you're eventually going to get bored of this game and soon find out you have no reason to play it anymore, as did I find out after realizing how boring and unfun/unbalanced it is to get a good character, without paying of course, which is why my hours for this game is considerabley lower and or higher than others who reviewed this game.I honestly used to think this game was fun, me and my 2 other friends always used to play it. Then one of my friends eventually got bored of it because his best character died. Me and my friend were still doing fine so we continued. I eventually got 2 great characters that both ended up dying due to the unfairness of this game. I tried to start up again with another character but after a week I couldn't bring myself to do it, which is how I eventually quit the game. My friend still plays and I honestly don't get how he does. This game is also heavily relied on luck through what items you get. You may have noticed how I've been complaining about character deaths and there's one word to explain why: permadeath.This game, has permadeath, once you die, no matter how good your character is, no matter how good his equipment is, no matter how many much you claim you pressed the nexus button, you will start all the way from the beginning with a level one character with basic default equipment, what makes the permadeath unfair is that even the items you pay ACTUAL MONEY FOR, you still lose when your character dies. Which is why I advise you to not spend any actual money on this game because you will eventually die and lose the items you paid for which essentially means you lost and wasted money.Another thing that makes this game unbalanced and even more P2W is the pets.Like others have stated there's a pet system in this game that can do various things (heal you, attack, etc)But to make your pets good, you have to feed themAnd you do that by using food, either high tier items (hard to get) or by paying money just to satisfy some pixels on a screen.Here's some pros and cons to sum up those couple paragraphs;Pro's:Fun (by yourself or with friends)Unique class systemGood guild systemRewarding when you actually get lootCons:EXTREMELY pay to playPermadeath not executed that greatlyUnbalanced to a great degreePet system reliant on payingEssentially a time wasterI find it very hard to recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a free game on steam that is very heavily pay to play. If you do decide to play this game I heavily advise you  to not spend any money on it because you will eventually get bored of it and the money you spent will be gone into the toilet. This game used to be more fun before Kabam made as pay to play as it is today.			"

												Realm Of The Mad god Is A Pretty fun game! But it has its drawbacks. Living/playing this game feels like we have a hated dictator that EVERYONE hates. Kabam. Although I do not play on steam i have around 2000 hours on the Chrome browser ( www.RealmOftheMadGod.com) and i have seen the changes that kabam has made. First they implemented pets, Seemed like a good idea, UNTILL IT GIVES YOU 100 HP EVERY 5 SEC (Extremely OverPowered, you never die) Witch is cool! if you earn it. But Kabam has made this game Pay-To-Win. So there can be a 5 yearold who Grabs his moms credit card and just Buys boatloads of items and buys an OP pet and whaddya know? Hes Equal to Henez Or Kalle or Any of those skilled players (Charactar and item wise ples dont H8 , btw henez and kalle ROTMG legends). This is aggrovating to see. Overall i think this game is amazing, simply incredible, how much it is skill and luck based, the grinding, the glory of getting a item you have been hunting for, the "" NOOO, THIS CANNOT BE!"" of Oryx 1 and Oryx 2 dying, is Amazing. I Have to say its even kinda fun when your charactar dies ( Unless its unfair, such as server lagg, R.I.P 6/8 knight) so overall this game is amazing, and it has the potential and the community (Shout out to all them guys on youtube twitch kabam fourms and even the players.) But the fact that a company is driving this game into the ground to get EXCESS money is Ridiculous. Hopefully another company will buy this game, And then , I will feel happy to come back home.			"

												This game was the first steam game I got, because I had no money and could only play free games. I was very pleased with this game, and I was glad this was my first game within the bullet hell genre unless you count Contra. although I must say this game is extremely frustrating in that if you die, you are dead forever much like in a RogueLike game and have to make a new character. I was especially frustrated when I was about to get my first level 20, then he died. I also find it almost impossible not to go after enemies much stronger than me in hope that I get the plentiful amouts of delichious Exp they give me. Needless to say I died almost 99.75+25.11-.1% of the time, not good odds.			"

												All you Kabam haters: I feel you, I've been playing this since some of the early public builds and I've seen a fare share of stupidity on the part of Devs. Build 7-9 was the last time I played Co-op Dungeons (they took stat pots out of God Lands) and learning to solo dungeons with any character was a game changer for me personally.Play to Win? No, all the cash you spend isn't gonna get you any better at the game despite all the loot you purchase, we've all seen newbs die horribly with tops. A Stock newb with purchased tops won't hold a candle to a maxed character with mid-tier gear, and they don't officially sell stat pots/UT items in game so that swag is up to the player, not the wallet.After Lvl 20 with any character your top priority is Stat pot acquisition. Yes it can be a grind, and perma death is real, but this game would be junk without perma death. My advice: Lay down the 10-20 bucks on a extra character slot and some storage chests. You will Die lots, you will crap Keyboards sideways, and you will quit, perhaps even forever. But you could also kick♥♥♥♥♥Pets made this game so easy anyway that I will agree with some people: It was a better realm under WildShadow, but I still recommend it to anyone wanting to flex their skills and strut their gear.

												After 3 years of crapshoot and torture, a great company called DECA Games have taken ROTMG into their own matters and has done more to satisfy and help the community than Kabam could ever do, with Kabam being completely ignoring, ungrateful, and oblivious to the community. Many loved events ROTMG has showcased were ignored and never brought back, but instead adding more pay 2 win features as a result. I have the courage to believe in DECA games to make ROTMG another major game that experienced and newbie players can enjoy.			"

												Great game! 400+ Hours of gametime for me... i would rate 7/10.Kabam bought this game from Wildshadow Studios, then Kabam took developers off the game leaving currently 2 developers working on this game... Ive written the review on July 10, 2015. Using that time im not expecting any updates for the next 6 months, but honestly if Kabam doesnt pick up their brain off the floor there will not be a Realm of the Mad God anymore. In my opinion we have to buy more ""realm gold"" so they can realize Realm of the Mad God actualy makes them money, this will also support the current developers. I love this game and i would hate to see it fall, it has a great community and amazing gameplay! I would recommend this game to anyone who is into ""CS:GO"" or just likes skill based games(this game takes skill). It is pay to win in a sense, but you can obtain almost any item in the game by playing it.			"

												I used to play the Realm of the Mad God online before it was cool, jk, before I had a Steam account, and I still love playing it with friends. It is a very addictive 8-bit fast action RPG which I play from time to time.Here comes the piece of advice about the gameplay: don't get too attached to your characters, you are gonna die, a lot. Even if you have managed to reach the max level with a class and have your inventory full of overpowered items, you'll eventually die and lose everything. Save high level items that your class can't use in your chest so when you die, because you'll die, you can try a new class with high level items from the beginning.Moral of the game: spam the shot click, get cutty pets, do random♥♥♥♥♥♥with random players along the map, defeat Oryx and overall don't get this game too serious, play it when you are stressed and want to unwind yourself.

												~Bold Starr~'s Realm of the Mad God ReviewPros:+Dungeon crawler.+Roguelike MMO.+A whole 14 Classes.+Tons of weapons, abilities, armour, etc.+100+ hours of gameplay worthy. (Depends if you like dungeon crawlers)+Simple and easy to get used to.+Tons of fun with friends.Cons:-Perma death. (You'll loose your character and all of it's items upon death)-Definantly repetitive. (This could be a pro or con)-Tons of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and jerks.-Modding / Hacking players galore!-Updates are practically a myth.-It's hard to continue at a point of the game without putting money into it.Even if this game sounds cancerous due to the cons, this game is very well layed out, I play it almost everyday, not on steam, but flash player. I reccomend you were to at LEAST try the game out. "

												I dumped at least 2k hours into this game on the browser version. I played for about 3 years before quitting out of boredom. This game is great, and very well made... but VERY poorly managed. Anyone that has been playing this game for at least 2 1/2 years will tell you all about how they hate Kabam for screwing up everything. This is true, however the game is not bad because of the mismanagement of Kabam. Kabam bought this game from Wild Shadow Studios, who were the original makers of the game, and started taking the game in a direction that the community was not too fond of. Before that, the game was very fun and spectacularly addicting... and it still is. The point is... don't get caught up in all the people telling you this game is terrible because of the mismanagement. If you like roguelike MMORPGs, this is one of the best, and easily my favorite.

												After 200+ hours on steam and countless on the web i have come to the conclusion that this game is wholly not worth it.One main thing that has finally sent me over the edge on this opinon of my personal fav dungeon crawler is that THIS GAME HAS ZERO SUPPORT, now one may say had they been playing for a while ""Stan! Stan! come now deca answer Support tickets reguarding bannings very quickly"" And while these people would be right about that, Deca (The current dev team) seem to be absent when it comes to game lag, input lag, loot and economy balancing and unjust player death, to name a few. To elaborate on the lag this game faces on both ends Stems mostly from the game being coded in flash thus limmiting the game heavily. On the front of economy,loot... the sale of end game items only effects the economy (GOOD ITEMS DOES NOT A GOOD PLAYER MAKE) Driving prices down, but who cares! as the most glaring problems apper in this game when you realise That this game has no progression in the end game and no reason to be better. IE in a game like chess you play to be better at the game than other players, or like quake as you get better at the game you are clearly better than new players and you have the skill to show for it. Now realm of the mad cuck does have skill as better players can dodge duck and dive like the best of em but that doesn't matter in a game like realm as the loot is random meaning no matter how good you are you will never be rewarded for your skill save for being spared for the crule hand of death, Oh wait going back to the lag this game faces Skill will not save you from the lag no matter how hard you try in this game the lag will get you at some point. This brings us to the crux of my little rant here Skill does nothing in this game and means nothing therefore the question is begged!WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ WOULD YOU WANT TO PLAY A GAME WHERE YOU ARE NOT REWARDED FOR SKILL, PUNISHED FOR THINGS OUT OF YOUR CONTROLL AND THEN NOT EVEN GIVEN AN ANWSER AS TO WHY?(Although i can not find the total ernings of realm (mostly from lack of trying) i can say that there are currently positions ranging 20k-80k per year, they have to money to remake realm and then some. And while they're at it put in a better guild/party system and make class varitey an actual thing please)			"

												This game looks actually horrible and that's what I thought to but this game is one of the best games i've ever played and you can tell by my hours. I've been dedicated to this game for four years and i've witnessed 2 owners and i'm about to witness my 3rd. This game is worth trying out if you are into MMO's and Dank communitys, there are some toxic players but how would this be a good game without some ♥♥♥♥ers am i right? So please give this game a try and thank you for reading my review			"
