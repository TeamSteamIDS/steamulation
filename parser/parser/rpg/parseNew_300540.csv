												Really nice and eclectic old-school RPG with a few highly unique features that make it stand out. First thing I should  mention are the environments. This time we're playing Lily, a little girl traversing a variety of worlds within her dreams that contain many familiar characters from literature and films. There is a sense of unpredictability that is special here, as the settings run the gamut from cute to creepy, futuristic to fanciful, to more modern and down-to-earth. A variety of custom assets really set this apart from many other games made with this engine. There is hardly a medieval RPG cliche in sight, and the vast majority of backgrounds, scenery, bosses, character designs, and even the unusually over-sized sprites and animations give this game its own identity. The only unfortunate bit art-wise is the small number of portraits for the characters and the kind of amateurish approach in the few designs that are there. They clash with the often inspired environmental and boss designs.The story is not heavy on cut-scenes or banter and the script is very comparable in longevity to SNES RPGs. There is a plot and quite light character development, but not a lot of time is spent extrapolating on either. What is here though is equally as unconventional as the presentation of the game. There is a mix of cute and charming aspects and darker, more sinister story elements. For example, the hub town is a magical wonderland of a place and Lily's three companions are mystical creatures befitting a child's storybook. But there are other ominous figures milling about, hinting at a more ambitious overarching plotline. Forces both good and evil seem invested in her journey, and the intentions of any characters are questionable. While the battle system is very old-school in execution, there are many notable editions to the overall gameplay. Crafting becomes possible early in, and involves creating your own spells and customizing character abilities and elemental affinities. You collect incredients for spells as spoils from fallen enemies and from treasure chests. You can also craft many items and furniture (more about that shortly) There are also a multitude of accessories to collect and/or earn from completing quests in the game. But perhaps the largest side endeavor is the ability to decorate your own house and place numerous items either earned from crafting or purchased with points scattered around the dungeons. I was surprised by how detailed this mini-game of sorts is, and that it ties into the rest of the game by giving bonus elemental and stat benefits. Finally, each new area offers puzzles to be solved, some are mini-games while others involve environmental manipulation and mazes to navigate through. There is a lot of care put into differentiating each of the levels. At about 10 hours through I've completed perhaps 60-70% of the game, and there is apparently an alternate mode (New Dream+) that adds more replayability. The inclusion of 38 achievements is a nice bonus, and some of these are fulfilling secrets that unlock in-game bonuses. Now for some of the downsides- my main issue with the game is how long it takes for battles to pick up speed and be more engaging. At the beginning, playing on normal at least, enemies have some powerful status effects at their disposal. The first two areas are rife with enemies who seem to have high evasion plus the ability to add a blind status effect to the party, lengthening battles by a large degree. What makes this frustrating is that it takes a few hours of leveling before characters learn the more interesting of their innate or learnable abilities, so much of the strategy options are limited. I think it's important for games to put their best foot forward when it comes to introducing a game, I could see many people becoming disenchanted by this title before it even begins to show promise. Just having a few more strategic options and introducing the variety of the battle party as quickly as possible can make a big difference, I feel, and would mesh better with the high ambitions of the rest of the game. There are already so many unusual features and for a game as combat-heavy as this, more resources should have been allocated to adding more variance to the battle system. If you're not already sold by the old-school turn-based battle systems of the NES-SNES era, this one is probably not going to change your mind. Those who have a lot of patience with or already enjoy that approach; however, will likely enjoy all the facets of this title. So overall, Sweet Lily Dreams takes a while to get going, but is interesting and recommendable.			"

												Sweet Lily Dreams is a JRPG that is highly influenced by popular stories, and wears those in its sleeves. Quite literally.The game's focus is clearly its universe and story, but it tries to tie the RPG mechanics into it without really understanding them... and so the ""game"" part ends up dragging for way too long, and had me lose interest in the story completely, about 15 hours in.I still finished it, but while the very last mission was better than the others, it still wasn't great, and definitely not worth it.The game has a few cool ideas, but it's far too ambitious for what it ends up doing, and feels like a mess the whole way through.RPGMaker games get a bad reputation, and it's totally understandable! I'm pretty sick of playing these games on a small resolution because the engine can't handle any better. And yet, this is sold for 15â‚¬. No. I could overlook the technical issues, if the game had good mechanics, but this is one just has a unique artstyle, with a fairly uninspired story (in my opinion).There's A LOT wrong with this, and I can't write about everything, but I'll sum it up the best I can.So, presentation.RPGMaker problems aside, it's not bad.While the UI is a bit generic, the actual game's resources are mostly unique, and certainly gives Sweet Lily Dreams a headstart when compared to its competitors.It has a very twisted fairy-tale feel to it, and it works well!The combat animations and particle effects were very simple and limited, but it didn't really matter to me.It's good, but nothing spectacular.The music felt a bit incoherent, to me. While it wasn't bad, it sounded very generic, and I don't feel it complemented the artstyle in any way. Take it or leave it. Personally, I didn't care for it, and I'm one to appreciate video game music, most of the time.Before going into the mechanics, I'll talk about how the story plays out.Essentially, you play as Lily, and you're trapped in a dream world. In this world, there are forces fighting that behave almost like secret corporations/cults... it feels out of place, and there's very little insight into them. While the game throws a bit of moral gray into this conflict, it never develops it.There are hints between who's right and wrong, but it's pointless. You never explore either sides very much, character progression was very shallow, and the player had no hand on it. I saw a few opportunities for moral choices, but no. It's as linear as it gets. And it's not that well written.So, other than that, you'll go from mission to mission, with a few party members, to prove your worth, and later fight the main antagonist. Each mission is from someone's dream. Or story. These stories are drawn from literature, comic books, etc. I'm not sure how I feel about this. In a way, I like when games/series do this. But it felt very arbitrary in this game. The missions had absolutely no connection to each other, and ended up feeling like an excuse for not writing original stories. (You know, some futuristic animes discuss some classic sci-fi concepts and problems, and reference books/movies for their origins, or other perspectives. This game, however, references them for the sake of it. Personally, I have no interest to look into those stories because of the game.)Besides, it can alienate some people, if they've never heard of those stories. The game gives very little context to them, expecting you to have the same past as the developers to enjoy it...Honestly, I don't think it's very good. Many people seem to disagree with me, so I may be in the wrong. But personally, the game felt like it wanted to have some idealism behind it, but didn't go the whole forward.So... so far, nothing very good. And with the combat and puzzles, things only get worse.First, the combat. In the first half hour of the game, you have only one character, with one basic attack. This means that you'll spend half an hour spamming the basic attack, while learning absolutely nothing abou the mechanics.Then, you gain a skill! But... it's just a physical attack, slightly stronger than the basic one. It's adds nothing to the game.You get the drill... It's pretty tedious. The game doesn't really give you a wide array of tools to experiment with. It's all so primitive... There are 4 elements that counter each other. However, there's no visual indication of which type your enemies are, which means that you'll have to use every elements until you figure out what the best tactic is. Simple trial and error. That's the first problem.Then, every elements behaves exactly the same, with the exception of the ailments. Each element has one, which could provide some more strategy. There damage over time (Poison-Water), Blind(Miss chance - Thunder), Burn (Silence-Fire) and Freeze(Cold). These could be cool... but turns out that all the bosses are immune to these. And the normals enemies die fast enough that you don't need to use them. So, the only defining trait of each elements is utterly useless. Big problem for me.So yeah. The combat gets very repetitive. It's just trying to figure out each enemy's weakness, and then use the most powerful attack you've got.There's also very little sinergy between the party members, it's limited to physical/magic defense for the party, and a very, very weak healing ability.The loot is limited to crafting materials for both spells and furniture. (more on furniture later)Equipment is just one acessory per character, and will boost one stat. That's all. You main character can have a Weapon (elemental attack) and a Dress(elemental defense). Even these two were badly implemented!You choose your weapon and dress at the beginning of the game. It's the first thing you do. With absolutely NO CONTEXT for what these you, you're given a choice... It makes no sense. You can buy the other elements later from a story, but there's no point anyway, and you won't be able to in the start of the game.On a segway, do not choose Thunder. The first 2 missions contain enemies and bosses that are immune to this elements, which means that one of your characters will be useless for the first couple of hours. Really smart way of doing things....I'm sorry for being overly negative, but it seems that I've stumbled across a major design flaw in every single step of the way. I'm not purposely trying to make the game look bad, but I can't see almost no redeeming values!There's also an optional puzzle elements to the game, needed only for sidequests. But guess what... Yeah, it's not very good.Each level has a different type of puzzles to solve (it can be a pipe-puzzle, and slide-puzzle, etc. etc.) These could have been cool, but they're just... there. And they usually stretch out for way too long, and go from being a change of pace to a shore.Also, since this is not a puzzle game, it doesn't slowly teach you, gradually increasing difficulty. Either you're familiar with these puzzle and solve them easily, or you're not. It's feels out of place.I don't think there much else to say. The game also feels completely unbalanced. I was playing on Hard Mode fairly okay. Then, due to the limited elemental spells (which you'll take a long time until you learn), I reach a point where it was impossible for me to win. The enemies could Blind and Freeze me, and half of my characters were powerless. It was literally impossible, until I lowered to Normal.Another balance issue, is regarding money. At the start of the game, you'll barely have money for potions. By the end, you'll have a lot of money, but the potions don't heal you enough to be useful in battle.It's just... I don't know. I don't know who balanced the game, honestly. It's just not good. At all.No more words for furniture (sorry for the rant). But just know that it was a bad replacement for equipment. Sorry, I didn't enjoy this game at all, and definitely not recommend it.			"

												You know what really grinds my gears? The way RPGMaker game review threads are full of people who give the game a thumbs-down BECAUSE IT'S AN RPGMAKER GAME.  You're an idiot for playing a game you knew you wouldn't like, and your review wastes my time and yours.This game is beautiful and original, going well beyond the stock resources available in RPGMaker and common DLCs.  The developer has gone inside the guts of the game and tinkered with the Ruby script to great effect.  The characters are sweet and endearing and the world is mesmerizing and subtly horrifying.  The overall atmosphere is dreamlike, almost psychadelic, and yet childlike in the best possible way.IF YOU LIKE RPGMAKER GAMES or develop them yourself I highly recommend playing this gem, if just to see the power a creative mind and heart and some Ruby skills can bring to genre.

												This game is quite mixed. Good things and bad things. But for sure not a ~10â‚¬ game, that is insane. I've seem free RPGMaker games way better than this.The character design is great and horrible at the same time. Some of the monsters are quite original and would make a great addition to a bigger lore. Many characters are actually cringy.The level design is good, but at the same time is infuriating how, for example, some rocks are lay out that prevent waking just to make a silly walk around of just a 4 or 5 squares.The music is acceptable. But at technical level the game is horrible.In general it feels like the game has a lot of placeholders and never got finished. Or if the people making the individual part of the games were doing a great job, but the director or the person putting everything together failed miserably.What I would actually recommend is to reset everything. Get the story, some characters, and so on. Start over and make it right, because is a pity that this is not any better.			"

												I actually really love this game. When it first caught my eye, i added it to my wishlist to remember for later, and when I had the chance to get it, i got a bit nervous at first because i actually took  a closer look at the trailer and in-game photos and thought ""oh my god what kind of furry adventure am i gon get myself into""but it's actually really fun and a lot of popular characters from popular older novels. movies, fairy tales, etc have appearances in it.When i first played it, i thought of Kingdom hearts for some reason, i want to say maybe if you think kingdom hearts is pretty neat, maybe you'd like this too? i mean it though, i think it's worth a play!

												Aside from the first puzzle, Sweet Lily Dreams is a fun little RPG with a nice balance of customization, story and gameplay. Combat has a steady difficulty curve, and inventory and elemental management becomes more important the further you get. Unlike many other games, customizing your home has benefits that boos gameplay, and costumes play a major effect in survival. All in all, a pleasant experience.			"

												Not actually a yuri game. 0/10Seriously, though, this game has a few things going for it, like being a lot prettier than is typical for an RPG Maker game, with very well-designed maps, neat character spites, interesting (if a fairly limited variety of) monsters, and also fairly good background music, even if one of the themes really sounds way too much like a Final Fantasy song.Unfortunately, that's where the good parts of the game ended for me, so this will be a thumbs-down. A lot of the systems (like the skill crafting) aren't very well thought-out and either incentivize grinding for fairly uncommon drops just to have basic attack spells, or feeling like you barely even have the basics for most of the game. Meanwhile, you'll barely have enough money to heal yourself in town or craft (a mere 10-12 MO each) potions at the start of the game, but shortly after that you'll never have anything to spend money on again.There's also an interesting variety of minigame sidequests, but they're dragged down by the alchemy minigame, which is the worst thing ever and something you have to complete 23 times in order to complete the sidequest for it. Also, unfortunately, the designer didn't code sanity checks into either the alchemy minigame or the sliding block puzzle minigame, and both of them can randomly be in unwinnable configurations - not a good thing, especially for the sliding block puzzle, which can take a lot of effort to determine that it's unwinnable.The difficulty I'm kind of mixed on. Easy is fairly steamroll-everything easy (though people on the forums seem to think it's not that easy), while Hard is pretty extreme. Unfortunately, while I was having fun with Hard early on, my fun was dragged down by my difficulties with the skill system and the game not really having many different approaches I can take to any given challenge, eventually leading me to reduce it to Easy at the end of the Russian Forest because I was forced into only using 1 and 2 characters without much warning.The story is ... also kind of a minus. While the setting is fairly interesting, it felt like nonsense (and/or BUY MY OTHER GAMES) early on, and never really cohered into something I fully cared about, but instead just an excerpt from a larger story with dubious relevance.  Then the last dungeon took an abrupt turn into darker and edgier with the villain's backstory, and then the ending was... more or less a diabolus ex machina that left absolutely everything unresolved. Blah.So yeah, thumbs down. But whoever did the art and map design should definitely do it for a better-designed game. Or the designer should get better at designing systems for his next game! One of the two.			"

												A nice little game which i finished. I decided to write this as negative due to issues i am having in the game, and that is why this is negative review. I tried contacting the developer, even friending them. I sent messeges to them in hopes of response to the bugs i posted on this topic:http://steamcommunity.com/app/300540/discussions/0/558756256022295783/?ctp=3I posted three bugs at the bottom, and will repeat them here so others can read this review to make a decision on getting this game.Bug #1. Controller bug. I use a Logitech F310. This controller is very basic, but should work theoretically with every game on steam..theoretically. It does not work fully on this game and can cause some frustrations. For example, when you try to use an item, and wish to confirm it's useage, it does not recognize the button on your controller for confirm, even if you map it different ways. Ive tested this several ways and have same result every time. There are also others that report same problem with XBOX controller, so this issue seems common.Bug#2. Music bug. This bug ruins the game a bit too much for me. Basically, in battle, if you fight certain monsters, and they use a skill, it either makes the music stop and you only hear ambient noises in the battle, or your own character skills constantly reset the music for the battle, starting it over and over again, which is also quite annoying.Bug#3. Screenshot Bug. I love taking screenshots. Unfortanetly for this game, you cannot take them. Everytime you do, you get an error. While using this method tends to work for most RPG MAKER games:


A very basic guide to make screenshots for this game (or others)Â

It does not for this particular game. I already posted it also on the main forum, and the developer did ask me how i take the screenshots, and yet to respond. Again, i will change this review when these issues are fixed.In case anyone wants to know, this game was played using Windows 10 OS 64 bit. Not sure if this is causing the issues, and that is why im still waiting on the developer for answers. I will change to positive once developer addresses these issues. In the meantime, this game is NOT recommeneded!			"

It has very whimsical art style of that of a children's book and a very good sound track and a good story  and puzzles .The controls are a bit off but just use the app that comes with your controller and config it,real easy fix!

												Not quite sure how to describe this game: it's a bit unusual. There are more than a few moments that leave you wondering if you're playing a game designed specifically for preteen girls XD (case in point: the team is made up of 3 females and an agendered plushie LOL)Fair amount for completionists - best to focus on not touching those green healing orbs OR going for max points - but you do get more points up for grabs in a playthrough than the achievement requires.It's a reasonably well thought out game, actually, and Sleepy Hollow, Dracula's castle and Dr. Jekyll's manor were charming surprises. The mini games are also a welcome distraction, especially the alchemy pipe tilting to make potions ^_^The last level and the plot in general leave a good few questions, but i haven't played whisper of a rose to get a better idea of where the whole 'caretech and idream' story is going now that Rosaria is all settled.The characters are memorable, but their trials and personal struggles seem a bit forced, i think it would benefit from being a longer game :)I admit this game as a fairly guilty pleasure and would like to see where it goes next.

												You know, at first this looked dumb to me. But a friend gifted it to me in a humble bundle, so I felt obligated to play it. Thank God I did. The game's intro reminds me a little too much of Kingdom Hearts, but the graphics are well done, the music is well done, and a lot of thought clearly went into everything. I was very glad to see that they didn't stick with the generic RPG maker battle system. I'm really tired of encountering those, and this was a breath of fresh air.I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, but I'll try and point out a few of the flaws in the game. The battle system is nice, but I think it'd look nicer if it didn't use characters overworld sprites. A lot of NPCs have super flat characters. I know they're NPCs and all, but I really don't care about them. They may as well have been anybody.Overall, the game's pretty good, although I would go so far as to say VERY good for an RPG maker game. If you're playing To the Moon but want a little more combat, I would recommend you try this.			"

												This is going to be a mixed review. I got this game off of a recent Humble Bundle. To tell you the truth, it didn't look that interesting. I finally got tired of it sitting in my library so I decided to pick it up.The main character of the story is named Lily. She is tucked to bed my ber mother and she asks, ""When will daddy be home?"" The mother replies, ""He will be working late tonight, but you can see him tomorrow."" Lily says, ""Then I don't want to go to sleep."" The mother thinks for a moment and replies, ""Then you can see your father in your dreams."" The main game takes place within Lily's dreams, and the three main characters are Lily, a talking dog, and a talking cat.Exploration mechanics could be tweaked a bit to make it more sturdy, but they are fine.Battle mechanics are pretty basic for a RPG game. Simple attack, skills, items, defend, and run options are available in battle.Overall, this game was clearly intended for 10 year old children. I would recommend getting this for you daughter, but not for yourself.			"

 Kinda hard to decide	This is not one of the worst or best games and probably not for an average person. If you like yourself some JRPGs then it will suit you but if you're used to the more conventional american RPGs then this might not be for you.There is a lot of story but not that much action, at least at first. After that you just grind from one plot point to another.Pros Nice story Better graphics than other RPG maker games What you'd expect from a standard JRPGCons Takes a lot of time to get to some action at first Grinding

												This has got to be one of the worst games I've ever played. The storyline is probably fine, but one would never know, because the combat system is absolute garbage. The game starts off with you having one character, lvl 1, and the rate of evade way to high on monsters. My third fight consisted of the enemy evading me 19 times ina row, before I could hit and kill it.To make matters worse, when you do get a party, it only makes you more frustrated. The main character DOES NOTHING. First real fights, and she hits for 0, has no skills, and is just there to be punched int he face. Even lvling her up does nothing. add to that fighting monsters that add blind automatically twice each turn, and you get an entire party that can't hit ANYTHING.Literally fighting 2 monsters, that do nothing but blind, no damage, and I can't hit them. After AN HOUR AND A HALF IN ONE BATTLE, UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING, I had to force the game to close, and realize I had been ripped off.Paying money for such a bad, bad game makes me feel bad, and the creators should feel bad for ripping people off of money. No one should ever get this game. You've been warned.			"

I have played both these games to completion and had a very enjoyable time.I enjoy the combat mechanics, especially the point-base system. You have to hunt for points (which appear as gold coins) which motivate you to explore every small little corner of the game map. There is also an achievement for getting all the points. Furthermore, the points can be used to buy furniture which you can display in your house and they will give you combat bonuses. Furthermore points can also be use to buy dresses (armor) and weapons for Lily too.Monsters will drop crafting materials when they are vanquished, and these crafting materials can be used for making Spells, Potions and Furnitures.  I love this system.Scattered on the ground are small green circles which will heal you when you step on them. However, there is a difficult achievement which will only trigger if you activate less than 20 healing circles in the entire game. So, this turn the game mechanics in a whole new direction --- as you are now trying to AVOID stepping on healing circles whenever you do exploration. However, this is not always possible, as some healing circles are on critical paths and there is no way to get through a dungeon without stepping on certain healing circles. The story itself is well thought out. The starting scene is misleadingly simple and looks like an RPG for kids. However, this is not the case as there are a lot of depth and the story gets darker as you proceed. However, I love the major themes of the RPG which is actually love, mutual caring and cooperation. I get a warm feeling at the end of the story, which is excellent.I would strongly recommend this game to any old school RPG gamers out there who like a good story with interesting game mechanics.

												Unfortunately I was quite dissapointed with the game. I don't mind it being so cheese and candy like. But it's simply very boring and the story is poor. I love jRPG  and hope to have some fun with it. Tried 3 times and I just can't do it. The graphics are good and the inventory is big with some things to do. But fights are way to easy and ... boring. 4/10.			"

												do not pay $15 for this gamecombat itself sucks unless you plan to grind for basic skills that only make it marginally more bearable, spent two hours and two bosses just mashing attack and healing because there's nothing else to do unless you grind like i said but grinding is dumb and the end result isnt even that good. difficulty comes in the form of bosses faceâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing you when they please with an overpowered all hit move. imagine SMT difficulty only way worse and for the wrong reasonsstory sucks, puts Lily on the focus before suddenly shifting perspective on the creator's actual fursona RIGHT AFTER THE TUTORIAL ENDS THATS RIGHT THE GAME WAS NAMED AFTER WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY SHAFTED INTO A SECONDARY CHARACTER FOR A GOD DAMN SELF INSERT FURRY DOGpuzzles sucks, either they're easy enough for a baby or too difficult to the point WHERE THEY ACTUALLY LET YOU SKIP THE HARD ONES IF YOU PAY UPthere is also extremely blatant plagiarism which I do not think the responsible authorities have been noted of yet and it's that the trickmaster from kingdom hearts 1 was placed into this game with only the shoulder pads not having the black trim and the room its in is literally called the trickmaster's room. if plagiarising it was not disrespectful enough, it was also used only for baby memory puzzle game that only people with ADHD or literal babies could failif you need a god damn $15 RPG then this is not the one, go buy preowned strange journey or something			"

												I don't know where I got this from, probably some bundle that had at least one game that interests me, and some with cards. Found out this has cards now, so I have a look while waiting for the drops.It just keeps annoying me.""Wake up"" apparently means quit.Clicking play, I get delayed by something drawing the title on the screen without the option to skip, and a scene I can't click to speed up text. Plus it's dinging music at me even though I turned it off.No way to get back to the menu from there, so I close the game by 'x' button and start it again. Pressing play again, again I get to wait through some stuff instead of continuing. After completing the first brief tutorial bit, I get held up by credits, apparently in between every scene.Oh, and when did I choose some elemental thing? There was no indication I couldn't pick up all the things there.More credits, another 'choice' (at least this time I noticed the yes/no that might have been there the last time, too), and more being held up in something I can't skip.Then some fight. Clicking Escape does naught.Yay, I got the 3 cards. Off to uninstall. (If I get past the next credits to the menu. Might better hit X again.)Phew, out!			"

												I got this game during a humble bundle and decided i'd try it out. After downloading it for half an hour due to myâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥poor internet the game finally loaded up. I had no idea what this game was about. The first thing you see is a wolf that looks like it was drawn by a 16 year old furry artist on deviantart. Normally I'd be like ""Oh ok it's a furry game"" and uninstall it, but this was different. My family was right behind me as I opened up the game. My ENTIRE family. You would not believe their faces. The look on disgust on my older brother. The look of dissappointment on my father. The look of shame on my younger sister. Their faces will never leave my mind. ""I can't believe this is what my son is in to."" ""I didn't raise you to be like this."" ""I knew you were messed up but not like this."" It's been five days. Nothing's ben the same since. They try to act like it's a normal thing but I know they're judging me behind my back. My mother keeps asking if I'm doing ok, or if I'm being bullied. My younger brother has spread it to my friends. I've been outcasted from my usual group. None of them want anything to do with me anymore. The furries keep trying to friend it up with me. Out of desperation and depression I've started hanging out with them. I've gone to a point of no return. My life ruined.Do not download this game.Do not make the mistakes I made.Go out.Save yourself.Remember the mistakes I made and spread it to the people.No other life must live the suffering that I endure.

												While I'm posting this as a negative review, I'm actually borderline neutral on this game.Plus: attractive, whimsical graphics, an unusual and consistent ""fairytale"" vibe, and fairly straightforward mechanics. The puzzles I've encountered have been fairly straightforward (not necessarily a good thing). In most ways this is a great candidate for Baby's First JRPG.Negative: controls are a bit awkward. The fairytale vibe seems condescending at times. I found gameplay a bit dull (although if you note my time played, I didn't get far into the part of the game where you battle as a team). However, the main problem only really applies if you do want your kid playing in it: under essentially any circumstances, when told to do something by an adult or authority figure, your best (and frequently only) option is to do the exact opposite.I realise this is a common trope in childrens' adventure literature but it's taken to extremes here.

												The plot of this game is interesting enough, provided you can get through the long, grueling, sometimes-confusing gameplay. The game makes an effort to be creative with its puzzles and design, and independent of the actual RPG portion of it, those could've been pretty neat...But as it is, they're immensely frustrating.The free-wandering enemy encounters are a chore to evade, especially when you're trying to figure out a puzzle and keep having to backtrack. It's a frustrating game. It's going to be long, it's going to be hard, and not in the entertaining way, either. Unless you somehow find not-entirely-intuitive puzzle sections, maps ridiculously easy to get lost in and fights that drag on forever because you can't seem to deal any remotely significant amount of damage fun.In which case, this game's for you, probably.I was interested in it, I really was, but it's just not fun to play.

												Sweet Lilly Dreams is a game made in the same vein as the JRPGs of the 90's, except it didn't quite manage to get the same charm as those games.It starts off reasonably well, the premise for the game is cute and interesting, so it made me want to play more to see if it also has a good story and gameplay to back that up. Sadly, it does not.The story fizzles out soon, as it is let down by bad dialogue writing and worse still it instantly derails you to a less interesting story plot.Not to mention the fact that I thoroughly dislike the art style. The environments are passable, however the characters and the character portraits look absolutely horrible. It simply constantly makes you think that you are playing a game made in a school project.The combat itself is a very generic turn based combat that you see in pretty much every game made with RPGMaker. It would've been OK if only you had received more abilities at the start. As it stands now with 2 of your characters all you do is press attack and with the other 2 you have one reasonable ability to choose from. You can create scrolls to get more abilities but even then you don't get much choice as you can only get a good selection of abilities later on in the game. So the combat is just too boring at the start to endure, and coupled with all the other cons of the game I got fed up with the game soon enough.4 / 10			"

												Please note that I haven't finished this game yet, even though I felt I should review this game. I just felt you needed to know that.Now, the first part of this is simple. If you want to get the achievements properly, especially the one where the Heartless (yes, the Trickmaster is the Alice in Wonderland boss Heartless in Kingdom Hearts, people) challenges you to a game of Thimble Cup for 7 rounds, be prepared for a lot of sweat and tears getting that right. Most of the achievements are story-related, mind you, so that's not going to be a major problem.Now... a couple things I should ask: Who the bloody hell is the Illuminati and why are we working for them?

												Got it in a bundle, don't reccommend buying for 15E.As many negative comments say, the combat is awful. Boring at best, grindy and tedious at worst.The writing is either predictable or pulls new plot elements out of nowhere.The art is all custom(as it's an RPGmaker game), but that doesn't instantly make it good.How ever could this be a recommendation?Stuff that helps to enjoy the game:A: A controller, or a keyboard setup would work too, with a repeater button. About 10 times per second of clicking ""confirm"". It's needed because of the horrendous battle mechanics. You can take the time to pick a special ability with an element for xx% more damage, but rarely does that cut even a single turn from the opponents. 99% of battles is thus everyone spamming their normal attack, and sometimes your healer heals. Leveling up grants you full hp and mana, so you're solid from here on out. Getting a repeat button makes the battles more like movies, inbetween the talky parts.B: Knowledge how hard making games is. How hard writing is. It's pretty dang hard.But I can appreciate the effort they put in this: it is clearly a work of love. They made this game because they wanted to make a game.C: Be drunk, high, or so tired that you seem drunk or high. Many games are too complex to play then, but this game is juuuust right.It's what I thought at that time to be a load of fun.			"

												Whew. Just finished it. This game gets an 8 out of 10.Maybe a 7.5, as 15â‚¬ is imho too pricey for what it is. I would personally price it closer to 7-10â‚¬ instead.- Should I buy this? (aka the Short Review)This game is made in RPG maker, so you need to like that style of gameplay (Ib, Corpse Party, Mihao... without the horror), with final-fantasy-turn-based kind of battles. There are card drops, but to get all the achievements you need to complete the game twice. Playtime to complete the game once was 17 hours for me, which is very good. The story is well told and the mechanics are enjoyable. It's not a horror game, but it has 2 or 3 scary/dark moments.You play as Lily, accompanied by a party of 3 as you travel to several dream worlds, each inspired by a different real life book. I loved the various references, such as the Kingdom Hearts intro, and the end lets open the possibilities for a sequel.NOTE: I played this, abandoned it, and picked it up much later. I learned that the game gets MUCH more enjoable after the first world (aka once your party is formed and you start travelling trough dream worlds). Keep an open mind.- The art is awesome. Not necessarily what you would expect from an AA game, but considering the RPG maker kit this is truly wonderful. The developer mentioned that they tried to stay away from the kit as much as they could, and it really shows. It's unique, nice to look at, and makes you see that they really put thought into it.- The story is also really nice. At some point I started believing they were ""telegraphing"" the ending twist, but that did not happen (not that I would have minded). It does a good job of making you feel involved and care for the characters. After the end, a little scene shows a cliffhanger, but it doesn't ruin the story.- Gameplay is fun. I usually dislike turn based battles, but in this game I had lots of fun all round. There is a little bit of crafting, and some customizing (Lily can wear one of four outfits), which I think are a nice touch. There are puzzles, so be prepared to scratch your head a bit!This is why I took out 2 points for my review:- You HAVE TO complete the game twice, to get all the achievements. This is a big no-no for me. I am NOT going to enjoy being forced through the entire game. - Missable achievement: you need to collect all the game coins to get this one. There are one or two places that become unavailable as you go along, and again you will need to replay the entire game to achieve it.Overall I RECOMMEND the game based on its great playability, nice story and pretty art style.I would not recommend it to completionists, unless they are prepared to go trough it twice and consume a lot of time.

												I love seeing what creativity is unfurled using programs like RPG Maker, and this was a cute attempt.  I however found the dialogue a bit flat and gameplay a little repetitive.  I didn't finish the game, so I may be giving a negative review prematurely, however I don't plan to finish the game to find out.			"

												Sweet Lily Dreams is an older fashioned RPG Maker game that uses various Folk Stories and childrens books from different countries and creates an intricate game play story. The knowledge and background research for these various stories helps to make the game flow smoothly between worlds and stories. The various dreams brought up are common among almost every young child and adults fears or insecureties. Whether it is facing a blood sucking Dracula in Transalvania, to chasing witches in Russia, or even running with the headless horseman, the story will keep your heart racing. The game has maybe one or two scary moments, but it really not a scary game to most.Sweet Lily Dreams is like every game and has some minor flaws to it that can detere some people from the game. I had some  problems myself, but to be honest most of them were cused by me. Many areas are maze like maps that have to be navigated through while dealing with respawning enemies. This actually helped me stay a few levels ahead of the bosses and made the game easier. However, it gets annoying trying to traverse some areas and not knowing how to get through them (again, most of them were my fault). Patience is a must with this game and requires you to think outside the box. Some of the side quest puzzles can also be hard if you are not very good with certain types of puzzles, but are rewarding when you do solve them.All in all Sweet Lilly Dreams is a decent game for hard core RPG Maker Fans who are looking for a different take on the RPG genera. The game is not super long, taking anywhere from 20-40 hours, depending on how much of the game you decide to explore (puzzles and sidequests) I would greatly recommend this to anyone who is willing to try the game out and is a fan of older RPGs. With some patience and understanding of the mechanics even new fans can be made with this decent take on Folk Lore and childrens books.7.5/10			"

												Like other games I bought to see what can be done with RPG maker this game is one of the few that dissapointed me. The graphics are not what I thought they should be and the way the game is blown up to fit the window gives it a more bitmapped image. The play as the dog at the start was un-fun and turned me off right away, as well as collecting the glowing balls in the cave. Sadly I did not get into this game like ""Breat of Death 7"" or such, it just seemed that the creators were making it more for themselves than an audience. The scripts seemed like they added them to see what they could do vs. if they should do it. Not my favourite RPG maker game.			"
