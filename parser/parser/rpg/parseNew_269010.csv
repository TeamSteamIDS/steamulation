												The school has been invaded by alien monsters, and it is up to six heroines to save the day. With the power of science, of course!Science Girls is a classic turn-based RPG, where you explore the map, fight the enemies and gradually uncover what is going on. It also features extensive dialogues that often let you pick protagonist’s response. And not only the girls have distinct personalities, each of them specializes in a particular scientific field, which add to their uniqueness not only in battles, but during the conversations as well.In short, if you enjoy turn-based RPGs, Science Girls are most definitely worth getting.

												Short game, with a quirky plot that doesn't bother to take itself seriously.  If you're into psuedo rpg/visual novel/japanese school girl uniforms, you'll probaby enjoy it.Instead of classes, you have majors of study, which was nice take, credit where credit's due.I'm on the fence with this one; the game feels... unfinished, certain elements of the game feel unbalanced: Heather is practically your designated hitter the moment you get her, and Jennifer is the only healer you've got.  Missy's tooling didn't seem to matter much, and Nicole should be renamed Hiroshima, she does one thing and one thing well.  I'll leave you to guess.Pro tip: go sparringly on the consumables, they're extremely finite, and you'll need them for the last boss.			"

												I kind of have a soft spot for underdog games so this one drew my attention. The characters are fun but the further you go the more leveling your characters seems to punish you by greatly increasing point requirements for performing actions while doing nothing to accelerate recovery of said points or providing much in the way of recovery items. The gameplay responsiveness is unreasonably crunchy, and shortly into the game battles just become increasingly numbing repeats of your team against armies of self-replicating enemies that just take too long to clear only to get into another same-same-same fight only moments later, taking even longer as it becomes more costly for your characters to perform their actions. If the repetition doesn't sound like a big deal to you, you may well enjoy it.Maybe we'll get to see these fun characters in a different game at some point.Short version: Good characters, but slow and repetitive gameplay that gets slower and more repetitive.

												Science Girls is an RPG where six girls that study different scientific fields come together to stop an alien invasion.This game is not good. Really, the only notable things about this game is that the protagonists are female scientists. It's nice to see media that supports women in science and technology. That's it, though. The protagonists are shallow, and offer very little personality beyond their chosen field. They look very similar (uniforms don't help), which makes it tough to remember which one is which, and after a while, I no longer cared. Sadly, the player-controlled character is just as interchangeable as the others, with the only difference being that she wears a dumb mask. Couldn't I have at least chosen which of the six to control? Also, most of the science the girls use is either basic high school knowledge or completely fictional, and I think the dialogue is actually a bit disrespectful to the scientific fields represented (though, as a CS graduate, I have spent time in a computer lab playing Nethack before). As for the story, I found it uninteresting and a bit too padded out with all the battling.As for the gameplay itself, it's boring and horribly unbalanced. Your characters' basic attacks are worthless. I found I just kept relying on multi-target skills, with the occasional heal. It's awkward that there's no place that I could find to just recover HP/SP... I kept having to do it in battle by putting one enemy to sleep and defending/healing repeatedly. The battle and level up system are really pretty inelegant. This game would've benefited by keeping things simpler (like the Mario RPGs). Also, I hate it with a passion when skills in RPGs become harder to use as you level up. The saving grace is that all six characters are usable in battle and they all receive XP... at least that's one pitfall avoided.The art is not very good. The pixel work is okay. The illustrations do a poor job of making the girls distinct. The alien homeworld looks particularly bad. As for the sound, well, apparently there's supposed to be some sound? There are options for sound, but I didn't hear any. I turned the volume way up and made sure my speakers were working, but no sound or music. The controls try to work for keyboard, mouse, and controller, but the keyboard controls were crap, and for the mouse, the buttons were a bit small and all over the screen, making it tough to use the mouse comfortably. I also found a number of small graphical bugs as I played through... this game really needed a bit more polish.I was really hoping to like this game, especially from the publisher that brought us Long Live the Queen (which was great) and Magical Diary (which was not very good, but I still enjoyed it), but for me, this game was pretty much a miss on every level. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. If you know a small girl who is aspiring to study a science/technology field, have them play a good game instead. I wouldn't want her to think that science is as boring as this game is.			"

												Okay, wow. So a little while ago my profile stated I would review games for people if they asked me, under the condition that the game was in my library. This review is the reason I had that removed.""Here's Science Girls, have fun reviewing it ♥♥♥♥♥♥"" happened and now I'm not that willing to spend so much time on reviews anymore unless something can be bargained.Regardless, I'm a man of my word and I do have principles so, just this once, here's a dead honest and genuine review of Science Girls.Science Girls, a visual novel RPG combination by Hanako Games, did a large appeal on my scepticism when I first started it. I couldn't help but notice it was programmed in Python, which explains its filesize and gameplay mechanics. I'm not going to let that be a negative point in my review though, a title deserves an honest review based on the proposed concept and how it's converged to a playable environment. In that regard they have succeeded in what I presume to be an attempt to recreate an atmosphere that belongs in a crossover between a Japanese visual novel and an oldschool RPG from an indie developer. It's not all good though, and I will elaborate this later on.The mechanics of the game are solid: it offers free roaming on a 2D map, a turn based battle system, interactive dialogues, save slots and it does this all without bugs as far as I could see. In fact, I don't have anything to complain from a technological point of view. On every screen everything is very responsive and the game can be saved at any moment, which is pretty neat! Parts where you explore maps work as you expect them to, dialogues being printed can be fastforwarded by clicking your mouse, all pretty intuitive. The fighting is not complex but still offers the freedom to use tactics, which is in fact required as you progress through the game and don't want to get slaughtered by aliens that look like plants.And that's where I'll break out the criticism: the premise is really silly though it doesn't seem intended as such. For all intents and purposes and regardless of the engine, this is a game about girls doing science majors in highschool having to fight off an alien invasion. As one of these girls, a masked psychology student, you first gather other girls in the school while fighting aliens. This setting is empowered by the dialogues that sometimes feel forced so much that the game gets an educative feel, and by this I of course refer to the girls explaining you how rockets work, why plants can't 'move and attack people', or that a ceiling fan does not provide enough mechanical modules to build a mecha. Of course, having a mecha around to fight the aliens would make the game much easier (in this setting, before any MuvLuv fans send me death threats), but mentioning these things feels out of place and pointless.The artwork expresses the game's indie origin, being reminiscent of a release from college game design club. I'm not arguing that this is a bad thing however, in my opinion it actually gives life to the Japanese indie atmosphere (Oreimo S1, anyone?). The same can be said about the music and sounds. While it might not be your preference (and it certainly wasn't mine), this is exactly what the game is meant to be like. Dialogue screens present you hand drawn characters, the battles are done in 2,5D perspective, and though I must admit that the free roaming map feels a little cheap, it gets the job done.With that I can summarize my review, Science Girls met my expectations as far as the atmosphere was concerned. I could appreciate the authentic Japanese indie feel and the fact the engine was as solid as it gets, what I wasn't so fond of was the educative dialogues that seemed forced and out of place as well as the premise altogether. If Hanako Games has more games based on this engine, though with a less silly and more genuine setting, I am pretty sure they have one or more gems with their name on it. While it might not suit your tastes, it will definitely hook those that look for a Japanese indie visual novel RPG without translation hassle. Hell, when you look at the website of Hanako Games you will see that they actually sell these games on CD's at anime conventions, it doesn't get more authentic than that.			"

												I actually don't understand why this game is so highly rated. It is an RPG that tried to do things in a Visual Novel style.What I have garnerd from my limited time playing it is this: The VN portion of the game is pointless and has no agency within the game. It's their because they wanted to do an RPG/VN. It serves no purpose. The RPG protion of the game is sloppy. You have no way to gain consumables outside of combat. You have no place or way to rest/heal. The combat is slow, tedious and poorly designed. The basic attacks are worthless, so you end up in a ring of defending and healing just trying to get your party ready for the next fight. The character sprites could have used some variation other than hair.Even on the hardest mode, their is no challenge. It just requires you to spend more time in the defend/heal/use special loop.Moving the character on the map works best with mouse. Using the kyeboard is clunky. Going through combat is best with the keyboard as using the mouse get tiresome quickly and you can accidently misclick quite easily. Controller support might as well be yanked. Moving is sluggish, accessing menu's is unintuitive, and using special attacks sometime breaks it so that you can't do anything until you use the mouse/keyboard. And finally the biggest question for a game: was it fun? The anser is no. It was slow, had no real story to speak of, troped characters and tedious combat that monopolizes the majority of the game.I loved other games by the publisher, specifically LLTQ. So this game came as quite a let down. "

												Overall I would say that Science Girls is a pretty good game. In Science Girls you play as the president of the Science Club at a private, all girls school, and the school is being attack by aliens that look like plants but are not plants. Not soon after you make this discovery you go out and find the 5 other members of the club, each of them specialized in a specific field of Science/Technology, and all their special moves are based on their field. There is Jennifer whose field is Biology, Nicole whose field is Physics, Heather whose field is Engineering, Missy whose field is Computer Science, Andrea whose field is Chemistry and your character's field is Psychology.On a gameplay level, Science Girls is a JRPG with the typical turn based fighting system. Arthur C. Clarke once said that ""Magic's just science that we don't understand yet"", and that is reflected here as the spells and Mana that you would find in a more classical JRPG have been replaced by Specials and SP (Science Points!).One good thing that Science Girls does is that the story is surprisingly compelling, and it makes you want to keep playing and see where it goes. Another thing Science Girls does well is that the fighting system is actually pretty fun for a turn-based fighting system. All the girls in your party get XP every battle no matter if they were fighting at all, unless they pass out, and there was enough variety in the girls' special moves to prevent the game from getting too repetitive.However, Science Girls does have it flaws. While I find the story to be compelling, the girls themselves are not. I had to look up their names when writing this review because the characters themselves have no real personalities of their own to speak of, which makes remembering their names to be difficult. The only really personality quirks that we do get is that a) they are girls and b) they are interested in Science (which is pretty obvious in a game called Science Girls). You get some likes and dislikes in the character profiles in the menu, but they are not really all that reinforced in the game itself. Another problem is that the while the fighting system was pretty good, the overworld looked like something someone put together in half an hour using Gamemaker.Science Girls is not a bad game, and while it may not be the best game I've played this week, I feel that it is worth a playthrough.

												The characters are fun both in and out of combat and each one has some compelling abilities though some are much, much easier to justify than others. The battles threaten to become a grind before you're quite able to unlock something else or run into anything new. A fair amount of the game's length is fake - walking around running into repetitive mob packs. There's also a bit of a balance issue in that there's no renewable source for items so you fashion your party in such a way as to have enough sustain to farm battles for SP. Not surprising then, that of the people who played the game long enough to get back the box of doughnuts (~25%), only slightly more than a quarter (~6.4%) bothered to finish the game.There isn't all that much of a story either - just a few lines of comedy and simple decision points stuck along a linear narrative. The alien overworld art is conspicuously ugly. The recorded character sounds are actively offensive even if you watch anime. Fortunately, there's an option to turn off the yell-on-attack sounds, but you'll steal hear them screech every time you get hit.At $5, borderline purchase. Wait for a sale.			"

												Science Girls is a cute but short game about a girls science club whose school gets attacked by plant-like aliens. The story is at times funny, imformative and also a little slice of life. Well, as slice of life as one can expect when there are aliens involved. I would have liked a bit more of a solid storyline regarding all the science involved but on the stuff it does touch on, I can't complain. It plays like your typical turn based RPG so pick your attacks and level them wisely. Speaking of leveling, it has a really cool system in that it allows you to pick any aspect you want to upgrade. It could be a move or your stats. It also has good music, a random assortment of food items, and replay value. I definitely reccomend this game.  "

												If you enjoy smaller scope RPGs with cute girls, talking about science, give it a try.The game itself could need some design polish and makes a couple of mistakes that makes it a little less enjoyable than it could have been. Depending on how you level some abilities, they end up costing loads of skill points to cast, while gaining points back is pretty slow and boring as your standard attacks also cost skill points to use, you may end up forced to sit around defending several turns to build enough skill points to attack, not to mention the ton of turns you have to wait until you can cast a high skill point cost ability again.As it is an indie game, it is understandable that graphics are re-used in many places and doesn't bring a whole lot of variation.Overall, the price is fair and if you're an RPG enthusiast with a day to spare, check it out.

												A little buggy (crashed on a boss fight - seems to be fixed now).  The voice acting could be better (ears hurt, so turned off calling out attacks).  Some of the battle tracks get repetitive (normally to be expected, but two or three of them become repetitive almost immediately after you hear them the first time).  The controls are a little rough (lagged response & hard to tell which choice is selected when using gamepad, have to move long distances back and forth during battle if using the mouse).  The enemies have an all-too-amazing dodge ability (like a 75% dodge rate on hard).  Despite the flaws and annoyances, the graphics are charming, the game has interesting characters, and the battles can be challenging until you get the rhythm.  Also, from what I've seen so far, the story has remained consistent with the title.			"

In the first moments of the game, one of the girls exclaims repeatedly that the defining feature of plants is cell walls, and thus they cannot attack things. Firstly, that is a common distinction, but cell walls are actually common among bacteria, and two, there are myriad articulating plants, like the famous venus fly trap.			"

That are actually correct, even! So the developers did their research, which is definitely a plus in my book. If you're a science geek, and enjoy some odd twists in storytelling, definitely put this game into consideration.Kudos to the developers!

												Science Girls: The members of a science club rally together, using science to save the world.Total playtime: 7.5 hours according to in-game clock on normal difficulty (Steam didn't track my first few hours accurately).It's a nice enough game if you understand what you're getting. It's not going to replace any of your other PC or console RPGs, but it doesn't claim to, and it doesn't ask much of your wallet either. The game reminds me a bit of old (S)VGA DOS anime RPGs back in the late 90s.The first half of the game plays like a light RPG+visual novel. During this period you meet your team members, get to know them a bit, and discover the situation you're all in. Combat is fairly light, being limited to one random encounter per room or screen you enter. I think this part of the game is balanced well, with frequent ""story"" segments regularly breaking up the short strings of battles and exploration.The second half of the game adopts a more JRPG style with an overhead world map and visible wandering enemies. However, dodging enemies is limited since they seem to constantly spawn and swarm you, and most of your time is spent navigating labyrinth-like narrow passages with an annoying number of branching dead ends. Decades of JRPG grinding has worn me thin, so this was more annoying than fun, but I'm sure many people won't mind. Depending on your preference, you should adjust the game difficulty at the beginning accordingly.Bosses are a slightly more interesting affair compared to regular battles, but they are still fairly easy. The last battle, however, was a surprising spike in difficulty. It was probably the first time I really had to make full tactical use of all six girls. I still beat it though, and I even had 1-2 skill points on each girl that I hadn't used yet.You have six party members, three of which can act in each round. They can be swapped out with no penalty at any time, leading to surprising flexibility in combat options, which is probably most necessary in the harder difficulties. You can choose to equally balance all girls and swap them regularly to moderate SP use, or you can specialize the girls in certain roles, like having three for front-line fighting, and swapping the others in as needed to unload their souped-up skills.The girls themselves are nice enough in personality, although I wish there was a bit more talk and story bits with them. The actual science in the game is pretty light too, and nothing you wouldn't have learned in high school. I wonder if a younger child would like this game? Humor is pretty mild, but it's charming enough, and it mostly comes from the girls' personalities.Character art is decent, but the girls look way too similar (palette/paperdoll swaps?). Audio is nothing to write home about. Sound effects and voices are tolerable (excepting Nicole's voice when she gets hit in combat), even if the way they talk in Japanese is puzzling. Some of the music tracks are tolerable, but I imagine most people will mute it after an hour or two.			"

I can't seem to get much further than past the first battle.  The game appears to be a python port or something, based on the error dumps I get after every crash.I cannot recommend this game at this time.  Hopefully the devs will fix the problems so I can play, and then I'll update my review.			"

												Firstly, this game isn't ecchi or hentai it's just girls using Science to defeat aliens that invaded their school.  Are there better games for $2-5?  Yeah...  but this game still let me have a really good time and I kept coming back until I finished it.   So if you think that playing a game where you gather your girls, level them up, and then fight aliens sounds fun then pick this game up.  I didn't regret it.			"

												It's a game I could not get into.  I am driven by story games, interesting game mechanics, or similuation (building) games, but this game doesn't quite invest it's time in story or game play.  I can see where it may be enjoyable for JPRG fans because of the animation, quirky characters, and battle system, but after a few minutes, I knew it wasn't my cup of tea.			"

I will say, it is worth the price, but you should really buy it when it's on sale. 6/10			"

												I came into this game with an open mind and I ended up with mixed feelings with the game. I enjoyed the corky storyline and goofy characters in this game, however I found the battling system to be very frustrating at times. Often I ended up hitting the wrong button because of how close together the list of options was and I don't think there was a way to change the option you picked...or at least I couldn't find it. I also feel like the enemy to player damaged/defense ratio to be unfair. The characters did not really do a whole lot of damage despite me putting skill points into almost everything and the characters didn't dodge quite as much as the enemies did which made me rage quit a few times and it also drew the battles out too long. However I did still enjoy this game over all even though I found it frustrating. I wouldn't recommend this for everyone, but for those who are looking for a short rpg and for those who are willing to work around some wonkyness you should try it out just don't expect something amazing because this game is very far from amazing.

												I sincerely enjoy this game, the characters are all interesting, cute and with their own quirks and styles of combat based on their area of science. The characters are actually believeable to people who have worked/lived closely with people of other scientific professions and I have actually had many of these conversations myself. The combat system does become a bit more difficult later on based on the recovery rate of sp being identical regardless of level but with skills requiring more as they level up but this puts more importance on planning whether the extra damage/effect is worth the sp cost, although it doesn't become too much of an issue if you plan ahead, it is a cute game and I enjoy it so I definitely recommend it and I personally would love to see a sequel or more games from this creator.

												Okay, I admit I got this game on a whim.  BUT I LOVED THIS THING TO DEATH!  I started playing this game and once I started getting the characters I fell in love with them, with one exception the main character WHO HAS NO PERSONALITY AND VIRTUALLY NO DIALOGUE!  Each of the girls is a reference to a different science, their attacks, dialogue, and abilities all reference what science they are linked to in some way, I adored this.This game has a relatively simple feel, which is nice, but you can if you know what you are doing do some rather powerful attacks.  The battles don't vary much through the game, there are a small handful of various enemy types, and there are a total of 5 big bosses in the game, which although are simple do provide some extra challenge.  This game was short, I beat it in roughly 6 hours or so in 2 play sessions, it was overall fun, and one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a long time.  It wasn't Dreamscape, but this was quite a gem, if you see it on sale for $2 or less BUY IT!			"

												Science Girls is a nice RPG that manages to pack quite a bit into a little package. Each of the main characters are unique and have their own personalities and I personally enjoyed the way the overworld map of the school was done (reminded me of a Clue board). However it is very bare bones as grinding is the only way to get stronger there is no equipment you can upgrade your characters with. With that being said it is also a bit on the easy side as I'm playing on graduate difficulty without having too much of a problem. Overall its a nice game if you're looking for a light RPG but I would try something else if you want a serious game/challenge.			"

												Watching attacks miss on both sides of a turn-based RPG battle system for turns on end quickly turned any enthusiasm I had for this game to nothing very quickly. This is one of, but not the least of, many deep flaws that Science Girls has. Let's get some positives out of the way first, though.Pros:-The idea of female protagonists in a video game is always a welcome change for me. That I can respect, even moreso when it's done right and holds up to other ""good"" games. I can't fault games for trying, and won't overlook that for a second. More on that later however. -Within battling itself, each character has a specialized role that they basically fill, akin to a class in most other RPGs of this nature. Giving attacks and spells to each character's ""class"" in this case allows you to find a relatively niche use for probably five of the six girls, the sixth only having a scan ability and not much else of use. The rest, however, are all viable picks for battle. Which is good, because you have all six of them within the first hour and will need a good balance to survive this game. Additionally, each girl learns a ""finisher"" skill at level 6 that will grant them extra exp at the end of the battle if they killed an enemy with it. All of these help phenominally with leveling and the idea itself is unique and pretty cool. I wouldn't mind seeeing it in other games, at that.Unfortunately, that's where the positives stop for me. Let's move onto cons. -Everything about this game feels so slow. The pacing of the game itself, the movement, the progression of the plot, and especially the battling. I would go through one battle and it would feel like fifteen minutes had passed. In one instance of a boss battle, it actually did take that long and felt more like half an hour. More on why battling is bad in a minute. -The plot itself is tolerable at best and hollow at worst. You follow six girls fending off an alien invasion who seem to be after...people's hair? For some reason? That's really all I got. There isn't any more than that. It's weird, kinda creepy, and probably isn't taking anything seriously in the least minus the scientific concepts. Speaking of...-This game throws around scientific concepts and the like like there's no tomorrow. Expect half of them really feel like there's no meaning to them. They talk about wormholes briefly, except nothing about wormholes is ever explained. They come up with different ways to cross paths that might be dangerous, but who cares? I just want to cross a ♥♥♥♥ing bridge, I don't need some complicated solution on how to do it carefully. I most certainly didn't learn anything from it, and it just didn't feel like it went outside the box to make it really interesting or even remotely fun. -The art and sound are absolutely atrocious. I played the whole game with my sound muted because it was driving me up a wall to hear one of the characters cry out like a stereotypical anime girl every time they attacked something. Every. Single. Time. The music is lackluster and carries no sense of urgency. The school is the most generic school you could possibly see, consisting of empty classroom backgrounds and occasionally a storage room or cafeteria. The alien homeworld is no better, just feeling like an empty landscape that I have to trudge across for minutes on end in between the constant battles I have no chance of avoiding. The only thing you can do to tell the girls apart from one another is their hairstyles; oftentimes I would confuse them, even though I've been staring at them all for the past five minutes in battle. The only other NPC in the game is a bald teacher, and the entire cutscene he was in just made me cringe. Just...take my word for it. -The characters themselves are also bland, uninteresting, and have little personality. Each of them is a student in a specific scientific field and... ...well, they do scientific things related to that field. In their profiles, each of them have three ""likes"" of completely mundane things, like horses, or pizza, or movies. That and their interactions throughout the game is all you get on them. Their humor isn't even cheeky. It's doesn't make me laugh, or even giggle. It falls flat in every instance. The protagonists here are one-dimensional. This isn't what I want when I say female protagonists. I want female protagonists with depth, an interesting personality, and a valid reason for doing what they do. ""Let's save the world with the power of sicence lul"" doesn't count. It's insulting. -Oh boy, the BATTLING. Battling is many things. Battling is slow, unrewarding, trudging, and the worst part of the game. Maybe, possibly, it was because I was playing on the harder difficulty, but let's still go over every little thing that contributed to me wanting to throw my computer out the window in detail. First off, attacks will miss. A LOT. On both sides. Battles will drag on and on because neither side can land a hit on the other for possibly turns on end. Damage is always between two numbers, a low end and a high end. So when you finally do connect, you could do fifteen damage! Or you could do two. To get a higher low end, you have to level up a skill when you level up. However, that also increases the amount of SP you need to use the skill. It is ridiculous how much some of the higher level skills will costs. Upwards of 2/3 of your total SP. Items are finite. The only HP and SP restoring items you get are the ones you find on the map. There are no places to fully restore your health, except through level up. If you run out of SP, you have to defend to gain two back per turn (that character's ENTIRE turn) and an extra bonus one if everyone in the front row is defending. Characters in the back row do nothing, not even gain HP and SP back, unless they're brought into the front. Yet, they're still susceptible to attacks. Why? You can't attack their back row. Enemies will always have stronger attacks than you. Certain enemies will counterattack EVERY attack you throw at them, miss or not. Bosses are extreme damage sponges unless you've invested a lot into your attacks or exploit the system in very specific ways. It's impossible to tell how much of a chance you have to actually hit an enemy unless you raise your accuracy stat, but then you're wasting skill points. The amount of exp you need to get even past level 10 merits battles and battles of grinding even with the finisher moves. And you know what? Those aren't even guaranteed to hit. One character in particular, had a 9/25 success rate of hitting random battle enemies with her finisher. That's nearly a third. Yes, I counted. Strangely enough, in every boss encounter, she seemed to hit every single time. I am just. So worn out over this game. I didn't expect it to be great, but I figured it could be worth the time playing. It wasn't. Hardly any of the game was enjoyable to me, and if I was so tenacious in getting all the achievements, I wouldn't have bothered. Spare yourself the purchase. The people that made this have made much better games than this.			"
