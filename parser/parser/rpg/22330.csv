												Okay, where to start. I figured that there was no need for me to review this game as it is so successful, but, as always, All the Steam reviews on the front of the store page are one to two sentenced jokes instead of something actually helpful. Please thumbs-up this, if you like this review, for visibility.The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is the sequel to the critically acclaimed The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. Knowledge of prior storylines are not needed to enjoy Oblivion, though a working understanding of TES world lore will always enhance your experience in any of The Elder Scrolls games. A good idea is to just read some of the in-game books, from time to time, as you play the game. Some of the fictional books are amazing little detours from the game world. Oblivion and Morrowind are less fantasy experience and more-so a virtual world that you live in. With mods, this experience feels more real to me than some of the Dungeons and Dragons campaigns I've played. It's incredibly easy to get immersed into this work.Oblivion's main story leaves some to be desired. You are a prisoner who meets the Emperor (voiced by Patrick Stewart) and his guards as he flees a rumored assassination attempt through hidden tunnels in the Imperial City prison. Suffice it to say, that its' not really a spoiler that you witness the Emperor's assassination. Before the Emperor's death, he tells you that you are fated by the gods to save the Empire and ""close shut the jaws of Oblivion"". Long story short, you flee the tunnels and are sent to track down the Emperor's last remaining illegitimate heir (voiced by Sean Bean) as well as pretty much single-handedly repel the invasion of Daedra from Mehrunes Dagon’s hellish plane of Oblivion.However, in classic Elder Scrolls fashion, the main quest isn’t even the largest part of the game. The entire Imperial province of Cyrodiil is open to you for exploration. There are many guilds to join, whether or not you want to be a mercenary, a mage, a thief, an assassin, or a holy crusader. There is an abundance of miscellaneous side and freeform quests for you to do. I recommend the purchase of a strategy guide, not so that you’ll have a walkthrough, but because you’ll need some way to keep track of where everything is! There are many quests and areas that you will miss if you don’t scour the world for them. You can easily spend around 350 hours if you finish all of the main, side, and faction quests as well as the DLC. Many people just wander across the world, not even touching the main story.The mechanics have long been applauded as an improvement over Morrowind, level scaling aside. Morrowind offers a better story and atmosphere, while Oblivion offers a more modern experience. The graphics are a bit dated by today’s standards, but I still sometimes catch myself stunned by the beauty of Cyrodiil. Skills are a lot more streamlined than Morrowind, which I consider a negative trait, although it does make the game friendlier to newcomers. Combat is not as bad as so many people claim. To me, it really feels like I’m actually swinging the sword. The magic system is a lot simpler than Morrowind’s but a lot easier to use. It is not as good as Skyrim’s magic system, but still useful.The DLC The Knights of the Nine and The Shivering Isles far trump Oblivion’s main quest. Knights of the Nine puts on a holy crusade to fight against Umariil the Unfeathered, an ancient Ayleid elf who has come to try to enslave men once more. The Shivering Isles sends you to the frankly breathtaking realm of Sheogorath, the Daedric  “Mad God”. Most of the dialogue in The Shivering Isles will have you chuckling to yourself and smiling. And the atmosphere of the realm brings nostalgia from Morrowind to mind.Now, I am going to discuss mods. Oblivion’s modding scene is unparalleled by Morrowind or Skyrim. There are enormous overhaul mods, plenty of lore friendly stories, and enthralling and immersive stories and factions. You can even reach an added five or six hundred more hours if you play through some quality mods. Morroblivion, brings the entire landmass of the previous game, Morrowind, as well as all of it’s quests, items, NPCs, creatures, etc. You can then travel between the two provinces with your same character. Other mods add some of the other provinces from Tamriel. And a few mods have been so well rated that they’ve become known as unofficial expansion packs.Oblivion is an astounding RPG that will draw you in and stick with you for a long, long time. The replayability of Oblivion is excellent. The game was released eight years ago and I am still playing it to this day. You will not regret buying this game. Get the Deluxe pack for $25 that comes with all the DLC, themed player lairs, and, yes, even horse armor. It is well worth the price and you will get your money’s worth over and over again.			"

												I made a Khajit and he could punch stuff. I leveled up punching stuff, running places, and jumping to their maximum level but when I went to the arena I had trouble. I easily defeated my opponents by punching them until they could no longer stand up, then continuing to punch them as they lay bloody on the arena's dirt floor. I heard the crowd roaring as my fists crashed into the Grey Orc's skull; I felt their love wash over me like a crimson silk gown. Slowly, after the vampire scum gave out his last breath, I walked out of the arena. Not in triumph, not in victory, but in remorse. I had just punched my way through a dozen or more skulls, and for what? In my agony I gloomily set up at the The Bloated Float Inn, located in the Imperial City's Waterfront District. I woke up to the sounds of rustling, was confronted by a clearly beligerant bandit. The man had no idea I was the Arena Champion, he had not heard how I crushed the skulls of countless enemies with my punching, how I jumped clear over them with little effort, or even how I ran circles around the arena dodging every single attack thrown at me before pummeling my opponents into submission. The very idea of the man standing before me, a person unknowing of my athletic prowess, set me in to an uncontrollable rage. I don't recall what happened over then next ten minutes, but my memory picks back up again standing inside of the Inn owner's cabin covered head to toe in blood. I navigated back through the ship, which now more resembled a slaughter house, to try to find someone who could tell me what happened. Located in the messhall I found a naked shivering woman named Selene. I will never forget the look on her face when I approached her, a visage of fear so vivid the viewer can feel it. It was then I realized what event must had befallen the denizens of The Bloated Float Inn. The ingorance of that would-be bandit set me into a blood fueled rage. I slaughtered every person aboard the ship for his sin, that is, every person save for this trembling woman. I decided then and there to never use my fists again, I set off from the boat, WHICH HADN'T LEFT THE HARBOR, to embark on a pilgrimage. One that would encapsulate all nine divine shrines and eventually lead an unwilling khajit boxer to defeat the ancient Aylied king Umaril using only Talk good skill, run fast skill, and jump high skill. After defeating such an awesome foe I came to the conclusion that one need not fight with his fists to attain his goals. Through the use of hecka convincing words, speedy feet, and super strong legs, anyone can stamp out evil without ever lifting a finger.Oblivion taught me the greatest lesson of all, that fighting is evil.

												If you've just played Skyrim, then this is a much more 'Elder Scrolls-y' experience. It's not as pretty and some of the controls are odd, and yet it utterly trancends such things. If Skyrim's about exploring, Oblivion's about questing. The land is mostly just trees but the missions are much more varied and some are very well written. Especially for the Dark Brotherhood. This is one of the best deals on steam at any sale price. Thoroughly reccomended.			"

												Lets compare this game with skyrim.1. Does Skyrim have an arena that you can compete or gamble in? No.2. Does Skyrim let you make your own spells? No.3. Does Skyrim have a quest about finding stolen potatos? No.4. Does Skyrim have a portal that leads to a realm made of lava and fire? No.5. Does Skyrim have an entire dlc about a mad god who gives you cheese? No.6. ""Stop right there criminal scum!""Now get this game... And close shut the jaws of Oblivion.			"

												While people complain that the Elder Scroll games can be quite bland and you play an expressionless psychopath mass murdering your way to the top of society, Oblivion is a sterling example of one of my favourite things about PC gaming - mods.   I have hundreds from total conversions to one that adds little street cats that wander around looking cute.  Oblivion really captures the DIY aspect of PC gaming I love in a shiny giant studio package, allowing me to change almost anything i don't like about vanilla.  Unlike console people, to merely review and make judgements based on vanilla is to miss the beauty of PC gaming.  It's that kind of community that keeps an aging game fresh interesting and addictive.As far as the extras in the GOTY go, whether you care about player houses shapes much of  the DLC, Mehrune's Razor quest is a large dungeon, nothing mind blowing if you play with Lost Spires mod, but some very shiny loot.  The Knights of the Nine was a fairly straight-forward quest, would call it a good DLC rather than an expansion pack as such.  However although you have to seriously stab someone at the end, at least some of the quests have variety in what you have to do a bit.  However Shivering Isles makes this edition worth your money imo.  It adds some much needed oddness to the game, the kind of thing where you pause to think 'wtf is that?' as some creature shuffles or leaps towards you.  Without getting into the whole 'which elder scrolls is best', one thing i felt was Oblivion and Skyrim settled with standard pseudo-medieval europe fantasy world, whereas Morrowind felt quite alien, but with it's own culture to be read about and discovered.  Shivering Isles brings that to Oblivion.  The books are a delight, and it's nice to experience a daedric realm aside from the Deadlands (which while fun, never felt like a place people lived).  All in all and bearing in mind what i said about the still quite vital mod community, I totally recommend you buy this game.			"

												I've noticed that the reviews for Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim tend to be about why that game is the best Elder Scrolls game and the others are terrible in comparison. I really enjoy all three of them (sorry, Arena and Daggerfall, you're just not very enjoyable by today's standards), so I figured I'll give reviews for each that focus on what's unique about each of them, and what kind of players that will appeal to.Oblivion was my first Elder Scrolls game (and my first open-world RPG in general), so it has a special place in my heart. Anytime I hear that music come up when I launch the game, it brings back all sorts of emotions and wonderful feelings related to discovering a whole new type of game that I thoroughly enjoy. As good as the music in Morrowind was, Oblivion's music is even better for me (both are better than Skyrim's).For positives, let's start with Oblivion being the most deliberate of the three games. What I mean by that is that things are the most contained and orderly in Oblivion. You don't ""accidentally"" do anything in this game, as opposed to Morrowind and even Skyrim to a degree. Leveling up is slower in Oblivion, and so you don't race through anything. It gives you plenty of time to savor everything. You don't start a new game and find yourself pimped out with super powerful gear or spells a couple hours later. The landscape is also fairly contained, with each region and city being unique in its own right, while not having any drastic changes. The most extreme the landscape gets (besides when you are transported to the hellish realm of Oblivion or the DLC that sends you to the Shivering Isles) is some snowy mountains in the north. And for this game, that works perfectly. You are in Cyrodiil, the center of the empire, and therefore the most refined. The somewhat subdued landscape fits into that perfectly. Compared to Morrowind and Skyrim, this game world is neat, orderly, and prim and proper. It makes you form an emotional attachment to the game, since you focus less on the landscape and more on people and feelings, while still enjoying beautiful scenery. And when you get to the Shivering Isles DLC, you're well versed in forming those emotional attachments, while now having some very bizarre and magnificent scenery to add to your playing experience.The biggest positive of Oblivion (for me) is one of the most pleasant surprises in the entire series. My single favorite thing in any TES game is what would seem to be some relatively minor DLC from this game. There are four distinct castles, lairs, caves, and towers available through the DLC. Each is geared towards a specific playstyle (warrior, assassin, thief, mage). There are all sorts of things available for each, and some questlines regarding them. I find myself spending a lot of time doing those quests and getting enough money to afford the upgrades, some of which are incredibly useful (alchemy ingredient gardens, a pirate crew that goes out and plunders for you every week, a dark shrine to Sithis that grants you potent powers based on your infamy, etc.). There are also unique items in each. Basically, they are the greatest player homes in any TES game, and they're official content, not mods. For the negatives of this game, we will actually revisit some of the positives I mentioned. It's slower than the others, which can sometimes make you feel bogged down. It's polished, nice, and orderly, but sometimes you want something more wild and rugged. Think of it as the difference between living in a nice suburb and living in a cabin in the Rocky Mountains.  There's not really anything wrong with this game, but it always stays in the safe zone. There are no glaring errors, but its peak is lower than the other games. Basically, Oblivion is content with always hitting singles or doubles, so that means that there are no strikeouts, but also no homeruns. Oblivion will disappoint you the least often of any of the three games, but also won't take your breath away like Morrowind or Skyrim does occasionally.			"

												Bam. You're a prisoner. Then what? Oh, its just PICARD TELLING YOU YOU'RE IN HIS DREAMS. SECRET. PASSAGE. HE DIES (OH NOES) TAKE THIS SEXY AMULET. GET OUT OF THE SEWERS. EXPLORE FOR 100+ HOURS.Well, you can already tell this game will be incredible. But seriously, this game starts off very strong. You're a prisoner, with your crimes unknown to you. As long as you don't abuse the character creator (hehe...) you'll be able to mold your ideal elf, human, or orc... or cat... or lizard. But yes, many great awesome things happen in the first few minutes within the game. You may think the game is linear... until you exit that sewer. ""Can I go anywhere?"" ""Can I follow this road?"" ""I want that horse. Can I steal it?"" The answer to all this is a glorious ""yes"". Oblivion is at it's best when you're wondering along the vast land of Cyrodiil, exploring multiple dungeons, mines, and towns. Oblivion is outdated, but still pulls you into the world.Quests are great. Some surpass Skyrim's as far as story goes. (The Thieves’ Guild quest line is so much better.) There are both your typical quests with markers, and a well mix of a few. Ranging from some puzzle solving, to even being a detective, it'll keep you entertained. Help out a town by shutting down an Oblivion Gate (which furthers the main story), and now you can buy a house there, and buy upgrades for it, just for playing the main quest. Kill an innocent person, and have a very unique visitor appear, and follow a very dark path. Either way you'll be getting into all sorts of crazy situations, and it'll be a delight. Gameplay is more complex than Skyrim, yet not quite like Morrowind's. I consider it a perfect balance, as its tough, but very rewarding. If you're a weakling, maybe you shouldn't steal that horse just yet. Oblivion in a way pushes you to a certain type of major, as if you’re taking college classes. Keep shooting that bow, and you'll advance specially in that skill set, and use your experience to further develop this. But if you pull out a sword after not using it for three levels, well you might want to rethink what you're doing. It’s not hard, but the game defiantly wants to pick one type of combat and stick with it. This is fine to me, as I love dedicating my character to a specific type of combat. If I want to be good with a sword, and have some good magical ability as a side dish, I can do that. It'll just take time.This game probably has the greatest DLC ever. The horse armor has so much value... well not really THAT specific DLC, but Shivering Isles is a MUST HAVE. You're getting another free game when you purchase this. Knights of the Nine is harder to get access to due to the slow leveling progress, but is also pretty great. Get GOTYDeluxe, its worth the extra $5, you penny pincher. Mods, mods everywhere as well. There are some greats ones. In fact, this game taught me how to mod. I might of ruined my first save file(s) tough doing that, so be warned; there's no silky Steam Workshop bed waiting for you upstairs. You must use either your brain, or a Mod Manager application. For those complaining that it isn't working on Windows 7; The Steam (digital) version seems to work fine, and there's a mod called ""Unofficial Oblivion Patch"" which solves many conflicts and errors, and is stupidly simple to install. Get the latest version patched for your game as well. In fact, before even launching the game, you might want to do all these things I've mentioned. Also have the latest video drivers installed (derp).Oblivion may be old, but you shouldn't stick your nose up at it. It's great, and will always be great.			"

												When I was 8 years old, my dad pre ordered the original oblivion on Xbox 360 for me. At the time I knew nothing about the game, he just thought it would be fun for me to play as a knight ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ up doing hoodrat elder scrolls stuff. I had never played morrowind or daggerfall, but the second I made my character I was hooked. I played oblivion religiously, collecting the official game guide, multiple physical maps of tamriel, and I even kept journals of all of my quests and wrote in the first person as my character. I would then go to school and share these journals with my friends who also had the game and who also wrote their own adventures down. It became a sort of 'guild' group if you will.Time went on and Skyrim came out in 2011 when I was in junior high, thus causing me to forget about oblivion and move on as the dragonborn. But just recently I was going through some of my closets getting rid of old junk I had been hoarding, and I came across a stack of about fifteen books hidden underneath some blankets and boxes. They were my oblivion journals. Frantically I plugged in my xbox, located the game, and fired that ♥♥♥♥ up. My heart sunk when I realized the disk had been scratched long ago. So I went on to steam and saw that the game of the year adition was available for a rather cheap price. When I was younger I never even knew about the DLC because I was so lost in exploring and creating my own stories for my character.Today, as an 18 year old, getting ready to move out of my house, I can tell you that the extensive world of Oblivion is much bigger than I ever remembered it to be.And to this day, the music that plays when I  treck across the land still brings joy to my heart. Please play this game and download it's DLC. It is a near perfect gaming experience filled with lor and action. 100/10 would be an elementary school dweeb because of this game again.			"

												Ah, Oblivion. What can I say about this amazing game that hasn't already been said? Now you may be wondering, ""Why is this guy writing a review when he doesn't even have 10 hours?"" I have played well over 400 hours of the game on my Xbox 360. If you started the Elder Scrolls with Skyrim, Oblivion and Morrowind may be hard to get used to. Pros-Okay graphics, considering the time it was released-Great story-Awesome spell crafting feature, and swordplay-Mods!-MUCH easier to learn and get into compared to MorrowindCons-Ugly characters-Some glitches Bethesda never patched-Oblivion gates can sometimes be confusingOverall, Oblivion is a great game, and I would reccomend it for anyone who wants to play an Elder Scrolls game. Personally, I never liked Morrowind (I own the GOTY edition on disc) but I played the ♥♥♥♥ out of this one. Mods have added tons of replayability to this game, and they have kept me hooked to this day. Thank you for reading my review, and have a nice day,			"

												So, I bought Skyrim during a sale, played it the rest of the week, loved it. After much more hours, wanted to check out Oblivion, because I couln't get enough of the great series. I have 10 reasons for buying this piece of art:1/10: Get jumpscared by kahjiit who was hiding in a bush2/10: Disarm a deadra while having a sword duel and watch him run downhill chasing his fallen mace3/10: (almost) no racist people4/10: You can wield a sword and shield and heal yourself with a spell without the need of switching5/10: The game counts the amount of jokes you have made6/10: Epic battles in the sky above a giant wheel (the imperial city)7/10: You can actually place objects in your house wich you can move somewhat normal, and they don't teleport back when you leave8/10: Freedom as a mage to spell your own way (well except for some arts then)9/10: Get jumpscared by a village of invisible people10/10: THE. GUARDS. ARE. NOT. COMPLETE. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S.Anyway, if you loved Skyrim, you will love Oblivion, and probably even more. The slightly older graphics might be a setback for some, but after a while you feel perfectly comfortable with them. Just let your wallet fly to your pc and dive into hours of dungeons, cities, sigil keeps and joke-telling.			"

												First of all, if your question is ""Should I buy this game, period?"", my answer is simply: Yes.If your question is ""Should I buy this game, or skyrim?"" the answer's a bit more complex. I would not say either one is better, but they're two different tastes, like vanilla and chocolate.In this case, I would say Oblivion is the vanilla. If you're looking for a straight-up, classic medieval fantasy, Oblivion might be more your thing than Skyrim, which is ""themed"" around the viking-style Nords. Likewise, Oblivion has the default fantasy setting of castles and forests and rolling green plains, where Skyrim is, again, Nordic themed, and focused mostly on mountains and snow.Because of that, and some differences in art styles, Skyrim and Oblivion look very different, to the point where I would almost say that might be the deciding factor in which game is right for you. Skyrim is very much a modern game, with fairly realistic art, and that includes the recent trend of realistic games to be primarily brown and gray. Oblivion, on the other hand, is vibrant and colorful, and perhaps a bit stylized. If you are longing for a colorful first person fantasy game, Oblivion is for you (if you're looking for a sidescroller, I'd recommend Trine). If you've been wading through the Real-Is-Brown trend, the sheer vibrance of Oblivion can be a real breath of fresh air.As for gameplay, the two games are relatively similar. I personally prefer the spellcasting setup in Oblivion over that in Skyrim - in Oblivion, you equip spells in their own slot, rather than in a hand (which could instead be holding a weapon), whereas Skyrim just treats spells like a sword that has to be put in one of your hands. Speaking of which, you cannot dual wield in this game. If you want to play a classic sword-and-shield knight, this particular difference in mechanics is more or less irrelevant, except that it's easier in Oblivion to cast the occasional healing spell.Furthermore, Oblivion offers a much greater degree of freedom in spellcasting than Skyrim. You can create your own spells by adding effects and designating whether the spell is a projectile, area of effect, etc. Enchanting and Alchemy are slightly more complex than in Skyrim, as well. If you like playing spellcasters, I'd say Oblivion is probably a better choice than Skyrim, which has you simply pick from pre-determined spells, and has a far more limited alchemy and enchanting system.The biggest mechanical difference is the level up system. Without a doubt, Skyrim's level up system is more user friendly and intuitive. It might be a little more friendly to those who want to play these games casually, where Oblivion requires a little more care, planning, and effort. In Skyrim, you level up your skills as you use them, and after you've increased any combination of skills by a certain amount, you can go up a character level (on the spot, even). When you do, you increase one of your three stats (yes, only three: health, mana, stamina), and pick a talent tree to put a talent point in, which gives you bonuses - with different talent slots unlocking as you raise the respective skill. In Oblivion it is completely different. For one thing, you have several stats, each tied to three skills. The number of times you level any combination of skills attached to a given stat affects how much you could POTENTIALLY increase that stat by when you level up (and if you dont' get those +5s, you will find that the game swiftly outlevels you). By the way, you only level up when you raise ten points in any combination of your class's seven major skills, and only when you sleep. Skyrim has no classes, and therefore no major skills. This makes Skyrim's character-building system a little bit more freeform, as you can, if you want, change directions as you go, if you decide you don't like a particular aspect. Oblivion allows you to create a custom class, but you're basically stuck with that choice after you finish the tutorial.In short, Skyrim has a simpler, more intuitive, more fluid leveling dynamic, good for building your character as you go according to what feels natural, while Oblivion might be better for those who like to plan or min-max, and requires a bit more thinking ahead.I should also mention that on certain computer systems, the music in this game may not work. It certainly doesn't work on my system, but otherwise the game runs just fine. From what I understand this is an issue with the CODECs and may be related to Windows 7.One other thing I think is important to mention is that this game, despite being a fantasy, is surprisingly arachniphobe friendly. As someone with arachniphobia, I find it hard to deal with how ubiquitous giant spiders are in fantasy games. Skyrim's spiders are particularly horrifying. But Oblivion has no (true) spiders at all. It does have the Spider Daedra, which are essentially spider-centaurs, but I didn't find them particularly phobia-triggering. They're also very rare outside of the oblivion gates, so you won't often find yourself being jumped by one unexpectedly. If you are an arachniphobe looking for a fantasy game, I HIGHLY recommend Oblivion, especially if you're comparing it to Skyrim.Also, this game has Martin Septim.That's reason enough to buy it.			"

												Oblivion, in my opinion, is the best game of all time. It gets a bad reputation among fans of other elder scrolls games, you see the argument that Morrowind is the game for patient players that can enjoy an older game, and skyrim is this big new awesome RPG, and so Oblivion is seen as some weird spot in the middle of the two. Yet I repeat, oblivion is the best game I have ever played. Many Morrowind players dislike Oblivion with the argument that it is less inclusive and immersive than Morrowind. But then why is Skyrim the only game on par with Morrowind? Skyrim, the game with less weapon types, the game with the worst alchemy, the game with the worst magic? Skyrim's graphics barely surpass the incredibly captured beauty of Cyrodil, and they had five years to make skyrim. They had four to make Oblivion, and your blind grandma could easily tell the difference between that and Morrowind graphically. The gameplay was also a complete overhaul from morrowind to oblivion. People talk about how Morrowind's or Skyrim's fighting systems are so much better, with Morrowind's realistic feel that you have to be good with the weapon type or you will be awful, or with skyrim's realistic feeling combat but Oblivion completely build anew the combat system of morrowind, made it insanely more realistic, and remains the only game in the series that you can have a sword, shield, and spell at the same time. From Morrowind to skyrim each game got easier. Morrowind is the most difficult of the three, with no quest markers on a compass, and no advice or help whatsoever. But when I went to play skyrim it was the easiest thing in the world. Anyone can take a nord with a battleaxe and beat the game. Oblivion is in the middle. Oblivion isn't like the insane difficulty of morrowind, showing how hard each quest would be were you actually to do it in real life and record the words that someone said to find a secret location. Oblivion helps you, but is not easy. The game has an easier start, but if you can remain powerful past level 30, that's when you know you're good. Skyrim is just always easy. Progress through oblivion is kind of like progress through life. The lower your level, the less you have to worry. But as you grow into the game it takes constant effort and maintenance to remain successful. In oblivion you have to have a gameplan. Will you be a thief that goes around and gets rich to make sure they have the best equipment in the game, and talks your way out of hard situations? Will you be the the brute warrior that relies on lots of stamina and power to take down less physically gifted enemies? Or will you be my personal favorite, the mage that can go about every situation in a million different ways? Sure, you can mesh these things to any degree, but the point is that if you don't go about it correctly with skills that make sense together or you use the wrong race, you won't be successful later on.You could go on forever about the systems in place in oblivion that make it unique and amazing but Oblivion is the game that revolutionizes combat and especially graphics (Oblivion had some of the best graphics the world had ever seen, and was made on such a large scale that's almost an unimaginable feat) but sticks true to the elder scrolls mentality. Skyrim is a game to pull people into the franchise. Skyrim is the start of a new generation, a worse generation, of TES players. Oblivion is the peak in the series.			"

												What can I say about Oblivion. I was gifted the game when it came out on the Xbox 360. And after that, I continued to play it till I gave the game to my girlfriend 6 years later and bought the GOTY version on PC, which I'm playing at this moment. I have a lot more hours on PC Skyrim simply because I thought it would be better.  I was wrong. I'm now adding to my collection of inhuman hours of Xbox 360 Oblivion.  Don't get me wrong, dear Skyrim fanboy. It IS a great game, with amazing atmosphere and graphics. It one-ups Oblivion on graphics, since it's 4 years younger. But when it comes to atmosphere, Skyrim might as well be a cardboard box. Here's why:  Oblivion's soundtrack is rich and beautiful, unlike Skyrim's flat ""Dovahkiin"" ""Badass"" default track every time you get in a battle.  Skyrim's main questline is almost nessisary, since it contains the Shouts that are so very fun to use. Oblivion's main questline, however, is lots of fun, and optional. You'll miss out on items, but you'll never be lacking in a critical game ability that was the gimick of the entire launch.  Skyrim is flat and snowy, with SOME differences around the eastern and southwest parts of the map. And when you are in those green areas, it still feels like it's about to freeze over. Oblivion has snow, beautiful snow in fact, but it's SO diversive in the enviorment section. Beaches, forests, mountains, valleys, rivers, lakes, ponds, actual Oblivion, it's all amazing. And the colors are so vivid, with reds and greens and yellows and blues and OH GOD ITS GREAT.  When you fight a bandit in Skyrim, you're swinging a pool noodle at a mural. When you fight a bandit in Oblivion, it's head will twist to the left when you deliver the final blow with your Elven Mace, it's body crumpling to the ground, ready to plunder ( and sometimes teabag ). No silly spinning death animations that need a mod to disable like I have, just ragdoll. Like real life.  All in all, Oblivion is ahead of it's days. It was an improvement to Skyrim in the atmosphere department, not graphics. I LOVE Skyrim for all of her faults ( one of my favorite gaming moments of all time were my first 2 hours in the Forgotten Vale, absolutely breathtaking ) but Oblivion takes the cake. Morrowind? That's a different story. Totally different subject. I don't have much experience with the game honestly, so I can't effectively make a decision over who wins in the entire trilogy. And yeah, it's a trilogy. ( EDIT, I know Elder Scrolls isn't a trilogy. I was tired and wrote this half-arsed. Stop commenting on it :) ) ESO sucks ♥♥♥♥. I said it.  Buy this game, with the DLC. It ain't no map pack, it's two seperate and amazing questlines. Just buy the game. Right now.			"

												I love this game. I love the atmosphere. I love the Sidequests. I love the main quest. I love the ARENA!! (which was absent in Skyrim) I love the cities, especially Anvil. I love the fact that there were only like 13 voice actors for the entire game. I love that there seemed to be 2 voice actors for 1 person sometimes. you can be talking to a beggar and he will weakly say  ""I can eat for a whole week with just a single coin."" so you give him a coin. And he he will boomingly say ""BLESSINGS OF AKATOSH UPONG YE!!"" in a completely different tone that makes it sound like a different voice actor. I love wedging myelf between a bookshelf and the ceiling and jumping nonstop for a good 30 minutes to raise my acrobatics. I love murdering the adoring fan at the top of that one mountain or just leaving him standing out in the middle of nowhere and leaving him there for days. I love how when you walk into different buildings it actually felt like you were in a different place(every building in Skyrim felt the same to me) I love the persuation wheel thing that changes the NPCs facial expression. I love randomly exploring the world at times with no point or destination. I love how you can spend hours, and hours, and hours, and hours, and hours trying to level up your mercantilism by just 3 points. I love delving into bottomless caves and ruins just to find someones lost sword. I love hearing the sound of goblins getting wrecked by a longsword. I love jumping on top of roofs and shooting an almost endless supply of guards. I love the lockpicking.I love talking to Ma'iq the Liar outside Leyawiin and trying to keep up with him as he runs off. I love, love, LOVE the soundtrack. In fact I love the soundtrack to this game so much that I use part of one of the songs as the ringtone to my phone. I love finding that one enchanted glass helmet of the coast near Anvil. I love this game. And you should love it too. I dont have many hours on it on steam but I put over 500 hours on this game when I was a but a young teen on the PS3. Do yourself a favor and buy this game.			"

												The first time I played Oblivion, I hated it. I thought it had the worst character models of all time, and the combat took too long and felt unnecessarily difficult, I immediately developed the opinion that Skyrim was the best game in every regard. That was probably one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made concerning a video game. The thing about oblivion that makes it the polar opposite of Skyrim is that, the more you play Oblivion, the better it gets. Meanwhile Skyrim is magical at first, and then progressively gets way too easy and tedious. So heres why you need to play Oblivion in 2016:1) The combatAs mentioned antecedently, Oblivion combat system is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at first, but then, very similarly to Morrowind, you feel yourself getting progressively more powerful. You start as someone less dangerous than a native american toddler with cerebral palsy, but turn into one of the most epic warriors on the face of Tamriel. It also requires more skill, you need to strafe and blocking actually consistently makes a difference in who falls first in an engagement. Although there are no fancy decapitation animations, it still rewards more of a sense of completion, since you know that you have to be powerful to slay this person or creature.2) The StoryOblivions many storylines, particulary the Dark Brotherhoods, blow skyrim out of the water. The characters have so much more depth than, ""I came from X and I'm gonna hostile to you now but after one ♥♥♥♥ing quest I'm gonna worship the ground you walk on"" They will start to like you more after every few assassinations, depending on how well you perform them, and when its done, you wont just be their favorite warrior, you will be their leader. Same with the main quest, rather than just running around dungeon to dungeon, killing the draugr ""boss"" at the end. There are many different types of quests within the main storyline, and honestly it feels like a complete movie at a certain point.3) The questsYou know whats better than having to go into a tunnel fight the draugr minions, fix a puzzle with the directions right in front of you, and have it be the same puzzle every time? EVERYTHING is the answer to that. Oblivion has such a vast arsenal of different variations of quests that it can throw at you, poisoning someones food, chasing a unicorn, etc4) The worldThe final point I'm going to rant about is that the world of Oblivion is more interesting than Skyrims in almost every regard. The people have their own conversations, and the game somehow manages to give personality to all of the random conversations as well. For example, when a nord and an imperial had a conversation, the imperial said, ""those nords sure are hostile"" and he immediately said goodbye. That sort of discomfort in the face of racism adds so much personality and says alot about the world itself, and the bigotry is hurled in every direction from every direction. It also, despite a weaker engine, still looks prettier, due to its bright colors rather than white and brown. BY AZURA BY AZURA BY AZURA			"

-Quick Review-The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is a massive open world game developed by Bethesda and released March 20, 2006. It would take too long to list all the various quests, armor, weapons, enchantments, and magic spells you can learn/create, simply trust me when I say this game is an adventure waiting to happen.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: This is probably one of my personal favorite parts of Elder Scrolls of Oblivion, once you get out of the starting area you can make your own story, or follow the main story, or go search for your own quest. If you wanted, you could become a villain, you could also become a hero. The choices are completely up to you.The whole Elder Scrolls series is very rich is lore and diversity of environment, you can read in-game books and learn useful facts about the monsters you fight. Not everyone will do this, but I ended up learning what all Trolls are weak against, and I've been using it in all Elder Scrolls games since.I won't say much more about the story, because most of the fun is in finding the quests and stories yourself, and of course forging your own tale.... however there is one additional thing to note, in the Game of the Year Edition you get the Shivering Isles Expansion, and there you meet my favorite character in the whole series.Game Play: You can control the camera to play in third person, or first person. (personally I always thought third person looked silly... the knee's bend funny, and when you jump your legs stay straight. seems like an indication of ""play in first person"").You could be a necromancer and summon skeleton hoards, you could be a thief and sneak into combat, you could be a warrior and smash your enemies faces in, you can be a mage and even create your own skills, you can be a ranger and pew pew, a monk, an acrobat or any hybrid combination of what I've said and much much more.Achievements: There are no Steam Achievements in this game, you can certainly find plenty of challenges online to test your skill in the game, or simply increase the difficulty of the game.Price The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Game of the Year Edition is priced at $19.99, as always, I suggest you wait for a sale, but if you already know you like this style of game you won't lose money out of it, since the game is getting ""old"" *cough cough cough* you should probably look for a good deal out of the game, it goes on sale often.Conclusion: This was the first Open world game I ever played, I absolutely loved it, and I still remember the fun I had playing the game. The stories/quests are very memorable and the game play was dynamic and very fluid. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open world or RPG's.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update March 18, 2015:I redid my review for Oblivion, thereby normalizing it into the framework I do for all my reviews. (No one ever read the old review anyway, you're not missing anything)Update June 23, 2015:Corrected release date from 2007, to 2006.Update September 14, 2015:Here's the URL to see my review for  Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (Including links for Skyrim DLC reviews!)

												I played Skyrim before Oblivion, but still feels Oblivion has much to impress me.After I saved Kvatch, people started calling me ""Hero of Kvatch"".After the Bruma Battle, a statue of my character was built beside the city gate, which was generated based on my weapon and armors instead of using a pre-set one.After the main quest line, all the guards hail me as Champion of Cyrodill when I pass by.After I became head of a guild, I recieve unique benefits like a real man in charge.After I became Grand Champion of the Arena, there is an adoring fan who wants to worship the ground I walk.All these details make me feel like that I am really living in the world and making a difference. I am really changing my place in the age of chaos through hard battle and honest work.Instead, in Skyrim, guards still call me a sneak thief after I saved Skyrim from dragons. Nobody on Solstheim recognizes me even after I saved their asses from Miraak. I helped a Jarl to reclaim his throne but all I got afterwards is ""You are not as dumb as you look"".Bethesda, WTF?============================================================pros:+Not bad graphic as a game in 2006. +Despite some strange looking NPCs and their strange chit-chats, Cyrodill is a much better place than Skyrim, considering climate, city scale, politeness of the guards, etc.+The Woold Elves are so cute.+The Shocking Oblivion Gates.+Elder Scrolls music never fails to impress.+Magic crafting. College of Winterhold looks like a bunch of rookies in comparison.+Newspaper about the quests you have done. I don't know why they cancel this in Skyrim.+Shivering Isle is really something you should not miss.cons:-Bug. Bug never changes.-Poor motion design. Takes some getting used to.-Awkward NPC chatting systems. Mother and daughter greet each other like strangers, have some random talk, say goodbye, and then immediately greet each other again.-Useless followers.-Dungeons are like f**king labyrinths and have little to offer other than common monsters and meaningless random loots. No related quests. No background info.  I can see why Bethesda hired experienced level designers to construct dungeons in Skyrim.-It ruined my life like Skyrim did.			"

												My favorite game of all time!!!I remember going over to my friends house when I was a young man and he had this game called Oblivion on his xbox. I didn't know anything of the game but one day we decided to start it up. Choosing my race and fine tuning my character was something new to me and blew me away. Then the game continued with the dark elf mocking me from my prison cell.At that moment I was hooked and bought it for myself the next day for Xbox and then a year later for pc. It was the first game I modded and I closed every gate and explored every crevice of the map. I have spend thousands of hours on this game on the non steam edition and will play this game off and on until the day I die. I am a die hard fan of this edition into the series and no other game has ever lived up to this. You exit the sewers and the whole world is open to you, it is your destiny and you can play how you want. All enemies scale to you so you can go anywhere on the map. North east south west it does not matter forge your own journey the game allows you to role play to the max being who you want to be.My all time favorite game gets an 11/10 and will always be the best game in the series in my heart and I hope you can get the same expirenced as I have.

												Okay,So as a person who started off in the Elder Scrolls series at the game Skyrim, oblivion never really appealed to me. It looked so outdated, i couldnt stand the graphics, and having briefly watched people play it in the past it didnt look like it could ever compete with a game that holds such a great magnitude as Skyrim. I am happy to say that i was completely ignorant for thinking that and Skyrim will be collecting dust for a while. So my friend gifted me this and i started playing, the first few hours were like meh, not sure what to think. As i explored more of oblivion and got into the main quest and starting seeing the guilds, the mechanics in this game and the depth surpass skyrim in literally all aspects.. And ive only been playing for around 3 days now and already clocked in 20+ hours. The amound of lore, the unbelievablely deep quests and the characters that you remember. Its absolutely mesmorizing. To think of the age of this game and the fact that im just starting now, in 2016, to get into oblivion i dont even know what to say. This game is the best rpg ive ever played in my life. It keeps the player interested as i continue through the game and keep wanting to learn more and oblivion actually makes you want to learn more about the lore behind the elder scrolls. It has inspired me to eventually buy morrowind as ive become so interested in the lore behind the elder scrolls because of this game. It feels so much more authentic than skyrim. I enjoy the combat so much more. And it is so much more immersive than skyrim wil ever be. And i only have very few mods for the game. The exploration aspect of the game is so much more rewarding than skyrim's and you actually have to put in a lot of work to become even somewhat powerful. This game is a committment and makes you work your ♥♥♥ off for the things that you want. So anyone who plays the hell out of skyrim and thinks its the best RPG. I dont care what year it is, put that game down and give this one a try. You wont regret it.			"

OverviewThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is the fourth installment of the series and one of the most known and loved fantasy RPG in gaming. Released in 2006 by Bethesda, the game is still very played to this day, and has a very active modding community, which is a testament of the life-span of a great game. Embark on a journey full of lore, quests and dungeon explorations in this masterpiece of a game.The Pros
Enticing Gameplay - Oblivion is a game that really nails it when it comes to gameplay. You always find some new quest to do or a new dungeon to explore, people to gossip, barter or fight with. The large, open map provides many opportunities to explore and create your own adventure. Even if you already completed the game and know the majority of quests, it’s still fun to replay them. The quests are very well done, and much more diverse than one might expect, primarily due to the rich backstory they provide.Long Completion Time - Don’t worry about running out of things to do. There are over 200 quests and 400 locations to discover, explore and loot. Not to mention this is a Role-Playing Game. You can have multiple playthroughs, each with it’s own different approach on what and who you are, how you attack, and how you respond at moral decisions in quests.Beautiful Soundtrack - This game has, in my opinion, the best soundtrack in the history of gaming. The music is very well made for each situation. It is relaxing when wandering, thrilling when in battle. Jeremy Soule really hit the nail on its head on this one. Modding - Head on over to Oblivion Nexus to download and install a few of thousands of available mods, that fix most if not all problems vanilla oblivion has. Bug fixes, texture enhancements, ENBs, UI redesigns, quest mods, item mods, gameplay tweaks, and so much more are being offered by the modding community. This is one of Oblivions strongest points, and will definitely make the game several times more enjoyable. Just make sure you take your time to research, download and organise them before you start playing. Expansion Packs - We all know the famous “Horse Armor” DLC fiasco, but let’s not get in the way of its actual expansion packs, namely Knights of the Nine and The Shivering Isles. The latter is considered one of the best expansion packs that were ever released, and comes included in the Game of the Year version on Steam. It adds lots of new content, including maps, items, quests, characters and  gameplay elements.The Cons
Vanilla Version - This is just informing you that the vanilla game you get when you first download it is a bit underselling. The graphics are outdated(Duh! 2006 game) and there are quite a few (hundred) small bugs and other inconsistencies that may occur during gameplay, the faces of characters look… well, hideously ugly in some cases. All of these problems and many more are easily fixed with a few tweaks and mods and you can enjoy a better, prettier, and more stable version by installing them. There are loads of bits and pieces I could write long rants about, but there’s a mod for all of them, so I won’t bother. I will concentrate only on the things inherently bad about the game that cannot be fixed (in most cases)Voice Casting - Given that Patrik Steward voiced about 5 minutes of emperor Uriel’s lines, the budget was already out the window, so we are left with about… a few handfuls of voice actors, each representing their race. This makes it a little weird having every member of a gender and race sound the same, with a few exceptions. Albeit, in order to do this, each actor recorded the entirety of the dialogues, even ones that would never be used by their characters, for safe-proofing. A lot of work to be admired, however the problem of little to no diversity between characters’ voices is a little disappointing. Which isn’t to say they sound awful. The sound quality is good and the actors are talented. It’s just that everything sounds the same. Also, you may encounter beggars that change voices radically between different topics.Totalitarian Crime System - There is a running gag of the telepathic guards that roam Oblivion in search for you. Doing any murder, even in complete and utter stealth, even in the most devoid of any witnesses location, that crime will be recorded, a bounty will be placed on your head, and sometimes guards might leave the cities in search for you and they know exactly where you are. Not only this, but touching items is a crime. You are a guest in someone’s home. You see a misplaced fork on the table and just want to nudge it a bit to align it with the plate. Yup, you are going to be arrested. Or say you broke in someone’s house late at night, and you steal an apple. That apple is now known throughout the entire province of Cyrodill as being stolen and cannot be sold to anyone but thief guild fences. You can come to a merchant with 20 apples, but he will specifically know that only 18 of them are righteously yours. You can’t sell the other two. How!? Why!?Uneven Leveling System - (fixable by mods) The world seems to be leveling with you, which seems stupid. By about level 20, every common bandit you find will be equipped with the best grade weapons and armor, which breaks the immersion and unbalances the game. Also, attaining the perfect character (max stats) requires a deep understanding of the leveling system and painstakingly much micro-management.ConclusionIt may seem the cons list is longer, but trust me, this game is amazing. It is one of my favorite games of all time, and have been rocking a lot more hours before I got it on Steam. If you like RPGs, then this is a must have. I recommend it with all my heart. Be sure to mod it and to try to find everything there is to do in it.

												I would recomment it to anyone who likes a smooth but adventurous and easy RPG game. It gives many details about the world you are playing in and a great map to explore, many options to develop your character and many different quests to occupy yourself. Its graphics are quite good and the story can keep your interest. I love this game...			"

												A definite must-buy for a fan of The Elder Scrolls series. ""Ermagerd Skyrim is better Oblivion sucks cus graphics!!!11! You're just an Oblivion fanboy!11!!!"". Well no.I first started playing The Elder Scrolls series a few years back, when Skyrim first came out because of all the hype. Reason why it shows a ridiculously low number of Skyrim playtime hours on my Steam profile would be that I didn't get the Steam version as I didn't have a Steam account then. I finished the entire main storyline, finished all the DLC, 90% of all sidequests and explored almost 80% of the dungeons in Skyrim.Now, I only got Oblivion after much insistence by a few of my friends. At first, I was very turned off by the bad graphics and  combat system. I compared it a lot with Skyrim, but I tried to look past the graphics. It was then I got really surprised. Funnily enough, after playing Oblivion for awhile, I like it better than Skyrim. I appreciate and get attached to the characters in Oblivion more than the characters in Skyrim. Maybe it's because the character development in Skyrim pale in comparison? Or maybe it is because they hardly (almost never) kill off companions in Skyrim. In Oblivion, a lot of the main characters of the side quests  even the main quest  get killed off, and you cannot simply ressurect them using console  like if you accidentally kill off Lydia in Skyrim. Face it, everyone does that , because their death is crucial in that plot. I like the change of pace in Oblivion compared to the rest of the games I have played so far, because you are not the main hero here. You are just a Blade, assisting the next Emperor to take over the throne and stop Mehrunes Dagon. You do not get to do the final blow to the villian, you do not get to be ""hero"" at the end of the main storyline. Because someone else close to you will do it for you. And trust me, you will get this feeling of emptiness for a very long time after that.The soundtrack is really beautiful here, although it may make you feel lonely especially when you are exploring the wilderness. The horses actually make a satisfying galloping sound, although they are not as ridiculous in climbing vertical walls.If one were to compare Skyrim and Oblivion, I would say they are both incomparable. It's like comparing an apple and an orange. They are similar, but you cannot directly compare them both. If you are looking for something different, and something more story-based, and a f*ck ton of plot twists, go for Oblivion. But if you are more of the graphics, modern-day sandbox game which follows a linear plot, go for Skyrim instead. Overall, I enjoy this installment, will definitely put in more hours in this game.

												Stop right there criminal scum! Oblivion needs you!--WARNING--Make sure you buy the GoTY DELUXE version of the game - if you don't, you'll miss out on all of the smaller DLC, as they are not sold seperately and cannot be purchased afterwards!EDIT:If you're looking for better graphics, check out Oblivion Reloaded @ Nexusmods, link here: http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/45749/?Oblivion Reloaded replaces previous versions of OBGE and overall is more power and efficient than alternatives (possibly even ENB).So yep, the game is still being modded.--Reviewing Oblivion is a little tricky for me because I've had it for years. Many, many years. I've literally had it since sometime during good ol' 2007. Thousands of hours easily poured into the none-steam version of the game, and time I do not regret putting into the game.It was, simply put, a centrepiece to the later years of my childhood. I enjoyed it so much I bought it on Steam too, so in case I ever lose any of the disks for whatever reason, I've got the steam version as a backup.So beyond countless hours playing the game, I've also got another issue. Mods. One really should not review a game on the basis of what users have created out of it -- even if modding is a huge aspect of the game -- but I do have some difficulty doing so accurately doing so, so you may have to bare with me.Gameplay:Oblivion had unique gameplay. For someone who had never played anything like it, Oblivion was something above and beyond anything I'd ever played. To this day, Oblivion has a number of unique gameplay features that aren't present in, say, Skyrim. I'll give some big differences below.- An attribute system. Each attribute governs a number of different skills and has a number of affects. Attributes such as Endurance, Agility, Intelligence and so on. For many players such as myself, these attributes add something extra to the game.- Fame and Infamy system. Your actions have a limited impact on the world in terms of disposition. People will react to you differently - murder lots of people, and people will react to it in terms of their opinion of you.- Repair skill and durability of weapons and armour - you need to manage the integrity of your equipment, or else watch it degrade and eventually break. There is even a hand-to-hand skill, so you can train yourself to kill people with your bare fists if you want to.- Disposition system. People like you more or less depending on events, infamy/fame, quests and even the silly mini-game in the game you can use. Personality attribute also has a big impact.- Scaling in the game is, to be blunt, terrible. At the beginning of the game, you'll find a rather friendly and not so hostile world. Deer will roam the wilds and slaughterfish will slaughter you whilst mudcrabs pick at your corpse. Skyrim does this slightly better, but mods can fix this in Oblivion.- Birthsigns are selected at the beginning of the game and have a permanent effect. Your birthsign will have a number of effects, ranging from lesser and greater powers to minor impacts on your attributes. This initial decision may full well shape your character in ways you will not be able to change later.- Working item moving. It's much better in Oblivion than Skyrim - you have much more control over the moving of items around your house and all that, with fewer bugs and what-not.- Lots of different armour pieces. Greaves, Gauntlets, Chestplate, Helmet and Boots.And much more. Actually, there is an entire page dedicated to it right here, including the differences between Morrowind too: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Differences_Between_Morrowind,_Oblivion,_and_SkyrimNow onto modding (my original review with minor edits). Beyond vanilla gameplay, which intitially I thought was great, mods can turn the game into something completely different. Add in Deadly Reflex or UV to get a deadly and bloody game, despite being somewhat unrealistic. Or maybe go for Duke Patrick's combat mods and find yourself playing a realistic combat game.Or download thousands of other mods and mix and match to create a game that is unique for you. Don't like the levelling and skill progression? No problem. Grab numerous mods that edit the system, changing it into something more casual, more hardcore or even something completely different. XP system? Gotcha.I've played the game through multiple times over the years. I have to say, I'm still not bored of it, though I did take a break for a couple of years whilst I played Skyrim and Morrowind.Graphics are a little bit dated. But plenty of mods around it to bring it up to Not-Quite-Skyrim quality.			"

												90% of my time spent playing was: duplicating poisoned apples, placing them in guard barracks, and watching guards slowly die11/10 would buy horse armortl;dr: It may follow Bethesda's formula of open-world enjoyment, but this one (and Morrowind) doesn't hold your hand.  It has enough RPG elements to make one playthrough of the game different from another.  Combat and bugs are aplenty, but the quests and varied map make up for those shortcomings. 9/10I first played this game back when I was 13. This was the first Elder Scrolls game that I was subject to (I was slightly too young to be interested in Morrowind at the timeit was released).  I had never played a game that allowed for such open-ended exploration and freedom.  This blew my mind when I first played and it seemed like there was always something new to find out in the world.  As a kid obsessed with this new experience, much of the flaws never really surfaced.Fast forward 10 years.  For nostalgia's sake, I take another trip down memory lane.  It isn't as fantastic as I remember it (but nothing is as good as the first time).  The exploration is still the best part of this game (as it is with all Bethesda games), but the problem is, once you've seen everything, a game can get old quick when it relies heavily on exploration.  This is the problem with all future Bethesda games (but that's a conversation for another time).  The quests are what elevate Oblivion.  There are still some fetch quests, but I think those are few and far between in this game.  If there are fetch quests, they dress them up and throw in plenty of twists to make it interesting.  The best part is there are tons of quests in this game.  Reliving those, or trying out new ways to complete them made this second playthrough incredibly enjoyable. Oh, and do yourself a favor and play through the best DLC/expansion Bethesda has ever made.  Shivering Isles was so diverse and included so much content that I feel like I still haven't done everything to do there.  Downsides: Bugs, no real controller support, potato faces.			"

												TL;DR:Oblivion is my favorite game of all time. You should defiently buy it and never play any other game, ever. I'll give it a 10/10 for what it is. The game is just amazing, though bethesda REALLY seems to have a thing for tracking down sons/famiy members or people in their games.(Martin, ""Dad"", Shaun, the blade guy in Morrowind).P.S. This game is better than Skyrim in a lot of ways.Story:You start as a prisoner in the Imperial City Prison. Sentenced for unknown crimes (Great for having an RP backstory). The Emperor comes down into the dungeons, it turns out your jail cell just happens to have a badass escape route out of the city. You end up escaping the city with the emperor, along the way you find out a little about what's going on. The Emperor has the ""Amulet of Kings"" which is used to create a barrier between your realm and Oblivion (hell).Mehrunes Dagon (main antagonist), god of Oblivon, wants to invade your realm. His little idiotic cult followers called the ""Mythic Dawn"" help him do that. They assassinated the Emperors sons and now have came for the Emperor himself.Now it's your destiny to take the Amulet of Kings and locate the Emperors ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ son, kept in secret, hidden away & make him Emperor and ""Shut close the jaws of Oblivion"".The story is awesome really, though the game lacks as a choice-based RPG. There's no choices (There's a few in the Dark Brotherhood (Assassin Guild)). The storytelling is amazing, -------World Development:Oh boy, this is where the game really shines. Bethesda is known as MASTERS of world development & Oblivion is no different. The game is set in Cyrodiil. The world is a bright, beautiful & vibrant place. It's very diverse (The game is set in the center of the continent, so has bits of everything). From Anvil, a port town on the west coast, to Bruma, a city of the Nords, far to the north in the mountains near Skyrim, to Leyawiin, a city far to the south, mostly inhabited by the Argonians and Khajits (Lizard and Cat people, beast races) a dark, swampy-like town.Or even the Imperial City itself, the largest city on the continent, filled with all the races and culture from everyone. Also the arena where you can pay to watch people beat eachother to death.RPG-ness:It's not a choice-based RPG. You can't choose sides and nothing conflics, but honestly it's not a bad thing & i'm sure there's mods for it anyway. It's more of an RPG that expresses a sense of freedom for the player. You can literally walk anywhere and interact with things, drag objects in the world around using the game physics, kill almost anyone you see and just take in the world. Anywhere at anytime.If you do NEED a choice-based RPG for your library, i'd definetly reccomend Dragon Age Origins (probably my second favorite game).(Same music composer too, Inon Zur, known for The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Star Trek, Pirates of the Carribean, Prince of PErsia and more)Races, characters, voices etc:Cyrodiil, being set in the center of the continent, is home to all races, it has a large feeling of diversity, each city generally has a larger population of the race that the city is closest to their home province. The voice acting is great for ever race and there's a large amount of culture to it too. You'll here ambient dialog from characters in the street talking about things around the world & all NPC's wander around openly, they all have their scripts that they follow daily, at certain times they'll do certain things. Counts and Countesses will sleep at night, then attend their courtroom during the day. Places open and shut and scripted times and everything acts like a real world.-----------Overall I LOVE this game, it's a MUST have for any RPG/Open-World/Fantasy lover. If there's anything more to say I might add more to this review later.			"

There's still something unexplainably charming in it, and every visit to Cyrodiil is filled with joy and excitement.

												I was first introduced to the Elder's Scrolls franchise through Skyrim. I like it so much that I decided to try Oblivion. I'm glad I did. After clocking more than 100 hours in, I can say I like it more than Skyrim for its quests, colorful world and great mechanics. Now that I played both games, I think Bethesda decided to make Skyrim more accessible. Oblivion will give you a world of opportunities and invite you to explore.The graphics aren't the best, and combat is weak, but if you enjoy roleplaying a character and exploring a fantasy world, consider Oblivion. You won't be disappointed. Also, if you can pick up the DLCs. They are worth it for this game.			"

												There's no  way  a short review such as this   can do justice to a game like Oblivion, it's too massive and there' too much to experience, especially when you factor in the number of custom made modifications that are available for this game.  Almost approaching the same as Unreal Tournament and the early Battlefield games (BF1942, BFV and BF2); we're talking several hundred gigabytes of free content at least (I have around 500GB for Oblivion and over a Terabyte for Battlerfield 2).The initial stage of the game where you have to escape the cobwebbed, dark and sometimes dank dungeon is   a little depressing, but still   a pleasure to experience the first few times around (it’s one of only   a few  linear parts of the game - another one is where you get transported into a painting), then you hit the outside, exiting the dungeon via a sewer drain.  On my first time it was a moonlit night and I was actually awed by the sight that I beheld.  I could see   the dark shapes of mountains and   the moonlight gave an eerie look to the small clouds slowly passing by.  The sky was full of glittering stars and I could see some distance ahead to a small broken down castle keep, all of which, even in the dark looked amazing.  I thought Morrowind was fantastic, but this was even better. I waited utill sunrise and was even more impressed by the amazing vista before me, Mountains  clothed in forests, morning mist,   a sun rise that looked almost real and  amazing,  the lush grass waving in the breeze, and    a whole host of other things swamped my  visual cortex.  Every step of the way, I marvelled at how realistic the grass, rocks and other objects looked.  Buildings, the imperial city, villages and towns all had their own distinct feel and charm.  The transition from night to day and back to night  is a pleasure to see; with HDR lighting, bloom effects, specular highlights and  parallax mapping  giving the game    some of the best visuals I’ve seen to date (well, maybe not the last    couple of years of AAA  game releases).  The effects are amazing, even now seven years after its release it still looks brilliant.  You can get several mods that improve many of the textures (the largest of these is around 3GB in size).The usual RPG elements are present; for example, levelling up, plus  resource collection for  crafting magical weapons and  potions as well as stocking  yourself with  better armour, weapons , arrows, spears, potions etc.    Combat is nothing special, but still satisfying when swapping between bow, sword spear and magic.  Despatching enemies isn’t too hard, especially once you’ve got a steady stream of healing potions.If you still haven’t purchased this game, now is the time to get it.  It includes   the expansion The Shivering Isles and the mod package Knights of the Nine that contains several   new missions, etc.  You can see several videos HERE,  HERE, HERE, HERE and HERE.The first one is  the escape from the dungeon, the next  two videos are in and around Cyrodiil  and the last two relate to the Oblivion gates.

												The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion is by far my favourite in the series. I have played the Elder Scrolls since Morrowind came out way back and have continued it's amazing legacy in my life to this very day. Of course, it comes with bugs and glitches but what do you expect from a massive RPG such as this? Anyways, besides from the graphics and quests, my favourite part of this game has always been the modding community and also being a part of it.My days began way back when I was 12/13 so a good 6 years ago, when I discovered mods and how awesome they were. Graphics were always an important thing in mind so mods such as Qarls Texture Pack 3 (the best one at the time and still is I believe) was an amazing thing to have. All the small mods, such as keychains, graphics, sound overhauls, OPEN CITIES etc were what made this game, and also the rest in the series truly amazing. Sure having a flying dragon or flying skyship was awesome, but it wasn't something you'd always be using and seeing. There were still many bugs in the later releases however an Unnofficial fix was released (many times) to fix what Bethesda could and did not. This helped greatly with smooth gameplay and to fix errors.I haven't covered nearly 5% of what I wanted to type as this game is just truly amazing and my favourite in The Elder Scrolls. Check out PlanetElderscrolls and The Nexus for mods and make sure you know what you're doing by reading the Readme files and guides.If you have only played Skyrim, you probably won't like Oblivion that much because everything isn't as 'immersive' graphics wise, but to us who started here, I think we can agree that the Replay Value outnumbers Skyrim's.

To this day, I still think Oblivion is the best Elder Scrolls game thus far.Yes, I've spent over one houe playing the PC version, but I've spent hundreds of hours playing the 360 version.However, this game is quite old, so while the graphics aren't terrible, your experience with this game would be ten times better with a few graphical enhancements.Graphics aside, the core plot is one full of mystery, adventure and sometimes shock. The side-quests (There are probably over one hundred of them) are quirky and range from being pretty short, to really long and complex.The environment, like many RPG games, can be repetitive and sometimes quite boring, however, this is countered with multiple buildings/shrines/portals scattered throughout.The alchemy system is, in my opinion, far more easier to learn and more rewarding to use than any other elder scrolls game. Not surprisingly, more complex potions can be made with a higher alchemy level.Unlike Skyrim, you don't ""wield"" spells, that is, you can walk around with a sword and still a spell equipped without any compromise.I recommend this game to those who are looking for some nostalgia.I recommend this game to newer players who don't mind installing some graphics mods.

												Oblivion is a beautiful experience. Rich characters and absorbing questlines within a game that brings Tamriels central province to life. As 'old' as it is now, Oblivion still holds up as a fantastic experience and is well worth playing, even if your only previous Elder Scrolls game has been Skyrim. There is very little handholding and figuring out how basically anything works is a myriad of frankly hilarious trial and error. There is almost nothing I don't love about this game aside from Bethesdas general ability to write less than interesting main questlines and have a habit of placing a large number of copy pasted Dungeons throughout the game, but the rest of the world is filled with more than enough to quench the thirst of the avid adventurer.*♥♥♥♥♥♥s*			"

												In Skyrim, if you use magic, all you need is Destruction Dual Casting, Impact, and four enchanted items to hit end game. In Oblivion, even the most cheap and knowledgable player who utilizes power leveling and walkthroughs to get the best gear/spells at the fastest rate possible will still experience a sense of progression and improvement far into the highest character levels.The musical score is god tier.Although repetitive, the voice acting is pleasant and cohesive (if you don't listen to the beggars).The environments are colorful and interesting, whereas Skyrim's world could have been created by a three year old with a pair of grey and white markers.If you like RPGs, Oblivion is a must.

												In my Opinion Oblivion is still better than Skyrim. The story and the Quests are waaay better. Just as an example: Skyrim Magic University Mission is quickly over, and the uni itself doesn't even feel like a place people study. In Oblivion the questline is really long spread out over all major cities and the university is a giant place with the feel of an acutal university. And where as the ending of Skyrim is kinda meh (you fight a dragon, so what? You did that the entire game) The Ending in Oblivion is epic and memorable.Also Oblivion has the best expansion ever made aka shivering Isles.That is not to say Oblivion doesn't have its flaws. The major gripe I have with this game is the leveling system. It is really easy to ""misslevel"" you character, making it weaker the higer level you get. Leveling is almost stressful. You have to grind 5 levels per attribute or else you are missing out on stats. It is even benificial to only level up skills that are not your main skills as that makes you deal way more damage than you should have per level.  "

												This being one of the first RPG i ever played, it blew me away. This game is just so well put together that it leaves me to want a remaster or something of the sort. However, the game isnt without its flaws. Specifically, the combat can seem dull and repetitive if you play it with an aggro mindset, not bothering to avoid attacks and spam health potions. Another flaw for me personally is the difficulty setting. Finding the perfect sweetspot varies from character to character. Enemies will either become total wimps getting one shot by any attack or be absolute tanks that drain your resources to nothing. What i would more prefer is something along the lines of fallout 4's survival mode damage, where you and enemies both have increased killing potential. That aside, this game has characteristics that far outweigh the cons. My personal favorite being the music. This game's soundtrack, in my honest opinion, is amazing. I feel myself getting lost in the harps, flutes, and violins when wandering the various cities. Ominous music kicking in when i enter an unexplored cave. But who could forget the epic tones of the games title screen. Another great thing about this game are the secrets hidden throughout the landscape. Perhaps a bow or chest that you would have never stumbled upon in a first playthrough. Another topic i wanted to touch on is how you play this game. If you are the type of person that loves getting to the end fast and wants instant gratification, maybe this isnt your game. I think you have to be the observant type, listen to the dialogue, read the books, dont rush through every quest like you are in a hurry like so many others do. You miss out on the little nuances the game so delicately hides. You can appreciate the game on another level. Though this game is very outdated, i feel it gives the game a certain charm that few others have. It was the RPG that paved the way for future games of its genre, and look where we are now. These are just my thoughts on the game, the may not be true or subjective, but i hope i can convince someone to experience this game the way i have. Much love and thank you for reading.			"

												Well Skyrim's been out for almost three years and I'm sure that most people who haven't been living under a rock have at least tried it once. What a lot of those players never realized was that it was the fifth installment of an already amazing series. This game rivals Skyrim for story, worldbuilding, and enjoyment in just about every way but graphics. I'd highly recommend this game to any RPG gamer out there.			"

												Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is a gem within the Elder Scroll series.What was good about Morrowind was brought over to this 4th installment of the series, and of course, what was bad. Was either taken out, or refined and polish for a much smoother experience.This game is huge, then what the game let's on. From quests just about almost everywhere you go. With impress lore and backstory. Not to mention the various challenges in these dark and creepy dungeons. Another great thing about Oblivion is it's class system. Unlike in Skyrim where you play as you want. Here you play based on a set of class. And therefore the game experience for you could either be hard or easy, Depending upon what class you play as. To add on the 500+ in Oblivion you got a stable (still active) modding community plus DLC quests like Knights of Nine and Shivering Isles. Which that place adds even MORE hours into Oblivion.  To add on this amazing experience is these beautiful towns and cities filled with the sam- der i mean different variety of characters each one having their own set schedule, personal opinon, and even the way they see you (through fame or infamy status) the world is very active around you within this game. There are at least two negatives about this game, that i can point out.1. NPC's are literally forgettable, this being the reason why Skyrim's NPCs are vastly superior than Oblivion's NPCs, and more flexiable than Morrowind's NPCs. The Oblivion character models are literally the same, except with a few minor face tweaks with the hair, nose, eye color and so on. Plus with the same voice acting it doesn't really help who is who in the world.2. Combat is sluggish, Yes. Even though it's a class based system. It will take a while, a long while before finding the right tune for your character to even remotely survive in the combat. Really it's just: block, lung, block, fire a spell, block. Rinse and repeat. Sometimes you are on the defensive the entire time or not even bothering going through that dungeon and just drinking buffer poitions outside the dungeon. Can you say it's because of the player level..perhaps. But even then the combat is still sub-par.If you love a cross between Morrowind and Skyrim. I highly recommend getting this game. This is the one to have in your RPG collection.			"

												Fantastic game! Oblivion is one of those games that only comes from time to time, just imagine how much the developers put into this game, time, ideas , money. Thank you Bethesda! I confess it was the first game in the Elder Scrolls series I played, so I can not compare to Morrowind, and Skyrim I barely played, then I'll make a review based solely on impressions of the game.It took a while until I get to continue on a character and finish the main quest, the game requires dedication, Cyrodill world is vast , the possibilities in a TES game well, you need to explore,  learn about, otherwise you will getting lost as I did several times and so I abandoned the progress with other characters.The wealth of detail is impressive, the plot of the main quest not, but everything else makes up for this fact, the quests are very well written, some are so smart that I was surprised. The possibilities are endless too, this is a true Role Playing Game, you can make a character and be what you want from a killer thief going through a heroic warrior to a simple traveling merchant, or all together.The graphics are outdated and mechanics are strange at first sight, especially the combat and movement, and the animation of NPCs give the impression that they do not have emotions. Despite this the game is still very good, the graphics can be improved with mods, you get used to the mechanics and also the sound effects are well done. The community is huge and active, there are thousands of fan-made mods that help solve problems, improve gameplay, graphics and add content that make it practically a new game.I highly recommend it, but as said, you need to devote to it, it takes a while to get a feel and learn how the gameplay works, how the skill system and leveling for example. But there are wikis for it with everything you can know about TES: Oblivion, I recommend consulting to aid, but being careful with spoilers, of course.9/10			"

And to anyone who is looking for a good familial bonding game, I recommend this one, as it has an inviting artistic style and intuitive system of leveling where those playing get quite the cathartic fantasy experience.

												Oblivion makes some arguable improvements over Morrowind, as well as some massive steps backwards. Some of these mistakes would be fixed in Skyrim, while others will be ignored or worsened in some sense. As a full experience, Oblivion is a big open, sometimes annoying, technically and gameplay wise, but still mostly enjoyable overall. However, unlike Morrowind, where if you looked past the graphics now you could likely get immersed, Oblivion has numerous barriers preventing it from matching Morrowind.Compared to Skyrim, the combat feels somewhat choppier. It is faster at some points, but it manages to feel a lot more simplistic. I definitely prefer non-magic combat over Morrowind's dice roll simulation however, as combat finally feels responsive. Magic crafting also returns from Morrowind, and still feels very powerful at higher levels. However, I actually, for whatever reason, prefer magic in Morrowind to Oblivion. Learning a school of magic however, unlike Skyrim, is still worth doing regardless of playstyle due to the ability to cast regardless of whether both hands are occupied or not. Oblivion is, combat wise, the halfway point between Morrowind's more traditional style and Skyrim's faster combat, so benefits and pros of both apply here. I don't actually mind it, as like I said, magic feels superior to Skyrim, while in most other areas, combat feels more responsive than Morrowind.Location-wise and graphically, Oblivion is very green and bright. It has a better colour pallet than non-modded Skyrim, and there are definitely graphical improvements over its prequels. However, the location itself is generic. It's all greens and old elven architecture and medieval towns, rather than the alien lands of Vvardenfell's plains or Skyrim's cold mountain ranges. My main problem with Bethesda worlds has always been the very small population, and the Imperial City, although more populated than anything in Skyrim, still feels empty, and the NPC's all have very funny looking faces. Character models in Bethesda games always feel like the lack, and Oblivion is a prime example here. What feels like a let-down is that the beast races no longer have unique animations either for movement. This is more an immersion thing, and animations never affect your gameplay experience, but if you had played Morrowind before Oblivion, you'll likely notice it.The soundtrack is quiet and peaceful. The scores are always nice in Elder Scrolls games, and although I don't have anything in this game I prefer over Morrowind (which Bethesda seemed to like as they were re-using the compositions even before the Dragonborn DLC in Skyrim), the music all fits and helps build on the games atmosphere, which is all you need a soundtrack to do.The guild quests in Oblivion are some of the best in the series. Although the main quest becomes a bit of a drag, the Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood in particular have some of Bethesda's best quests and plotlines to them. Highlights include the Gray Fox and his final heist, and The Dark Brotherhood as a whole. There aren't any quests in Skyrim that compete with the quests here. The Fighter's Guild also has a few interesting ones and the Mages Guild suffers from the same problem that the College of Winterhold suffers from in that you can be hopeless with advanced magic and become the archmage in a few days of joining. The Arena is a massive missed opportunity, as fights never feel that big and the questline can be dusted off in about 30 minutes, which is massively disappointing. Guilds are definitely stripped back from Morrowind, due to the removal of skill barriers between the low and high ranks. Although this means that the player will be able to see everything, it means that unless you force yourself to roleplay, you can see everything on a single character. This is something even Skyrim dodged with its Civil War questline. This becomes even more self-defeating if you originally played it on the XBOX 360, and you were allowed to pick up every achievement on a single character.The Shivering Isles expansion included is brilliant. You have to play it more than once to see everything, and although a bit short, gives a far more varied world than Cyrodiil to explore, and Sheogorath and the residents of the isles have fun, over-exaggerated personalities that fit perfectly with the theme of madness and misery the expansion is going for.Overall, Oblivion has very nice ideas. The best ideas of Skyrim seemed to appear here, albeit somewhat under-developed, and although not as focused as Morrowind, it still maintained the RPG gameplay that Bethesda seems glad to phase out more and more as they release more games themselves. Worth a buy, and with mods, just like all the other popular Bethesda games, if it doesn't crash, you can go on and on, possibly even fixing your own personal problems with the game.			"

												★★★★☆""Live Another Life in Another World"".  If only every game could boast that as a key feature.  + Ragdolls+ Fitting music+ Captain Picard+ Optional difficulty+ Fast Travel & Quick Save+ Immersive and varied world+ Loot everything from everyone+ Interesting quests and locations+ Fully voiced endless NPC dialogue+ Countless ways to complete quests+ NPC and Faction relationships/alignment+ Unique and detailed spell crafting system+ Varied equipment, both visually and functionally+ NPCs.  While they can occasionally get laughable, this is probably the most alive NPCs have ever been.  They have schedules, they have conversations with eachother, they have unique appearances and stories, you can fully interact with all of them, and they react somewhat reasonably.  There isn't a single civilized NPC in this entire game that is just a copypaste non-interactive background filler, aside from maybe city guards.  + Considering this game is 10+ years old, the graphics hold up pretty well.  With a few extra settings forced on from your Nvidia control panel, it can even compete with most modern indie releases.  Aside from faces, ohgod the faces.  +- Can't kill important NPCs+- Mage is by far the best playstyle+- Levelup skill categories by using skills relevant to that category.  While this is an interesting idea, it causes some lame issues, like AFK running into a corner, or spamming spells at nothing to grind exp.  - UI is painfully clunky- Inventory weight limit- 3rd person is not viable- Graphic performance varies greatly, between 30 and 300 FPS- So many ""come back tomorrow"" quests, which don't even update when tomorrow is ready* Mods			"

Pros:-Amazing open world gameplay-Beautiful graphics-Massive content-Comes on steam with all expansion content-Varying character build paths-The best thieves' guild plot arc-Oh come on, it's basically Skyrim Lite, just buy it already.Cons:-Persuasion wheel.  Ugh.-Horses are disappointing-Occasional voice acting issues-Occasional glitchesOverall: Skyrim lite.  Pre-Skyrim.  If you're here and you haven't bought this yet, but you got any amount of enjoyment out of any other Elder Scrolls game, just hit the purchase button.  The graphics are a little outdated but still beautiful.  The world is every bit as expansive as you might expect from an Elder Scrolls game, and honestly, I think I prefer a lot of the guild plots for this more than for Skyrim.Oblivion improves on so much of what was introduced in Morrowind, and when played, it's easy to see what was kept and refined for Skyrim.  The game is fun.  With a world this massive, and mechanics this complex, there are bound to be a few bugs.  And there are.  But they are remarkably far and few between for such a huge game, and the polish really shows.  My biggest gripe is when talking to an NPC, and the voice actor for the pre-assigned sound bytes changes between conversation topics.  You can't sound like an angry cowboy one moment and a hoity toity nobleman the next without ruining immersion.  This doesn't happen often either - but it sticks out enough to be memorable.Still, if you're here, you know what this is.  Just buy it.  Or wait for a sale.  But you owe yourself this experience if you ever loved playing any sort of role playing game in your life.  There's something here for everyone.Bottom Line: Obvious recommend.			"

												I originally bought Oblivion because I couldn't afford Skyrim when it first came out, and this was on sale. I was immediately sucked into Tamriel, and I can honestly say that this game has aged immaculately. I did go on and play Skyrim for a long time, but Skyrim requires so many mods to fix lackluster questlines and glitches. Oblivion's only con is that the people's faces look like potatoes, but it's really not that big of a deal. The Oblivion quests that are available are so much more interesting; you really feel like you're there. It's so immersive and the writing is incredible. You don't have to force yourself to feel empathy for the Emperor, and this game is never too easy. I don't find myself looking for ways to make this game more immersive or interesting; I don't find myself searching for mods to fill the void left by poorly written quests and plotholes. I started playing Oblivion again because I wanted to see if I'd find it as interesting as the first time I played. I can tell you I'll be playing this again and again and again... 10/10 game. Worth every penny, and then some.			"

												Oblivion was one of the first games I ever got for the Xbox 360, and remains my favorite in the series-- not as poorly aged as Morrowind, not as unnecessarily trimmed as Skyrim.  It has the core of the Elder Scrolls games intact, a memorable world, graphics that still hold up decently, and the full physics of the 7th gen Gamebryo engine.I sunk hundreds of hours into the game back on Xbox.  The thing is, I never even beat the game.  The main questline was interesting, and very well-done overall, but it pales in comparison to not just the amount but the quality of the sidequests and guilds.  That's something Skyrim simply hasn't impressed me in-- the quests all feel like their own set of explorations and fights, rather than ""go to x and kill y to get z.""  The quests of this game all feel like something special, whether it's reading from an old journal to follow the path to a lost village, jumping into a painting to find a missing person, or helping someone fake his death to avoid paying debts.  The sheer amount of variety and quality in each of these quests will give you massive amounts of content that, unlike Skyrim, are actually fun to carry out rather than an excuse to walk around a frozen tundra for a bit longer.That in general can summarize Oblivion; there's attention to detail in pretty much everything.  Those random burned-up books in Fallout 3?  Every single one of them is a text, fully written and readable, which can be collected.  Random plants you harvest?  Craftable into poisons and potions.  House you bought for a too-good-to-be-true price?  Secretly haunted by a necromancer!  There's always something to surprise you about the game, whether it's just how much of the world you interact with or some of the downright strange things that can be found.Even the random events can completely catch you off guard.  While walking to Weynon Priory with the priest from Kvatch (early part of the main quest), I came across a regular looking cabin in the middle of the forest, with no-one around.  When I walked in, there were skeletons everywhere inside and a charred corpse on the furnace.  This has nothing to do with the rest of the game, is never explained, and completely caught me off guard.  This was 8 years after first playing the game!  There are other strange things you'll come across, but the less spoiled, the better.Speaking of strange, the Shivering Isles DLC is included with these versions of the game.  That's important, as the Shivering Isles is a massive DLC.  Originally going for $30 alone on Xbox Live, the DLC adds a massive new map and storyline where you get thrown into a world that's downright insane.  Two new sets of armor and weapons, memorable and insane characters, even more great quests, and overall just a brilliant addition to the game.  While I haven't played Knights of the Nine, and little needs to be said of the Horse Armor that you don't know already, the DLC for this game based on that alone is fantastic.Overall, what makes Oblivion special is that it holds up.  Yes, the combat can feel a bit spongy, but Skyrim has a very similar problem with its enemies.  Unlike Morrowind, the combat has a very important part: consistency.  No more RNG hit-and-missing, no more weapons divided into a thousand different types; the skills, gameplay, and controls finally make sense, especially compared to Morrowind and Daggerfall.  Even the visuals are great, though as a now decade-old game, you should expect some pop-in and lifeless faces with Bethesda's infamous awkward zoom-in angles that thankfully aren't present in Fallout 4.So yes, I do recommend Oblivion-- quite easily, in fact.  It's still to this day one of my favorite games of all time, and I don't know why I waited so long to start playing it again.  I've picked an entirely different build from my old character, and was honestly surprised at just how different of a game it feels like now.  This game has not only aged well, but compared to its other entries now stands out as an example of how to make an open-world game timeless.			"

												The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is an absolutely great title and is one of, if not, the best titles in the Elder Scrolls series. Oblivion was my very first introduction to the Elder Scrolls and I enjoyed the game so very much from start to finish. The sense of immersion along with the well balanced gameplay and epic storyline was quite enjoyable for a roleplaying enthusiast like me. This title is so chock full of adventure and combat that it will keep you busy for hour upon hour which will eventually compile into weeks and months before you realize it. Graphically, you have to remember that this title was released quite a few years ago, it pales in comparison to some of todays RPG's but even so I found the basic game to be quite beautiful with a uniqueness of it own that completely fits the fantasy world and story that it places you in. I said that graphically ""it pales in comparison to some of todays titles"" but I think this game still looks as good if not better than alot of the current roleplaying games available...this title was ahead of it's time and the work that the developers put into it definitely shows. Of course, as with many of Bethesdas RPG's, after you finish the basic game the first time you have the ability to modify the game to your liking for many more playthroughs by way of the Oblivion Nexus. You can mod the game from the start but I as well as others agree that playing through the base untouched game the first time is a wise thing to do. This title is simply fantastic and is highly recommended!!!			"

												Oblivion one of my favorite games of all time.Morrowind is were it all began and Skyrim is the result of years of refinement, but Oblivion is the ambitious middle game in the modern Elder Scrolls games. Why? I first started playing Oblivion about a year ago, this was after i played Skyrim.When i first started the game it felt a little off. The controls were weird the graphics and the animations were a bit lame.After i played it for a while i actualy noticed that this world felt much more alive than Skyrim.I forgot the time and it really gave me the drive to explore the game.The Quest were just unique from one another and there wasn't a single quest i thought was boring. When i was deep in the game i forgot about the animations and realised i actualy liked the graphics from Oblivion more. They are much more alive instead of all the depressing and boring snow from Skyrim.In terms of physical appearance Skyrim is ofcourse alot better, and well it does look nice but i actualy like the positive environment from Oblivion more.Its just such an awesome and fun game even today.You just have to get into it, and when you do you will not get out.I never know what to expect in this game and it always keeps me excited.If you have the money go buy it, i am so glad i started it once when i just was bored. Its totally worth it!Oblivion- Awesome questing - 14 Guilds - Positive and nice environment- Fun Combat - Amazing SoundtrackFor an old game, it just never ceases to amaze me every single time. "

												Story? Great, but morrowind's was better.Gameplay? It has aged. I won't hide it. Skyrim really has better mechanics for basically everything, but this game is a lot simpler to pick up and has better quests and storylines.Atmosphere? Best out of the series. Although they couldn't afford to hire more than 8-12 voice actors.Graphics? Good for a game from 2006, but it still looks amazing on max settings. Still, graphics mods polish it.Physics? Try decorating your house. It's painful.Leveling up and build system? Complex, but dumbed down from Morrowind, for the better.Game length? Doing every quest and completing every guild + all the DLC = More than likely 200+ hours. Very rich.Better than Skyrim? Absolutely. But it has aged, and won't live up to the more modernized style of Skyrim.Has it aged well? Not quite, but you can still play it if it doesn't crash. From what I know, some cards actuall aren't compatable with the game. Mainly AMD cards, but see what cards can run this game before you buy it. It may be 20$ thrown out the window if your card isn't compatable.Most negative reviews are either about how it can't run on their computer or how people like it for nostalgia. Don't listen to those reviews. The game is well worth the 20$ if you are really into vintage games like this that are heavy with roleplay elements that aren't dumbed down.			"

												The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is one of the greatest games I have ever played. Made in 2006, the game still continues to amaze me, to this very day! Back those days, this game was considered as one with the most realistic graphics (Even today, they are not bad). And it was a HUGE leap from it's predecessor, Morrowind, by all accounts. But, of course, it is not perfect. Nothing is.Well, here's my pros and cons of this game:Pros: - the main storyline - the world's size and details- character customization- the guilds and their respective quests - the spells (better than Skyrim's if you ask me)   - the ability to make your own spells (Not available in Skyrim)- the look of the cities- the soundtrack- Mods, the possibilities are endlessCons: -  the lockpicking system! - armor and weapons can break and need repairing (OK, this is probably made to add realism, but I still find it annoying)- too little amount of voice actors- fast travel made it too easy (you have access to all the cities in the beginning so that really kills the exploration feeling)- combat was a bit dullBut despite it's minor flaws I still enjoy the game. And recommend.			"

												Right after its release, Oblivion divided people on many patterns. I've heard friends who felt it was not a big step above Morrowind. In other words, they were disappointed with how little was changed. They wanted more of new game design decisions, and Oblivion, following all basic guidelines of the previous games, was not such a huge leap forward that someone expected. At the same time there were others, who felt lost and enraged with the amount of obscurities in compare with their beloved TES 3. ""Conspiracy of simplification"", some people called new trends, shown in the Oblivion. ""They trading deep, thoughtful gameplay for WOW moments!""...It's been almost a decade since then. We saw Skyrim, Fallout 3 & 4, many other open-world RPG and wanna-be RPG titles. While it's a common thought that Oblivion was not a bad game, the main question is - Is it worth something now? If you haven't played it before, by what conditions would you like that game and will be motivated to actually play it? Simply put - should you buy it now?In the line of Elder Scrolls games, despite common lore, every volume is quite unique. Morrowind goes with oriental motives, religious cults and huge, comprehensive and insane magic sandbox. Skyrim is about Nords, snows, dragons and their powers, and really huge open world to explore. Really, like hundreds of hours of adventuring...TES IV has its own focus - the Central province of Empire, being overrun with hordes of demons from the lower plane called Oblivion. The problems of central governance and very dramatic main storyline, with all adventuring and other freeride activities pushed away in favor of highly orchestrated quests. The Empire in perils, the one and only Emperor dead, along with all legal heirs... The high dosage of Pathos seems unavoidable. Is it a bad thing? No. The Oblivion still much more free-play oriented than, say, Dragon Age Origins or Witcher. And those ""orchestrated"" quests are not giving the feeling of moving in the narrow intestines of scenario where you're more of the observer rather than actual actor. Some of those quests will be memorized as perfect examples of quest-writing and performing. You know, the gold book of RPG quests, bonfires, fanfares, all that stuff...Sure, the creators of Oblivion dropped many of the gameplay mechanics that Morrowind fans were proud of. On other hand, we've got a world much more alive and reflecting with your actions, than it was before. All those things that were simply nailed to the one place in Morrowind, including god-like beings like Vivec - in Oblivion have not only a place to be, but the duties to perform and some logic to praise or disregard the course of current events in the game plot. Although... less static doesn't necessarily means good dynamics. It is safe to say that the world of Oblivion is not that capable for providing player with adventures as Skyrim. Besides main story line and some of fraction quests (like assassins or Daedric quest lines), some of us could even find that Oblivion is somewhat dull. On the contrary, the world of Skyrim is noticeably less colourful, so there certainly will be others, who like Oblivion More than Skyrim...You know that? You should try it for yourself. Placing yourself in the sabatons of the knight-by-fortune, saving the Empire from fires of Abyss...My mark will be 7.1/10. I'd give it more, would there not been all those useless pricy dlc's like shiny ""armored"" skin for horses. They downgraded my overall expression out of the game, but it is still a nice piece of work, well-worth of attention from any RPG fan.			"

												This game...what's there to say that hasn't been said?My steam hours on this game are pitiful, but my love and years with this game PREDATE steam.Sitting at the family computer at 10 years old in 2006, scared deathless of how dark the sewers in the prologue were.And I never stopped playing. Even 5 years later when Skyrim was released, I returned to Oblivion after Skyrim satisfied me.This game was my first RPG, it's home.RIGHT, sentimentals aside, how's the game:+ It looks amazing, there's something about the graphics style that even today stands out to me, despite the vast improvements graphics have made over the years.+ The soundtrack is honestly the single most beautifully composed game soundtrack of all time. Fantasy orchestral symphonies for every mood and atmosphere and moment.+ The story is fascinating and wonderful, plunging you deep into the world of Tamriel and all its rotating elements, from the seperate guilds to the conflicting gods and deities, with smatterings of political intrigue thrown in but not so much it feels heavy.+ The voice cast is just absolutely stellar, the celebrity castings of Patrick Stewart, Sean Bean, Terence Stamp, and others, still standing out as spectacular work. They are a voice cast deserving of better facial rigging software than they were given.+ Fully customizable fantasy RPG character developments. Laid out and easily manageable and, if you desire, exploitable.I'd give a negative list, but honestly, I love the flaws in this game:+ The ragdolls are ridiculous. I love them.+ The character models are so, god, damn, ugly. I love them.+ BY AZURA BY AZURA BY AZURA. IT'S THE GRAND CHAMPION.+ Among the scariest facial rigging I've ever seen in a game. Many of the expressions wrenched out by certain lines of dialogue, haunt me.+++ The absolute best piece of DLC ever created for a game. Ever.

												This is my favorite Elder Scrolls game and one of my overall favorites! Bethesda pulled off the atmosphere in Oblivion better than Skyrim and even Morrowind. The factions and there questlines are amazing and story is rich with lore as always. You can make your own spells and create your custom class. Even though the main story is a little short, I enjoyed playing through it, the faction questlines, the daedric quests, and all of the others in between. The cities and towns are a decent size and some are beautiful! If you haven't played Oblivion, I strongly recommend you do! A vast map to explore, deep story, and many hours of fun and adventure!

												It's taken a long time for me to think of the correct words I wanted to use to describe Oblivion.I first played Oblivion on my friends Xbox 360 and was immediately hooked - I went straight to our local game store (Our town still had one in those days) and in there was a guy who was being made by his parents to sell all of his games to cover his ridiculous phone bill that he had wracked up, it was hundreds of pounds. I got his copy, a battered old case with a cigarette burn on the cover. And I loved it. It was probably the game I spent most time on, ever, on my good old 360. Now that I have evolved into one of the PC master race, it was time to do it all over again.Now, I will start here with Oblivion's flaws. For as much as I like it, it does have them and it would be unfair not to mention them. As the game world itself is huge, of course the associated bugs and glitches come with them. There are hundreds, and I suspect not all of them have been found. Some of them are quest breaking and some of them are literally game breaking, so they can be highly frustrating. On PC, this is not so much of an issue due to the all godly console commands. Combat is clunky, and especially in melee combat - you can get stuck in a hit cycle from multiple enemies and just have no way of defending yourself. The voice acting in itself is quite literally a cultural phenomenon. Yahtzee (our lord and saviour from Zero Punctuation) was 100% accurate when he described characters talking, to themselves, about the shop, owned by themselves. Its a solid attempt at a procedurally generated NPC conversations but it just falls short of the mark. The speech skill/persuasion is baffling in this game, and often I just ended up bribing people to tell me what I wanted.It hasn't aged terribly well in line with modern RPGs, but this does not matter to me so much - however, this could be an issue if graphics are your marker of a good game. The upcoming Skyblivion mod will seek to remedy this, and good luck to the development team on this - if you're ever in the UK, I'll buy you a drink. It does occasionally crash for no reason, but that could just be my particular set up.I could sit here and write pages about why I love Oblivion, so I won't. Its not just a game, its an experience. It is a lush, huge world with many different areas to wander, and has hundreds of dungeons, forts, caves, even shipwrecks to explore.  The quests and quest writing is miles above other Elder Scrolls games, the guilds in particular are fantastic - The Dark Brotherhood blows Skyrim's out of the water. I've never managed to complete all of the quests, I still find new NPCs, locations and quests to this day. It has a good chunk of DLC available - including the much derided horse armour (Seriously, give it a search - it was a bit of a mess). However, the available content also includes the legendary Shivering Isles DLC, often considered to be one of the best ever DLC packages made. It adds well over 30 hours of new content, and its not just new weapons or armour but an entire new world to explore, set in the Alice in Wonderland-esque realm of Sheogorath. That, Bethesda, is how you should be doing it. I'll stop gushing now. Seriously, if you let it drag you under - you won't come out for weeks. Cheese for everyone!			"

												I hope I dont get hate for this, but i think this game is better then skyrim. Skyrims gameplay is 10x better, and all the systems for leveling up and all that, but the oblivion story oh my god... Wether its stealing back some jumbo potatos to a mad kajhitt, to saving the world from a giant demon, you choose your own path. If oblivion was remade with skyrim style gameplay, then it would be the best game in the world. Just oblivions quest are capabul of making you laugh, so i would really reccomend this game!			"

												Oblivion is my favourite game and in my opinion the greatest game of all time. When i first picked up a copy of oblivion i was only interested in FPS games. After putting in the disc and hearing the theme song  i knew this was something special. I watched the beautiful intro spanning over the imperial city in awe. I dived head on into the character creation and spent a good half an hour tampering with these (at the time) weird and facinating races. I chose a nord and proceeded through the tutorial, talking to Patrick Stewart's Uriel Septim and feeling some importance. My first battle was with the rats at the crumbling door that took me by surprise but i still won. I proceeded through the dungeon slaying beasts and looting as i went. I saw the death of Uriel which still tugs on my heart strings to this day.i remember leaving the sewer for the first time and just being in awe, the beauty of cyrodiil is unmatched to this day. The size of the cities dumbfounded me. There are critisims for them being too generic however I love the way they look it feels medival yet fantasy. I remember seeing the imperial city and being taken a back. i plowed through the oblivion gates which are a stellar contrast to the soft features of cyrodiil.after completion of the campaign i felt lost, i didnt know what to do, (the ending is very sad). Luckily the side quests had enough ti keep me entertained for hours on end, as with the lore. With over 1000 hours of gameplay compared to my 800 in morrowind and 200 on skyrim it is safe to say this is my prefferd elder scrolls.sometimes i like to turn it on and just walk through the forest with the enchanting sound track and just reminice. i beyond reccomend this game			"

												This is the best of the Elder Scrolls, from a time where the Role Playing actually mattered in RPGs. This game was also a turning point for the franchise, settling on the middle ground between completely unguided character exploration and a little bit of as helping hand from the game itself. An absolutly amazing gameplay experience awaits you in Cyrodiil, the heart of Tamriel's Empire, and when you have finished there, you can venture into the Shivering Isles to experience one of the best DLC's ever made. Period. I cannot explain the glorious nastalgia I feel everytime I hear the theme to this work of art. 10/10			"

												Only a few hours in, and although there aren't too many character customization options like Skyrim does. Ho-ly crap does it make up for the tons of content. I feel like this is the Fallout 3 to Fallout 4, whereas the newer game dumbed down the game a little to cater towards more players, but the earlier one has much better gameplay overall.3 hours in, and planning on more, as much as my statements probably don't count, considering low playtime. I do reccomend this game, and while it may be confusing at first if you've already played Skyrim, its super addicting.Please, do yourself a favor, and if you have a life, don't buy this game, but if you don't like the rest of us basement dwellers, pick it up, its totally worth the price.

												Oblivion may not be as advanced as Skyrim, but in my opinion it's still much better. When you join a guild or faction in Oblivion, you slowly work your way up to the top. When you join a guild in Skyrim, you are super important right from the start. For example, The Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim has you as the listener right after the first couple of grunt quests. In Oblivion, you don't become the listener until the very end, after you've poured your heart and soul into completing every quest. This is just one example, all of Skyrim's guilds are like this. Oblivion makes you work for your success, its storyline is better, and the overall feel of it is much more memorable. Skyrim is a good game, Oblivion is a FANTASTIC game, 10/10 would erase my memory and play Oblivion all over again. So before you buy any other game, STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM, get Oblivion GOTY Edition.			"

												Oblivion has to be my favourite elder scrolls game. this is despite a long list of flaws, including: poor character models, an incipid lockpicking minigame, lack of dungeon variety, horrifically bad dialogue assignment, generic npcs, bugs, poor optimisation, and only one Patrick Stewart. It's strengths lie in it's excellent story telling, incredible art design, and possibly one of the best dlcs of all time in the form of the ''Shivering Isles''. Oblivion manages to suck hours of your life away with each session. So don't buy this game if you have an infant to care for or it will probably starve.			"

												This is quite possibly the greatest game I have ever played in my entire life (WoW: TBC is the only other contender). Where to begin? I'll tell you a story. I remember it was 2006 and my dad was looking for a blueray player. The only options were like 800 pounds or so, or you could buy a PS3 which had just came out. So my dad opted for a PS3 and it came with a game I had never before heard of called 'Oblivion'. I being 14 years old of course wanted to play CoD 4 instead but decided to give it a shot to see how the graphics were on the new gen of consoles. I popped the disc in, game booted up and I started a new character. I had no clue this was an RPG game (had just gotten into WoW) and was encouraged. After completing the intro quest and liking what I'd been playing, I stepped out into Cyrodiil for the very first time and my frickin jaw dropped. I had never seen such an incredible environment in a game before and I was blown awaay by how beautiful and colourful everything I saw was. The deer running around in the forest, the serene water and the gorgeous nightsky. Amazed instantly and I knew this game was something special. Immediately I set about just running around, not caring about finding enemies to defeat or quests.. I must have explored for a good hour or so before delving into Imperial city and figuring out what was what. It took me a while but I got onto the first quest, got to Kvatch without much trouble and then I Was blown away again when I went thru the Oblivion gate. Being 14 at the time, I was a bit frightened of the Dremora and scamps in there so I actually avoided the main questline for over a year whilst completing many many other questlines first. Yes, it was in fact an entire year before I completed the main questline and I'm glad that I did wait before I did so because it was an incredible day (I binged for 24 hours straight, with no internet guide to keep me from stumbling). Epic battles, evil monsters and edge of your seat quests as the story unfolded. Ending with the giant dragon in Imperial City and the equally giant battle with the Oblivion monsters which ended in victory for my character (conjurer/destruction/staff type of guy). But before all that I completed the fighters guild, mages guild, dark brotherhood, thieves guild AND arena questlines. I experienced nearly all of the Vanilla game before the main quest, and that it how I think this game ought to be played. At the time, this game was so huge for me, it blew my mind in so many ways. I spent every other weekend at my dad's glued to his 42"" plasma screen playing this game for hours. Questing, exploring, conquering, trying out new builds and playstyles. Every session I discovered something new in the world. It took me weeks of playtime to experience this game fully, but I definitely have done everything there is to do in this game, including making a ladder of paintbrushes to break into the Arcane University prematurely to enchant my gear with chameleon and thus become invisible. Or duping 100 steel swords randomly in the middle of the market district.. Hey, the exploits were just as fun as the game itself sometimes!Seriously, this game defined my existence from 14-16 years old. I'm 24 now and it's still just so good. It's not AS huge as it was, but going back to all of the old towns, the old dungeons and remembering the location of EVERYTHING is priceless. I used to lose myself in this game for hours and get lost in the game itself too. The little details I can recall with alarming clarity too. Like the bandit on the long bridge just south of Imperial city. Or the layout of all the old forts and where the enemies are and how many there are and what weapons they usually spawned with. The enchanted glass helmet in the sunken ship at the very bottom of the map I happened across one day exploring. Amazing...I could continue to ramble, but you get the point. If you haven't played this game, I highly recommend. It is better than Skyrim in every way except in graphics- but you can fix that with a few mods and then it looks just as good if not better. I have a lot of hours on Skyrim too, but far more on Oblivion. This game, it is THE game of the decade I feel and the work BSW put into it in unmatched. The attention to detail is insane and the storylines are immense. The soundtrack too, is incredible, and I'm listening to it right now with tears in my eyes writing this review and remembering that time in my life when everything was so bright and good and the only thing I had to worry about was when I was going to go to my dad's house next to get lost in Cyrodiil.

												This was my first ES game... and what a game it is! There is no other game where I could just be lost in as much as this one.Everything about it is just MAGICKAL, this fantasy world grabbed me by the shoulder and it presented me with this amazing story and lore! But, somehow, I feel it brought me more than just that, something I cannot describe right now... maybe its just nostalgia talking? I do not know. Maybe there is something to do with the countless hours I spent just thinking about how Tamriel works and creating countless stories about random people and recreating the main stories with concrete characters just so I can proceed to playing the game interpreting them. Well, we'll never know. Shout out to the guys who made Morroblivion, this mod brings the God-tier (literaly) Elder Scrolls: Morrowind to the graphics of Oblivion, thank you for making me experience that!			"

I don't think a fantasy RPG could come close to what this game can do considering it was almost 10 years ago.Considering the original pc version, xbox 360 version offline hours on this I must have played 800 hours-1000 hours over the years. And I could still easily play this game and find something new.From its rich world and cities that just feel.. right.. real.. to its radiant AI system and the main quest being enjoyable while being rather questionable.This is easily one of my most favourite games ever and likely always will be.

												Bethesda Softworks has made a name for itself by making games that were WAY too ambitious for their time.Oblivion is no exception, when i escaped the first dungeon, after fighting for my life against some cult known as the Mythic Dawn, i had absolutely no idea what to do next! And the great thing is, i didn't have to do anything. Oblivion is the sort of game where you are encouraged to walk the woods picking up daisies or to go hunting deer. There are so many things to do! If you are someone who is new to the fantasy/rpg genre and eager to get your feet wet, then Oblivion is for YOU!Enjoy :-)			"

												What is there to say about Oblivion, aside from it possibly being the last great RPG that Bethseda has made, or possibly ever get around to making. It comes from a time when Bethseda was changing markets, from PC based RPG's, to more casual easy to pick up games. It also came at a time when games were first marked with the treachery known as DLC. It would be a lie to say that Oblivion does not suffer from this casualization to some degree, the forefront simply being that system requirements for consoles forced the devs to reduce content in a lot of areas. namely spells such as levitation or jump from Morrowind as players would be able to fly over city walls that simply had to be closed off. It also brought along click and go fast travel. Morrowind was all about exploration, getting lost and killed was all part of the game. This lost feeling never really happened with Oblivion. However, along the lines, Bethseda never really was sure about everything. they still had proper enchanting and spellmaking, they still had very good quests and something that Skyrim was never given. Character building. Simply being able to set up your character made the game feel whole. Bethseda's has always been bad with supergod main characters over agent of change characters for RPG's... but in the sense of the universe, it makes sense, for who the character is. Skyrim didn't give you the opportunity to set up your character. You could be anything. Oblivion, you could be anything as well, but at least you still had skills you were mastered in, attribute's about your person you can change. Morrowind, you better make damn sure to use the skills you started with until you had the gold to start training in them. before that, well, you better select some Magic skills if you wanna even talk to someone from the Mage's guild. And the quests. If I said gravekeeper would you know who I was talking about? what about this 50 gold for a set of nice silverware. mother? Ayleid statues?Cheese, Yarn and lettuce? if you don't, well, you should. if you haven't played it, you would instantly know why you remember these once you do. because, unlike future games. questing involved questing. not going into a dungeon dodging skinwalking jerky geezers who occasinally yell at you so hard you roflcopter the floor whilst saving the day from bad dragon. or another settlement needs our help.

												I've been playing this game since release date. This many years on I am still addicted. My hours of gameplay time only reflect my playtime since buying the Steam copy in 2014.If there is any game I could call perfect; it's this. As a long-time Elder Scrolls fan, dating back to Morrowind on Xbox, Oblivion is my favourite game in the series; and in the world.Nothing will ever compare to the beauty of this game, no graphical or combat improvements will ever change how I feel about TESIV: Oblivion.If you're someone looking to play this as you started on Skyrim or ESO, all I can say is GIVE IT A CHANCE! You're never a true Elder Scrolls fan if you don't like Morrowind OR Oblivion. Only REAL fans like these games. I shall never accept anyone saying this game is bad if they have only played Skyrim or ESO. Because you are noobs and aren't open minded.TAMRIEL AE DAEDROTH!I love you, Oblivion. xxxxxxxxxx			"

												It says I only have 3.5 hours on this (as of written review), but that's through launching it with steam, I've sunk at least one thousand on my old 360 back in 06-07.I know more people are familiar with skyrim, so if you've played skyrim and want to check out oblivion, here are some things you need to know.-Lock picking system is very different and can be much more challenging at the higher ranked locks.-All the npc's kinda look fat and ugly. (you'll have to get used to it)-The terrain is a lot more lush with green forests, not like skyrims winter tundra.-Every NPC ♥♥♥♥ing hates your guts and doesn't suck your ♥♥♥♥. You're no dragonborn here, your practically a nobody until the near end of the game.-No duel weild magic and swords.-Dark Brotherhood, at least I think, is a lot more fleshed out with better quests.-Modding community is not as alive as skyrim (but it's there) and oblivion doesn't have the steam workshop supporting it. You'll have to use nexus if you want to mod, although the vanilla game is tolerable.-Voice acting I thought was a lot nicer, I can only hear that one male nord voice for so long.There are plenty of other differences but to me both games are just as good even with their differences.9/10			"

												Dear God This is a BEAUTIFUL GAME. The Gameplay, The Feel, The Intensity,The story,... THE WORLD. Oblivion is a truley aspiring and wonderful addition to the great Elder Scrolls Saga. in my own opinion , Oblivion dominates over its very successful predecessors, those of which all have thier own very unique and lovable aspects and styles while still maintaining the entire feel of the series. Although I have played (with intense Love) Skyrim for many years (even after playing the entire Vanilla + the DLCs) I find my self going back to the one before, OBLIVION. when I play in this world, i feel a greater response to the environment of the game and what it offers than that of which I do in pretty much any other game. Aside from my personal view, Oblivion (for its time) had exceptional graphics and overall quality,compared to the games of our later generations, it still rocks the boat, (and seems to still be loved pretty much the same if not more than when it was in its new released years, ((when it was brand new)) .I love the Game, Thats all I need to say, but if ya wanna hear a better response than this ^ just message me.-SaltE60			"

												I have been wanting to review this for a while on Steam. When I first picked this game up in 2007 for the Xbox 360, I fell in love with The Elder Scrolls at a level Morrowind could never install upon me.62 hours played? That's on the Steam version. I have well over 1500 hours invested in this game. And there is STILL a bit more ccontent I haven't covered.  Mostly small things, like fetch quests and in 100% honesty I have never gotten around to finishing the Knights of the Nine DLC.Visually, the game hasn't aged very well. Combat wise, the game is rather simplistic. Let's talk about those.Now I usually don't take visuals too seriously, but keep in mind a game of this scope back in 2006 didn't have high requirements for visuals. A lot of people complain that the faces of most of the human races look really odd with questionable colouring, and that Orcs just look like green humans with different lips and teeth. Completely true. However, that doesn't really do much to your immersion, in the long run. The enviroments are huge, the number of running proceses overturns the 300 mark, and in 2006 you couldn''t have good graphics, a huge world AND good performance all at the same times as loading areas smoothly and quickly with no FPS drops. For what it has to work with, the visuals at the time were very good. Well done, lads.Segmenting towards gameplay, let's talk about the combat. If you have played Morrowind, it will feel dumbed down, if you have played Skyrim it will feel rigid and overly fast-paced. The combat AI is pretty bad. I'll give you a rundown of every enemy's AI:Melee Weapon equipped, no Shield.:If the enemy is visible, attack it. Between every 3-5 basic attacks, use one of 3 power attacks. If low on fatigue or have just used a power attack, block for a few seconds. Successful block means it's time to basic attack 2-4 times. Restart cycle. Never block if you are a monster like a zombie, troll or bear, but do block if you are a Ogre, Spider Daedra or Mountain Lion.Melee Weapon and Shield: If the enemy is visable, charge in. Do same formula as with no shield equipped, but block before each cycle and power attack if the opponant attacked you while blocking.Ranged Weapon:Fire when visable. Step aside between each shot. If enemy is close, switch to melee weapon if one is in inventory. Magic User:If it breathes, cast a spell at it. If it is close, use a touch spell. Use melee weapon when they are close, then back up after 1 cycle. Yeah, not the smartest combat AI ever. If they have a low movement speed, you can literally just kite them with a longsword, spell or bow, and they will never once change tactics. Bad AI is bad. But when not in combat, they are generally interesting. They react to your crimes, reporting them to he guards or shrugging it off depending on how much they like you and what factions you belong to, and each and every civilized NPC has a full in-game month's worth of routines - shopping, sleeping, talking, running around on a horse until they get killed by highwaymen... very detailed stuff. The rest of the gameplay is what makes up for the poor combat. Oblivion was designed as a story and world-centric RPG, rather than a combat-based one. You can spend 200 hours just shopping and decorating your house alone. Did I say ""house""? I meant ""houses"". There's 8 of them, without DLC. I personally wish the Shivering Isles Expansion - the biggest expansion for the game - had a house you can buy within the Shivering Isles. It's a new map to explore, with crazy good quest lines, and possibly the best Daedric Prince of them all, Sheogorath, Prince of Madness. Let me give you some of his Scottish-voiced lines:""I once dug a pit and filled it with clouds....or was it clowns.... it doesn't matter, it didn't slow him down. But it really began to smell! Must have been clowns. Clouds don't smell, they taste of butter. And tears.""""I'm a little busy here! I'm trying to decide what to have for dinner. Oh, how I love to eat. One of my favorite things to do. Go talk to Haskill, he's got more brains than a brain pie! Ooh...brain pie... perfect! ...Care to donate?""""Wonderful! Time for a celebration... Cheese for everyone! Wait, scratch that. Cheese for no one. That can be just as much of a celebration, if you don't like cheese, true? You've run a maze like a good little rat. But no cheese for you yet. Well, maybe a little.""Sheogorath is a riot. He'll keep you coming back trial after trial, just to hear some of his amazing rants. He's easily my favourite Elder Scrolls character.You cannot trade between shops to earn income like in Fable, which is unfortunate, but also stops getting the best items early from being too easy. However, with a lot of trading done, you can buy and sell for the exact same price, making late-game adventuriing fill you up with so much cash that you won't have anything to do with it all... except buy more houses and fill them with the rarer spoils of your journeys.The map, like I mentioned, is HUGE. the outter map is almost the same exact size as Skyrim, however there are much, much more dungeons and caves to explore. The map is litered with them, all of  them unique in one way or another. I just there were more old forts and ruins with bandits and marauders instead of monsters, vampires and spectral-kind. Finding the correct armour peices can take quite a long time. Needless to say, at the very least this gives you more incetive to explore. Once you finish a dungeon, don't forget about it entirely. Give it a few in-game weeks and the place will be full of new inhabitants, ready to be cleared out of your favourite treasure trove once more. Class specifications can be a bit... pointless. 90% of the time, unless you are hardcore into RPing, the best class is a Thief-Battlemage-Assassin-Warrior-Illusionist-Bard-Healer. Yeah... lategame you just kind of stop specializing because there is a poor integration for choosing your specific, well-thought custom class. You eventually will just start specializing in everything, rather than being solely a mage or a theif. Because  the game is so unstructured, the only way to get your perfect fantasy is to handicap yourself with strict RP rules.Speaking of RP, this game is a goldmine of oppurtunities. I have been streaming my RP playthrough of a theif who uses non-combat magic to get away with his endeavors. Using Invisbility spells to pass by unnoticed, life-detection to know where the enemies are behind walls, and should I run into a pickle, I can dice them up and place them on a hamburger with my dagger fit for Chef Ramsey. (I don't know how Chef would respond to a Argonian Meat Burger, but I'd imagine it would be something like ""THIS LIZARD IS SO UNDERCOOKED A SKILLED VETERINARIAN COULD STILL SAVE HIM!"") You can live a life as a dashing warrior, a powerful wizard, a simple townsfolk who is secretly the guy murdering all of the beggars and sucking their blood from the neck... you name it, you cann RP it. Except Werewolf. Sorry, Twilight fans, no re-enacting New Moon for you. Oh, and tons of small bugs. Double-equip a scroll that you have multiple of and drop an item. Bam, unlimited gold if you sell them, and duplicates of your favourite decorations. A few rare, but still present, glitches that make quests uncompletable. The game is massive, the game is immersive, the game is unbalanced. The game is exciting, the game is relaxing. My wife's legs really need waxing. I do like this game, Sam I Am.A solid 9/10 Final Verdict. The game hasn't been aging well, so play it while it's still a technical marvel. Not out-of-date yet, but then, what or who truely marks a game as timeless?			"

												First off, I own Oblivion as a non-Steam game and I've spent well over 75 hours playing it.Secondly, this is probably my favorite game ever made. It's definitely on my top five games ever. Oblivion was my first Elder Scrolls game, so the outdated graphics and gameplay didn't bother me even though I got it in 2014. The combat is basically like slicing butter, but it's fun. I love how vibrant and human the ""potato-head"" NPCs are, and how colorful Cyrodiil and the Shivering Isles are. The soundtrack is the best ever for any game. I actually bothered to purchase it on iTunes.Oblivion is a game I'd want to live in.Buy it. Buy it now. Even the horse armor.			"

												After playing Oblivion, I can see why many people love this game. It has many features missing from Skyrim, such as equipement decay and spell making (that's awesome). One thing I don't like about it, is the combat, it's very slow, and well I like faster combat. The quests are very nice and creative, such as the one where you go inside a painting. The guild quests are very nice. The Fighter's Guild was very boring in my opinion (The Companions had a better questline), the Mage's Guild was okay (The College of Winterhold is sort of similar), the Thieve's Guild actually made me feel like a thief, the Dark Brotherhood was also nice with lots of twists and murders. Then you have two great DLCs, one with a short but good story with good rewards and the big one that gives you a new land, weapons, spells and laughs. Buy this game, don't let its age fool you (there's plenty of mods to change your mind).			"

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

It has very nice looking graphics and all...The main storyline is awesome.There are several factions like The Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, Mages guild and The Fighters Guild that you can join.Also there is a lot of side guests to do.There is an arena you go and fight on or then you can go and wager on it.There is a lot looting to do and caves to rob...You can also make your own potions, enchant items and make your own spells!You can buy and decorate houses as you like or then you can just break into someone else's house and pretend it's yours...You can get robbed too.You can kill people stealthly with poison apples...Or then you could just go hunting or just talk to everyone...And if you have Game of the Year Edition Deluxe you will have many awesome DLC's too.The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: 10/10 Best game of 2006 and one of the best games of all time.

												I would like to start this out saying I played Skyrim before I played this.  I went in with Skyrim is my favorite game ever.  Now i'm torn.  Even with Skyrims overall gameplay and graphics being better (due to it being a newer game), I still think Oblivion is a tad bit better.  The quests are better.  Which does it for me.  The Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild quests are soooo much fun.  You are able to immerse yourself in the world that is Tamriel so easily.  Sure there's like..7 voice actors.  But I don't care.  The one complaint I have about this game is that it isn't controler compatible on PC.  I prefer mouse and keyboard, but sometimes my boyfriend is using the desk and I am unable to play.			"

												An epic, truly epic. Of all proportion  The game will draw you in and take you into its self, it is so immersive and in my opinion the greatest of all role playing games. The feel is so geniune, so original and so magical.. it's like watching a medieval fantasty film from perhaps the seventies.. if you can imagine that and have a splendid feeling, then you must be interested.  There is no comparison to this. Absolutley not. It is far too spectacular in its glory for that. Now you must understand that this game brought me into the world of role playing games, my favored genre, for their humming realism and grand feats of imaginative speldour, I got the game of the year edition, and that disk span in my xbox for well over well, my save game had 657 or so days there. I would say around three thousand hours I have played Oblivion.  Now one who has the skill to tell a detailed tale of their adventures in life may do so wonderfully. I belive it would take me much more practice to do enough justice that would suit my liking to this game. I will only ramble on at things that come into my mind.  So for the overall aestheics... oh man. words really cannot do justice on this. It is something very very special. Now this does give me nostalgia and so I am being biasedly complementary here, I remember the smells of snack food like oranges and the smell of meat and pasta, or any other combination.. and dust.. dust gives me much nostaligia of earlier days. This goes well with the theme, a quite colourful and dainty civilisation, obvious fantasy articles and easy lovely heads up display : ). Please man, if you like, check out a video of some menial gameplay from someone else, to get a feel of what this is like  I shall get into some gameplay descritions now, (which I must say are not entirely top notch) as I say, you must be imaginitive! That is the magic touch, for me at least.. well they go so well if you add your own self to it :), so they work simply, and add no mess, like they are working real time and are a glance at the world, moving you ever further.  Now I hope I do not have to tell you what you can do! As with many other games of its kind, you can... go foraging in the forest for example, find fruits & berry leaves for example, and go to a station of which you can work to boil up potions... you can do the vast array as normal, with no taints, no faults.  I am telling you, this is a super extrodinary game. A pioneer! I suggest that you must own this game, you know there is a balance of, mountains and snow, swamp and rivers, grassy hills with nearby caves, farmland and noble cities.. creatues galore, none out of place or without a story intertwined. The serenity.  Oh my I could call this perfect. I do love it. Well that is all I shall say, for if you do not know of The Elder Scrolls then, I say get to.			"

												Mini-Review for Oblivion, requested by an user.The question I've received: With skyrim having a great modding community, is there any reason to still pick up Oblivion?Well, Yes. But allow me to explain.Skyrim has the better graphics, better soundtrack, better combat, better ai, yada yada. All the stuff expected from having a better engine.While vanilla oblivion in itself can offer you a lot:A main quest that's of a grander scale as the one in Skyrim.Far, far more side quests.A plethora of explorable areas.Actually more in-depth factions, reputations and guilds.Better item distribution and item quality dispersion(when do you get this/that type).Enfin, the real question is: All that vanilla stuff is great, but it can be modded into skyrim as well!Well... Oblivion's mod-database is still far greater than the one skyrim has to offer as of now.Graphics and Music can be easily improved, especially in the realm of character textures.I'd personally also recommend many of the city overhauls and terrain improvements.However, the real treats are in the more complex mods. Oblivion has had a far larger amount of time to develop it's mod pool and thus has far more complex mods for whatever tickles your fancies.In short: If you're in love with modding your Bethesda games, Oblivion is certainly worth picking up and is easily moddable to your heart's content. Even if you're not into modding the game itself holds its own unique charm and well worth experiencing, especially if it happens to go on sale!So, hereby answering the request: Oblivion is a must have if you're fan of the TES series, well worth considering if you love modding games, worth a try if you started at skyrim and wondered what events lead to it, and if you're new to Bethesda's TES series a fair point to start.~Rose			"

												TES IV: Oblivion is my personal favourite RPG of all time. The athmosphere, the gameplay, the music, the roleplaying action, the potato faces, i love it all. The game obviously have flaws, but the good outweights the bad by a longshot, and it is one of the greatest gaming experiences of my life.I havn't played it a lot on PC. I have about 500 hours on the Xbox though. ( Didn't have a gaming PC as a kid ).			"

												I'm not going to give this game a negative review because in no way does it possibly deserve it; Oblivion is one of the best games ever released, and with mods can easily compete with modern titles such as Fallout 4 and GTA V for amount of content. That said, buyer beware; the game is not well optimized for modern PCs, and will (not may, will) crash in inconvenient points, and even worse randomly corrupt save files. Keep multiple backup saves if you do decide to purchase this game for PC.			"

												First off, I have over 300 hours in this game on Xbox so don't be fooled by my low playtime on steam. Secondly the fact that I have over 300 hours should tell you that this game is worth playing, if it isn't enough I break down what makes this such a great game and where its strengths and weaknesses are in this review.      Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is an open world role playing game that emphasizes on player freedom, exploration and creativity.  You play a prisoner of the imperial army who meets the emperor while he is trying to covertly get out of the city when a cult of assassins are killing members of the royal family to wipe out their bloodline. During the games tutorial you get recruited abruptly to help guard the emperor during this escape. Here you will get some insight on how to play the game and how the character progression system works as well as a taste of the lore of the elder scrolls universe. Once this brief but effective tutorial sequence is over you emerge a free man/woman free to do WHATEVER you want.  You can take part of all number of activities and explore the vast province of Cyrodil; you can sink hundreds of hours into this massive very in depth game.      The things you can do are extensive in Oblivion. There is the main story which is engrossing and varied though a little on the shorter side. There are four guilds you can join complete with their own quest lines which are all fantastic and very interesting with cool characters and feel distinctly different from each other. There is the ""Fighters Guild"" the ""Mages Guild"" the ""Thieves Guild"" and the ""Dark Brotherhood"". There is also the arena where you engage in gladiator style fights with some of Cyrodil's greatest fighters and most viscous beasts. You can also visit shrines of the various gods in the game and do quests for them, these are some of the best in the game and all are unique and yield cool rewards. There is also a plethora of quest's to do for the citizens of Cyrodil which are amazingly mostly unique and quite fun. There are countless caves, castles, and other locations to find and explore. There are houses through out the game you can buy and decorate ranging from shacks by the water the exquisite manors. Of course you can also spend hours on hours training your character and interacting with all the npc's in the game. The amount of content in this game feels endless and can be binge played all day, day after day with always more content seeming to pop up all over the place.      Oblivion takes place in Cyrodil as I mentioned earlier in the review, the central province in the continent of Tamriel. Cyrodil is the seat of imperial power where the Septim bloodline has reigned as emperor for generations. The Septim bloodline has a power, related to the gods themselves and they now face being wiped out by a sinister cult whose motivations are dark and mysterious. The Elder Scrolls series is rich with lore, Bethesda invented gods both ""good"" and ""evil"" with personalities and beliefs all unique from each other. The relationships the gods have with mortals are very interesting. You can spend hours reading the various books in the game learning about Tamriels history and learn more about the various groups and their own history, it's insanely extensive.      The gameplay is an interesting but mixed bag. The graphics look dated, the animations are clunky and the voice cast is extremely small for a world with so many people in it but it's pretty easy to overlook with all the goes right in the game. For combat you can use melee weapons ranging from swords to maces to axes as well as ranged weapons like bows. Magic is also very prominent in combat as well as for utility in the game. Combat is kind of stiff at times but it works fine and is easy to get the hang of. The leveling system is one of the elder scrolls’ biggest strengths and weaknesses simultaneously. You level your character by leveling your skills, these skills vary from ""Blade Weapons"" too ""Lock picking"". Leveling you skills increases your overall level, so if you spending all your time leveling utility skills like ""Alchemy"" and ""Athletics"" but without leveling your combat skills like ""Destruction"" magic or ""Archery"" your character will be poor in combat which will make getting things done difficult. It’s also important to think clearly about what kind of character you want to make, this will determine what skills you should focus on leveling in the early game, once these skills are at an adequate level you can then branch out into other skills that are catch your interest. Leveling up other skills will allow making your character more malleable in different situations. Remember, solving all your problems by swinging an axe into people's heads isn't the best way to handle all situations. Also all the music in the game is fantastic.     In the end, when you take all the good and the bad together you have an imperfect but very awesome RPG. You can lose all your spare time for a long time with this game, and you will love every minute of it. The two DLC's that the game of the year edition comes with, ""Knights of the Nine"" and especially ""The Shivering Isle's"" are fantastic extra content, the latter is one of the best DLC's I have ever played. It's like a whole game in itself almost. This is a fantastic experience and I would recommend it to anybody. 9/10			"

												It's an amazing rpg, what more can I say? The graphs are overall good, combat is ok, and the setting is superb. Personally I feel this is one of the better roleplaying games out there, in terms of immersion. The character creation is especially detailed, allowing you to create complex and interesting characters. The world is huge, but not so big that its overwhelming. Whenever I play this game I almost always have an interesting adventure with some kind of story, just from the complexity of the world. It's a game in which you can just play and enjoy, without relying solely on premade quests to keep you interested. Overall I would strongly recommend this game.			"

												Here I am, in 2016. This game is 10 years old. (Roughly half my age.)This was the first real RPG I had ever played.At first, I thought this game was horrible, mechanics were too complex, animations were too stiff, and the zoom-in-on-your-face dialogue was a real suprise.But after continuing to play, I fell in love. Every faction, every city, every dungeon, and like 70-80% of the characters are beautifully made. Character progression is flawless, you can actually see and feel yourself get more powerful throughout your playthrough. NPCs will have conversations with eachother,(that may or may not be centered around the main character.) I know of at least one NPC who even will actively try to steal things from other NPCs. And the stories packed into this game are just great. Bethesda manages to inject even the most simple bear pelt-gathering quest with life and personality. And if that isn't enough, this game has two add-ons that could easily be full games on their own, equal in depth, and life.			"

Since then, I've played Morrowind, Fallout 3 (as well as New Vegas from Obsidian), Skyrim, and Fallout 4.  After coming back to Oblivion on PC with numerous excellent mods, I'm inclined to say that this might be my favorite out of all the aforementioned Bethesda games.  This game is a masterpiece.			"

												I've played a lot of Oblivion in my time, both on and off Steam. The biggest source of frustration was always the opaque leveling system. Recently I read a guide here on steam that made me feel silly for not getting it. The problem is that if you don't understand the leveling system, and go by the game's premade classes, it will be much harder to play once you get to higher levels. They vastly simplified the leveling in Skyrim, which is why I preferred Skyrim for the longest time. However, I think that Oblivion wins for memorable quests and characters, as well as having a more complex and satisfying role-playing experience. 8/10			"

												I loved this game on the 360, and I love it even more on the PC. With ~30,000 mods and plenty of Official DLC's, this game has massive replay value, and can be a brand new experience every time you play. If you've never played it, loved Skyrim, but disliked Morrowind, Oblivion is a great in-between-er, and well worth your time and money.The main quest, as with all Elder Scrolls titles, isn't the main focus of gameplay here, and is fairly short in comparison to the whole of the game. But even without the Official DLC's, and all the mod possibilities, the ""vanilla"" game itself can give you hundreds of hours of game time. With a plethora of quests, choices, and almost unlimited possibilities, I highly recommend this game.			"

												This is my favorite of all the Elder Scroll games, the land is vibrant and green, there are many caves to explore and the quests are more often then not very interesting and none of it feels like it was taked on filler to make the game seem longer than it really is.			"

												This game is easily my favourite Elder Scrolls Game. Perhaps because I played it first and therefore have nostalgic attachment to Oblivion; but nevertheless it is superb. The buildings, forts, caves and especially the music all create a charming, surreal and entralling atmosphere that I haven't experienced to a similar extent in any other video game. Unlike Morrowind, it is easier and some people may not like the fact you are given the exact marker for the active quest etc. Some people who have started on Skyrim may not like the 10 year old graphics which are somewhat outdated. It is a masterpiece so definitely give it a go10/10 would recommend. Very immersion, much loot, such greatness.(always resist arrest criminal scum)			"

												The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion is an open world adventure experience that (for its time) opened up to a world of incredible proportions. Get over the dated graphics and awkward dialogue and you'll be immersed in this wonderful RPG that allows you to wander with no strings attached. The game rewards your curiosity and desire to see what is over the hill and what that village you see on the compass contains. Quests of differing demands are around every corner, everything from guilds, demonic gods, counts, common folk and lowly beggars are awaiting your appearance as their everyday hero. And it comes with one of my personal all time favourite soundtracks.The game's biggest flaw lies in its level progression, like any RPG you level up with the skills you use often but the main problem arrives as the further your strength grows, the stronger the enemies of the world gets (i.e. bandits will run around with rare armour and weapons that you went through hell to acquire yourself). The combat itself is unsatisfying with magic being boring to throw and most melee combat to be block'n'slash (I heard there are mods to fix that). But once you get used to it you see a magical world with lots of adventure and people in distress to save.9/10 - ""Hey, you're the one they call the hero of Kvatch!"" Get used to that phrase, it's less impressive than it sounds.			"

												Oblivion, the prequal to Skyrim and the sequal to Morrowind, released 20th of March 2006 was the fourth installment of The Elder Scrolls franchise.There are things i think that Oblivion did better than skyrim;1. The class system was better, you chose your star sign right at the start NOT JUST THE THIEF, MAGE AND WARRIOR, all of them, your attributes and class was chosen right at the beginning of the game as well as the star signs.2. I thought that the magica system in the game was better as you could use the restoration or any destruction spell whilst wielding your weapon instead of having to unequip your weapon and equip the spell.3. I overall think that the main questline for Oblivion was better, as i spent a good 20 hours on it compared to when I completed Skyrim's questline at just 5 hours. The questline of Oblivion was also much more diverse and detailed compared to slaying Alduin which is nearly exactly as difficult to take down as a normal dragon. I found defeating Mankar Camoran was quite the challangeI'd just like to add that i totally prefur Skyrim over Oblivion just because there is much more to do in the way of exploring and the guild questlines were better in my opinion.

												Once the dust had settled I tried Oblivion for the first time in close to a decade, and I found a game I really didn't hate anymore.Oblivion strikes the balance between depth (Morrowind) and playability (Skyrim). It features very well designed quests and far more improved combat. With a world that is full of color, and a wide assortment of locations. From snowy plateaus to sandy beaches filled with twitchy Argonians.At the same time the game is still flawed. It's a game that hasn't aged very well graphically, and the RPG elements are very hamfisted and lacking. There are thankfully mods that fix all of this, and I don't recommend playing this game vanilla. If you do, all you'll find is a game filled with potato people. One where you are legitimately stronger at the beginning of the game due to how badly coded the levelling system is.

												One of my favourite games of all time. This game has an incredibly open world to explore with plenty of quests to keep you occupied. The story is brilliant .... not to mention Sean Bean's voice as one of the main characters :).  The Game of the Year edition includes two great expansion packs, Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine. There are plenty of items and weapons to collect along the way, not to mention a variety of spells to use which become more advanced further in the game. Like many RPG/Adventure games, you level up once you have exceeded enough xp points. This enables you to customize  your character and how you want to play the game, ex, stealth, melee, ranged or magic. The graphics are amazing with an ace soundtrack. If you enjoy Adventure games, you will love this game and be playing it for a long time :) 96%			"

												As someone who came from Skyrim, this was significantly different, but in my opinion a good type of different. This may be because Skyrim and Oblivion seems to focus on two different things. While Skyrim focuses on the main storyline and the beautiful world, the people who worked on Oblivion spent alot of time on sidequests.			"

												The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion... Maybe one of the greatest game's ever to be released. Made by Bethesda Softworks you can expect alot of bugs. Yet, you will see alot of adventure and interresting dialogue. The game's story is that the gates to Oblivion (AKA hell) has opened in Cyrodill, and you. A prisoner off the Imperial Prison needs to seek a way out off the prison with the Emperor, and also find the last heir to him and shut close the jaws of oblivion. The game has a great atmosphere and it has alot of enjoyable colors aswell. The areas are simply beautfull, you always feel the need to explore the open world and also help the people around you when you actually listen to all their problems.When playing you will see alot of NPC's, some NPC's will only be talkable during quests or guilds. Or they might have a quest or just be people that are there to fill the area. There is about four guilds in the game, following the Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Mage's College/Mage's Guild, and ofcourse Fighters Guild.The story off the Dark Brotherhood is that you have just been spyed on by a man when you have killed a innocent, he will tell you to kill a man (Not saying due to spoilers) when you have done so you are invited. But to the guild you will be nothing but just a new member. You do quests to advance and aqually mean something in the guild.The Thieves Guild is similiar to the Dark Brotherhood in the sneaking aspect. But you can't kill people as that gives you a boun ty. The story follows: You have been thrown in jail, the people off the thieves guild take you as a criminal now and has given you a chance to join the group. You start off as a normal low ranked member, not being of much use, but it will change when you become a higher rank. The story of the Mage's Guild is self explanatory. Mage's Against some evil people. This guild is the most boring one in my opinion, but if you're playing  a mage I recommend this guild. The Fighter's Guild, this one is very mixed for me... it didn't have much for a story except for stop that guy, do that, stop that guy. But was still very interesting and had alot of fun moments. Overall, the Elder Scrolls: Oblivion in the ends turns out as a great adventure game with alot off challenge and alot of fun, you will spend about possibly even 90 hours trying to complete everything or less if you just wanna finish the story, but then you're just missing out off the actual game. As the game is very good and still has quite decent graphics compared to some games. I give this game a 9.5 out of 10 due to how it was made and how much there is to do. The graphics aren't the greatest but are actually quite decent. This game is very recommended from me if you like adventure and RPG mashed togheter.			"

 Games Good......Needs Workshop 9.9/10 (Kidding, its 10/10) EDIT 8/23/2016: With the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim getting a remaster, I felt like I needed to get back over here, I still recommend the game, don't get me wrong on that, but the game definitely needs an improvement on the factor of optimization. This is the list of ideas I wish Bethesda would at least just toss to Oblivion to at least show that they still care on past games...- LAA Patch: Oblivion only uses up to 1.8 GB of RAM, for a 32 bit .exe, that's a pain for someone on a 64 bit with 16 GB RAM, if you are keeping the 32 bit, at least make that default like Bethesda did Skyrim. The LAA Patch would allow Oblivion to use the full 4GB 32 bit uses and honestly if they do the second option, it'll only benefit the 32 bite systems out there by a slim margin.- 64-Bit Engine: We're not asking you to just go ahead and remaster the whole engine, but considering I can get frame drops with my setup due to the engine being limited? That's really annoying, we're not asking for a revamp, but an expansion of the engine used in Oblivion to where we can basically cram more items in there.- Proper Multithreading support: I got an A10-6700 from AMD, and it's quad core. This game sucks with quad cores. Fix. That. 3/20/17 Update: Got myself a good computer over Christmas, main improvement was the upgrade to an i5-6600K....It works better now.If Bethesda believes that the task of doing this is ""mountainous"" to quote their VP for Public Relations/Marketing, hell we can probably do that with the code for Oblivion if they released that too, but I can almost guarentee that won't happen unless they completely retire the game.Seriously, I wish this had more attention, and it hasn't. Maybe because I'm the only system somehow that has issues with my game stability, I don't know. But I wish they at least took a look at the nescessary stuff........Now, because I couldn't sate my hunger completely, a few optional additions wouldn't really hurt.-Controller Support: I seriously want to use my Xbox One controller with this game, it works with 360s layout- heck I run GTA V with the 360 layout and on my Xbox One controller. But if they can release this game on Xbox, they can at least make it to where I can use the Xbox controller in Oblivion.-Steam Achievements: Same. Same exact thing. They have Xbox Achievements for Oblivion. Steam has their Achievements as well, that's not mountainous at least.-Workshop: Cause *Shrug* I don't like Nexus Mod Manager and manually downloading 20 mods when I want to can take way too long, it would be a good idea for me.So. Yeah....I wish these were in Oblivion, and I hope this game has its improvements. I know what I am saying is much, but I'm PERSONALLY (I don't know about others) asking for a PERFORMANCE patch, not a remaster, something along the lines of what I believe Asphyr did with KOTOR 2, they improved the game with a massive performance update with controller support, higher resolution support, achievements, etc. That's what I believe a good example would be of where the game can be improved in terms of the level done..If that is done, I would be playing this game so much, heck...I don't know what to say. Seriously, just make the game more optimized because it simply isn't, the rest is just stuff that I thought would be nice with Oblivion, and seriously, it's within that grasp, it won't be mountainous to do it, you just need to allocate some time, some manpower, and most especially, the money to fund through the effort. If Bethesda isn't planning on doing anything else with this, at least help modders optimize the game at least more in-depth than LAA aware and Oblivion Stutter remover, etc.			"

												The first time i played this game was somewhere around 2009 or 10 for PS3, after being hooked on Fallout 3 i thought that this game was going to be just as awesome and time consuming, but it was difficult for me to get hooked as i did not understand the lore to this game much. Fast-forward to 2011 when i got my copy of Skyrim i found that i was able to play an Elder Scrolls game, and i found it to be one of the best games i have ever played, and went well over the 300 hours of gameplay estimated for the game.After playing Skyrim i chose to play Oblivion again, and i loved it. After having a bit of knowledge on the lore and the way Elder Scrolls games worked i found that the world of Tamriel became a more interesting, and definitely beautiful place, but i never did complete Oblivion until today on the PC. (18/10/2014)I can tell that Cyrodiil is very much based on England, or countries alike; with the vast and beautiful forests to explore to the rolling fields and meadows of County Skingrad and The West Weald, i felt like i had taken a journey back in time to the days of Albion, where tales of magic, dragons and heros were told in regular supply. The experience of delving into the past in Ancient Ayleid Ruins was exciting and jumpy, and all the more rewarding once you come out with a good bit of loot, gold, and tons of welkynd stones... maybe too many, but aside from the visuals and personal experience, i found the story to be very much like the fantasy stories of gold, and i cannot believe i never took the time to follow the main storyline before, but alas, i have now completed it.There are a few letdowns however, one being the lack of variety in voices for NPCs, and the very static movement of the animations for the game. I admit this was made back in 2005 and was BGS' second major 3D game, i think, but it made the game quite immersion breaking at times, and nobody would want to be pulled out of this amazing world. Speaking of voice acting, there were times where the voice acting for certain characters were not on par with the voice acting of the regular NPCs, and i found this to be disappointing with the amount of quality this game tries to bring to the table.Graphically this game has a very artistic feel to it, for where it wants to be as realistic as possible, it still has a sense of handmade effort in the visuals that gives what you see value, because the world of Cyrodiil is like looking at a painting: a true masterpiece.So my final rating for this game is a very strong 9.2/10Before entering the world of Tamriel, i recommend looking up on some of the lore, i would recommend ShoddyCast on YouTube with it's lore series, but this game, and Skyrim, are a definite purchase.

												The king of kings in the fantasy gaming community. This game series defined what a fantasy world should be like and is the foundation of any good fantasy RPG. Though it seems old to many young gamers, this game is a must have for any gamer that loves fantasy settings. Each race in Oblivion has its own strengths and weaknesses, greatly defining each race and seperating them from everyone else. For instance, Bretons (A race in Oblivion) can wield powerful magics and start off with more magical energies than other races, though they are weaker than most. Khajit can sneak around more easily and can use their claws as weapons to hurt their foes. There are many different classes in this game, each one serving a certain role. Do you want a warrior who also uses magic? Or would you rather prefer and rouge that uses illusions to hide his tracks as he steals jewels? If you don't like any of the classes, there is an option where you can create your own class, tailoring it to your own needs and wants. Combining a magic wielding class with a race that specilizes in certain classes of magics will allow you to become the greatest mage in the world or creating a two handed wielding orc to become the most feared barbarian in the lands. And the fun doesn't stop there, each adventure is more interesting than the last. One play through may have you encounter a door to Oblivion where you must close the door before more demons pour through. Another play through may have you collect a strange weed with mystical powers. No play through is ever the same.If you haven't played Oblivion and you are interested in Fantasy Settings, then Oblivion is a must have in your library. "

Turned out, it was a nice little spot to create my own little base of operations. So, I set about to create my own little pirate haven. In looking for funds to begin my pirate operation, I became a holy knight leading a religious crusade, and now have a cult of fanatical knights serving me.

												An incredibly solid RPG. The sheer variety of gameplay elements available, paths you can take, and quests in the game make it well worth a purchase. There is no reason why any RPG aficionado should not own this title.Oblivion is far from a perfect game, but I can think of very few titles that come as close. It’s among the very best in terms of gameplay, audio, and graphics.Assuming one has a system with the muscle to run the game and the player is willing to accept some technical glitches, there simply isn't a better RPG experience available.

												Only got this on steam cos my disk copy stopped working. Been playing since it was released in 2006, and I can safely say that Oblivion is easily the best Elder Scrolls game. It's a more complex and deep than Skyrim could ever be, but also better looking and it's game mechanics are easier to understand than Morrowinds, and with none of the frustrating combat. Also IMO has the best music of the series, and it is also the only game in the series to let you have true free reign in creating your character. All the games before only let you select from a limited number of faces, while Skyrim only lets you choose presets. Oblivion has sliders which can change the shape of every part of the face. This lets you create some true ""masterpieces"" of character design:

 The storyline is also great (and doesn't have the bad ending of Skyrim) and with the Shivering isles expansion you get even more crazy. Oblivion, unlike Skyrim, also gives you the ability to create you own spells which is great fun. Only things that are worse in Oblivion are the graphics (obviously), and the combat. The combat is still good, but Skyrim's combat mechanics are much better. I would still recommend this game every day over Skyrim.			"

												People complain about ""Oh, why are you playing Oblivion when skyrim had much better GRAPHICS?"" (They always seem to spit that word more than say it.) Well, I've got news for you: Elder Scrolls is not CoD with swords. It's about the overall experience. I don't need stunning graphics to reel me in. It's also not a game series that you ""beat"". Oh sure, you might finish the main story, but DO YOU KNOW HOW BIG THESE GAMES EVEN ARE?!?!?!? If the scale isn't your reason for buying this game, DON'T BUY IT.

												Fresh off the boat from Vvardenfell, I was hard on Oblivion early on. It's appropriate to compare the two games, but not as closely as I did. And while I still got far more hours and enjoyment out of Morrowind, there was a depth of charm to its successor that I had long overlooked.On a technical level, I find little opposition that Oblivion broke new ground in making such a big world function as well as it did. The employment of Bethesda's new ""Radiant AI"" served as a welcome relief to the NPCs of Morrowind, whose highlight of day-to-day activity was walking twenty steps to the left. While there were aspects of this innovation that Skyrim would later improve upon, it was awesome to see the people around me wake up, go to work, go to the tavern, go hunting, eat, sleep, pray. Population centers felt alive and I started to feel the community instead of trusting that it was there.Voice acting was another... ""improvement."" You didn't have to read large blocks of text anymore because God forbid. Bethesda boasted that dialogue took up half of the game's data with over two full days of voice recording.When I first learned this, I felt reluctant. I feared that no matter how much voice acting one is willing to pack onto a DVD, there isn't enough time or money to capture the alluring exposition of Morrowind, the details of the relationships and backstories; no voice actor Bethesda got their hands on could hope to capture what I imagined when I spoke to a Telvanni lord.Well, I was right. Long, detailed information was butchered, mainstreamed. There were hardly any topics to discuss, and I didn't feel like I could have a true conversation with anyone the game didn't deem important enough. Talking to a random bystander about their trade not only developed a character, but the world. I didn't have that anymore. Every gender of each race (for the most part) had not only the same voice, but the same speech. It was almost silly. With the big step forward in immersion with Radiant AI and voice acting, it was a shame to take such a step back in what was perhaps my favorite aspect of Oblivion's predecessor.I also had mixed feelings about the induction of fast travel. I let it go; if I wanted the immersion, I could always refuse it (even though I knew any such commitments wouldn't last). Looking on the bright side, I could enjoy completing quests and keeping the story going. Returning instantly to the doorstep of my favorite places would help me savor and rediscover them, when before I might have put it off for dread of the trek until I was too powerful to care. So, while I will always appreciate the punishing journeys of Morowind, I suppose I can mark fast travel as a net positive.And they finally added horses to make travelling faster!Um... okay. Maybe they would provide some other combat or burden benefit?No. Not really. So, uh... moving on.The graphics are beautiful. Stunning. I was impulsively critical of the ""normality"" of the setting compared to Vvardenfell. Yes, Cyrodiil is more familiar, but in hindsight I don't see why I should have trouble accepting that this particular part of a much larger and dynamic fantasy world is simply inspired by Medieval Europe like many other works of fantasy whose familiarity I forgave, even welcomed. Maybe it's because I expect more from a game, maybe it's because the story left me wanting (which it did, but it's not that simple--- more on that shortly). The vistas of Cyrodiil ran unrivalled in gaming at the time, and few with today's technology can match its brilliance, especially when considering how interactive and detailed every yard of it is. Now, Dagon's plane of Oblivion, for which the game is named, that's where I stop defending the lack of inovation: classic Dante. And Daedric architecture was, altogether now, far more intriguing in Morrowind.Just as Oblivions's landscapes hold up today, the general facial designs of NPCs were subpar even then (aside from the beast folk, but then I resented that they were streamlined to equip footwear).But where did Oblivion shine? Where did Oblivion not only stand up to Morrowind but arguably surpass it?The faction questlines.The main questline was not very interesting (still blows away Skyrim), though it managed to turn out a few likeable characters (Baurus, Martin, uh... Jauffre was okay, I guess). But the faction quests were truly the greatest strength of a solid game. Morrowind's were less linear, giving players the choice of advancing through work in different parts of the map (the superior concept, in my opinion); Oblivion allowed a single path, but not only provided a heavier narrative, they gave the feeling that you were part of something. Both systems have their strengths and weaknesses, but Oblivion's Mages Guild combined the two...You had to impress the leader of each installment of the Mage's Guild, each with their own personality, style, and agenda, much like Morrowind. Once they are in agreement, you're rewarded with access to the previously locked mechanic of magic-making and enchanting in a place that felt like a functioning school. There, you work your way from grunt to archmage in a series of quests that begin benign but gradually rise in importance to the finale. Was it perfect? No. But the structure and pacing brought the experience to life for me. I enjoyed every quest.In terms of story, the best of Oblivion (and the series as of Skyrim) was the Dark Brotherhood. The characters, the atmosphere, the plot and the individual quests were beautiful. Sometimes it felt like a different game entirely. I'll never forget when it was all coming to a head, I stepped out of a lighthouse and the brutal, depressing scene it housed, and spent a quiet moment watching the sun break the horizon over the sea, uncertain of the future. It was magnificent.The Thieves' Guild came close to the mages guild in terms of structure, and close to the Dark Brotherhood in terms of story: a well-balanced and enjoyable adventure.Oblivion's factions set the bar, and I couldn't wait to see what Skyrim... well, we'll get to that another time.Finally, on to combat. Yes, it's more fun to swing a sword when the sword is going to hit its target, and the employment of modern physics made it satisfying to knock your enemy over a table with a deathblow to the face. What's more, Oblivion did what I would have sworn was impossible: it made magic even more useless than it was in Morrowind (at least then you could cast offensive spells through items--- laughably overpowered, but I loved it).When Bethesda made Oblivion, they set out to build a whole new game from the ground up. As to be expected, there were changes that I liked, changes that I didn't. Did Oblivion stand up to Morrowind? I think not, but given the style of its development, it didn't have to. I can't help but respect Bethesda's willingness to drop all their assets and start anew. While Oblivion belongs to a series, it belongs to its own part of the series, just as Cyrodiil itself lies as its own little world in widely-varied Tamriel, and in ways neither can nor should be compared to the others.In the end, we need to be realistic: how many games lie outside Bethesda's world so big, where no matter which road you choose, whether you take a road at all, you know you're going to find something worth seeing? That is the marvel of Bethesda, the greatest RPG developer there is.			"

												'The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion' is one of my  favorites games and played this game way back in middle school. Coming from 'Morrowind' this game is a vast improvement in nearly every aspect. Morrowind is my personal favorite amongst the franchise, however, I'm not going to deny that Oblivion is an amazing game in nearly every aspect. Coming from Morrowind, this game blew me away back then since it vastly improved the visuals considering the dead and volcanic region of Morrowind is really contrasted with the bright and colorful vibrancy of Cyrodill. The whole game is alost like a painting since it embodies the typical fantasy aspect of Role-playing games since it's so bright, colorful, but has its dark corners that just beg to be explored. In terms of content, this is packed with several places to explore, all the guilds you are already familiar with if you're coming from 'Skyrim' (e.g.; Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, Fighter's Guild, and Mage's Guild). With that said, Oblvion's flaw with exploring ruins is that the ruins are practically copy-and-pasted. You explore caves and ruins throughout the map of Oblivion, however, they all seem to be very similar in style to the point where you feel you're exploring the same ruins. I remember it was a bragging point from Bethesda prior to Skyrim's release that every dungeon was hand-crafted, meaning that no two places were the same. Although, if you're new to Oblivion, I believe you'll be enamored with the content of Oblivion that you'll always be entertained. Whether it be side-quests, guild quests, you'll be too busy having fun to notice this flaw until dozens of hours into it.Another preference I have for this game is that the aforementioned praise of Oblivion's vivid world also contrasts it from Skyrim since Skyrim is supposed to be more dark and appears to have a gray filter slapped on it. This game feels more alive in that sense, but it's all in preference since skyrim is practically the land of vikings and mountains so each Elder Scrolls game has appropriate tone to its environment. Furthermore, I much prefer the combat in Oblivion since I love the physics in this game. Seriously, you can shoot someone with an arrow and they'll do a backflip before they ragdoll to the floor. It's awesome. In Skyrim, it's meant to be more realistic so they improved the physics so that they fall more realistically and they even added dual-wielding which was a big added feature. This game lacks dual-wielding, so if you're looking forward to that, sorry bud. On the bright side, the combat is much better to that of Morrowind's since they got rid of the ""dice roll"" mechanic where you would miss despite them being right in front of your face.			"

I saw a mudcrab the other day.Also N.B. I am not necessarily a fan of Role Playing Games.The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is Bethesda Softworks' blockbuster and hugely popular open world lite role playing game, set in the medieval fantasy world of Cyrodiil.The gist of the main storyline is that the Emperor, Tiber Septim, is assassinated literally 10 minutes into the game by a cult worshipping Mehrunes Dagon, who aims to invade the mortal realm and ask the kitchen sink of humans, ogres, dwarves, elves and assorted petting zoo people, to submit to literal hell. Following your convenient escape from the Imperial Prison, you play tennis with the required artifacts with this cult and the Daedra, and your goal is to restore stability to this world.It's a 2006 game, and for its time I will admit, it looks decent. From a technical standpoint in particular, the real time shadows are remarkable, while artistically, the bloom post processing works rather well to give a fairy tale feeling. Unfortunately, the big graphical offenders are the crude animations and the character faces, good god.Voice acting is hit or miss, usually miss. The spoken voice lines often sound different between one another and there's no consistent tone. It feels like about 10 people total voiced every single character in this game. The rest of the sound design is just about average, with other small blemishes.Gameplay is where the big problems arise. Improving your skills is done by performing the feats associated with said skill: Armorer is increased by repairing weapons and armour, while Destruction governs use of offense magic spells. You have 7 Major Skills personally assigned at the start of the game, and increasing these skills by 10 points across the board will allow you to level up the next time you sleep, after which you decide which of your main Attributes you want to increase. In theory, sounds good. In practice, the existence of level scaling enemies means that, in the game's vanilla state, you have two practical choices: get your pen and paper out and keep track of exactly which Skills you have improved, to maximise your Attribute gains at the next level up, or outright skip levelling up and fight, loot or interact with whatever using just your beefed up skills. Attribute level up bonuses scale with how much you've improved your skills, so you can end up overlevelled and underskilled, and mincemeat for the other baddies in the game unless you either mod the game, keep track of your skills in a manner that defies roleplay, or outright skip levelling up, also defying roleplay. It is probably the worst levelling system I've seen, where unless you play in a specific way, you won't stand much chance against future game challenges without lowering the difficulty.The world is fairly large and stocked with places to venture into, and side quests to complete. For the most part, they're passable, they give me, an action guy, a chance to mash and bash things into pulp. The stealth system is fairly robust, though it gets ridiculous later on where a skill in the high 70s and a ring of 20% Chameleon will make you literally invisible to certain enemies, even as you push them around. MagicMagicka is an important asset to most every creature capable of casting it, with a variety of effects ranging from standard fireballs, lightning strikes, frost attacks, heals and buffs, to summoning minions to fight alongside you, granting water breathing or water walking, and even skipping the lockpicking and persuasion minigames. The lore is huuuuge, as kind of expected from a series apparently spanning 10 years from this game's launch. I'm sure avid followers of the lore will find every little error in continuity to nitpick on, but I'm personally rather impressed on the number of unique NPCs, lore books and other fluff to make it feel like a lively place. If anything, this does it better than stiff, robotic NPCs doing the same routine every day, but that one's partially excused because otherwise quests would be way harder to complete.The base game might be a mixed bag, but mods most certainly make it much more bearable, and much more fun. The modding community is incredibly devoted still to this 10+ year old game, continuously putting out updated graphics mods, a more modern and conventional levelling system done via quest completion, rebalances, new magic spells and weapons, new creatures, and even riding a Nine Divines damned dragon.The basic storyline with minimal sidequesting will last about 20 hours, but finding everything will take you way, way longer. It's kind of addicting, and it's got its own charm.If it's cheap enough and/or you're an RPG-lite fan, this is worth a play, most certainly. For everyone else, mods are your allies, and you should still give it a whip.			"

												It is an absoulute astonishing game I love it, I was introduced to it 5 years ago and STILL play it to this day. It is a HUGE game to spend great time and hours either looting through caves or pickpocketing the town folk or even doing quests , The main quest is great (I will not spoil it for you) but even when you complete the main quest I guarantee you will NEVER treck through all the caves and ayeleid ruins on this game or ever complete. It is better than skyrim becuase of the great looking graphics its AI might be bad at times but overall it is a great game to be made in 2007. I hope you buy this game.

												Oh... OH...! This game. oh my god, this game, its just so good. Coming from someone that didn't play the originals, which I've seen some of but haven't really played, this game is just fantastic. The story works so much nicer than Skyrim's where you are 'The chosen one' type of story, common.In this game, you start out as some dude in prison (not unlike any other Elder Scrolls game) and are thrust into a world of crazy ♥♥♥♥ to deal with. But instead of being 'The Chosen One', youre just some guy through the entire game that just happened to be in the wrong place at the right time. You get released from prison and walk around doing whatever you want. Theres not many side quests like Skyrim has as you can beat the entire game fairly quickly. And unlike Skyrim, some of the best weapons you get yo have to spend a 3 month hike trying to find and then when you do get it, oh boy, its life changing.If you've played Skyrim and enjoyed it, then play this and enjoy a real game. Sure theres less mechanics, but its by far not E rated like Skyrim, made for kiddies was.			"

												Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is one of those games where you can fully immerse yourself within it's environment and society. The world (called Cyrodiil)  has multiple regions of landscape, all giving you a taste of wildlife and roleplaying elements, like old, swampy caves or a great fort in the uplands of Colovia. Everywhere you go you can interact with the environment, from plants and mushrooms to animals and NPCs.When you open the grate out of the sewer for the first time you realise the immense beauty of lake rumare, but thats the tip of the iceberg. You could if you wish, follow the main quest, and complete it how the developers thought it would be like. Or you can find your own path venture into an unknown cave, or explore the Imperial City's marketplace and see what it has to offer.The game has oppertunities to be each class as you will, and a race to go along with it. You could be a High Elf Mage, the Arch-Mage of the Arcane University, or a Nordic Warrior, leader of the Fighters guild. There is a great range of quests to complete and level up your character. You may want to find certain items and loot dungeons to find them, while selling what else you find.The Shivering Isle DLC, lets Sheogorath the Daedric Prince of Madness invite you to his realm, where everything is run a whole lot differently. The Knights of Nine DLC sends you on an epic quest, to defeat Umaril, who threatens Cyrodiil, while worshipping the Nine Divines. Depending on which pack you brought, one edition will come with four DLC houses, each with their own quest, and some other miscellaneous DLC.So go explore Cyrodiil in all its glory. Be a Warrior, or a Thief, or a Mage or even all of them together! Thats the thing with Oblivion, its an inviting world at your fingertips that will never get old.However they could patch up on the Havok Physics a bit.			"

												Oblivion is the sequal to the critically acclaimed TES 3 Morrowind, and predessessor to the well-known Skyrim (TES 5). This time it is set in Cyrodiil, the Imperial Province of lush forests, snowy mountain caps and dark swamps, all to be explored at will. There are nine major cities, Anvil, Kvatch, Skingrad, Chorral, Bravil, Leyawin, Bruma, Cheydinhal and the Imperial City, plus many other minor settlements, temples, farms etc. Right at after character creation, you are taken by the Emporers guards on an escape from the palace dungeons, before he tasks you with delivering the Amulet of Kings and shutting closed the jaws of Oblivion. From then on you have the entire province to explore at your own will. You can join guilds such as the fighters guild, basically the legal vigilanties of Tamriel, the mages guild, who are basically the wizards of the empire, the thieves guild, which is an illegal guild of robbers and thieves, the dark brotherhood, who are the spiritual assassins who worship Sithis and the Night Mother, and the Arena, which is pretty self explanetory.A good understanding of TES lore is recommended, and will always make the game feel more real. I recommend this series to bring you up to speed. https://www.youtube.com/user/ShoddyCast It will inform you on the many races, religions, provinces and more that exist on Nirn (It also explains what Nirn is). Or you could read the many ingame books as an alternative.The only downsides I can think of is the chat system, which is a little outdated, and the stupid essential NPCs. Unforunatly they removed Morrowinds 'you can kill anyone, as long as you can deal with the consequences' system in favor of appeal to casual gamers. These don't damage the overall game too much, however.9.1/10			"

												Say what you will about the repetitive oblivion gates and the potato face character models, this game is a triumph in open-world gaming.  Radiant AI makes the game feel much more alive than previous Elder Scrolls installments.  The Dark Brotherhood faction remains the single most intruiging questline I have ever played in a game.  You will hear npcs telling rumors of events that you yourself participated in, making you feel that your actions have had some impact in the world.    The Shivering Isles expansion that comes with this game is probably the best DLC I have ever played.  It is arguably a tighter experience than the base game.  Morrowind fans will likely experience a bit of nostalgia from the alien landscapes featured.  This game's only real problem is that everything that it tries to do doesn't always work as intended.  This is most obvious with how npcs interact both with you, and with each other.  You can have a perfectly pleasant conversation with an npc, only for him to tell you to shut up and leave him alone when you say your goodbyes.  While this is oftentimes comical, it is also immersion breaking, which is a bit hit for a game whose biggest draw is making you feel like an inhabitant in a living world.  Also, dungeons can feel a little repetitive, as designs are often reused.  It's hard to have every dungeon feel unique when there are so many of them in the game, but I would still expect a bit more variety than what we got.  I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys rpgs or open world games.  The amount of solid content you're getting for 20 dollars or less is incredible, and should not be passed up.

												My personal favorite entry in the elder scrolls series. Graphics and combat mechanics may not fully be up to par with those of skyrim but do not let this games age fool you. Oblivion has a great world to explore with a very fulfilling main questline and plenty of equal if not more exciting side quests and questlines. There is so much to do that you will never get bored! 10 out of 10 in my book.			"

												Having played Skyrim first, I was afraid that Oblivion was not going to be able to impress me just due to the sheer step backward in innovation and technology. However, I was proved very very wrong. If you have already played Skyrim and liked it, or are just interested in the series, I can highly reccomend this game. Give it time to fully immerse you. Give this game a chance. It is a huge, with hours upon hours upon content. Oblivion surprised me in that a game much older than it's succsesor still held up to the gold standard put forth by today's games. If you liked any other TES game, or even Fallout, give it a go, it's only 5 bucks! (I actually reccomend the Deluxe Game of the Year Edition, you get more content for 1 dollar more.)			"

												Not the best one but the one I spent longer on than any. This TES epic was the bane of my existence on xbox and I racked up more than 100 hours just trying undo the vamprisim - at the time, I had very little college, no job and no internet. Oblivion was the perfect game to eat up all the extra time, sometimes spending 12+ hours on a day (without DLC) - The GOTY is worth every penny, I haven't even scraped the surface but now with work, relationships and animals to look after, my oblivion days are very limited. If you've never played a TES game, get the ♥♥♥♥ out and do so now! Oblivion has all the ingredients of a perfect RPG you can just sit back, smoke a joint and binge to high hell on for many, many weeks. Cannot say enough about it without ever saying too little, just buy it and play it to high hell.			"

												some people say that oblivion is much worse than morrowind, that it is boring and so one.i played oblivion a lot and i can say that it is different to morrowind, but still good. i can agree that the main quest is not very astonishing but the thing about TES is that main quests didn't really matter because there is so much other cool stuff in this universe. once i had to travel through the painting into the painted world to save his artist. the other day i participated in vampire hunt which was started by the vampire himself. once i got A REALY LOYAL FAN who followed me EVERYWHERE. the other day i stayed at the inn located on the ship, and while i was sleeping that ship was HIJACKED BY PIRATES. and so one and so long, so many fascinating adventures!the most interesting part was the shivering isles addon. i suggest you first to finish the main quest (if you want to finish it sometimes) and only than go to the shivering isles, because this one is so good, and everything else is less bright after it. this sheogorath guy, he knows how to entertain!oh and i have an announcement for my fellow argonians: YOU CAN WEAR SHOES IN THIS GAME.

												In my opinion, Oblivion is the best out of all 5 of the games in the series. (Yes, even Skyrim, don't kill me) It's better because It has charm for days, the storylines and quests are engaging, it has Patrick frickin' Stewart, the combat and magic are tight, the voice acting is loveably campy (plus it's leaps and bounds better than that of Skyrim), one of the best DLC add-ons ever (Shivering Isles), Criminal scum hating guards who loathe when you violate the law,  Patrick Stewart, ingenious spellmaking and alchemy systems, you can actually see the sun, HORSE ARMOR, THE ARENA, A CASTLE YOU CAN LIVE IN! And did I mention PATRICK DAMN STEWART!?With all that said, the number one reason why this is better than Skyrim is: in what the heck other game can you go on a bloodthirsty massacre across the countryside and get off with a slap on the wrist, but get sent to rot away in prison for months for merely touching a noble's tweezers!?

												Fantastic game and a masterpiece. While some of the voice acting and graphics are bad and outdated, the storytelling and the gameplay bring out the brilliance of this game. The lore of this game brings you into it's world and makes you feel as the adventurer you are playing as. Gameplay is well engaging except for some problems that affects leveling and monster scaling. Monster scaling was not implemented well, I personally had no problems with it but I know of past horror stories of ""facing certain monsters is hard"" or ""the monsters were too easy once I started leveling"". Certain scaling elements slow down the battling but not much that causes this game to be unplayable.The main story writing is great as it shows how you are not the main character but as the catalyst that brings the Oblivion Crisis forward. Each of the Guild's storytelling try it's best to make you a part of the guild. Each guild has different strengths and helps raise your character for leadership. Each of the DLC's has the Bethesda touch to them. A couple masterful story-based DLC and immersion DLC. A lot of people could argue that the Shivering Ilses DLC is better than the base game. Each character has their own backstory and motavation that is found out. Dialogue in-game is some of the best writing in any game. Sadly some characters lose their impact because of the voice direction choice, of each race having the same voice character with not many pitch or tone changes. But several characters stand out. The skill and attribute system is somewhat towards the classic RPG feel and actually effects your character in-game. Animations in the game are not super diversed but is immersive. After puttting in a lifetime of hours in Oblivion in all platforms PC is the ultimate tier of playing this game. Not only does PC help strenghten what consoles failed to work with being on PC offers mods. Mods also offer ways to fix the usually Bethesda glitches and mechanics. Mods have been made for more than 7 years now and is still being made today. Any RPG fan should definitely play this game and live through it's worlds.I could just sit here and tell you what Oblivion did better than Skyrim or Morrowind or tell you what Skyrim or Morrowind did better than Oblivion. But there is no reason, they might be continuations in the series and its lore but each game should be measured by themselves rather than the other games in the series.			"

												The Elder Scrolls IV is a game that is munch between The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind's gaming legacy and the extremely popular Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Many people would ask, Should I get (or still get) the Elder Scrolls IV? Of course. Oblivion is well known for its scenery, extensive side questlines, and a remarkable story. The game has aged and its skill system will make newcomers rage (the skill system is mediocre at best, but it not really good). Oblivion was one of the first role-playing game that I've purchased for the Xbox 360 back in 2006. The game was really popular back then with so much things to do. Spend hours exploring caves and dungeons. Become the Grand Champion in the Imperial Arena. Become the Grandmaster for the Mages Guild, the Leader of the Fighters Guild, the Master of Thieves for the Thieves Guild. Each character you encounter would have a unique personality and would have a quest for you to do. The soundtrack for the game is absolutely the best and it would make you just sit and relax just to listen. There are varieties of environments in the game, ranging from the spring-like setting, the pouring rain in the southern side of the map, to the blistering cold in Northern Cyrodiil. If the setting of Skyim makes you a bit...""dull"" (meaning that you are tired of playing  the dominated wintery and snowy map of Skyrim), you can come back to Oblivion where all kinds of weather is featured in one game. Like other Elder Scrolls games, Oblivion should be in your gaming library. For gamers that had played Oblivion before, its time to return to Cyrodiil.			"

												STOP!YOU VIOLATED THE LAW, by not playing this game.Oblivion is the first RPG i ever played back in 2008 when I had it on disc (don't judge me) AND I LOVE IT WITH ALL MY NONEXISTENT SOUL!You have the freedom to do whatever you want from the beginning of the game **Spoiler Alert**  after getting out of jail **End of Spoiler Alert**. This freedom can include anything from buying bread to satisfy your nonexistent hunger to punching people in the face. And then you have the main story and a billion other sidequests from potatoe faced townsfolk and guilds.Most of the DLC's are also good but the shivering isles is the best DLC I have ever played adding over 10 hours more of gameplay (and the best character ever, Sheogorath CHEESE FOR EVERYONE!) but then there are pointless ones like horse armour which should have just been free in an update like the mounted horse combat in skyrim. The player homes DLC are also pretty cool, the best of them being the fighters stronghold but the wizards tower is also pretty damn cool.And not to mention the modding community which is still alive and well after like 8 years of the game being available which is amazing and there are some great mods like Elsweyr Deserts of Anequina (which may have been taken off of oblivion nexus)that adds an entire new country to explore with new monsters and rideable elephants.10/10 would violate the law again.

												I only have three hours clocked in on Steam, but on the 360, I've probably spent hundreds of hours of my freshman year in high school walking against a wall to build up my sneak skill.Oblivion was my gateway back into the world of RPG's after I had strayed off into the void of CoD and similar titles. A friend of my older brother had let us borrow a handful of games for the 360, and this was one of them. While my brother didn't touch it, I took the leap and tried it out. It was love at first sight.And I'm 99% sure that I never gave it back to the guy.Anyways, everyone looking at this game is probably comparing it against Skyrim: which should I buy? My answer is definitely both, they're both worth the money. I've literally bought both of these games twice, putting my investment into these games close to 200 bucks, and I don't regret it, not even a little bit, but if you have to choose between one or the other, here are the pro's and con's for both games.Oblivion:+Hundreds of hours of gameplay+Highly replayable+Great character customization+Great storyline+Great not-storyline, seriously, just wander into some town and you can    go days before you remember that the world is in chaos+I personally like the alchemy and speech functions in this game, but I    know some don't+Spell crafting, OMG!!!!-Graphics are now dated-On Steam, there is no controller interface :-(-No dual-wieldingSkyrim+Hundreds of hours of gameplay+Highly replayable+Great character customization+Great storyline+Great not-storyline, same as above+Dual wielding+DRAGONS!!!+Very deep-running political agendas in-game+SMITHING-Shouts are lame, I think :-p-Not as much weapon or spell variety as Oblivion-Graphics are better than Oblivion, but some things are just ehh-Landscape isn't nearly as pretty as in OblivionAll the negatives are purely from nit-picking, there is absolutely nothing about these games that I'd consider as being ""deal breakers"". Buy. Play. Devote your life to Talos today!			"

												I cannot even begin to explain the massiveness of this game.  Very much like Skyrim it is completely open world, RPG brilliance.  From the very start the choices you make, and quests you complete start to define your character for the hero they will become.  Right off the bat i am going to give this game a 9/10.Story:  Oblivions story is centralized around the idea that Tamriel is in chaos because the emperor was mmurdered, and without a new emperor to light the dragonfires cyrodill will fall into darkness.  In addition to this massive panic towards the death of the emperor, Oblivion gates (Virtually gates to hell) start opening up all across the province.  It is your job to go in and destroy these gates, and crown the new emperor for Cyrodill.Factions:  I have to say that this is possibly one of the best faction systems in any game.  contrasted only by Skyrim.  The way it is set up allows for multiple factions at once, and allow you to become the almighty ruler of them all.  The factions are: Mages Guild, Fighters Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, and The Arena, other lower end factions also exist but these are the ones with the most quests involved.  Each of these has a seperate unique storyline that from time to time will also cross into other factions.  Quite revelating.Visual Appeal:  My computer has an I5 processor and was able to handle almost everything on completely high res (with the exception of shadows and sometimes water), but with that in mind, and the fact that this game was released in 2006...8 YEARS OLD, its still incredibly beautiful!!  The view of the landscape that tranistions from Grasslands, to forests, to the jerall mountains, to the swampy regions of Leyawiin...Takes my breath away.  Though other Elder Scrolls games primarily focused on one regions appeal, morrowind to swamp, and skyrim more to snow, this game perfectly incorporated all regions as it was central bound.Gameplay:  This games main focus revolves around classes that fight in unique way, while also simaltaneously questing.  These mechanics are very strikingly similar to the Legend of Zelda, and if you have ever played a Zelda game, you know perfectly well how exquisetly it accomplishes this.  There are three basic classes, warrior, mage, and thief.  All three of these have their attriubtes, but the remarkable thing about this game is that you can freely choose what you want!  Though choosing your base class at the beginning with determine what skills you are more adept at, you are still able to combine any skills with any other skills.  If you want to be a battleaxe wielding, light armored elf with excellent conjuration skills. You are able to do that no problem.  This system allows you to perfectly mould out your character to what you feel would suit you best.Quests:  If you do somehow manage to beat all quests in the game, then sir i owe you a gold medal.  If i recall correctly i believe there are around 500 quests in the game to do.  Which some can be completed by simply delivering a package, while others like the main quest will make you toy around for 10 hours before being completed.  The multitude of quests in this game is astounding, and will have your interest hooked for the long haul.Final Impressions:  Oblivion is by far my favorite fantasy game of all time let alone my actual favorite game of all time.  I personally own about 5 different versions of the game because of my love for it.  Though it says on my steam profile i only have 9 hours on PC, i had approximately 50 hours on my other steam account, and on xbox...i would be baffled if it said anything less than 600.  This game has a deep connection with me because of Bethesdas brilliance to bring forth such a revolutionary game such as this one.  Even if this genre is something you cant see yourself getting into, i challenge you to play at least the tutorial, join a single faction, and kill a baddie or two and tell me it hasnt captured your interest like it did mine.  In conclusion this is an amazing game and a must buy for every person who has steam. "

												If you're debating on buying this after playing skyrim, just go into it with an open mind yes it might look worse etc and yes it may not have as many features as skyrim, but in my opinion this is way more polished and interesting than skyrim due to the amazing quest's easter eggs and such i mean it may be the nostalgia talking but i've had more fun playing this than i did skyrim.P.S Don't let my low hours fool you, i played this for near enough 1000 hours when it came out on the Xbox 360 xD			"

												My local mall had a Gamestop that is now a fragrance store. One day little old me wonders into Gamestop to look at the new games they have and Oblivion catches my eye. “Huh, Elder Scrolls? What's that? The cover and screenshots on the back look cool” I said to myself before going to the register. It was sunny and I had a cut on my hand from my grandmas cat. It's weird how you remember stuff like that. I go home and install the game on my families computer in the living room and was hooked on just about everything about the game. The freedom of exploring, the locations you get to visit, the quest lines, everything just blended together so well to create an open world fantasy RPG. Sure there's dumb stuff like characters looking like potato sacks and there only being 3 voice actors and some bugs, but they all added to the charm of the game. Oblivion is probably my favorite game of all time for sentimental reasons. I played the hell out of it and want to introduce it to my nephews(who are already into games like Zelda) when they get a little older but until then I would wholeheartedly recommend Oblivion.			"

												The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is by no means an inferior product to the excellence that is Skyrim... In fact, Oblivion thrusts you into a completely unique and enjoyable setting with it's very own quirks and traits. Gameplay is the most simple out of the trifecta (Morrowind, Skyrim), but it's the visuals, the outstanding soundtrack, and the immersive, breathing, world which lend to the game it's very own flair - it's own brand of flavor, not any worse, and yet, not any better then it's respective ""siblings"". With it's very own memorable moments - and yes, it's glitches, Oblivion still manages to dole out an impressive array of content (yes, even the horse armour...). Overall, Oblivion stands tall in regards to the quality of the given product, and is a must have for any fan of the Elder Scrolls series.			"

												When this game first came out, I only was only about 10 or so. I only got to play it every now and then on my brother's xbox. Going back now and really getting into the game, it still holds up. I always had fun with this game back in the day, and it's still incredibly fun. It's a game where 10 years later, you'll still find new things in it. 10 years later, the graphics are a little dated, but not horribly ancient. However, the story and the soundtrack more than make up for the now-dated graphics. This game is one of my all-time favorite video game soundtracks. God bless Jeremy Soule.			"

												I can still remember when I first got The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. My older cousin was playing it, and after only 20 minutes of running around as his character, I was utterly hooked. I was about...16 years old? Perhaps younger?The game itself is, for it's time, revolutionary, and it pioneered an entirely new kind of open world RPG, with 'no' invicible walls except for the required ones to put a limit on the generated world. Other then that, every door, was accessible somehow, and every plot of land was reachable. There was not a direction you could not go in Oblivion, and as an RPG, that made it priceless.The game also hosts rather higher tier voice acting. For example, Patrick Stewart(Also famous for starring as Xavier in X-Men, and Captain Jean Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation), lays voice to the majestic Emperor Uriel Septim, whom you meet during the tutorial of the game.The game, for customization, offers an impressive array of possibilities, with multiple races, hair styles, and direct face molding sliders to make you look truly unique(Or outright silly). It also offers a believably long winded skill system that permits you to become more talented in certain professions and skills as you perform them.As with most Bethesda developped games, Oblivions Engine is uniquely compatible with 3rd party Modification software, allowing Mesh, Animation, and Scripting artists etc. to work almost entirely independantly in the game, limited only by the game's graphical capabilities, and their own imagination. The amount of modifications(Or mods) released for Oblivion, is vast, but has since been passed by its successor; The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim(I should mention that Oblivion by storyline standards, happens 400 years before Skyrim does, and takes place in the Tamrielian province of Cyrodil, the homeland of the Imperials)Some individuals will argue that Oblivion is unplayable without mods, but I must say, Oblivion is one of the only games released by Bethesda that is truly a remarkable, fulfilled, well thought out and extremely precisely and expertly executed video game that by no means requires mods to be playable.On a scale of 10 hearts? I give Oblivion an 8.5 hearts. The game's higher tier voice actors, coupled with its engaging story, and the impressive free roam oppertunity, the large cult following and the engaging, high quality modding community, this game is, in on itself, a culture, and I would dare to say that you cannot call yourself a gamer without having walked the adventure filled, dangerously beautiful landscapes of Tamriel, and its many unique provinces.

Don't Miss This Post-Modern ClassicAlthough I may view other games as being objectively better, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is the single-player game I will always go back to. It is more than a game to me. I view it as true Post-Modern art and something of a lifestyle choice. Bethesda tried to recreate little parts of reality in the interactions between customized NPCs and their scheduled AI. They failed horribly and created instead listless deformed humanoids that lack the intelligence to do little more than bump into one another and echo the same conversation they heard from their previous collision. They lack the social awareness not to steal apples in front of a crowd of guards, nonchalantly stumble over corpses in the town square, or calmly approach a man wearing the recently murdered Emperor's robes.These NPCs do not resemble human beings at all, questionably apart from their character models. They are insane, compulsive, and often ghoulish creatures. (Searching through random NPC houses will commonly unearth dead bodies, Dread Father shrines, and other signs of repulsive activity.) It is inspiring in a way to see a thing so close yet so distant in reference to human society.Bethesda realized all of this in a moment of unbearably historic revelation and started work on the game that marks their Self-Actualization -- Shivering Isles. The people of Sheogorath's realm, the Shivering Isles, are each driven mad and suffer from individualistic fixations. Creating a society of manic and demented people is precisely what Bethesda was meant to do with their perfect skillset of brilliant writing, AI that requires specific targets and times, awkward animations, and ugly character models. Instead of accidently creating a weird RPG, they intentionally directed their labor to the highest-valued function. Shivering Isles is absolutely entertaining to explore as a result.As a whole, there is an impossible amount of content to experience. For nearly 10 years of consistent play, every new game has revealed new quests (some that don't appear in the journal) that I somehow missed. The quests are consistently hilarious and even have expanded my vocabulary. Exploring is vastly rewarding, as you can discover schedules, backgrounds, and dark secrets of NPCs. There are a fair amount of treasure and unique items hidden about the world, as well. (This contrasts with Skyrim's limited content that ends in repeating quests and NPCs that reveal all there is to know about themselves in 20 minutes of town dialogue.) The game is not without its problems. The dungeons are cookie-cutter and rumors are oft repeated. The combat is stupid, but if you are playing Oblivion for the combat...(LOL). The clothes and armor are not as pretty and differentiated as Morrowind's, but you can still make a few cute outfits. If any of Oblivion's shortcomings bother you that much, though, the modding community has more talent and creativity than the devs.I unfortunately lost my disc 1 while moving, so I repurchased Oblivion on Steam recently. This edition has no problems on my Windows 7 and comes with Shivering Isles and the objectively trash Knights of the Nine thing. (It's boring, has rewards that could only impress a lvl 10 and can be completed in one sitting.) That's fine, tho', because Shivering Isles alone is worth the MSRP of this product. Heck, even just the soundtrack is worth the MSRP.			"

												Before I bought this through Steam, I spent thousands of hours playing it. I'm so glad it's available here. No more scratched discs. You can't go wrong with a title that inludes ""The Elder Scrolls,"" well, unless they put ""Online"" after it, but that's another story. The Elder Scrolls games are deep, rich RPGs with so much to do you can get lost in them for weeks of real time and forget the outside world exists. I find myself using terms and quotes from this game when I am forced into real life, hoping, desperately to find others like myself. If you do something to anger me? ""Hope you rot, criminal scum!""There was a girl who suggested I play the previous Elder Scrolls game. She gave me a wonderful gift. I forget her name. I forget everything that happend after I got it installed. ""Another satisfied customer.""This is a true roleplaying game in that it lets you be whomever you wish, advance in whatever skills you like and live however you want. Go play the main quest, help the people out or just ignore all that and explore, find your own path. No one is going to force you to save the empire. Don't want to be a grand hero? Fine. How about becoming a thief instead? Perhaps you'd like to gather exotic ingredients and make powerful potions to try on people or even sell. Become a master mage or a truly accomplished assasin. Either way, make your mother proud. There's so much content I am incapable of writing intelligibly about it (or some would claim anything else). There are many races of people and humaoid creatures you can play. There's a full political game, crime awarness and punishment, people to impress or alienate, and a kingdom to save or doom. I'm sure others have written about all that. If you haven't guessed, I'm a fan, big-time. This is perhaps the best money I ever spent on Steam. I mean, if I calculate what i spent on every edition I have ever owned and divide by the number of enchanted hours I played, it would come down to less than a penny an hour to be absolutely delighted. Did I mention I like the game? The selection of weapons, armor, people, places and things to do is dizzying. As I said, I've played it thousands of hours before I bought it on Steam and I've never felt I've explored the entire game. I would MUCH rather go back and play it some more than write a decent review of it. There are currently 27,787 user-created MODs for this game on just one website, adding even more to the game. This makes the game infinately replayable. It also means a LOT of other people love it so much they made their own stuff to place in the game. Adding MODs to this game is very easy and extremely fun. I saw something about dated graphics, but here's where it gets good. There is a HUGE modding community that has not only added characters, quests, locations, and everything else conceivable to the game, but they have visual and sound creations to bring the dated game to modern standards.  I am delighted to announce that this game runs better than ever in 2016 in Windows 10. You can make it look and sound more wonderful than when it first shipped, back when it enslaved us in the greatest addiction of our lives. Okay, so I started the game in a dank, stinking prison cell. Wait. I thought this was supposed to be a fantasy. I don't like it when games are TOO close to real life.....			"

												I'm going to start off this review by saying that I've played this game from a disc since the year it came out (so pretty much for ten years lol)  and only recently got the steam version, so I would say I have 2000 hours + on this game. So I know what I'm talking about when I talk about this game. Character Customization The customization is great and leaves you with infinite possibilities to making a character.There are 21 skills and 8 attributes in Oblivion, allowing you to customise a class and a birthsign to give boots to certain skills and aspects of your character.This brings me onto the  leveling system At the start (when you choose a class) you can choose seven skills to be your ""Major skills"". You will get a +20 boost in each one and you will level up these skills much faster.Also, upgrading these skills allows you to progress to your characters next level. You can now upgrade your attributes based on the skills you learn. Story/Quests This game is story rich and you will absolutely fall in love with it if you like RPGs.The main quest itself is epic and will take you a while to finish, But the game has SO much more than that (not to mention DLC).With 200 + unique quests it will take you years to fully complete this game and even when you have, there's always Knights of the Nine and the Shivering Isles which add so much more to the game. Graphics/Visuals Obviously this game is no match for Skyrim and GTA V but the graphics are amazing for 2006 standards, and are still alright for today's standards.This game looks great in terms of landscape, it's full of colour and very vibrant. (In my opinion it looks better than skyrim)But overall this game's graphics are pretty good and the general visuals of this game are very appealing, and you can run the game on a toaster. Soundtrack This game's soundtrack is one of the best out there IMO. The main theme of this song is instantly recognisable and very fitting to the story. (The opening cutscene still gives me chills when I first hear the main theme) Interface You can enter the main interface by hitting Tab. This contains your Inventory, Spell menu, Journal, Map and an overview of your skills. Each category is like a drop down menu, which is very easy to navigate. Modding Modifying this game is very easy and mods can easily be activated and deactivated in the launch menu. Some recommended mods:- Midas Magic- The Lost Spires- Cheidenhall Pet Shop- Rebuild Kvatch DLC Buying DLCs adds so much more to the game, though i would only recommend the Shivering Isles and maybe the Knights of the Nine.The Shivering Isles is like another entire game. It has a completely different world (you can easily travel between the two using a portal), it has new monsters, spells, and of course quests, with one main quest and several side quests.The Isles itself is a very interesting place with insteresting places and people, including Sheogorath, the Madgod, the insane ruler of the Isles.I would give TSI 9/10.The Knights of the Nine is pretty much just another main quest added to the game, and I'm not going to lie it's pretty fun. I would give it a 7.5/10 SUMMARY (THANKS FOR READING THIS FAR) This game is simply everythig you could ask for in an RPG. It's exciting, epic and just a great experience. A must-have for RPG or Bethesda fans.If you haven't played an RPG before this is a great place to start. With adjustable difficulty you can learn the game pretty easily.I would completely 100% recommend this to anyone. It's just an all-round good game. If you are buying it I would recommend the shivering Isles too, as it adds alot to the expeience. MY FINAL RATING TES IV (without DLC): 9/10WITH DLC: 10/10!!!Just... just buy this game			"

Also thanks to modding community, Cyrodiil is still an amazing place to explore.Until now TESIV's details surprise the hell out of me, even watching the Blades fighting you will receive skill bonus. Although some background stories related to some quests is not as obvious as you imagine, once you try to dig into it, you can find a completely new aspect about the event you currently involved. This is the most interesting story-telling style about TES series, and I love it, totally. My gameplay time might give you some idea ;) Just friggin' buy and play it!			"

												Amazing combat system, amazing atmosphere, takes you into a glimpse of the good and bad, poor and rich. The cyrodilic land of one of my favorite race's: The Imperial's. The heartland inhabitant's of the empire. This game will take you into a literal RPG and will give you shiver's from walking into a dungeon, a heartwarming welcome when you enter a town and be approached by your fellow friend's you meet on you journey's. I've logged in 1000's of hours into this game, read every book, did every quest, had every item, enchanted with all possible enchantment's, and casted every spell. Every town has a diversity, you'll want to go to the one's you're most welcome at. Every character has a specialty, you'll want to focus on your favorite's and never regret it.10/10 Even when compared to its better-half, Morrowind. "

												Don't let the hours on record fool you, I've sank hundreds of hours into this game on my PlayStation 3 and will soon delve ack in on my PC.TES:IV Oblivion is my personal favorite fantasy game in existence. Does it have flaws? Yes. Is it as action packed as Skyrim? No. But there is a beauty to the game that screams ""I'm worth your time"" and it delivers. Main Story: 5/5Magic: 5/5Graphics: 3.75/5Combat System: 4/5DLC (Shivering Isles): 5/5Side/Misc. Task Quality: 5/5Dungeon Quality: 5/5Follower Quality: 2.5/5See? Not perfect. But the game is beautiful. If you are looking for fast-paced COD-esque action, go somewhere else. However, if you are on the fence about getting this game, get it. It's got some problems and short-comings, though nothing perfect is flawless.I give this game a 5/5, call me biased, if you dare. Just make sure you have a lot of time to kill when you get this.

												This game embodies what every open world game should be, the ability to choose how much of the main story and which elements you want to follow. You could do a mix of main and side quests as I do on most of my playthroughs. Another option is to only pursue the main quest line, and then once that's finished, delve into the rest of the world. Or you could choose to ignore the main quest entirely and play 40+ hours of interesting side quests fleshing out the rich, beautiful world the characters inhabit and then come back to the main quest line only once you've explored the entire rest of the world.I would also suggest looking into mods once you've played through the game a time or two as this could add hundreds of hours of gameplay, scenery, and characters that are as good or better than the quality of the original game.(Although I'm new to this game on steam, I've played hundreds of hours on my original physical copy.)

												Not my first Elder Scrolls experience, but definitely my first to actually beat. The main story is entertaining and will take 20-30 hours to complete. I somehow managed to accomplish that task at level 5... and as a vampire. The enemy level scaling is very evident and proves to make the game far easier than it should be. That being said the interaction you have with the people of cyrodil are the main attraction. you'll take missions ranging from destroying oblivion gates to massacring a house full of guests agatha christie style. Plenty to do and much to see, Oblivion earned the title of Game of the Year.			"

												Oblivion is a great game with some large problems. It has good enough graphics and a good story, with well-done guild missions and beautiful cities. Oblivion also has one of my favorite soundtracks, with music style changing based on where you go or who you meet. There is a lot to explore, such as Shivering Isles, and even more with mods. These add up to create very memorable moments; however, like all games, there are problems. The outdoor areas in this game are usually extremely bland and boring, making exploration repetitive after a few hours. You will not see all the varied landscapes such as in Skyrim, each one hand-crafted and beautiful. The enemies level up as you do, so you will not find rewards by leveling up. When you are level 5, bandits may have weak armor and weapons; when you are level 20, they have tough armor and good weapons. You will find them in very formulated patterns, such as when you walk along a trail and see each enemy standing the same distance away from each other, each one standing motionless in the middle of the trail. This makes the game feel less realistic. That leads me to the game's biggest fault; the combat. Combat is literally bonkers compared to Skyrim. Enemies soak arrows and take hits like a sponge. In Skyrim, I could take down an enemy fairly quickly by sneaking behind them and slitting their throat, I could take someone down with a few arrows, and I could kill with a few hits of a sword. In Oblivion, I can recall shooting about ebony twenty arrows (at least) from an ebony bow into a bear until it finally died. It took about 15 ebony arrows from an ebony bow and 10 flare spells (very weak) to kill a bandit. However, it is easy to enjoy the game while acknowledging these faults. Don't think the bad outweighs the good, because it doesn't. Oblivion is a great game, and if it had a good leveling system, combat, and hand-crafted environments, it would be the best Elder Scrolls game.			"

												The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, now offered as the GOTY edition, is one of the most famed role-playing games of its time given its huge open world. Set in a fictional universe where knights, orcs and elfs live, Oblivion offers a magic and worthwhile experience that allows you to explore a world set in medieval times. However, it should be noted that the game's engine suffers from a few flaws (mouse acceleration, occasional crashes, etc).			"

												Offers infinite replayability and hours upon hours of gameplay and exploration.There are hundreds of quality (...or at least entertaining) mods out there to enhance or add more to your experience as well.The amount of hours I have in the game right now are only from one run through the game, and I still haven't finished the shivering isles.I do have one major criticism however, and that is the level scaling. The enemies level with you. Those random bandits you had trouble dealing with at the beginning of the game? Well, they're going to have gear on par with yours or maybe even significantly better than yours as you progress into the game. It really ruins the sense of progression. However, this can be fixed with mods though if you don't like it, like most issues in the game. (Though I kept it the way it was)			"

												If you are planning to buy the game be sure to get the Oblivion GOTY deluxe edition to avoid the disappointing discovery that you missed out on some DLC. There is no legit way to upgrade from the 'normal' GOTY to the GOTY deluxe version besides buying the whole game a second time. As Todd Howard said in an interview about Oblivion: 'We made the game for hardware that doesn't exist.' Ten years after release that turns out to be a good thing. You can play Oblivion in 4k right out of the box and it looks pretty good with all settings on ultra high. If you invest a little time in modding the visuals are on par with Skyrim. Don't take complaints about the dated graphics to seriously as more often than not the underwhelming hardware is to blame.Like in the other games of the TES series you face a huge open world and the main quest being not stellar is not bad either.But the main quest is not what most players love to do in an Elder Scrolls game. It is the masterfully created living and breathing world with hundreds of side quests that keep you playing for hours and hours with always something new to do for you. And some of the quests are really memorable and I would go so far as to say the best in the franchise.The soundtrack by Jeremy Soule is spot on and one of the best you'll hear in any game. Shivering Isles is the best expansion I've ever played. See? I could go on and on. I should at least mention the massive content the modding community has contributed over the years. Giving you many more hours of enjoyment.All this can be yours for a few Septims - I mean €/$. You owe it to yourself to try it out if you are into RPGs. Oblivion is not a perfect game by any means - but it is very good and a technical masterpiece.			"

""This is the 27th of Last Seed; the year of Akatosh 433. These are the closing days of the Third Era and the final hours.. of my life.""And so begins one of the most popular RPGs of all time. A fantastic example of what a modding community can accomplish, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion has nearly unanimous love amongst the community, even after 10 years since its release. If you've played any of the Elder Scrolls before, from Arena all the way to Skyrim, then you'll probably already know what's in store but if you're new to the series, then you absolutely owe it to yourself to play this as soon as possible.Though still a flawed gem, this revolutionised the role-playing genre back in the day and marked the bittersweet end of the isometric days of Baldur's Gate and its ilk. A huge step up and a breath of fresh air in a saturated market, the success of Oblivion was primarily due to its ability to perfectly combine so many elements together while still producing a coherent, easily accessible and, above all, extremely enjoyable game.""You. I've seen you before. Let me see your face. You are the one from my dreams. Then the stars were right and this is the day.""Threatened by total annihilation from the other-worldly Daedra, you alone are tasked to stand against the horrors that continue to pour into the world and save Cyrodiil from those that seek to destroy it. Ultimately, the world's fate is in your hands to do with as you please.Personally featuring my favourite campaign of the TES series, the huge range of activities, quests, factions and general shenanigans you can get up to is remarkable. While the implicit morality system tends to favour reasonably good characters, the grand campaign and truly epic final battle more than makes up for it. There's little else that has come close to achieving the experience of that final battle in the Imperial City. Plus Jeremy Soule's superb soundtrack will have you engrossed all the way through. Good times. Technically, this game is a marvel and will run excellently on nearly all rigs.  Oblivion has certainly dated, that's for sure, and if you're more interested in more recent games, then please be warned because, yes.. even back in 2006, PC games were filled with atrocious console UIs. Thankfully, there are plenty of mods and unofficial patches available, as well as graphical overhauls and ENBs to bring it up to looking its true and (breath-taking) best. The ""Bethesda bugs"" and the amusing A.I. remain the same, but almost have a charm to them now and, though noticeable, don't detract from your experience.Gameplay is a mixed bag. For its time, it's great and offered a great depth and freedom to the various playstyles the open-world/blank slate roleplaying encourages. Simply put, this has some fantastic dungeons. Yet by today's standards, if you're playing this for the first time, it will most likely frustrate you with supposedly clunky and repetitive combat. It certainly can also take some time to adapt and navigate the menus and inventory system. Though you've probably been hounded to play this classic, if you don't enjoy this sort of thing, then I cannot recommend it. However, if you do consider yourself to enjoy the fantasy/RPG genre, then this is the essential addition to your collection. It doesn't matter whether The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is better or worse, or more or less watered-down than Skyrim, Morrowind or even Online. At the end of the day, it simply is a great game in its own right. So what are you waiting for? Stop right there, criminal scum and hit play already.			"

												Oblivion is probably feeling a bit forlorn these days, with most of the hardcore crowd sticking to Morrowind and most of everyone else abandoning it for Skyrim. And it's no great mystery why this is the case, but I still think Oblivion is a game that shouldn't be overlooked, with the proper precautions taken.It's no secret that Oblivion is an RPG full of problems. The most grievous one in my opinion is the level scaling system, which scales basically everything in the game from dungeon loot and quest rewards to enemy equipment, gradually making the game more tedious as you level up until you finally find yourself face to face with a highway bandit who somehow found a full suit of Daedric armor and you just have to wonder where your decisions went so wrong that led you to this moment. The persuasion system is literally a joke, in which you just play a little wheel minigame where you dish out your best knock knock jokes (or boasts, if they're into that) until they have no choice but to tell you everything they know so that you'll leave them alone. I still don't know what the Speech stat even does, because as far as I'm aware you can start working on your standup routine fresh out of prison and never suffer any penalty. There's very little feeling of character specialization, and there's no reason at all to not be the leader of every guild in the game, the owner of your own order of knights, and more because even if you want to play the game as a stealthy archer or something the game all but forces you to become a combat focused character where your major choice boils down to ""magic or hitting things"" and there are no guilds that are strictly designed around a certain playstyle, making each of them less interesting for the people who did specialize towards one guild. The main storyline in general is fairly boring, and even the Shivering Isles expansion is fairly dull, to the point that I didn't even think that the collective content of it as a whole was as amusing as the single little Sheogorath quest in the base game.The good thing is that thanks to the magic of mods, most of Oblivion's faults can be fixed, and when you can play through the game without being constantly reminded of its flaws there's a lot to like, instead happily focusing on preventing the game from crashing whenever it feels like it. While it certainly has its fair share of tedious quests, Oblivion has a surprising amount of actually interesting content. I found myself enjoying more sidequests than not, and there are a few that are up there with my favorite quests in any RPG, like a certain Dark Brotherhood quest. Most of the ""organized"" quests like the guilds (for reference, play the Dark Brotherhood if you want to have fun, play the Thieves Guild if you want to pretend to have fun, play the Mages Guild if you hate fun, and play the Fighters Guild if you really hate goblins) and main story fall flat and feel like they build up too quickly for an ultimately weak payoff, but the real good stuff is in the one-shot stories you'll find in the towns and wilderness. Another perk of Oblivion is that it's home to the outstanding mod Nehrim: At Fate's Edge, which is a massive total-conversion mod that is arguably better than any of the Elder Scrolls games.Ultimately, Oblivion isn't an amazing game, but it can be pretty great or at least good after a bit of tweaking. As a special note, if you buy the deluxe edition I would personally recommend just disabling every minor DLC instead of bothering to grab all their unofficial patches, because as a whole I found them majorly disappointing in that almost all of them were just cheap excuses to get you things for free, like a house that has an ability that lets you skip one of the longest sidequests in the game or a house that has everything you could ever need for alchemy or any other of like 5 houses, quickly leaving you desperate for a quest that doesn't end with a deed to a mansion after being overloaded with a dozen quests you don't know the first thing about the moment you leave the prison. Even Knights of the Nine, the not-expansion expansion, is fairly short and not really interesting at all, unless you just think the armor reward looks cool. Ideally I'd recommend just not buying the deluxe edition at all, since the regular game of the year edition comes with the two worthwhile bits of content, but since there doesn't seem to be any way to buy the rest of the dlcs separate if you're a completionist you may as well jump for it. But overall I think Oblivion is definitely worth playing, especially since it goes on sale fairly often.			"

												This is a great game and probably in my top 10 favorite games list. It's a great story, great visuals, beautiful setting, and great side quests. There are of course some things that are negetive about this game, like the voice acting. Sometimes you come across the same voice with different characters in the game (and I'm not talking about the guards), the combat is a bit clunky, and this game is way to easy. I've completed the whole main quest and all the other quests, like the Mage Guild, Dark Brotherhood, etc. in under 20 hours and not because it's a short game (it's pretty average length) but I completed it fast because it was very easy.

												Oblivion is the worst TES game ever. Then Skyrim came around and a good half of the TES community kinda changed its opinion. Turns out that Oblivion's actually a pretty good game.Almost as soon as you get out of the prison you realize just how different this game is compared to Morrowind. A lot of people hated this, but this is not actually a bad thing - even Morrowind kinda gets boring after a while, so a change in the setting keeps this game varied. Especially since Oblivion is good at doing what it tries to do, which is to be a game with a pretty comfy medieval fantasy atmosphere. However, it's mostly Jeremy Soule's soundtrack that does this because the game's graphics are incredibly lame and make this game look like the painting world from one of the sidequests. Speaking of sidequests, they're actually better than Morrowind's. They're a lot more interesting and a little bit more varied, so they almost become these short self-contained stories. I personally think that Oblivion has some of the best guild questlines in TES games ever. Dark Brotherhood is simply amazing and Thieves Guild was also pretty cool and Thief 1-like, with a really neat final quest to boot. Other guilds were not that great, sadly, because there was almost no improvement to the way quests are structured in this game. For some reason, Bethesda thinks it's really great to do this thing where they give the guild quests a storyline that becomes clearer the more quests you do, but then start throwing you off the trail by giving you lame tasks. I found the sidequests to be the real icing on the cake, because the main quest was pretty lame and brought nothing unique to the table. Overall, the base game is actually pretty good. Sure, some things got dumbed down compared to Morrowind, but it's also not cool to hate this game anymore, so there you go.Then Shivering Isles came out. ""And, behold, it was very good"". It almost feels like more effort was put into this expansion pack rather than into the ginormous base game. It was very interesting to be in this weird world, meet all those strange oddball characters who, this time around, had actually good and almost unique voiceovers, and do these bizzare quests. And, of course, who could forget Sheogorath? It's worth playing the expansion for the single purpose of hearing his amazing voiceover and reading his hilarious dialogue. Sadly, I can't say that all quests and sidequests in this expansion were great, but it's still worth to play Oblivion simply for Shivering Isles only. By the way, it's an actually good expansion pack done by Bethesda -  that's one for the books!Knights of the Nine is also supposed to be an important thing. However, it's not. It's painfully average and incredibly short. It's supposed to consist of 11 linear main quests, yet a good 60% of them can be done in a matter of 30 minutes. The writing is almost nonexistant, but the armor and the bossfight in the sky were cool. If you think that's not too bad, then just remember the fact that this pathetic excuse for an ""expansion pack"" used to cost 10 or 20 buckaroos when it just came out.			"

												This is a great game and probably in my top 10 favorite games list. It's a great story, great visuals, beautiful setting, and great side quests. There are of course some things that are negetive about this game, like the voice acting. Sometimes you come across the same voice with different characters in the game (and I'm not talking about the guards), the combat is a bit clunky, and this game is way to easy. I've completed the whole main quest and all the other quests, like the Mage Guild, Dark Brotherhood, etc. in under 20 hours and not because it's a short game (it's pretty average length) but I completed it fast because it was very easy.

I also tried to replicate what i've had done in oblivion and i ended up vomiting up raw meat and end up in prision for trying to punch a daedra cosplayer.

												The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. I really love the game so far as it is fun to play and really enjoyable when I do quests for people. The game may have some bugs, but so far, I really haven't find any of the game-breaking bugs yet. But if I do, I'll edit this review of what bugs I have encountered. So let's talk about the game. So the setting is that the Emperor named Uriel Septim VII is being hunted down by the cult who follow the Daedric Prince of Destruction because in order for the Prince to enter the realm of Nirn, the dragon rulers must die and the Dragonfires are extinguise. Well by dragon rulers, I mean the decesendants of Tiber Septim who was the Dragonborn. So far, his three sons have died and he lives but not for long unless he escapes but it dosen't really matter. So he escapes through the Imperial City Prison where there is a secret escape. But when he and his guards called the Blades come to the cell, that's when they see the prisoner. Which that prisoner is you. So Uriel talks to you telling you that he saw you in one of his visions that was a sign of his doom. But you can help him by giving the Amulet of Kings to someone who can keep it while you search for the next heir. The reason why you are doing that is because as soon as you get through the training in the dungeon and see Uriel Septim one last time, he is then assassinated. So whenever you are done creating your character and giving him or her stats, that's when you finally get to explore Cyrodiil ever since The Elder Scrolls I: Arena. Here are the positive stuff and negative stuff that I found so far with in the game.Positive:Pretty good story (it's fine but there are some stuff that don't make sense)Awesome quests (with some plot to them and you can find some cool stuff along the way)Downloadable Content (except for the horse dlc but it's fine sort of but why cost money IDK)Explore Cyrodiil (IT'S HUGE! BIGGER THAN SKYRIM! But not as big as Arena or Daggerfall)Become whatever you want (like a thief, a champion of a arena, pretty much whatever you want)Join awesome factions (like the Fighters Guild, Mages Guild, Dark Brotherhood and more)Looks beautiful (if you get good graphics and a good computer)NPCs interacting with each other (giving some random conversations but fun to listen at times)Interact with NPCs with the emotion system (to get them to like you or hate you! yay!)Dungeons ('cause why not)Negative:NPCs kind of look ugly (but the ugliest ones are Orcs and Elves)Some bugs (if you get the Unofficial mods on Nexus, then the bugs won't happen :D)Terrible voice acting (THE ACTORS DIDN'T EVEN TRY! Except for the actors of Uriel Septim, Martin Septim and Sheogorath)With the negative, that's all I can think of. But so far, the game is great I definently recommand that you get it if you want to try it out. I give the game a 9/10. Definently try it out and you might like/love it. I hope you enjoy the game and I'll edit this review if I ever encounter anything else with in the game. Enjoy it! :D			"

												I am not so good at the whole review thing but here is my review on The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion® Game of the Year Edition!I don't know what it is about Oblivion that makes me keep coming back for more. It was the third Elder Scrolls that I ever played, and personally my favorite. Everything in this game was perfect. I could have played Skyrim with ease if it had everything that made Oblivion what it is. Skyrim, in my opinion, lacked something. Maybe it was the setting. Maybe it was the story. Maybe it was the higher sense of exploration and less emphasis on slashing your way through enemies. Maybe it was the breathtaking soundtrack. Here is my pros and cons list of this game and my final verdict.Pros: Masterful story, great combat although bow can be a pain sometimes, side quests that will keep you hooked for hundreds upon hundreds of hours, memorable characters, I could literally get so caught up in seeing what certain npc's would be doing and seeing how there everyday lives unfolded one time i remembered seeing Penniless Olvus dead next to the poor guy were a few guards my best guess of what happened to him is that since he begs he might not have been getting enough to live and tried his hand at pickpocketing someone and got caught because i saw a good amount of gold on his corpse.Cons: Bow combat can be annoying if you did not mean to pull it back because there is no way to retract it, potato faces which you can easily overlook, and not many voice actors but can also be overlooked seeing as how the quests are great.The point is, is that this game brings endless possibilities for you to experience and how you play the game is up to you. Will you be a great hero who fights off the mythic dawn and puts a stop to corruption, or will you be a crazy bloodthirsty serial killer who teases the guard egging them on to catch you, perhaps even becoming a adverage citizen earning money off of game, errands, and or investing in shops. The choice is yours, but i can what I can tell you is that you can not pass up on playing this game it is just such a well thought out game, I myself have put in over 1k hours on this game on console, steam, and pc disc combined. If you have not got this already go and get it now, trust me you will not regret it! Final result 5/5 WILL PLAY AGAIN!			"

Also a modern version of the Morrowind class system.Being that the newest addition of the Elder Scrolls games, Skyrim, is out at the time I write this I will provide a short review for those that know skyrim but have not played this.If you do not like Skyrim, but found Morrowind to old fashion. You will enjoy Oblivion greatly.Pros-Magic system that is vastly superior to Skyrim and Morrowind.-Magic spell crafting-Best Guild Quest lines out of all the Elder Scroll games.-A large map full of dungeons and monsters.-LOOOT !!!!-Large variety of monsters/animals and enemies.-Potion crafting-Variety of equipment.-Very Long and memorable main story quest-More quest than I can count.-Shivering Isles DLC adds a huge new land to discover, with quest galor.Cons-Unless you level up your level in weapon skills, weapons will do jack ♥♥♥♥ in damage.-Level Scalling. -Weapon Scalling.-Few graphical Gliches in some dungeons.A great game.

												A wonderfully rich game in the series and has hours and hours of content.  I remember when I first saw Oblvion at the E3 XBOX Conference I was astounded at how good this game looked.  I first played it on the XBOX 360 and have since seen it on the PS3 and the PC.  This game on PC was a hog when released, but on more modern machines, including more modest ones today can run this game looking as good as the developed had intended.  Many of the screenshots uploaded show off the rich environments of the Provence of Cyrodiil.  Like many games in the Elder Scrolls series you start the game as a no one and find yourself in fortunate circumstances which enables you to wonder the world.  Upon the first part of the character creation where you have a myriad of options to taylor your character exactly how you want you do find just how deep this game can be.  Game play for Oblivion has departed a little from previous entries as it is now more action based, where your states do not determine IF you will hit the enemy but how much damage, if they block and so on.  So it is not the TRUE RPG experience that many might have expected if you love Morrowind.  But it enables a player to quickly get into the swing of things and as you progress through the story you find yourself sometimes feeling more powerful than you are and will undertake some foes that are just out of your reach, BUT, with the mechanics of Oblivion it is not beyond impossible, creative ways to get objects between you and your enemy, knowing when to run, are all options if you find yourself in a sticky situtation. Many of the objectives in the game are leveled to your character so none of the quests seem too difficult and other than a small handful of quests you can do most (the others will not unlock until you reach a specific level).Leveling is easy, you have major and minor skills, get your Major skill up a level and you will level yourself.  Minor skills level up as well, at a slower rate.  This is where it will be a good indication as to how you will want to play your character since if you pick a warrior load out but find you want to sneak around then sneaking skills will take longer to level.  So to increase a skill you use it, fight enemies with a sword to increase your blade, hit them with damaging magic and your destruction will increase, sneak around the dark corners of the world (and there are many) and you will get better at doing do.The music by Jeremy Soule is one of the best sound tracks he has done and I even love listening to it as I find myself looking over the vistas the game presents.  The music dynamics do over an insight if you have annoyed an enemy, but it is a good indication especially when you do not know from where they are coming at you.  The biggest let down with an unmodded version are some of the sound glitches that happen, where audio will cut out, it will come back after a period of time but you will find yourself wondering the wilds and making no footsteps, but the most difficult one is the weapon strike and knowing when you have hit your enemy as it can disappear to.  But I believe there is an unofficial patch can fix many of these issues.Under newer operating systems this game might just crash from time to time, I have found when the in-game dialogs display as white and not textured it might be a good time to save.  Save often, make sure the auto saves are also set, on PC this takes no time and you will be welcoming it after a few crashes.All in all this is a top addition to the series and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a solid RPG experience and a game that will sometimes make you just want to sit and enjoy the view.

												TL;DRBuy Oblivion right now.---------------------------------------10/10 would spam jump to win again.Play this game. I have in total about 700 hours of Skyrim (mostly not through steam). I bought Oblivion GotY edition while it was on sale a few months ago, but I never really played it. I just started to play it, and let me tell you, it's good. The lockpicking, magic, speechcraft, combat, side quests, humor, etc. etc. are all much more enjoyadble and overall better than Skyrim. It has so many cool and interesting features that make it super immersive, super RP-friendly, and really fun. Dialogue with actually funny jokes and combat that isn't ""click to win"" like some *cough* games are really appeals to me. Seriously, I'm surprised that it's this good. Everyone always told me it was super hard and that I shoouldn't get it, but I'm glad I did. Time to buy Morrowind.			"

												Oblivion is my personal favourite TES game in the series. Compared to Skyrim, it has less sidequests, and the world is less interesting. But intead, it has much more replayability, is more fun, the story is more compelling, and has more variety. I like the freedom Skyrim gives, where you can become who you want, when you want, but Oblivion's classes and birthsigns are more interesting. You HAVE to specialize. And that's both good and bad, because it limits your freedom, but you know who you'll be from the start; you also don't need to grind some skills like in Skyrim, because that skill is already higher from the class you selected. Overall, i think this game is really good, and if you played and enjoyed Skyrim you should enjoy this game too.			"

I believe it plays truest to the original intent of the old school role play game.  I have spent many hours researching for another, but none are as good as Oblivion.  Many games call themselves RPG, but they  do not come close to the true depth of detail for roll playing as Oblivion.  Quit frankly, many games that are taged as RPG are very waterd down versions of the original styl of RPG. If Bethesda remasterd the graphics, I would by it again even though I own 3 copies.			"

												My favourite game ever. Ignore the ""hours on record"", I played hundreds of hours on the XBOX 360 and and hundreds more on the CD PC version first.Get it. With all DLC. Anything else is an injustice to yourself.I would also recommend this mod list (at least the essentials):http://www.zhakaron.com/2016/07/oblivion-lite-mod-list-for-quick-set-up.html "

												While a great game on its own, what makes Oblivion worth getting nowadays (when it's 10 years old) is the fact that it has a huge and active modding community. Mods range from graphical/ gameplay improvements to pure ridiculous additions. Even if you've owned the game before (I played it on PS3 back in 2007) it's worth the price just to fool around with mods.			"

												This is an archetype for free-roaming fantasy RPGs with classic elements of dungeon delving and a consistent leveling mechanism. The game by itself is solid but aged, and it is recommended to install at least the Unofficial mods that fix a lot of bugs. If you want to further improve the game there are tons of mods, but the resulting configuration may be too heavy and/or crash-prone.Thumbs up for the complete freedom of doing almost everything you want.

												I've actually owned this a loooooong time ago for the Xbox 360, but I liked it so much I bought it again. That and the mods.This game truly brings back memories of taking turns with my dad playing it and how bad we were at fighting in the Arena.Or the time when we beat up a bandit in full Ebony regailia, stole it, and wore it for the rest of the game. (which is sort of why part of my screen name is Ebon.)My ""Good"" Opinions:Feels very adventure-y/immersive, good to sink a couple hours into.Colorful and varied landscapes.Towns were filled with quests and cool characters.The player wasn't the BIG DEAL protagonist through the main campaign, but a very vital component to the campaign.Lots of different stats and class mixing.Major DLCs were fun and added more stuff to play with. (Plus Sheogorath is always a good reason to buy an expansion.)Can leave you with fond memories.The guilds were fun (even though the Mage's and the Fighter's Guild quests were a little bit boring.)Mods!My ""Bad"" Opinions:Buggy (it's a Bethesda game, what'd I expect?).Lack in variation to voice actors (also not a big suprise).Oblivion gates were boring and really had not much variety.Patrick Stewart never got to actually voice anything outside our beloved dead emperor.Dungeon delving gets boring after a while.So does repetitive quest goals.Persuasion is useless if I can just pay them cash to give me information.Vampirism is awful.Overall:It's a really good game that leaves you having a satisfying experience.9/10.

												While I don't like the way Bethesda is making their games easier and dumbing down their content, this game is still enjoyable.  I'd rather they didn't remove so many skill lines, or remove negative consequences. You can do it all in this game, you aren't forced to choose right vs wrong, nor is there any real depth to the characters. You can kill anyone you want without consequences. The point of a Role Playing game is your actions should result in game changing events, there is way too much hand-holding going on. This is more like an FPS in a Elder Scrolls setting.			"

												This is by far my favorite Elder Scrolls game. I owned the hard copy previously and when I saw it on Steam I knew I had to get it. The environment in this Elder Scrolls is the best out of all the games. Tamriel has a peaceful air to it filled with vibrant color and good amounts of green. The story is easy to follow and maintains interest. All of the side quests and other distractions give this game 1000's of hours of gameplay potential.The only complaint I have about this game is the leveling system. The level of enemies is based on your level so if you focus too much on levelling non-combat skills, the enemies become very tough to kill. This is more then made up for by the rest of the game though, so I'd still give a 10/10. Shadow guide you.			"

												The game that defined the modern RPG and arguably the best game ever written. In the two years since escaping from the Imperial prison I have become a holy crusader, a gladiator in the arena, fallen from grace, spent an uncomfortable two weeks as a vampire, defeated at least one ancient evil, driven ghosts out of my home and been made into a god. Also, there's some problem in Kvatch, which people keep on referring to as the 'main quest'.Massive, I'm nearly 200 hours in and there are parts of the main game and bits of DLC I haven't even started to look at. With the 'unofficial' patches from the community this game has had most of it's bugs fixed and runs well on modern PCs. Other community mods make it an incredibly pretty game, fix gameplay issues and add oodles more content.Look at http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion for mods and patches.			"

												Ok...My review here is very similar to the one I did on Morrowind ( Read it here http://steamcommunity.com/id/BringerOfDusk/recommended/  )They tried to fix my main issue with Morrowind, in Oblivion. They Dropped the skills down to 21 (Was 27 in Morrowind).  Same deal though. Some skill choices take forever for you to level up. Some you level up instantly (figuratively...) Veterans of this game (And Morrowind) Will agree to this. If you want to level up super quick...Acrobatics and Athletics in your main skills... Running and Jumping is how you level those skills... And by leveling your main skills you level your charecter.			"

												Played this game for hundeds of hours on console recently got it on steam. Oblivion has always been my favourite game in The Elder Scrolls series and perhaps in my top 5 ever.The open world of Tamriel's central province Cyrodil is stunningly georgeous for a game made in 2005 and remains iconic to this day. The story is in my opinion the best the series has ever produced and this game is easily home to the best DLC from and Elder Scrolls game, The Shivering Isles.Oblivion unlike its younger brother Skyrim (Also a great game) Isn't easily mastered and does present a challenge at higher levels, Yes you get god like strong and epicly awsome equipment ans spells but so do your enemies. And the best enchantments on weapons eat up your soul gems.Oblivions class system is somethinng I missed in Skyrim, It makes you focus and develop your Character along the 7 skills you chose though you still can master all skills though any skill you did not chose as a major skill doesn't level you up.The combat at levels 15+ clearly rises in difficulty. Enemies start staggering you in close quarters and you sniping skills need to improve fast along with adding some poisons and preferably an enchantment on your bow to keep getting those one shot kills.I could write a novel on the game but in short Oblivion is an excelent open world rpg with a great story fun characters and factions and always gives you something to do 10/10 if you havent played this get it asap			"

												All in all, I find this game way more appeling than its more modern counter-part, Skyrim. In my opinion the guilds are a lot more immersive and in-depth as you work your way up the chain in a way that makes sense for that particular group; battling evil necromancers and getting recommendations for the arcane university, rather than Skyrim's cast a simple spell get into the arcane college. The main story is also pretty epic, as the invasion of the daedra draws near ever minute, you along with the local Blades need to take certain actions to stop this onslaught. Need a break from quests or need something else to do in the game? Well you can make your own adventures by clearing the local fort or dungeon, either by yourself or with a group of adept adventures behind your back. The only issues I came across dealt with the leveling up/character build mechanic. Cookie-cutter characters are hard to make as a wizard build has to be purely towards the most magicka to cast the higher tier spells; warrior builds and theif builds aren't as restricting, but are still a little rigid. Also at a certain point your character becomes ""too good"", as your attributes hit insane heights. You become really hard to kill, save for a room FILLED with top quality enemies or a named legendary enemy. I'll admit that the perk system of Skyrim is better, as it rewards using skills and allows for intresting characters to form. Would give this game around a 9.5/10. The DLC's are amazing btw.			"

												You know, Bethesda doesn't exactly make really excellent games... you buy their stuff because they're the ONLY high-profile developer out there that makes their particular variety of open-world RPG. In a Bethesda game, you can go anywhere on the (typically) VERY large world map, and do just about anything you in-game character in capable of doing at anytime you please. That level of freedom to do whatever the **** you want goes a long way.SO, while Oblivion has a whole list of stupid/annoying mistakes and flaws, it's still worth playing through a few times or more. There's just SO MUCH you can do with it, especially if you start modding, which can really make this game shine.			"

Sure the world may feel empty and your actions inconsequential, but it doesn't really bug me. I think it's pretty sweet that  I can be the listener for the dark brotherhood at night and be a holy crusader by day.

												If you don't have this game, or if you have never played this game, then you are missing out on one of the best open world games that has ever been created. The map is huge, the art style and the different environments are beautiful, and there are tons of quests to distract you from the main story. There are different guilds you can join that can appeal to different tastes. Honestly, the only main problem that I have with this game, other than a few small glitches, is the Oblivion gates.

												I played The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind before ever playing this game, and I always felt that this game took a step forward from III with graphics, combat, and other mechanics.. but several steps backward with exploration, character-building, and true roleplay.I'm not reviewing Morrowind here, but I think it is fair to compare a game against its predecessor and look at what was improved and what was taken in the wrong direction.To begin, Oblivion did a lot of things right, when improving on mechanics compared to Morrowind. We'll start with combat. In Morrowind, your character's skill with your chosen weapon, along with one of your main stats, determined your chance to hit, as a percentage. If the game calculated that chance and determined that you would ""miss"" with that swing, your weapon would not damage the enemy at all, even if it appeared to go directly through them. Similar chances were put in place with blocking, where you simply had a chance to block while holding a shield, and when casting spells, where you had a percentage chance to fail at casting while still using up the magic required to try. This gave the game's combat a feeling more similar to traditional pen and paper RPGs and made combat feel more like a chore to some. Oblivion took the combat system and made it much more action-oriented and controlled by you, the player. Now, every attack hits, as long as YOU don't miss, as the player, and instead your damage is what's determined by your skills. Spells are cast, if you have the magic for it, and that magic cost decreases as your skill increases. Blocking, with a shield or not, is an active thing and more effective depending on the related skill. This made combat much more interested, when compared to Morrowind, and made tough fights actually FEEL tough!The stealth system, although improved as far as enemy detection and such, mostly stayed the same from the previous game to this one. You still have a symbol indicating whether you've been detected, you still deal more damage while sneaking, etc.The magic system also mostly stayed the same. Some spells went away from Morrowind to Oblivion, and we saw some new additions. Spellmaking is done differently, as is enchanting, and again, the mechanics of each of these systems is improved. A major gameplay difference this time is that you don't have to equip a spell INSTEAD of your weapon in order to use it; there is just a separate button to cast the chosen spell, even if you have a sword and shield equipped. This made combat much more strategic and made ""utility"" sorts of spells more fluid to cast or re-cast in combat. A few really neat improvements include new ways to get new enchantments (sigil stones) and spells (Spelltomes, from DLC).The world, unfortunately, seems to take a step backward. In Morrowind, the world felt gigantic, even after uncovering most of your map locations, and even near the end of my years playing almost nothing but Morrowind, I was still able to get entirely lost in the world - in a good way! - and discover locations I had never seen! For Oblivion, this can really only be said for the distant corners of the game's map, and I never had a reason to go there anyway! The world simply feels smaller, even without fast-traveling. Part of this smaller feeling is that most of the dungeons of the same ""type"" feel and look almost the same, unless they're different for the purposes of a quest. The Aylied Ruins all feel about the same, most of the abandoned forts feel about the same, most of the caves feel about the same.. It's all just very similar! Thinking back, I can still remember unique dungeons or ruins from Morrowind, but hardly any from Oblivion, if they didn't play a major part in the main or faction quests.My next point.. I'm really not sure if this one is a good or a bad thing. I think, really, it's neither. You aren't special, in Oblivion. In Morrowind, you're the Nerevarine (SPOILERS), and flash-forward to Skyrim, you're the Dragonborn (AHH, more SPOILERS!!). In Oblivion.. Nope! You're a prisoner who gets out and does some great things.. but you aren't special. You can't do anything that someone else in the game couldn't also do. The only difference between you and those other people is that you're in the right places at the right times and do the right things (or the wrong things, depending on your faction choices...), and if you choose to take part in the main storyline, you help Martin, who IS, in fact, special.All in all, I feel like Oblivion improved on plenty of points that were lacking in Morrowind, though the ones that were a step backward were BIG ones, like the world and dungeons. The game plays much better, but feels less spectacular.I still recommend the game, of course, and once you're done playing, I also recommend modding the game! This is what really gets me nostalgic about the game: the mods! Modding was definitely a thing for Morrowind; there were plenty! But, to me, it feels like modding really took off with Oblivion, and there are so many incredible ones to choose from! Have fun!			"

												(This review is going to be astronomically long, so bear with me! TL:DR; is at the end.)I remember the first time I played Oblivion. It was at a friend's house when I was seven, back in 2007. I didn't understand it much, but I got to watch him play it on his old television and I got a small turn for a while. Eventually, I got my first Playstation 3 in 2009. Oblivion was one of the first games I ever bought for the system.Between the endless interesting quests, to the big open world that was the best for it's time, it was one of the best experiences in video gaming that I have ever experienced.Now it's 2017, and I have just started playing Oblivion again.I have two hundred or so hours on the retail version, and roughly 30 hours on the Steam version. Time and time again I find myself returning to Oblivion just to play through the Dark Brotherhood questline or to just explore all the dungeons and forts that the game had to offer.I would even daresay that this game beats Skyrim. Skyrim's graphics are certainly much better, but to me, the game dumbed down on a lot of the elements that made Oblivion great, including a mediocre story, poorly made (and much less) side-quests and a broken vanilla follower system.But enough about Skyrim, this is about Oblivion. I'm going to list all of the positives, negatives and other features that are a little in-between.POSITIVES+ Excellent main story.+ A plethora of side-quests that are even better then some of the main quests.+ The Thieves Guild and the Dark Brotherhood's questlines are excellent.+ Good controls.+ The Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine are EXCELLENT DLCs and NEED to be purchased with this game.+ An all-star acting cast who do a very great job at their roles.+ Very well detailed dungeons, forts and caves.+ Many different cities with dozens of quests, along with many interesting characters.+ A lot of well-written books inside the game.+ Many different weapons to choose from.+ Customise your own class and what skills level up your character.+ A lot of spells to choose from, including many other ones that can be bought.+ The Mage Guild and the Fighters Guild. Their questlines were pretty good, however, they didn't return in their same form in Skyrim. The Companions in Skyrim represented the Fighter's Guild and the College of Winterhold represented the Mage Guild.+ An amazing soundtrack. From the quiet songs while you're trading with a merchant in the Imperial City, to the heart-wrenching song playing when you enter an Oblivion gate, this soundtrack is quite possibly the best in the Elder Scrolls series.+ Weapon degradation. You can use repair hammers to repair your weapons, where in Skyrim, you couldn't do that.+ Alchemy. I enjoyed the alchemy in this game a lot, especially when I needed to upgrade my Alchemy tools whenever I levelled higher!+ The voice acting is on-par with 2017 video games to date. With the famous 'Lucien Lachance' scene being one of the best scenes in the entire game, just because of how the actor portayed Lucien in that very scene.+ The visuals are pretty damn good. Skyrim's visuals were excellent, but felt very drab. Oblivion's visuals were perfect for how many players envisioned Cyrodil. From the beautiful green trees, to the snow near the Blade's temple at Bruma, the scenary and visuals are excellent.+ The end of the main quest. The end is very well done, and it's short and simple. Much better than Skyrim's in my opinion.+ The Arena. It may be repetitive sometimes, but for me, this was one of the best questlines in the entire game (taking a back-seat to the Dark Brotherhood). From the Gray Prince realising his true identity, to the many battles you will have to win to become the 'Grand Champion', this is another reason why Oblivion is so good.+ Random encounters. They may be less of them than Skyrim, but coming across a Highwayman when crossing a bridge near the Imperial City, or M'aiq the Liar outside of Leyawiin, I just found more enjoyment in those encounters.+ The Ayleid Ruins. Skyrim tried to replicate the Ayleid Ruins with the Dwemer Ruins. To me, I found them a lot less interesting than the Ayleid Ruins in Oblivion. The beautiful arcitecture and design, (along with the value of all the Welkyd stones that you could collect) made them a lot more fun to explore, then Skyrim's substitute.I think that covers all of the positives. Now, onto the features that are a little positive, and a little negative.AVERAGE~ All of the guards have the same voice actor, so good luck trying to find a certain guard if it involves a quest.~ The game stutters infrequently (at least for me) and it breaks immersion.~ The AI isn't very good, especially the Bandit and Mage AI, where they will just run right into my blade instead of being tactical or running away.~ Glarthir. That entire quest is absolute garbage. The only thing that's good about it, is being able (you can choose not to) kill him and take the reward.~ Merchants seem to have infinite gold. It makes no sense that if a Merchant has 800 gold, you can sell 795 gold worth of potions to them, and be able to sell them more as long as you keep the amount to under 800. The gold never depletes!~ Lucien LaChance's ending. I don't want to talk about that.~ I'm not going to say that the Zombies are hyper-realistic, but they are too scary for me.Now...onto the negatives.NEGATIVES- The UI. It is clearly designed with the Console in mind, and it can be extremely frustrating and sometimes un-usable due to it's awful inventory interface and merchant inventory interface. The only way to really use it, is if you download a UI mod for the game from the Nexus.- Levelling up. Being able to level up your stats while you're sleeping? Overall, the levelling up system is good, but I just found it really curious as to why we need to sleep to level up.- The Lockpicking. It is a good minigame, but the problem with it is, you can just Quicksave in front of a locked door, then reload whenever you are caught or break a lockpick.- The intense lag. The game can range from 30 to 200 FPS (only up to 90 in my case, and that's with a GTX 970). For a game that is over ten years old, intense lag in some places (such as Bravil or the Arena) is unnacceptable. Download mods to fix this and greatly reduce your lag.- The Adoring Fan. You know what I'm talking about if you've finished the Arena questline.- Invisible walls. Like in Skyrim, Oblivion has a LOT of invisible walls. Couldn't big mountains have been put in place to force the player to stop and not be able to hit an invisible wall? The only positive to this, is that when mods open up new lands to explore (Elsweyr Arquenia, etc), all you need to do is disable the invisible walls.- The fame and infamy system. Fame isn't such a problem to me, as it makes a lot of sense, but infamy seriously annoys me. I want to be able to complete the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild questline, but I can't because each mission or murder grants you infamy (even when nobody sees you doing these crimes) and eventually, guards will attack on sight if your infamy is high enough.That's all I could think of.Oh, also, a massive positive.MODS. Enough said.TL:DR; Oblivion is an amazing game and is the best Elder Scrolls in the franchise and it is definitely worth picking up (ASWELL AS THE DLCs) and should not be missed at any cost. It overcomes it's shortcomings with an amazing story, world and cast of characters, that are unforgettable.GET. THIS. GAME.			"

												Quite literally, this game - nay, experience - is something that saved my life on innumerable occasions. It's best to not compare it to anything else - even other games in the series - and instead focus on it as a separate entity that provides a wondrous realm of vivid storytelling and escapism. Lose yourself in the bloom-lit ethereality with Jeremy Soule's transcendent soundtrack as a companion, and endless discoveries hidden just over that next green hill. Not all of us know how to appreciate Oblivion for what it really is, but enough of us understand it's essence to respect it in a way that presents the game as an escapist classic. I explored the rich and beautiful lands in this game on my Xbox 360 for several years, and it provided a profound sense of solace and reflection, strangely enough. Anyone in search of an experience or a portal to a place to simply lose oneself in (in a good way) should at least give Oblivion a try. For me, this will always be the best entry in the series due to that special, undefinably brilliant magic that's embedded in it and how it provided endless hours of whimsy and solace to me during times when I needed it most. And if you can't quite get what all my ramblings and praises represent, perhaps you haven't given the game enough time to let it get into your head (or, perhaps you're a longtime Morrowind fan who understandably detests the changes made in this entry). The DLC expands upon the game even moreso, and with select mods you can do no wong with taking a step back into this wondrous title.It feels like an entire era - a golden age in itself - that will forever be timeless. Just ignore the potato-headed NPCs and look beneath the surface of this game. There's magic there.			"

												This is the epitomy of the fantasy genre. It has perfect mechanics for getting into RPGs without being too streamlined or confusing. The environment is perfectly put together and will keep you invested for months at a time. The levelling is set up so that the game can actually get harder as you play, instead of easier and boring like another game in the series. This is the perfect game to play as a first RPG, and it will keep veterans just as entertained. This game is far over-shadowed by its comparatively mediocre sequel, and I highly recommend everyone to play this game and some of its predeccessors for an idea of what a true open-world fantasy experience should be.

												One of the best RPGs that I've ever played. You will have plenty of fun with this game and once you beat it vanilla, it's time to install mods! Mods for this game are soooo much fun. Anything that you can think of, they add to the game. Want new quests? Done. Want rebalancing of level? Easy. Do you want more weapons? How about a mod that adds 120 immersive weapons? Yes, there are many, many mods for this game.My only complaint with this game is that it may crash every once in a while, mods or not, because Bethesda games usually crash a whole bunch for no specific reason. Sure, you can have 8+ hour sessions where the game will run smooth and not crash whatsoever or you can be playing for about an hour and have it crash when you enter an interior. In my opinion, the game is badly optimized but that's the only con, and the pros outweight the cons by A LOT.			"

												Oblivion. My favorite Elder scrolls game so far! I've played all of the main titles except for Daggerfall, and the Online one, but man, this game is fun! You can craft your own spells once you get to the Mages Guild in the Imperial City! I like Oblivion better than Skyrim, because you don’t feel like you’re carrying a backpack full of rocks, you can actually cast magic while holding a sword and a shield, and Cyrodiil is not as cold and miserable as the neighbor to the North!Another thing I like about ES4: Oblivion is once you level up your acrobatics and athletics a bit, you can run really fast and jump super high! I like this game better than Morrowind, because you don’t have to be a specific class build to actually land a blow, the only downside, is it discluded the levitation spell from Morrowind. I still have yet to beat the main quest line, but I beat the Mages Guild, beat Shivering Isles, and Started on the Dark Brotherhood, and it’s honestly one of my favorite RPG’s Ever! On a scale of 2, I give this game a 10. 10/2.Edit: So far, I see no need for mods, The game isn't as glitchy and broken as Skyrim, and the story and characters are fun enough, that I only play Vanilla!

So Far  The game is really well made!Review--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The elder Scrolls  Oblivion is a open world,story rich  game that take place in the Medievil era. The graphics in this game is good back then in 2006 or 07.  The game has a lot of option to do, Like quest, go to caves, and more. The Story is very intresting that It's like someone is reading a book. So far after more then 15 hours of the game, I got addicted  to the game. The game is made by one of my favorite company of all time is Bethesda, same oh made Skyrim,Fallout NW, and etc. I was going to get Skyrim but my PC is so bad that i can barely run games above 2009. (unless it's a 2d shooter or platformer) The Soundtrack is by far the best soundtrack yet. The elder Scrolls is a really well progamed game. If you like dungons,dragons, then this game is for you--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Positive-Great story-Customizeable character-Very Open source- Peaceful soundtruck-big modding community-Open world-Good Graphics back then in 2007-Quests--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Negative-Crashes-Bugs-erorrs (sometimes)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rating9/10 ""Loved it, one of my favorite games  of all time""			"

												The vibrant colours, constant cheesy charm of the NPCs and the overall life that is put into the game world are just a few aspects of this game that I personally think propels this game into being superior to Skyrim. This is a classic open world game in the making.			"

												The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Game of the Year Deluxe EditionBe prepared for a detailed review of this game. If you're considering purchasing this, have a read and see what you think before doing so!Positives:+ Pleasant graphics for a game almost a decade old (2006).+ A huge assortment of quest to complete, such as the Thieves' Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Fighter's Guild, Mage's Guild and Daedric God storylines. Lots of miscellaneous quests too.+ Massive map to explore, lots of locations including caves, bandit camps, forts and ancient ayleid ruins. Snowy regions and lush forest, open grasslands and swamps, very varied terrain.+ Wide array of weaponry, many, many skills to level up, use magic, archery or melee combat to strike down foes. Mix your own potions with alchemy, become a master of acrobatics or conjure powerful beasts to do your bidding. + Hundreds of hours of gameplay to engage in. Fun for the first 100-120. Anything in excess of level 40 starts to see boredom set in. I recommend taking regular breaks to avoid the repetition, in which case it won't be so noticeable. + Large mod community.Negatives:- Extremely flawed and stupid monster levelling, giving you no sense accomplishment when you progress to higher levels. Many creatures will be levelled to you, meaning that, at higher levels, you'll be required to spam click attacks for ages to get kills (ogres, goblin warlords, gloom wraiths). Keep in mind this is using the best weapons available, with the highest skill level. Much to your disdain, you'll spend hours clearing out caves or forts filled with insanely high hitpoint enemies. Not fun, not a challenge, just a complete and utter waste of time.- Caves, dungeons and other places have a lot of loot potential and you'll have fun in the beginning collecting fragments of armour, potions and gold to pay for adventuring supplies and purchasing houses. However, after awhile there's literally nothing to spend your cash on. All of the equipment I've sold has resulted in stockpiling over 300,000 coins, with nothing practical to spend it on. Every elder scrolls (even the latest instalment to the series, Skyrim) has had this issue.- Dumb AI that gets stuck when you jump onto rocks and cast magic or shoot arrows. It doesn't understand how to reach you. The AI scripting for conversations is also ridiculous. There are only a limited number of discussions citizens can have between each other and these all feel very, very unnatural. It's as if the designers didn't bother to implement realistic dialogue. - Many textures for forts or caves are re-used and do not look unique. This gets dull later, rather than sooner, but it's still a great downfall of the title. The layouts of many locations are similar. They might have different pathways, include an underwater cave or a bridge, but for all intents and purposes, most locations have a familiar feel to them. There's little excitement in that regard.- Modding requires excessive use of complicated tools that are not only time consuming but annoying. Not to mention the countless glitches that conflict with gameplay.- Character levelling comes to a sudden halt around levels 40+, it becomes so infrequent that you feel like you're achieving nothing at all, apart from going on errands for a number of characters you don't care much about.The Shivering Isles Expansion:Positives:+ New textures compared to the base game, an entirely new environment, new colours, new armour and weapons, new characters, new monsters and new quests. Consequently, this expansion does have a feeling of freshness to it. +Around 30 hours of additional content, which is not unreasonable for an expansion.Negatives:- Despite the fact that there are various changes and new features, the dreadful monster levelling system remains, which never fails to detract greatly from the experience (unless you go to the Shivering Isles at a lower level, at which point it becomes bearable).- Rather horrible voice acting for Sheogorath, too try-hard in its approach, quite off-putting and didn't seem like a genuine portrayal of the characteristics the developers wanted to exhibit, which was a God of Madness.Knights of the Nine Expansion:Positives:+ A new and intriguing storyline (for the most part) based around the Nine Divines, where you must complete a series of tests to retrieve the ancient armour of Crusader Pelinal Whitestrake, in an effort to defeat the infamous Umaril, a Daedra who poses a threat to Cyrodiil. + Some extra locations to explore which have been added to the map during the expansion, but nothing really new other than aesthetics (the Crusader armour and weapons). + There's a real feeling of reviving the old Knights of the Nine Order, as people will approach you to swear their allegiance. You'll fight side by side at the end against Umaril's minions in a big battle, which is cool.Negatives:- Many of the places you'll visit are filled with the standard enemies you'll encounter in the base game, there is little difference in the design of these locations to other ayleid ruins or forts in the base game as well.DLC Add-Ons:Positives:+ A number of new houses for those interested. There's a Wizard's Tower, a Castle and an underground Cave that can become new homes, some of them include enchanting and spellmaking areas for convenience.+ A few additional activities to partake in, like collecting dwarven artifacts stolen by bandits, to repair an Orrery at the Arcane University. You can also investigate the caverns beneath anvil to find the resting place of a pirate ship and the mystery behind it. In the East of Cyrodiil you can travel to Sundercliff Watch, a fortress that holds the powerful Daedric item, Mehrune's Razor.Negatives:- Some bugs which interfere with how the house DLC works, causing problems with them being unable to be purchased or relevant questlines not progressing.Overall Score: 7.5/10The Elder Scrolls: IV Oblivion is almost a decade old as of 2015. It's still a very entertaining and fun game, but one should also be aware of the numerous problems it has. Worth picking up on sale for under $10.			"

												The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion PC ReviewThe Elder Scrolls IV might be one of the best open world rpg's of it's time so I decided to pick it up during the Discovery steam sale. This game consumed my life for 2-3 weeks while I was finishing guild quests, exploring this expansive world and getting immersed by the lore of this video game.Story: 9/10The Elder Scrolls IV has a mediocre main story but the Guild quests and side quests really make the story of this game one of the best in all Elder Scrolls games. If I was to do the main story of this game alone it would take me less than 8 hours and bore me to death but the side quests really where the majority of my 50 hours in Oblivion were spent. In some of the quests in the Dark Brotherhood I was having so much fun doing so many different contracts for them. Almost all the guild and side quests were exponentially better than the side quests of many other Rpg's because of their intriguing plots. Overall, The main story is mediocre but the side and guild quests are where oblivion's story shines.Gameplay: 7/10The gameplay of this is mediocre and could get boring at some times.Since I played through the game as a Warrior-Destruction mage most of the game was filled with mashing my mouse and keyboard while occasionally blocking just to get my block skill up. Even though the combat was mediocre the leveling system was horrible in my honest opinion because in this game you get weaker by leveling up. Even though the gameplay and leveling system were not so great all the other systems in the game were refined(Questing, Alchemy,Etc.). Another horrible aspect of Oblivion's gameplay is that the dungeons all look the same and also make you backtrack through them sadly. The only other gripe I have with this game is horrible map system that was really confusing to navigate. The gameplay might not be the best part of this game it isn't unplayable but can sometimes get enjoyable mashing away at hordes of dremora. Graphics-8/10The graphics in this game were awesome for it's time in 2006 however I can say that the graphics look beautiful some times however the character models look completely hideous at times really showing the age of this game. The dungeons also look horrendous as their is no variety in their aesthetics but some times as I'm riding through the world of Oblivion and the sun shines on the world making the game look awesome.Overall-8/10This game may not be the best rpg ever made but it's a must buy for gamers who like rpg's with expansive worlds like Skyrim and are willing to look past some gameplay and graphic issues. So this game gets a 8/10			"

												10/10Pros:*Great Story*Great Soundtrack*Fun combat and leveling system*Memorable NPC's (Or maybe they're just burned into my memory because I played it so many times.)Cons:See, Oblivion has cons. I love the game too much to really care (biased review, oh nooo). But, for any cons you find... There's a 99% there's a mod for it.An awesome world with a gripping story and one that's told well. While the main story is pretty linear, the rest of the game is fairly open in choices. The impacts of your choice aren't as heavy as they perhaps should be, but it's still nice to be able to be a charming knight, a stoic wanderer, a powerful mage, a cunning assassin, or anything else you can think of. Due to the fact that it's on the PC and has mod availability, that only gives Oblivion a boost.Base game Oblivion with no DLC's or mods is still awesome if you can look past outdated graphics and appreciate the pretty colors. Plus, with the amazing soundtrack, just roaming around in the wilderness can be rewarding enough on it's own. There's a few factions to join and various side quests, some that are easily found, others you probably won't notice because of how far off in the corners they are. With DLC's, the content for the game is only added upon, and each DLC is a nice and fun little thing, particularly Mehrune's Razor, Knights of the Nine, and Shivering Isles. If we include mods, well. It's what you choose to make it.			"

												Hallo.If you're reading this review you most likely never played Oblivion before and wonder if it's still worth it.Yes.It doesn't feel outdated in any way. Of course the graphics are not as detailed as in current games - but it still looks beautiful and fits the game very well.The gameplay feels good and I actually prefer it to Skyrim.The open world feels big and open and getting from A to B is rarely tedious or annoyingPersonally I don't like the main quest that much but there are dozens of side quests, missions and things to explore that you can literally play hundreds of hours (including 2 very good DLCs and various brilliant fan made) without touching the main story.A lot of fan made mods let you personalize Oblivion and you have as many as you can wish for!In conclusionIf you are even slightly interested in this game and you think it might be for you - you should definitely give it a try!I'm pretty sure you won't regret it.

Going on 8 years later, decided to pick Oblivion up on a Steam Sale for a generous price to play the main story again, and just by doing the main quest line gave me 24 hours of nostalgic fun.Also adding new mods made it a brand new experience in itself with better graphics, and there's plenty more new content with mods if you feel like devoting more of your time to this legendary RPG.

												Oblivion: it feels like a parody of Skyrim. Not only are Skyrim's graphics better, but the world itself just feels more serious and realistic than its predecessor. The game is sort of a more relaxed Skyrim, that was my first impression.But nonetheless, I can guarantee you that I had more fun with Oblivion! There are few games that made me laugh so hard. But don't think that Oblivion is all about laughing. The game is filled with very entertaining and well made side quests that feel as if they aren't side quests, but the main story itself. I actually did not play much the main story, just because the side quests were so good!The graphics? Nothing special nowadays, but definately playable!  The game is just so good, that you will probably get more immersed than in Skyrim, even with the simpler graphics. Hours will fly by and you won't notice. I guess that the graphics also helped create more complex environments. The cities in Oblivion are much bigger than the ones in Skyrim. There are endless hours of fun in the cities, from messing around with the guards to exploring sewers and doing quests. It just feels more complex than Skyrim! Don't get me wrong, both are excellent games, but have slight different approaches. Skyrim is a masterpiece of beauty and thrilling adventure, while Oblivion focuses on the complexity and fun of its world. My suggestion? Buy both!(Don't trust Steam hour record! I have endless hours of offline play in both games!)			"

												If you kinda think about it, Most people who prefer skyrim are the type of people who only play a game for graphics. (In my opinion, at least)Like, Skyrim is cool and all and they're all different in their own ways. But honestly skyrim has no match for oblivion.Honestly I don't even know WHERE to begin. The game is so cool and it left me with a broken heart, tbh.The quests were so unique and so different. And the story itself is so amazing. (Especially if you're someone who likes backstories/lores)Oblivon felt more alive to me. It had more colors and life than skyrim. And I absolutely love the voice acts.But honestly as someone who really loves all elven races/beast races, I love the equality of the races in the game.Because skyrim was so racist towards elves and khajits which made me hate the nords more.Like I loved oblivion because I saw lots of races in one place, I was so sick of seeing only Humans in skyrim tbh.And I fell in love that you can ""make"" your own class. Instead of counting on the stones, You chose your perks and name your own class.And the fact that you can ""talk"" to NPCs made the game more alive. Like you can tell them jokes, Bribe them, Boast, etcit felt like the NPCs in the game are a living things. Instead of accessories or an ""atmosphere"".But really you could soo many stuff in your free time. Like, enter the arena for example !!You can even choose your own title and you'd have a fan following you.That's the least i could say without saying any spoilers. But I still feel like i left so many stuff unsaid.Can't blame me though, this game is so amazing and it left me speechless.But my advice is you should buy this game. It's honestly a great experience. 10/10			"

												dont judge a book by its cover. oblivion might look a little 'cartoony', but its packed with many features and details such as amazing AI, many quests, guilds to join, places to explore, etc.. oblivion is my favorite game in the 'TES' series. one of my favorite features is the AI. no matter where you go, the NPC's of oblivion are doing their everyday job. i really like this because in most games the NPC's only do things when you are around them. i think this gives oblivion more of a living aspect compared to some of the other TES games. overall, i totally recommend this game.

												I got this game as i played skyrim and realy enjoyed it. i havnt played as much on pc but on my ps3 i have over 100 hrs on it. This game is so fun, and alot of people say it is outed and such, but it really doesnt affct the experience at all. its hard to belive this game came out over ten years ago. i would defintly rcomend this game and its so cheap so defintly buy to be immersed in cyridol, in tamriel on nirn- the world of the elder scrolls.

												the elder scrolls iv: oblivion is not realistic. if you're looking for realism, go away. the elder scrolls iv: oblivion is not graphically impressive. if you're looking for impressive visuals, go away. the elder scrolls iv: oblivion has a lot of content. if you expect to finish this game in your lifetime, go away. seriously, leave. you are wasting your time reading this.with that out of the way, here's my review. this is the game that quite honestly set a foundation for modern RPGs. it has everything you would expect in your average RPG: spooky dungeons, loot, exploring, a large amount of quests... but here's the thing. oblivion isn't an average RPG. it has a LOT to offer for what its worth now, and frankly i found this to be more engaging than skyrim. here's why!as i mentioned at the beginning of this review, it does not hold up well to todays standards. everyone has baby butt faces and it seems everyone, including the scrawny elderly beggars, is voiced by the voice actors that portrayed the intimidating imperial guards... it just looks goofy. but, if you strip it down to its core functions, you get a pretty solid RPG with plenty of features to occupy your mind.it may seem redundant at first: whack whack whack, slice slice slice. you start to realize dungeons look almost exactly the same. but fear not! there are plenty of treats to keep you occupied as you level up. dungeons start being populated by more frightening enemies, you start to get better tiers of armor and weaponry... you also start exploring some of the guilds and their special quests. i found myself forgetting about the main quest after 50 hours of gameplay involving side quests and world exploration... then realizing i still have the amulet of kings in my inventory. sorry emperor!!one of the highlights of this game--one of the reasons i find it TONS more exciting than skyrim--you can LITERALLY GO TO HELL. is that cool or what?! i think so!! bethesda games aren't known for having the most engaging main quests but this is honestly one of the main reasons why i prefer oblivion above skyrim. the story just feels more intriguing to me. in the DLC shivering isles, you can go to this crazy ""other world"" that has new enemies, new dungeons, and more content. i like that skyrim has naturally fixed the majority of what made oblivion so goofy (mods have fixed most of these problems anyway) but i find myself coming back to oblivion, a game nearly a decade old, and playing hour after hour only realizing that my entire day consisted of waking up, sitting down for 14 hours, and going back to bed.i really, really, super duper wish i could talk about this game for hours. thing is, the elder scrolls is a series you have to play for yourself to understand. still though, i hope this review was helpful for you RPG-goers <3			"

												Oblivion>Skyrim. Morrowind>Oblivion. If you like Bethesda RPG's and are tired of the over simplification of their games, Oblivion is a nice medium between ""I have no idea what I'm doing in this game(Morrowind)"" and ""I wish the game didn't hold my hand so much(Skyrim)"". I have beaten every quest in the game twice now so I am pretty comfortable in my viewpoint. When it came out it was a 9/10 in 2006... by todays standards I'm gonna give it a 7.5/10.My only compaint is that the environment scaling to the characters level completely destroys any sense of looting and novelty when exploring things. For instance, in Morrowind you may encounter a cave populated by extremely high level enemies at level 1. 99% of people are gonna die and just not come back until a higher level. But if you are intuitive, or can just really design a good build maybe you make it past them. And find some insane Daedric artifact or weapon, something ACTUALLY WORTHWHILE. I wish TES would go back to that type of system, it added such a huge element of surprise to the game and made exploring things actually worthwhile.			"

												Some people say Morrowind, some say Arx Fatalis and others will go for the Gothic Series. For me, it will never get better than Oblivion.When I first played this game in 2007 our (yes, OUR PC, I was young as hell and we were poor as ♥♥♥♥) could barely handle this at slightly below medium settings but I didn't care. Everything about this game just blew me the ♥♥♥♥ away. The music was amazing, the lands were fun to explore and the plot is still unique to this day. The story itself isn't very original: Ancient prophecy is broken so some duder has to unbreak some stuff so a bunch of duders don't kill all of the duders. That isn't what makes the plot unique. What makes this so different than normal is that you aren't the duder who's unbreaking things, you're a duder who breaks other things to help the main duder unbreak the stuff that wasn't supposed to be broken. You're just some ♥♥♥♥ that hits stuff with a sword when it gets in the way. You don't even play that big of a part in the story as a whole, you're just kind of there yet at the end of the day you feel more accomplished than you ever will in real life.Buy this game. If you don't then THIS IS THE PART WHERE YOU FALL DOWN AND BLEEED TO DEEEEEEEEEATH.			"

												Oblivion I feel is the weakest compared to Morrowind and Skyrim. It lacks the refinement of Skyrim in combat and radiant AI as well as Morrowind depth and quest connectivity. Nevertheless, I always enjoyed Oblivion quite a lot as it was my first TES game and the one the modded most heavily. While it can be quite bland in some places, I could always look past that but it could put off quite a few people. Then there are the mods. Personally, I always found that, at least for the moment, Oblivion mods are the easiest to find and most plentiful out of the TES games. Most MW mods seem scatter across various sites while the big Skyrim mods are still in deveiopement. Overall, I would say that it is still a pretty good game that definately is worth it.			"

												""STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM!"" These are words that summed up a game that cannot be possibly described in words. Building off the success and standard set by Morrowind, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion far more than its predecessor sucked us into a rich, breathing world filled with breath-taking scenery, towns with believable NPCs with voiced dialog, factions to join, houses to purchase. horses to ride and a vast amount to see and do. Oblivion like Morrowind before it was a game you poured hours into and could still not have seen even a fraction of the game's content. The sheer fidelity, quality, and scope of Oblivion set a standard for Western RPGs to come and heavily influenced the development of Fallout 3. Patrick Stewart even lends his talents to provide the voice of Emperor Uriel Septim.Once again, the reason why Oblivion has remained its legacy is the mod community. Oblivion has strong mod support and  countless mods have been created that add to the game and change the experience in significant ways. Among these is an Oblivion version of MOG*MOD. There is a wealth of content in this game, and with both expansions included, there is a lot to lose sleep over in this game.Out of the most recent The Elder Scrolls games, Oblivion to me seems to have aged the least well. Part of this is due to the way the leveling system can work against you, especially if you're a new player and make poor decisions leveling and allocating points. This leads to the ""leveling problem"" where at high levels you have an underpowered character but all other enemies have leveled appropriately. The other issue is the models themselves where most NPCs have an uncanny look to them and the odd decision not to include modeled facial hair (which was rectified in Skyrim). Thankfully there are mods to fix both these problems.Overall Oblivion is a fantastic and almost perfect game, overshadowed only by its successor Skyrim.			"

												For sure, one of the greatest fantasy games to-date.  I've cleared more than 300 hours in this incarnation, so time to write a review.I first purchased Oblivion while still in a life and death struggle (in more ways than one) with Morrowind, so I sat on it for a long time before I started playing.  When I did start playing, it was like a breath of fresh air.  The vanilla game was more than a little buggy but no worse than Morrowind.  It now looks very dated compared to more modern games (let's face it, it is ten years old).  It also frustrated me that the entire world levelled up with me.  As my characters gained in ability, so did the world around me, meaning progress quickly became entirely meaningless.This opens up one of Oblivion's better points.Since Oblivion was released, the modding community have updated and improved pretty much every aspect of the game.   Enhancements to textures and display features can transform the game's appearance.  The content of the open world has become even more open, with huge game-world additions, many of which being 'lore friendly', offering a deeper and wider world to explore.  Game mechanisms have also been updated and improved, and new spells, magical items, enemies and quests are available in vast numbers.  In my build, the world no longer levels with me.  Even the game's audio is open to enhancement.All of this choice will then introduce a dilemma.  These add-ons are not always stable, and the more one adds, the less stable the game becomes.  A gaming evening on Oblivion without crashes is unknown to me, and I have spent a great deal of time building the best possible platform I can.  Despite this, I count the crashes as part of the cost of having Oblivion with all of the extra content I have, and I would not want to play the game without that content.  And let's be clear:  Oblivion was not above random crashes even in its 'as shipped' state.So, what have I added that keeps Oblivion alive for me?I wouldn't play without Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul, the Unofficial Patches, Better Cities, and Unique Landscapes.  Despite some issues, Oblivion Reloaded has also become part of my standard build.  CM Partners adds two new dimensions - many more characters to interact and quest with, and a whole new level of instability to live with (which means I currently have it disabled).  Add to this a raft of game-play modifications and you have my basic build.This build allows me to explore a large game-play world that is a thing of beauty.  The original content was very extensive but the Mods expand it further.  Most of that additional content is good, although there are some moments that make me cringe.  At 2.5 Ghz and with Nvidia 970M my frame-rates are good - especially during indoor game-play.  Avoiding the crashes (or saving when recognising the signs of an imminent crash) has become part of the game-play.The biggest negative - No network play (as designed, and no mods to allow it so far as I am aware)So, to sum up.  A vast and flawed masterpiece.  Not as vast as Morrowind but not so flawed.  Above all, a game of great beauty that influenced many that followed.  Even today, it is worth the time and effort needed to keep it working at the optimum level for me.  My optimum level may be something different to everyone else's but that is another plus.  With a little effort (and more than likely a lot of patience) it can be configured however you want it.To borrow a well used phrase:10/10.  Would spend hundreds of hours perfecting my modlist again.			"

												While I have only played mere hours of this game on PC I have played days and weeks on consoles.  I had this game on release of the PS3, after waiting months after its release on Xbox.  I had to have it.  It revolutionised the gaming world for me.Oblivion has perhaps the most in depth questline of any game I have ever played, by questline I include the side quests in the world.  There is something for anyone in this game.There are many faults to this game, graphics, gameplay, voice acting (not the main characters for these are done superbly by Ian McKellen, Sean Bean and Terence Stamp).  But it is a world begging for adventure.If you like stories of questing and heroes then this is for you.A gem among RPGs.			"

												this game is such a pain in the ♥♥♥ to mod. unlike nv which is on the same engine, all the limitations of the software with this one make it incredibly unstable once you start fooling around with more complex graphical upgrades or anything with too much scripting. I think this is in part tied to the games inability to properly utilize modern hardware and any ram over 2 gigabytes (there is the 4gb patcher but it kind of doesn't work great in my experience with oblivion). so once you throw qarls on, maybe oco, maybe oscuros, a sprinkle of hgec and roberts, a dash of better cities, and oh say the graphics extender upgrade recently released and an enb upgraded to x64 enboost, it starts to not recognize what you've done, and then runs choppy anyway. and don't get me started on modding nehrim graphically. what a mess. which sucks because nehrim is so. cool.er anyway I put like 200 hours into this game on Xbox when I was younger and also like 100 hours into a wine skinned Mac port of it before I really got into pc gaming. it's a good game for what it is, buggy, expansive, uncanny, unruly, poor design of dungeons, excellent mid 2000s immersion. it's hard to go wrong with Bethesda for a very very baseline power fantasy, they don't do anything particularly great but the scope and freedom offered within its passable husk (bug testing notwithstanding) can def become addictive.

												I haven't scratched the surface of this game yet, but I can tell it's going to give me literally years of enjoyment.  If Bethesda were able to swing it, I'd bet a remake/remaster would be very well received, probably moreso than even the Skyrim remaster.  This is the Ultima X we wanted but never got after that abortion of a game:  Ascension.  It's actually quite overwhelming to get into if you do any research beforehand, so I'd probably suggest you close your eyes and just push the buy button.  You probably won't be disappointed provided you're able to get it running ok on your Win 10 computer.  There are some good quality of life mods on nexus for this game that will enhance gameplay and overall stability.			"

												My favorite game of all time, Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is truly a masterpiece. I have spent thousands of hours playing through it on the Xbox 360 back when that was a thing, and will likely match that feat again on the PC.The gameplay is stellar, the explorable world is massive, beautiful, and filled with interesting dungeons, quests, and fights, the AI is revolutionary, and overall it is just extraordinarily fun.My only gripes with it are the graphics, which are universally agreed to have not aged well (a problem solved relatively easily with mods), and that Bethesda has yet to remaster it (here's hoping).Don't get me wrong, Skyrim is amazing, a work of art in and of itself, but it doesn't quite compare to Oblivion for me. In fact, no game does, and I hate to think no other game ever will. But whether or not this is the case, I am glad to have played Oblivion in my lifetime.			"

												I played this back when I was first in middle school, so the review might have a bit of bias towards it. Nevertheless, Oblivion is personally my favorite elder scrolls game despite its generic european fantasy setting. The main selling points for this game are the side quests, specifically the guild quests. I wont spoil much, but they will make an impact on you and you will feel for some of its characters. Gameplay wise, oblivion has decent combat, even with the ability to actually dodge in all 4 directions. You might want to mod the game up though, but I fnd oblivion to have this charm that other elder scrolls games lack. personally 9.5/10compared to other TES 8/10			"

												A great game I have played since I was like 10. First game I ever had on PC with thousands of hours on the non-steam version. Only decided to get the steam version recently.Better than Skyrim. Only thing that makes Skyrim better is the Graphics (Who cares about that anyway?) and you can just mod oblivion to have really good graphics anyway. I could make a list of a billion reasons why Oblivion is better but honestly can't be bothered.			"

												This game is literally the best game i've ever played. I've played all the games from zelda, to world of warcraft, even minecraft and beyond, and I can say without a doubt in my mind that this is the best out of all of them. It's even better than it's more popular successor, skyrim. Great story, hundreds of hours of gameplay, amazing replay potential, tons of mods and a great community, plenty of guilds and classes to check out, even make your own, it's great in so many ways it's hard to count. The ONLY problem I have with this game is that it's not on mac! I played it on the ps3 and a lil on a laptop i used to own, and loved it, but am not capable of playing it currently because it isn't on mac. Anyways, enough rambling trying to get a mac release, this game is a must buy, and at 15-20 dollars for ALL the dlc and potential mods, it's the best 20 dollars you could ever spend on a video game. 10/10.

												If not one of the most best game from the elder scrolls series.There's a lot more stuff than you expect.Screw the graphics. Pros -Amazing dungeons.-Has more skills like athletics. Which skyrim has not.-Has more detail with small things. Like the chains at the start, you can move it by grabing it.-beautiful environment.-It has sheogorath.-Amazing soundtrack. Cons -Limited editing with character.I honesly can't think of anything else.Though, it did take me sometime to figure out if I was running or not. Because you can't actually run to be exact. Well, you can only jog, but to move faster, you need to upgrade your athletics skill to move faster.I would totally recommend this game to anyone wanting a good elder scrolls game.			"

												There's a big chance that you're looking at Oblivion because you played Skyrim and wanted to check the other Elder Scrolls games. This review is mainly going to be a comparison between the 2.Main story of Oblivion revolves around Martin Septim, the last remaining son of the emperor. He has to deal with Mehrunes Dagon, daedric prince who starts to open portals across Cyrodiil. You play as the Hero of Kvatch and help Martin by fetching him some important items and defeating a not so strong boss. Quests: There are no quest arrows in Oblivion. Markers are present on the compass.Quests themselves, at least a lot of them, just like in Skyrim, require dungeon crawling. The entire Fighters Guild questline is pretty much just this. Leveling: Leveling is quite different in Oblivion. At the start of the game, you choose your major skills. Training them allows you to level up. The minor skills can be trained as well though. In order to successfully level up and be able to choose which attributes to give points to, you have to sleep. Combat: Combat in Oblivion is a lot clunkier than in Skyrim. Also some enemies can make you fall and that is not fun to fight against, even though they barely scratch your health.Weapons and armor in Oblivion also have health. The more damaged they get, the less effective they are. In order to repair them, you need to buy or find repair hammers.You cannot fight while on a horse, but at least you have a first person camera. Alchemy: In Oblivion you don't need Alchemy stations, but you will need to find at least a mortar and a pestle, an item which lets you mix potions wherever you want, as long as there are no enemies nearby. Like in Skyrim, you can sample raw ingredients and level up your alchemy skill. Spells: Spells in Oblivion come from the schools that are in Skyrim plus the Mysticism school. If you are a Mage's Guild member and have access to the Arcane University you will be able to create your own spells. The more powerful the spell is, the more gold will be required.Enchanting is present as well. Enchanted items can be created from the sigil stones found in the Oblivion gates and the Altar of Enchanting found at the Arcane University. You can put as much effects as you want at an altar, but it will cost gold. Graphics: Obviously, Skyrim has the better graphics, but Oblivion can be modded as well, with overhauls and stuff.Overall, to me, Oblivion is an older Skyrim with different quests. The differences are not that big.			"

												With over one-thousand hours logged on the Xbox 360 version, I can safely say that Oblivion is my personal favorite of The Elder Scrolls games, and it is my all-time favorite video game.It is a wonderful open-world RPG that allows you to do almost anything in the beautiful province of Cyrodiil.

												How do I describe a game that is so important? So life-changing? This game is the definition of a masterpiece; from the way characters talk to you, recognize your feats (""It's you! The Hero of Kvatch! This is truly an honor!) to the way that you can wander anywhere you like and still experience a challenge; enemies will test you throughout the game. Some people don't like this form of levelling, but I love it; it keeps the game entertaining right through, unlike other RPGs, by which the end of the game I feel like one of, or maybe all of, the Nine Divines. In this game, things are kept challenging and given enough variety with all of the enemy types (Minotaurs, Land Dreugh, and an army of demons). This game truly is special to me. GameplayA first/third person rpg in which you can be any character you wanted to be. Ever dreamed of being a lizard who had a penchant for eating whole rounds of cheese at midnight every Fredas?Ever wanted to be a mighty warrior who enjoys stealing plates and pulling cutlery from dead wolves(?) Or perhaps you want to be something a little more... regular? The combat is probably the weakest part of the game, though luckily it's easy to master and the enemies remain challenging. You can go and talk to any friendly NPC and chat with them about the rumors of the day. Sometimes it's nice to pick up a note about a deed that you've done. ""Did you hear? The Fighters Guild is recruiting again."" StoryThe gates of Oblivion have been torn open after the Emperor's assassination. All his heirs lie dead, and you hold the Amulet of Kings, the key to this entire dilemma. The world is about to end-! But the world can wait because someone just asked me to investigate a merchant who is selling wares far below the average price... ooh some flowers by the side of the road!Graphics, Atmosphere and SoundThe graphics are looking a little rough these days. The potato faced people look sort of freakish to first time players, but after some hours, you come to appreciate their strange charm and their samey voice actors. The buildings, trees and grass all look nice from a distance, but standing face to face with them, some textures leave room for improvement. The voice actors are indeed all the same pretty much for each species; almost every Orc is acted by the same person, and so on, but you can get past that. The music is beautiful, I can't choose a favorite track. Very peaceful stuff. The atmosphere is impeccable and I love the way arrows bounce off metal surfaces but sink into wooden and flesh, the way characters and their cities look like they are actually lived in. Skyrim does this, but not to the same effect. I feel as though I am right there, in the moment. I am in Cyrodiil as I play Oblivion. That's how good the atmosphere is. ConclusionWait, you mean I haven't convinced you of the merits of this game which makes my day every time I play it?Play it. jmcone's Personal Rating: Essential "

												Just a full, rich, amazing game. I dumped well over 100 hours into this, at which point I decided to just go and beat the game because I have a backlog. But if I didn't own many other games, I could have easily played dozens of hours more. A huge world to run around in, various guilds to join and run quests for, various skills to improve through use, some interesting quests, and people in the world that react to your actions. The levelling system (which rewards you with better stats for NOT staying in-class) is blatantly stupid, but aside from that, Oblivion is a fantastic game, and anyone who doesn't hate RPGs should pick it up when it's on sale.

												It is a great game. So far I have around 40 hours on it and I have completed the main quest, thieves guild, dark brotherhood, arena, mages guild and almost the shivering isles. The review will be in 6 sections- graphics, combat/magic, guilds, dlc, main quest, overall.Graphics:Obviously due to its age oblivion is not looking great but it has aged quite well and the graphics does not change the fact that it is a great game. Also this can be touched up with mods.Combat/Magic:The combat is not great and not particularly enjoyable. I therefore enchanted my self an OP bow early that does a ton of damage spread over a large radius(it one hits pretty much everything in a certain radius from the guy that was hit with the arrow). However I like the fact that you can cast spells whilst having other weapons equipped unlike in skyrim.Guilds:This will be an oblivion to skyrim comparisonthieves guild is better in oblivion- you steal more, get better rewards and it is less of the dungeon crawling.dark brotherhood I would say is equal. In oblivion it is long but entertaining whereas skyrim it is short but sweetmages guild is better thsn the college of winterhold. The recommendations can be tedious but the rest is a lot better.fighters guild is do not know about as I have not done it.Arena is better than the s**t bards collegeDLC:This will be a skyrim to oblivion comparisonOblivion has a lot of useless dlc that pretty much equals hearthfire so i will only be talking about Knights of the nine, dawnguard, shivering isles and dragonborn.Shivering Isles is amazing and the best part of oblivion. It at the very least equals dragonborn another amazing dlc.Knights of the nine looks great whereas I did not much like dawnguard.Main Quest:Oblivion main story was a better plot the skyrim and felt more important. However the oblivion gates mechanic and the dragons both got boring. I enjoyed playing through both of them a lot and to be honest if you enjoyed either of them you will like the other.Overall: If you like skyrim do not be afraid to try oblivion. It might be tough to get used to but it is definitely on par with skyrim and if produced tomorrow would probably be a better game. "

												Many mechanics are flawed, the graphics are out-dated, it's buggy as hell, little to no controller support, every enemy is an arrow sponge past mid-difficulty level, and combat is terrible. You may be wondering at this point why I gave this game a positive rating... it's because this game is beautiful. This is the game you bring home to your mother, unlike that trash Skyrim (I love Skyrim). This is the game you cuddle up on a couch to, playing all night on xbox or playstation because you can't cuddle with a mouse and keyboard. This is the game that taught many people, including myself, what an rpg could truly be. This game did not have the extroardinary success that Skyrim had, nor did it redefine how gigantic an rpg could be like Morrowind, but what it did do is further push the standards, raising the bar even further than ever believed possible. This game helped further shape what it means to be an open world rpg today and like all Bethesda Game Studio's games it is a timeless classic that no matter how ugly, old, or broken it may seem; you have to give it a chance. Escape prison, help what was believed to be a simple farm boy become the emperor he was born to be, become a professional thief, help and fight daedric princes, join a guild, explore the world, become an arena grand champion, become a lethal assasin, become a true madman, and CLOSE SHUT THE JAWS...

The graphics are great for when it was released, the gameplay is usually pretty smooth and the quests have lots of different varities so it never really gets old. I am usually not a completionist in games but I found myself wanting to do EVERYTHING in this game. I play through about once a year. Very high replay value. Highly recommended.			"

												This game is simply.. No, insanely amazing! When you start playing it.. You're bound to crave for more.The exploration is worth it, you can go on exploring for hours. I found myself doing the main quest and often stop to explore something that peaked my interest, or simply started talking to a random NPC and got a new quest to do, that embarked me in another journey of finding more amazing stuff.This game is definitely worth picking up if you like RPGs, you'll get your money's worth, the gameplay can go on for hours and hours since there are many side quests and exploration you can do!

												Favorite thing about the game is how easily you can get lost in it. You think you're going to go on foot to reach your next destination, and suddenly you encounter a dozen different things on the way to distract you no matter which route you take. Now you're on a whole new sub-objective, and get turned around. Nothing to do but keep dealing with the other sub-objectives now right?One downside is the main story isn't the strongest part of the game, so it's easy to not care and instead do other things. With that said, if you do all the side missions related to the story, you're going to get a huge amount of lore and background in the game world which does balance out if you're into that.			"

												I personally think Oblivion is better than Skyrim, though Skyrim is less buggy and better in some ways. Obviously the graphics aren't as good as in Skyrim though they can be improved with mods if you don't like them. There are a few things that make Oblivion better than Skyrim in my opinion:More spell types and the ability to create your own spellsMore weapon/armour typesWeapon/armour degradation (must be repaired with hammers)Better guild storylines (the Dark Brotherhood guild especially is amazing, pure art)Bigger and more interesting cities (Imperial City is HUGE, so much stuff to steal as a thief)Another big deal for me is proper class distinction. Oblivion is traditional to the fantasy RPG genre in that it has set classes (or you can make your own if you wish) such as warrior, mage, thief and many other hybrid classes such as spellsword (mixture of destructive magic and swords) and battlemage (mixture of heavy armour and supporting magic) and so on and so on. This is a big deal for me because in fantasy role-playing games your class is who/what you are. It defines your character. In Oblivion, if you take warrior (with primary attributes of strength and vitality) then you're a warrior, pure and simple. You can use magic and increase your magic attributes if you like, but you'll never be as good with it as a proper mage class, it will merely be a minor supporting aspect. Plus wearing armour in Oblivion makes magic spells less powerful; the heavier the armour the less powerful spells become. In Skyrim, the ability to be every class all at once made me feel like I didn't have a specific class/role. One moment I could be an awesome warrior with a big axe, the next moment I could take my armour off and be an awesome mage, and in the next slip on some light armour and use a bow and sneak and be an awesome thief/assassin. I feel more at home in the traditional RPG custom of specific classes. It feels natural to me because it's what those games have always been based around. Like in real life, everybody has a specific role, making each person feel unique in some way. In real life you have carpenters, salesmen, lawyers and so on and so on and in traditional RPG's you have warriors, mages, thieves, assassins, alchemists - everybody has a unique role.There are some things I don't like about Oblivion though. The ruthless level-scaling means that when you are level 1, every other person/creature in the game is also level 1. When you are level 99, everybody else is level 99. You never feel truly in danger and you never feel truly heroic because everybody else is always just as strong as you are. Fortunately this is fixed perfectly in an amazing mod called Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul - I highly recommend this mod. I would never play Oblivion without it. It removes level-scaling entirely and makes the world an extremely dangerous and harsh place for newbies, but as you gain levels you become higher level and more powerful. So at level 1, you may run in to a level 3 mage bandit who kicks your butt. But when you get to level 10 he is still level 3 and you can show him who's the boss.			"

												My favorite game of all time, Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is truly a masterpiece. I have spent thousands of hours playing through it on the Xbox 360 back when that was a thing, and will likely match that feat again on the PC.The gameplay is stellar, the explorable world is massive, beautiful, and filled with interesting dungeons, quests, and fights, the AI is revolutionary, and overall it is just extraordinarily fun.My only gripes with it are the graphics, which are universally agreed to have not aged well (a problem solved relatively easily with mods), and that Bethesda has yet to remaster it (here's hoping).Don't get me wrong, Skyrim is amazing, a work of art in and of itself, but it doesn't quite compare to Oblivion for me. In fact, no game does, and I hate to think no other game ever will. But whether or not this is the case, I am glad to have played Oblivion in my lifetime.			"

												I played this back when I was first in middle school, so the review might have a bit of bias towards it. Nevertheless, Oblivion is personally my favorite elder scrolls game despite its generic european fantasy setting. The main selling points for this game are the side quests, specifically the guild quests. I wont spoil much, but they will make an impact on you and you will feel for some of its characters. Gameplay wise, oblivion has decent combat, even with the ability to actually dodge in all 4 directions. You might want to mod the game up though, but I fnd oblivion to have this charm that other elder scrolls games lack. personally 9.5/10compared to other TES 8/10			"

												Absolutely can recommend this game if you are a fan of RPGs, open-world games, simulation, or medieval settings in general. The world is vast, ready to be explored, and extremely charming. If it's on sale and you're hesitating, just get it already. You won't regret it!!! :D			"

												Had this game on console when it first came out on the Xbox 360. This game brings back great memories and is still a great game with a solid storyline. Probably still one have my favorite games on my PC. The game of the year edition brings so much more to the game with the Shivering Isles DLC. Overall fantastic game that i will always recommend.

												This is one of the best games ever made. This is best Elder Scroll game in my opinion, followed by morrowind. The world is so much prettier and more colourful, and the story is so much more interesting, and i personally prefer the UI, plus the quests are so much more than just going from A to B and wondering through caves. Everytime i play this game i'm overwhelmed by how much more their is to discover all these years later, and I am yet to get bored of it.			"

												Pretty much the very definition of an open-world RPG. Cyrodiil is massive, and is a joy to adventure through and even too look at. There is a lot of detail in the world and it is clear that a lot of time and love went into making an authentic looking, immersive fantasy world. That being said, the most important part of any RPG is the depth of the character customization and leveling, and Oblivion does a fine job at that. You can choose your race and change your appearence with a good amount of customization. The skill customization is deep enough to be able to play as seperate playstyles as a nimble theif who is great at lockpicking and a bow, a knight who wears heavy armour and wields massive battle axes, or a magic using mage. Having your skills level up the more you use them just makes sense, and has your character develop naturally, evolving on how you're playing the game without breaking up gameplay. The other most important thing in any RPG are the stories and sidequests. There are enough sidequests to make your head spin, and a lot of them do have interesting stories to tell. A lot of them I don't want to give away, so you'll have to find them on your own. There is also a great amount of items you can find and loot. From different weapons like swords and axes to different sets of armour, there's a lot to find in this game.Now for the things it didn't do particularly well. The story of the main questline isn't really that interesting, atleast to me. It just felt too predictable, and the segments where you actually travel into Oblivion itself were all really boring. The beautiful thing is, however, if you don't like the main questline, you can just skip it. An open-world game this massive is also prone to have some bugs. There are not a huge amount of them, just enough to warrant a mention. There are also a number of quests that aren't too captivating, but again, with this much content, you can't strike gold everytime.  There also seem to be a lack of voice actors and actresses in this game. There can't be more than ten of them; you will be hearing the same actors speak for totally different characters constantly. Combat also isn't the deepest thing in this game, it's usually just mindless swinging at enemies until they die first. Ranged combat with bows and magical spells fare a little better, but not by much.Now, this is the Game of the Year edition, so it comes with the two major expansions for the game. Knights of the Nine I didn't particularly care, mainly because I didn't find the storyline particularly interesting and it didn't add very much content-wise. Shivering Isles, however... holy crap. That's one of the best expansions to any open-world game ever with a very interesting new world, lots of interesting stories to tell, and overall just tonnes of new content.This game is worth your time and money. Nothing beats going on an adventure that you craft yourself, and Oblivion does a fantastic job at that.			"

 im only 5 hours in and thought i should make a first impressions review! i have grown up with the elder scrolls games and none have captured me as much as this. the start is fantastic. you awake in a prison, no idea how you got there. you get mocked and made fun of by a dark elf! Assasins have came and killed the emperors known sons and tried to kill the emperor! fortunatly he has been brought down to the prisons by the blades to escape through the secret tunnel in your cell. you are called out and questioned by the emperor but its ok he has seen you in his ""visions"". you are trusted to escape and follow them down the tunnel. you are then told to stop following and cut through a broken wall. along that way you fight skeevers and goblins. you acquire your first set of weapons and armour and head out. along the way you meet up with the emperor and the blades and help battle along side them.  ***SPOILER*** Unfortunatly the emperor is killed by mythic dawn / daedra and you are given the amulet and told to give it ito jaufree. so fast forward and you close an oblivion gate and dig deeper into the mythic dawn.... The Verdict so far.. so so far im enjoying how in depth thew game is. the combat is actually aged decently well and holds up. the story is capturing and brings you in quickly, the cities and towns actually give you feels. i remember walking around imperial city for the first time on xbox 360 and it meant nothing to me. i was young and only likes killing and stealing :D but now i get a warmish feeling from everyone greeting you and acknowledging who you are! Overall so far its an easy 9/10 only con is that camera angle sometimes and the slow movement until you level it up :D "

I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to deside their destiny, whether it be a master theif, arena champion maybe the best wizard in the world! This game is for people who love a deep story and love to choose what happens next.Go to all the cities of Cyrodill, or get some mods and go to other provinces, maybe Morrowind? Find secrets at every turn! Start one quest, accidently stumble upon another.Decide the fate of man as you, along side the Blades fight the evils within Oblivion!If you want one of the best RPG experiences ever, get this game.

												To start off, this is my favorite game of The Elder Scrolls series, I've spent +200 hours playing this game.This game is heavy, very heavy, I'm level 35 and I'm still getting kicked by some baddies. You start off as a prisoner, like in every other Elder Scrolls game.  The general storyline is alright, it could be better, but it's still very nice, it gives you the feeling to continue and watch what will happen next.The graphics of this game is not a total ""Wow this looks amazing!"" But it still looks alright.All of the citys are amazing, they're big, but it doesn't top the Imperial City, it's just AMAZING, I've never spend so much time playing in one single city.The modding, the f*cking modding, it's amazing, I enjoy it very much, there are so many mods, and there are still mods beeing created and updated, and holy crap, I modded out my oblivion very much, and it makes the game so much better. If you want to have a game that you can mod it madly, this is the game for you.			"

												I was first introduced to Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion when it came out on Xbox and now since discovering it again on PC, I'm reminded of why I never made a dent in the main quest.The open world of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion allows you to explore outside the main quest line due to the factions/guilds, side quests and the hidden ones.The Unofficial Elder Scrolls (http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Oblivion), I find espicially helpful when I'm stuck on what to do or where I need to go and mods such as the unofficial oblivion and shivering isles patches will make it difficult to go back to vanilla.Overall, I enjoy this game immensely and I highly recommend it.

												I know that Steam says (at the time of writing this review) that I only have about 21.5 hours on record, but I assure you that I put hundreds of hours into this game on my Xbox 360 before I got my PC. This game is undoubtedly one of my favorite and most likely one of the greatest games to ever be released. I can almost guarantee that you will like this game if you are an Open-World RPG fan. Let's open this game up and take a look inside one of the best isntallments in the Elder Scrolls Series. Gameplay:The most important element in a video game is the gameplay, and the Elder Scrolls IV has that down to a science. Sure, this game does a bit more hand-holding compared to its predecessors, which is completely undeniable. This game also has a simplified dialogue system and, in my opinion, terrible voice acting, but do not let these cons detract from the great game this is. Oblivion, being one of the only titles in the series to not be named after its main setting, offers amazing exploration and rewards it nicely, especially for you dungeon-crawlers. With the vast and open world of Cyrodiil at your fingertips, you can explore and discover some of the most beautiful and historical ruins, forts, hamlets, cities, castles, rivers, lakes, caves, mines, and many other dungeonesque sites. you won't just find enemies at these sites, though. Like I said before, exploration is rewarded.As for a replay-value: you will never play this game the same way twice. Sure, with the lack of ""radiant"" quests that are present in Skyrim (Oblivion's 'sequel') you basically know what's going to happen in any given quest you've already done, but you don't have to approach these quests the same way you did before. Perhaps in one playthrough you are a battlemage that wields a Dwarven axe whilst sending a barrage of lightning bolts towards your enemies, but in another playthrough you are an assassin that wields an Elven bow whilst sending a barrage of poisoned arrows towards your foes. With the class system in this game, you won't ever have to be the same character twice. I have had several different characters in this game, and each time I have played I experienced everything differently than before.Combat:The combat in Oblivion makes so much more sense than it did in Morrowind (Oblivion's 'prequel') in which you would swing your weapon into an enemies face and it wouldn't even phase them, but here in Oblivion, every hit is rewarded with a blade covered in blood and a scream from the other end of your sword. While the game doesn't do a very good job of challenging the player in combat as long as they follow the course provided for them, but there are places in this in which you will be absolutely brutalized if you go in unprepared. This is where exploring and being prepared come into play. Bows and arrows, swords, daggers, magic staves, maces, axes, or your own bloody fists are all at your disposal when it comes to combat in this game. Each comes with its own positive and its own negative, but the more experienced you become with your weapon of choice, the more rewarding your trudge through the cons will be. Choosing a weapon choice and becoming proficient with it is always a great choice, but, of course, you are not forced to do this. If you want to use swords and axes at the beginning and then halfway through decide that you want to use bows and arrows, go for it! You won't be held to the weapons you use in the beginning, it will just make the journey a bit more difficult on your way to mastering your new weapon type.Finally for combat, there is the Arena. This is perhaps one of the most popular features in ES4, and rightfully so. At any point, you can enter the Arena, join the team and fight for glory and money in a gladiator style throwdown. This is a great way to not only get yourself into the swing of things when it comes to combat, but it can also help you level up pretty quickly near the beginning of the game; be careful though, because the further you get in the Arena, the more challenging the enemies become!Graphics:I won't lie to you, the graphics in this game aren't the best, though at the time of its release (I remember very well) these graphics were some of the best I had ever seen! Without the proper mods, this game makes everyone look like they have  a potato-face and makes blood look like a powdery substance rather than a liquid. Fret not, though, like I said, mods are a beautiful thing when it comes to this game. I downloaded a buttload of mods and now my Oblivion looks almost as good as Skyrim. Don't worry, graphics have no effect on the gameplay anyways, unless graphics are very important to you.Immersion:As is the tradition when it comes to Elder Scrolls titles, immersion is a key feature in Oblivion. From the small details like being able to pick a random magical gem off its stand in a random tomb or being able to go for a stroll and pick flowers and mushrooms, to being able to commit murder on any unsuspecting NPC for no good reason and then going to prison because of your vile actions. Your actions have consequences, and almost everything you do will have an effect on how the world treats and sees you.Have a beer, read a book, eat dinner, spend the night in a hotel, buy a horse, ride that horse to another town and repeat the process. Any small action you can think of, you can most likely do it (no f@pping guys...)Performance:Considering this game came out almost 11 years ago, I'm pretty sure everyone on here will be able to run this game on at least the lowest settings and still hit 60 fps, but who knows.-Ratings-Gameplay: 9/10Combat: 8/10Graphics: 10/10 (At the time of its release)Immersion: 9/10Performance: 10/10=Conclusion=Definitely give this game a chance. If you're still on the edge of whether or not you want to buy it, watch some gameplay on Youtube, or look for some streams on Twitch, you are guaranteed to find something online somewhere that allows you to get a glimpse of the amazing game that Oblivion truly is.

Pros Questline stories & characters --- Though it remains straightforward and has a simpler plot that still doesn't quite reach its full potential, the main questline manages to overtake TES3's for presentation alone.	Everything is made up for in the game's countless side quests, which are easily the best in the series. Comical premises and unforgettable characters are plentiful, from helping a Wood Elf with his paranoia to quietly disposing of a mansion's guests by turning them against one another. Even the faction questlines, which were more errand-based in TES3, return with greater depth.	Since all the DLC is bundled with this release, it's also worth praising the Knights of the Nine and Shivering Isles expansions for the amount of content they add to the already immense base game. The latter also contains some of the most outrageous quests and characters in the series and is often considered the best video game expansion of all time. Soundtrack --- Possibly the best soundtrack in the series. The tracks are memorable and greatly enhance the atmosphere, especially in the overworld, where exploration is accompanied by a relaxing piece that always feels appropriate. Dungeons and cities now have their own unique track playlists unlike in TES3. Overworld --- As the geographical center of Tamriel, the province of Cyrodiil has a variety of landscapes thanks to the regions it borders; evergreen forests, marshes, snowy mountains, and seaport beaches. In addition, the Oblivion realms of Mehrunes Dagon and Sheogorath feature volcanic deadlands and an island straight out of a fantasy painting respectively. Visuals --- The textures on architecture and characters aren't the highest quality considering the detail of the models, but the landscape visuals can be stunning due to a graphical style that does not shy away from its color palette. Modding support --- Modding support returns for TES4 with improved functionality for mod creators and users.Neutral Gameplay --- Compared to TES3, its more modern approach makes it more tolerable for newcomers to the series, though at a cost of skills, attributes, and equipment variety. Dungeons --- More atmospheric and filled with more areas of interest compared to TES3. However, there are also fewer distinct dungeon types which may increase the sense of repetition in not just architecture, but enemy types as well.Cons Leveling system --- At higher player character levels, armors, weapons, and enemies become phased out. This leads to a loss in variety and item value when even the common bandit carries some of the best equipment in the game.ConclusionOf the three TES games released on the Gamebryo/Creation Engine so far, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is the most well-rounded. The gameplay can be described as ""one step forward, one step back"" as not everything survived the transition from its predecessor. Judgment on whether the additions are a net positive will come down to each individual player familiar with the series.TES4 also chooses a more traditional fantasy setting for its province as opposed to the imaginative, exotic land of Vvardenfell that was featured in TES3. Enemy types also seem more generic as a result. This is corrected in the Shivering Isles expansion where nothing is constrained by preestablished lore, allowing the developers to implement their wildest creations.While it doesn't have the same depth in its lore and world-building as TES3, TES4's presentation and incredible questlines make it a contender for being the best in the series. With more modern gameplay mechanics and visuals, it's admittedly also one of the best starting points in the series for newcomers.With hundreds of hours of content, it's highly recommended to buy The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

""Live another life in another world"".Immersion, open world, choices and roleplaying at it|s absolutely finest.One of the best games in existance, especially for the RPG genre.And now we have awards, like: The “Test of Time” AwardThis award is for the game that is just as good today as the day you first played it. Newer games may come out, but it doesn’t matter… you’ll always come back to play this one.This description is EXACTLY what I feel about Oblivion. I could not put it better.

A flawed and aged adventure in Cyrodiil, but incredibly soulfulThe questlines are lenthy and engaging. The scenery is awe inspiring. The character models and mechanics, however, haven't aged well. Combat in particular feels like a step in the right direction, but still far from satisfying. Yet, whatever flaws Oblivion has are easily fixed thanks to the extensive modding community. While Cyrodiil isn't quite as insteresting of a setting as Morrowind, it possesses a certain depth and character that Skyrim failed to live up to.			"

												If you are an Elder Scrolls fan, you probably have already picked up this game. In case you haven't though, here is why you need to. The Elder Scrolls series has been famous for its magic. The amount of detail spent on different types of spell types and effects is something truely the RPG fan will enjoy. The quests are all very entertaining and fun to do. The melee combat system could be a little less repetitive, but they still provide an entertaining time. It might be hard for the casual gamer to pick up and play, but it is worth the experience. I would give this game a solid 9.8. A few annoying glitches encountered made it a little difficult at times, and the melee combat could be better.			"

												I have played Oblivion for about 80+ hours, completed The Shivering Isles and the main questline. I still haven't gotten around to completing EVERY quest in the game, but I got most of it.In Oblivion, you start out in a prison cell after a small monologue and character creator. An NPC mocks your choice of race and then the emporer himself comes to your cell. The Septim line is being attacked by an unknown force, and he is escaping the city to survive. Destiny destiny destiny, tutorial, class picking, bla bla bla... and then you finally are put into the world. When you first step out, you'll either say one of two things: ""Wow! This is amazing!"" Or: ""Wow! These graphics suck!"" Oblivion is a dated classic, and doesn't look as good as games do now. But, if you can look past that, you can really find a gem.Like many RPGs, they either leave much to be desired or a years worth of adventure. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is full of places to go and things to do. But, this is where some problems arise. With so much to do leaves a lot to be desired, and some quests end up being your typical dungeon crawler. But the idea of having an open world to explore and do whatever you want is overwhelming and terrific. Every 1 in 3 quests though did have a great amount of originality to it, from stealing a prized gem in the imperial castle itself or going to another dimension to stop a man from destroying the world. It really is amazing if you can look past the typical dungeon quests that get boring after a while.Finally, the gameplay; the meat of the review. Oblivion's leveling is complicated at best and very hard to do sometimes. It tends to be stressful, and quite honestly, dull. Skyrim had done it much better. Swordplay tends to be just slashing around a sword hoping to hit. Magic is cool, though, as if you can get into the mages college, you can customize your spells. Archery takes precision and is pretty fun to try out. The difficulty slider in the options menu is literally just ""How many times do you want to hit this guy until he goes down?"" There is no reason whatsoever to put it up, just keep it 1/4 up to make it better. Fighting is fun in general, TL:DR.In the end, Oblivion is fun. It's really hard to critique this without coming across as a fan. But, I am a big fan of RPGs and you should take this review in the eyes of one. I can't see a huge FPS fan getting this and having as much fun as I did. This is really only a game for people who are not new to RPGs in general and like the idea of them. This game is a great game though, and I do fully recommend it from the eyes of an RPG fan. "

												The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion is an open world RPG set in Bethesda's original fantasy setting of Tamriel. This was the first Elder Scrolls Game i ever played which was back in 2011 (on PS3) and it got me into the series in general. It was released in 2006 and it was the first of game of its kind I have ever played (open world RPGs in this case) and it was the last in the series to have the class system and the first to not have the dice roll based combat like Morrowind, Daggerfall, and Arena (Elder Scrolls Arena and Daggerfall are both free by the way if you want to try, Daggerfall is amazing).  There are 9 races and you can create your own custom class and this game is very mod friendly as well so if you want to buy this game I recommend you do especially if you are new to the Elder Scrolls series considering it isn't as in depth as the first 3 games in the series. Lets not forget the amazing amount of great mods for this game which are pretty easy to install, Link for mods http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/top/?. And for a mod tutorial

												Oblivion shall forever have a special place in my heart, as it is the game that made me fall in love with RPGs and, more generally speaking, PC gaming. I think I own at least 3 copies of it (a physical disk PC one I played first and for the most time, a PS3 one someone gave me that I didn't play very much for obvious reasons, and this Steam one). I still consider it to be the best in the Elder Scrolls series, and I keep coming back to it every now and then.			"

												Do yourself a favor - and don't blast through the main questline. If you do, you'll have the game beat in like 8-10 hours. Oblivion is the game before Skyrim and has a great deal of content to offer you. Explore out in the wilderness, steal some stuff, kill a person because ""mother"" told you to. It's all there really. Magic is the most powerful of all things in this game, and made more powerful by the ability to craft your own spells. You can make yourself an unstoppable force with weapon/armor from enchanting.Go back to the days where you can find magical equipment that does it's own special thing like a ""underwater breathing ring"" and explore the vast underwater in search of chests and caves. This game is fun - seriously. The only difficulty I could see with folks, is if they played Skyrim before this - the graphics and such... well... they're worse, which is to be expected. Some find this acceptable, while others run away with eyes bleeding. But really - it was fun, took a good while before I got tired of it.  "

And although I am a big fan of Skyrim, Oblivion has it beat in my opinion for better/ longer quests, better skill builds, and better DLC. I highly reccomend it to anyone who hasnt already played it and is a big fan of Skyrim.

												Oblivion is a wonderful game for many of the previously stated reasons. It combines decent combat with interesting quest lines and likable npc's. This, however, is not why I would suggest it. Any number of other RPG's have better combat, better fleshed out quests, or more realistic npc's. No, what sets this game apart is it's open world. With many other ""open world"" RPG's you are still pressed to follow the main quest line and, once it's done, you're done and left with little else to do. This adds to how immersive the game is and, above all else, stresses the ""Role-playing"" aspect of ""Role-Playing Game"".  So what the combat isn't as impressive as that of Dragon Age? You don't have to min-max in Oblivion: you just play and enjoy the beautiful vistas of Cyrodill. I would also like to add that there are literally thousands of mods that improve upon every problem present with the game and even improve on the good aspects. (P.S. There's no Workshop support, so you have to use a mod manager and stuff. I personally suggest OBMM (Oblivion Mod Manager) and the use of the Nexus mods webpage.)Just wanted to say, I nominate this game for the ""Stands the Test of Time"" steam award. After more than 10 years, it's still one of my favourite games.			"

												After playing this game for several hundred hours on console I absolutely loved it. I then did the same on Skyrim, hundreds of hours. I recently bought oblivion again on pc and my god it is a far superior game to Skyrim in most aspects. The lore is extremely rich and feels a lot more meaningful in this game. It feels alot more of an rpg than skyrim does. From the fighter's guild to the arena all of the guilds feel extremely fleshed out and well thought out when compared to skyrim. All in all I personally believe this game is one of the best of all time and easily my favourite game I have ever played through. I adore this game, please purchase it if you get the chance, you won't regret it.			"

												Morrowind was never able to catch my interest very much to play it extensively. Skyrim was a little too overdone for me but here was this game in the middle of the two that was just perfect, even the graphics still stun me even though they are from back in 2007. As i said skyrim was too easy for me and i grew old of the whole dragonborn thing and killing alduin 8 times. But playing oblivion everytime i do a quest or beat the game it feels different every time. If you want a wonderful experience this is the game for you.			"

												[Full Review of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]Graphics:This game came out in 2006 so the graphics are obviously going to be dated by this point, but if you've played Bethesda RPGs before, you already know that the graphics aren't going to be the strongest aspect of the game anyway. Aside from graphical quality, the landscape is bright and beautiful as well as very detailed, considering it's size. Certain towns and locations obviously got more attention than others though and the characters look . . . not . . . good. However this game is huge and features a tremendous amount of content so it gets a slight pass. - 7/10Audio:Again, if you've played a Bethesda RPG before (specifically an Elder Scrolls game) you already have a pretty good idea of what to expect. The soundtrack is nothing short of amazing - it always is in Elder Scrolls' games. So, no surprises there - Jeremy Soule is a god amongst men and all that. Sound effects are also good but I wasn't too crazy about the voice acting in this one, though maybe that's just me. Extremely strong audio presentation overall. - 9/10Gameplay:It's your standard RPG with a whole mess of choices to make while creating your character including race, class, attributes, ect. There are many options but it ultimately boils down to the basic warrior, mage, and rogue classes - though you can use any style of weapons, armor, and magic regardless of class, which is a mechanic unique to Bethesda I believe. Combat is nothing special but, then again, it hardly ever is in RPGs. Exploration, however, is one of the strongest aspects of Oblivion and what ultimately makes the game as addicting as it is. You will feel like a real adventurer traveling across Cyrodil saving the world, as well as a few NPCs, along the way. - 8/10Story:So, basically, you are the chosen one and it's your destiny to save the world. Super original right? But in all seriousness, the main quest line is pretty interesting and I found myself completely invested in the story by the time it was over. In addition to the main quest line there are also several others (Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, Mages Guild, Fighters Guild, ect.) in addition to TONS of other side quests. All in all, there is a lot of story here, most of which is pretty interesting. - 10/10Replayability:It's an RPG . . . and it's made by Bethesda. Just those two facts alone should tell you that you are not going to be leaving your computer screen for quite a few days, should you choose to pick this game up. I've personally played hundreds of hours of Oblivion across all platforms and still haven't completed all the quests. Also, there's real incentive to play multiple times since there are numerous races (all with special abilities) and some really fun quests that you'll probably want to replay but not a lot of key decisions to make throughout the game, at least for an RPG. So, yeah, there's replayability here. - 9/10Overall:Oblivion wasn't declared GOTY by everyone for no reason. The explorations mechanics, interesting storyline, and immersive universe all come together perfectly to, once again, give us an addicting role-play experience. If you've never played it for some reason, you need to pick up the GOTY edition like, right now. - 8.6/10			"

												Besides Arena, this is my least favorite Elder Scrolls game, The graphics for the environments are nice but the NPCs are ugly as sin, the attempts at immersion are shoddy at best, and the minigames are annoying and rather idiotic.Despite this, the main quest is excellent and so are many of the main faction quests such as the Dark Brotherhood, and many of the issues I wrote above can be rectified with proper use of mods. One of the best games for getting into pre-Skyrim Elder Scrolls games.			"

												I can remember the first time that i played Oblivion as clear as day still.This game stole hundreds of hours of my life on the X-Box 360 version. Not really started it yet on the P.C. ""But Planning odd hour here & there, ""Time permitting of course.""""But what i can say and  assure any body who's looking into getting into the RPG's of Bethesda's, is to go for it, as believe me when i say that you wont be dissapointed by having this game in your collection/library, and i will promise you that you will lose more time to this game than any other you have in your collection, say bar Skyrim.As for recommendingYES DefinatelyOverall Score : 9.0/10.0The reasons that i have given a 9.0 score is for the shear amount of fun and quests that you can do in this game, yeah it might not be the best looking NOW, but back in the day when i first fired up the game and left the cellar/dungeon and into the beauty that is tamriel, i was in complete awstruckness at its size.Plus there is also the DLC's for people intrested in expanding out and extra quests...Cheersmark117h			"

												My first and probably my personal favourite Elder Scrolls game, though I can see why other titles in the series may be considered better. The experience on the 360 was alright, but if you plan on buying it on PC be ready to mod the ♥♥♥♥ out of the game. Some things feel okay for consoles but not so much for the PC like the UI and graphical fidelity, then there are some other quality of life things too you might want. One thing that I found can't quite be fixed with mods is the horrid level scaling. Sure there are a few combat and level scaling overhauls and what not but they're a bit of a pain to install and get working and they tend to either not fix the problem or make it worse by making basic enemies like bandits tough as ♥♥♥♥ from the start. But enough of my rant, either way if you haven't played another Elder Scrolls game you'll probably enjoy this one, but if you have then you will probably want to mod it in some way or another. DEfinitely better than Skyrim though, 10/10 GOTYAY			"

												I recently wrote a very long review on The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Game of the Year Edition so this time is the turn of the next chapter in the Elder Scrolls series, Oblivion. I must be honest I had never played Oblivion before I purchased it here. I had played Morrowind for years and ended up jumping straight to Skyrim (both on the Xbox/PS3 depending on which one you are referring too) I don't think this was as much a case of oversight as a little research showed me that Oblivion, despite it being a good game, was just released at a time where RPG games where becoming the norm and the market was flooded with a million sub-par attempts. The same could be said for the precursor to Skyrim, Dragonborn, which suffered a similar fate. Not that it really damaged its' reputation at all as Oblivion is still one of the most highly praised games of the entire Elder Scrolls series. I really settled into this game well. It didn't take long to get going with the first quests of the main storyline which I decided to complete first. It was well laid out and the actual storyline itself was gripping. From semi breaking out of prison to finding the hidden Septim son Martin all the way to the crux of the main storyline where you get one of the most amazing pieces of CGI in a cut scene. I won't go to far into it for those that have not played it yet or have not gotten that far but all I will say is Golden Dragon... (A wimpy girly moment led me to go ""ooooh"" LOL). Now would be a good time to mention the graphics and scenery which are stunning.After all of that though, which takes a fair amount of time but is no-where near as long as the mainline in Morrowind, you can then go on to do the two extra DLC's which come complete with the Game of the Year Edition. The first one was The Shivering Isles which is by far my favourite part of the entire game. I just loved everything about it. From the insane world created by Lord Sheogorath to the way the guy speaks. I literally had moments during this part of the game where I was in fits of laughter at some of the things he would say randomly whilst trying to help you prevent the Graymarch.The icing on the cake of this one is that you get to become Lord Sheogorath, but don't worry you aren't insane and you can come and go into Cyrodill and the Shivering Isles as you please. The last add on is The Knight of the Nine. This is by far the biggest let down of the whole game. All you do is pretty much run around getting blessings from 9 different shrines and then finding old relics of the Divine Crusader all of which together will allow you to kill Umaril the Unfeathered of which at the end leaves you with a rather large and heavy set of armour and that is pretty much the end of the DLC. This, to me, was just not worth the time put in to find everything (it took a while as this one has little prompt) and was just anti-climatic at the end. Of course after all of the mainline and add ons were completed I set about clearing up sidequests and doing things for the Fighters and Mages guilds. I also went to the Imperial City Arena and became Grand Champion because why not. But I felt that all of the side quests and the Fighters/Mages guild stuff was just all very mundane and boring and really lacked the kind of thought that had gone into the mainlines in such a way where it almost felt like the creators had, had enough at this point and just wanted it finished. All of this is good fun though, even if walking around everywhere being called Champion, lord, hero, knight, sister ect does get a little tiresome, but of course once the mainline and the DLCs are done there really isn't all that much left to do and really in my eyes at least I felt that the game had ended for me.My only major complaint though is that it seems that this game suffers from some pretty irking bugs in the quests. I got stuck numerous times where the game just wouldn't progress despite me doing what it asked only to look it up and find that countless others had the same problem. Of course most of the bugs had patches made to fix them but I didn't have time for that so opted for the slight cheat route of using the Console to force the quest along to the next point which works but of course can end up cutting out a huge portion of a quest or leaving you a little confused as to what to do next, in some cases it almost led me to do a quest backwards getting other journal entries about something I had done previously.I must add that there are hundreds of tutorials and tips and cheats online for the game which do help to make a bit of an interesting character or to get you through a rather tough patch but ultimately it is far more fun to run around and try and do as much as you can for yourself.One last thing.... Keep and eye out for the UNICORN. It's the only one in the entire gamePS. Why make riding the horses so complicated. You have to control it with the keys alone unlike the character which you can control with both the mouse and keys... This would have been a little more helpful as I spent a lot of time getting stuck on rocks and with the horse looking the wrong way despite what I was telling it to do. Also I'm pretty sure being on a horse was slower than running. On the plus side I did end up with a series of horses and people following me around all of which would fight/protect/get in the way if I was attacked which made for some interesting moments.			"

												As someone who almost spend 100h on this game, I can seriously say that to the elder scrolls series, this game is the mario 3 to the super mario games. A formula that works and is fun, but it's just better and a more refined game. I certaintly think Skyrim has made even more improvements to the franchise, but it'll still never catch the charm this game delivered. The epicly crafted open world of Cyrodiil is open, cozy, natural and rural, the way I like it. Dungeons and its loot aren't as unique as Skyrim, yet they still offer great fun. Great story, but I think no one can argue about that, in specific with the dark brotherhood. Character creation isn't perfect, but it's more open than SKyrim, music's top notch and for a 2006 game; it's graphics are great and detailed. So buy it and have yourself an immerive journey through one of the best RPG-games of the 21st century, it's worth every single penny!			"

												The first thing i said half way through Playign Skyrim was ""Oblivion had way more places to go and stuff to do"".  After playing through Oblivion 4 times as different characters back when it came out and now just a few days ago grabbing it here and starting over again i noticed that i was right about Skyrim its just not as big as Oblivion is. Just looking at an online map of Oblivion compared to the online map of Skyrim confirms it, You can't walk 15 seconds in any direction without running into something of interest where as Skyrim had swathes of barren landscape. this isnt to say Skyrim was bad it was just toned down for the lowered attention span of todays Child Gamers AKA console crowd, Oblivion is just less feature creap and more substance to me.

												As you can tell from the hours I have put into this game, I have greatly enjoyed every moment of it. Although, some quests can be quite challenging, your friendly and not so friendly community will give you information to help you on your way. That of course, you have to build your points in each level you achieve, such as personality, strength, intelligence and so on. The not so challenging, but would I say repetitive quest was definitely the 'Finding Your Roots' quest, where I was constantly being told to collect 10, and then 20, and then 30, and lastly 40 Nirnroots, and dreadfully being told I can  collect more Nirnroot for future references. After spending 3 hours on the entire quest, I think I will leave it be for now. A proud moment for me was when I finally found all the ingredients to cure my Vampirism. Seek that choice at your own cost! But most of all, when you close all the Oblivion gates, that is a great achievement. The game itself presents a lot of adventure, a huge variety of quests, a lot of places to explore and lots of dangerous species to kill which makes the entire game as a whole, a really great game play. As part of the Elder Scrolls, I recommend playing this game first out of the series. "

												I loved Fallout 3, and I loved Morrowind, but Oblivion has actually stuck with me more than both. A tour of its most recognisable locations and the early quests would be pretty uninspiring, but if you live in that world for a while, it has an incredible sense of place. And it does feel like living. The total freedom of what to specialise in, what goals to pursue, how to achieve them – none of those things are unique individually, but put them together and you have something that’s more of a world than a game. That will continue to excite me more than anything else in the genre until Skyrim comes along and does it all again.			"

												Arguably the best installment of the Elder Scrolls series (yes, I too love Morrowind dearly but let's be real, many of its systems and all of its visuals are too horrible to endure in this day and age, despite the plot and setting).The most landscape variation in any TES title, great imaginative sidequests, far more interesting NPCs than the mind-numbing bores of Skyrim. Oblivion gates can get a little boring but nobody's forcing you to really go in all of them.If only we could get all of this beauty ported to the Skyrim engine one day...			"

												Saved Bruma from being demolished by a Great Oblivion Gate... so I destroyed the gate, Daedra invasion stopped. However... that was not the end as the Empire descended into CIVIL WAR whilst Daedra were attacking them all at once, but they paused for a moment all because someone accidentally hit the Emperor, then everyone started to battle each other, slashing swords and clad at everybody and knocking any and all unconcious (or killed) whilst the Daedra just stand there literally watching, with me included.Thought I'd try to talk to one but I got the ""BE QUICK ABOUT IT MORTAL"" approach. He wasn't very interested in speaking.All I saw was hordes of guards from all the different cities rushing from each end and more and more began joining in the frey, including Imperial Soldiers. In the end, when the Emperor was knocked unconcious, everyone started clapping and celebrating and moved on with their daily lives, while Emperor Martin Septim just laid on the ground, ♥♥♥♥ing comatose. Then, the Daedra and the guards started fighting each other and it started happening again.The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion is just fantastic. lmfao_____So, I have completed the Dark Brotherhood questline. However, I was supposed to wait for someone to assassinate at a certain time in one of the cities. So, I used the waiting option. Ofcourse it wouldn't kill me for just waiting a bit (WROOONNNGGG).So, after waiting, battle music started and I was ontop of one of the houses. I saw someone at the last second, pulling out a bow and firing an arrow straight on my face when I was ontop of a three/four story building. It was such a strong blow that it lifted me off my feet, casted me down to the ground and I died. Bloody hell!Reloaded from the same waiting save, managed to get out the way before it would happen again (lol). Killed the lad, Lucius randomly popped out of thin air when I killed one person and started screaming that I was a traitor I ""shouldn't"" have exactly killed the person I should have. He preached on about how he was going to kill me and then started to say ""Oh, you're confused aren't you. I should be killing you but something tells me I shouldn't be!""So ofcourse, Lucius is blabbering on about a plan to catch a member of the Brotherhood, so I inadvertintly agree, no doubt. So, as I pressed forth, I turn around to see him actually RUNNING OFF into the distance when he's describing his plan. So ofcourse, I wouldn't exactly figure it out because herp-a-derp master of stealthiness just decided to go for a jog.His voice got lower in sound and all I heard was: ""The Dark Brotherhood will rise again! NOW GGGOOOooooooooo-"" and he then leaves the city. So I do too, heading to my next quest location.So, I realized what I had to do eventually, but in the top left of my screen, it then stated that ""Lucius <Insert second name here> is unconcious."" atleast half a dozon times over, just after he stated he needed to go into hiding. He didn't get very far, then.Better than Skyrim. xD			"

												I might be a little biased because this was my first elder scrolls, but Oblivion is one of the best games I have ever played - it practicaly dominated my life in middle school. I use to play it on the xbox 360, and I wouldn't be suprised if I have put 1000+ hours into the game. Its combat system is clunky, its leveling impractical, and its lack of voice actors hilarious - but I love every bit of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

I have had a few friends dislike the game because ""it doesn't have smithing?! how am I supposed to get good armor?! This game sucks!"" In my opinion the reason that some people don't like this game is because they can't appreciate it on its own, and think that it's not good because it doesn't have some of the features that Skyrim does.

												I originally played this game for over 200 hours when it first came out. This is truly one of my favorites of favorites the story and scenery are far more superior to Skyrim, but the graphics are a little dated but well enough (before modding) as well as the game engine a little buggy (I recommend the unofficial patch to fix). I went through another play through and modded it to look better and I can really say it looks better with mods almost as good as Skyrim after I was done with it. I’m also using Xpadder to map the keyboard keys to a XBOX one controller and I seem to be getting great results with it. I would say all and all this game is a great experience 10/10 for an open world RPG with no remorse starting out. you will get lost or try to wander at first, but try to stick to the main quest for a little bit till you get a little more powerful before wandering off.The thieves guild and dark brotherhood quest are some of the best game play in the series to date, and the add on DLCs are some of the best pieces of work I’ve seen take an already brilliant captivating game to a whole other level over and beyond  11/10 what it is and make it that much better. Note: If you played this on Xbox or PS3 Port, you my friend were bamboozled with sub-par graphics and lower res that’s just atrocious and downright unplayable. The PC copy (GOTY) edition with some mods (not to many) to make it look nicer, I’ll play it all day long and revisit time and time again.    "

												This is the game that got me addicted to the Elder Scrolls series. The game is visually stunning and full of appealing colors. The world is gigantic, the modding community is gigantic, and a ton of quests to keep you busy for hundreds of hours. The game however isn't quite perfect, the RPG system isn't that great, the ending was extremely anti-climatic (something Bethesda is known for), and there are a ton of glitches. Fortunately there are unofficial patches that attempt to fix most of these issues, but there's always going to be glitches overlooked. But the game is still more fun than frustrating. I do highly recommend you play Oblivion, it's not as good as Skyrim, but it's at least more appealing to look at.			"

												Every characters face looks melted like a barbie doll that your older brother lit on fire. The expansions are ok but it is the horse armor dlc that really adds the most content to the game I think. Its a solid 10/10 as changing your load order of mods it is basically another game so you are getting two games and horse armor for the price of one			"

												I might be a little biased because this was my first elder scrolls, but Oblivion is one of the best games I have ever played - it practicaly dominated my life in middle school. I use to play it on the xbox 360, and I wouldn't be suprised if I have put 1000+ hours into the game. Its combat system is clunky, its leveling impractical, and its lack of voice actors hilarious - but I love every bit of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. If you come from playing Skyrim, beware: this game is not the same as Skyrim, and you should have reasonable expectations of Oblivion. I have had a few friends dislike the game because ""it doesn't have smithing?! how am I supposed to get good armor?! This game sucks!"" In my opinion the reason that some people don't like this game is because they can't appreciate it on its own, and think that it's not good because it doesn't have some of the features that Skyrim does. Don't get me wrong, the game has flaws. But as I said before, I love this game, and I would certianly reccomend it to anyone who likes a good RPG.			"

												By far the greatest game I have ever played. I first played Oblivion many years ago, getting the Game of the Year edition on two disk DVD Rom. I remember falling in love with the world of Elder Scrolls Bethesda built in Oblivion. All these years later, I still find myself coming back to play the game again and again and again. Even with Skyrim and the Fallouts and all kinds of other things to play, Oblivion is the game that I always come back to. The stories and characters built in Oblivion truly showcase the epitome of an RPG, as does the customization and endless replayability. I'll always go back to Cyrodiil for more. I can't recommend this game enough.			"

												After Morrowind, this game was a big step forward. Much-improved graphics and gameplay (plus, no cliff-gliders!).  In Morrowind,  I don't think had a truly central story-line. Oblivion changes all of that, giving a core story, many side-quests and the early stages of playing a monk character, which was even better in Skyrim thanks to a mod.Too bad the idea of The Workshop mods hadn't surfaced yet. Thank god for The Elder Scrolls Wiki, which finally gave you a bit of a leg up when you needed it. Good voice acting throughout, with Patrick Stewart and Sean Bean included, just to mention two.  My younger son refused to play the game for awhile, believing Morrowind was ""pure"" Elder Scroll game. After he got, he never looked backed.I've recently started a new game as I was having issues with Skyrim: Legendary Edition (some of my old Skyrim files still in the library caused it, I think) and i plan on playing this Bethesda game until I can get its sequel program up and running again.One nice thing: nowhere near as buggy as Elder Scrolls 3, with few crashes and I think its playability has stood the test of time. Having the game of the year helps, too.I give a 8 out of ten septims!			"

												It hits that sweet spot.You know, that one right between morrowind and skyrim. Morrowind was great, but had just too many unnecessary hoops to jump through. Skyrim was also a platinum quality game, but it's instant gratification based gameplay left out that special something from the deeper aspects of traditional RPGs. Oblivion has fairly well aged graphics (even better with mod support), relatively lively combat, a lot of deeper RPG elements compacted and presented by a user friendly UI, and all that delicious Bethesda game freedom. Other RPGs might beat it in combat fluidity or graphic style, but this is as close as you'll get to ole pen-and-paper fun without sacrificing any ease of use. Doesn't have spears though.			"

And works perfectly on win 7 if anyone wonders.Graphics are fair, shouldnt lag. Game has bounty system, so before killing inocents need make sure noone sees you.Dont wanna spoil game, but those who played Gothic series, or previous Elder Scroll games, wount be dissapointed.Pros:         I. Gameplay not repetitive.          When you join guild, missions they give all diferent from each other. If you gota kill someone, you wil be asked do it each time in diferent way.       II. Alot of skill choices, even vcustom skill tree.      III. Conbat mechanics totaly manual, no auto target stuff.      IV. Fast travel between locations you already found.       V. Interesting lore.       VI.Ability become vampire. Cons:         I. Oblivion gates all too similar.       II. When you kill a city guard, and EVEN if noone saw it- you will stil get bounty. It sucks.       III. Lack of your own choices in lore.All in all game is adictive and awesome.			"

												I've been hooked on this game since I was like 9, and I consistently have difficulties pressing the ""exit"" button and going back to my real life. Thankfully, the game crashes every few hours for no reason, so I've never had to worry too much about it.Still, I just gotta say, the Dark Brotherhood questline in Oblivion is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing compared to Skyrim's ♥♥♥♥ ""kill these random dudes anyway you want"" spiel. The quests, in general, try not to take themselves too seriously and I'm glad they don't lay it heavy on the Grit. As long as you're not too miffed about the really ♥♥♥♥ing ugly faces (see: Hackdirt Brethren) or some of the glitches, it's a pretty fun game and has high nostalgic value. OH, also, Shivering Isles is pretty interesting visually and story-wise, but some parts of it made me rather uncomfortable (ah... the ableism... like if you have any mental illnesses like me, you'll definitely go ""Yikes!"" a few times). Buy this when it's on sale because it's not worth its posted $20 for how old it is. Also, practice Safe Saving.			"

												I originally played this game on Xbox 360, where it quickly became my favourite video game of all time. I can only imagine the PC experience is much richer.Before discovering The Elder Scrolls, I had very limited experience of playing RPGs - the only ones I can remember playing were Pokémon and FInal Fantasy VIII. Both of which I enjoyed immensely, but I still stuck to action adventure games, strategy games and first person shooters.Then Oblivion came along and changed my life. I mean it - this game has affected the way I look at sunsets ever since. Some real sunsets I've seen have almost been as pretty as those in this game.Bethesda's mantra is ""be who you want to be"" and Oblivion allows you to do just that. The early moment in the game where the protagonist steps out of a linear, grey darkness and into a sumptuous open world of possibilities accurately reflects my own gaming life upon discovering this game.Unfortunately, as has happened with its predecessor Morrowind, Oblivion has become dated and now seems rather clunky and rough around the edges. It might be difficult for a player used to modern open world RPGs to step back and enjoy Oblivion in quite the same way I did. But damn, I just want everyone to feel the way I did when this game's world eclipsed my own.			"

												Oblivion, the game that made RPGing it's ♥♥♥♥♥.Okay, that's aiming a bit high. But it still felt like that for the hundreds of hours I've poured into this game.I was first introduced to oblivion on the PS3 right before the release of skyrim and Ho-ly HELL! Oblivion has aged quite a bit, but it's still a great game if you can get used to old graphics (Which shouldn't be that big of a deal, tbh)This wouldn't be an elder scrolls game without modding, now would it? I don't know about you or anyone else who played this, but I would always get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I couldn't wear the Palace Guard Armor that some of the Impieral city guards use. So I got a mod to let me wear it. I never liked how buggy the game was, though I bared it on consoles most of the time. PC roles around, a bug came, and guess what? Un-offfical patches, Ho!

The quests, plot, factions, and magic are all better than Skyrim's, and the Shivering Isles is probably the best DLC I've ever played for any game.

												The additions to the game of the year addition is well worth the $5 extra you pay from the regular game of the year addition, you have 3 awesome new homes, 1 for a mage, 1 for a knight and 1 for an assasain, they're not just cool looking, they also are very useful to the class they were made for. The mage's home has a spell making alter, an atronach forge (3 whatever-element salt makes an atronach, that isn't timed, it's like a companion) an enchanting alter, a teleporter to each mages guild and the arcane university, alchemy lab.The knights home has a stable, a personal smith and other assistants.I haven't checked out the assassains  place, the horse armor is a cool feature, makes horses easier to keep.The added quests i've played were very fun, but i haven't played all of them; all in all i wouldn't play any other version of Oblivion, kinda sucks this is only for pc, but not for me so whatever.

The difficulty is just right, and I love the speechcraft minigame. Cons:THE DAMN LOCKPICKING HOLY CRAP			"

												it's a very great game, I would recomend it because it is super fun to play and fool around but also hard to level up your character, and that's what I like. I also like that you can create a class where you can choose the major skills that you level up so that you can level up you main level. it's also amazing because you can cast a spell even if you have a two handed weopen equiped, and you can also adventure around and that's the most fun part because you can kill enemies on the way and you can look through the gates of oblivion while you are adventuring around trying to find items, weapons or armour. My conclusion is that you should get this game and that you should play it cause it looks better than skyrim!!!			"

												Oblivion, the game that made RPGing it's ♥♥♥♥♥.Okay, that's aiming a bit high. But it still felt like that for the hundreds of hours I've poured into this game.I was first introduced to oblivion on the PS3 right before the release of skyrim and Ho-ly HELL! Oblivion has aged quite a bit, but it's still a great game if you can get used to old graphics (Which shouldn't be that big of a deal, tbh)This wouldn't be an elder scrolls game without modding, now would it? I don't know about you or anyone else who played this, but I would always get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I couldn't wear the Palace Guard Armor that some of the Impieral city guards use. So I got a mod to let me wear it. I never liked how buggy the game was, though I bared it on consoles most of the time. PC roles around, a bug came, and guess what? Un-offfical patches, Ho! Overall, great game. 10/10 would fist guards again.			"

												WARNIN' POTENTIAL SPOLIERS (if there is a thing to do with spoilers sorry) YOU HAVE BEEN WARNEDThis game is the game that prepared the elder scrolls series for the gamers of this century, personally it is my second favorite game because of its unique quests, plot and items. Yes some of the people look like a pig being squashed in a vice but the majority of the graphics are deacent or good. The game is an open-world action adventure rpg sorta game that takes you to the province of Cyrodiil, ruled by the Roman style Imperials. In my opinion the main story is superior to the story of skyrim and morrowind. I think this game should be bought if you are an adoring fan of the elder scrolls. The DLC in this game is perfect, the shivering isles DLC could be its own game (probably a spin-off game) and the knights of the nine takes you through interesting doungeons, to find crusader style weapons and armors to deafeat the evil aleyid Umaril. Overall, Oblivion is a great game which built the bridge that skyrim crossed, it has a superb story, memorable quests, improved concepts from morrowind and open-world exploration.			"

												I have really conflicted feelings about Oblivion, and most of my complaints lie where they do with other Elder Scrolls games. Let's be completely honest, the combat in these games aren't the highlight of the show, and Oblivion is far from an exception. What would be excusable for a combat system becomes laughably tedious as the game progresses since all enemies scale to your level. Levelling, as it stands, is incredibly tedious. Instead of an XP based level up system like traditional RPG's, Bethesda opted for a ""skill-based"" one. To level up, you must progress your seven major skills (which you can pick when you make your class). The only way to level these stats is to GRIND. and GRIND HARD. If you're not inclined to just cheat your stats with the console, you'll be stuck spamming custom made spells that use as little magicka as required to get any sort of real boost. The major problem of Oblivion is it's scarcity in good content. The sidequests are phenomenal, and some of the most interesting and creative you'll find in any video game. They range all the way from dinner party mysteries to vast journeys into unmarked areas. The main quest is, quite simply, boring as all hell. It starts reasonably decent, and the first Oblivion gate was a cool expirience. But once you have to go around Cyrodil, close one or two gates for EVERY CITY, then be the errand boy for the Emperor it gets tedious quickly. The ""boss"" encounters are underwhelming, characters like Mankar Cameron are just souped up wizards and Mehrunes Dagon is just a big demon guy walking in the background while you run through the streets.Many skills just seem completely useless as well. Acrobatics for example. Sure it's kind of fun bunny hopping around, but the dodge isn't that great and the mastery skill of jumping on water is practically useless. Mysticism, Alteration, and Illusion are practically worthless with the exception of a couple spells, like Paralysis in the Illusion family. The reason they are ""empty skills"" is because enchanting your armor will get you far better bonuses than the spells and allow you to alot your magick into vital things like Restoration. Athletics can be useful when it's mastered maybe, but running faster and regenerating fatigue quicker? Horrible. You don't really win at all with Oblivion in context to the combat. It's either a spongey mess of mouse clicking, an absolute cheesing with high level destruction or 100% chameleon/shield enchanted armor, or just a bore of sneaking around and getting an 8x bow attack.The absolutely fantastic and beautiful thing about Oblivion however is the immersion. Books laying around referencing ancient battles, Ayleid ruins hiding powerful Liches, or mini events like the Bloated Float Inn being pirated when you sleep onboard. The little tidbits of good content are paced out well to counter the absolute chore-ish nature of the rest of the game. The relief of finishing a long questline of fetch quests like the Knights of the Nine expansion is both satisfying and underwhelming at the same time, because once you realize you just went through the same copy-pasted caves and ruins just with some flavortext to keep you interested, the expirience sours. As with any Bethesda game, mods are almost essential to the expirience. It doesn't have to be 100 different loli-maid mods either, just the basic fixes or fanpatches and graphical improvements are fine enough to keep the expirience fresh. Overall, to somebody that has never played Oblivion or many other RPG's before, it's a fantastic game. You'll enjoy it for many hours over many characters. However for someone that has a lot of expirience with other RPG's with more polish, you'll find yourself disappointed by a lot of it's shortcomings.			"

												This and Age of Empires 2 were my two first and greatest loves. IMHO the game still holds up to this day, although I might be under the influence of nostalgia. The graphics are still good-looking, and at times even quite beautiful. Both expansions are worthwhile, with Shivering Isles being the greater of the two. There are a lot of interesting sidequests, dungeons, easter eggs. The guilds are fun, especially the Assassin one. The downsides may be centered around the main story, as well as dungeon conception. A lot of dungeons just look alike, and the Oblivion Gates quickly become tiresome to deal with. As for the story, it's not bad, but it's not very memorable either. I never really got attached to the main character, in fact I found some of the guild plotlines more compelling. However this might all come down to personnal preference.Still a great game to explore and enjoy, and I hope you do .			"

												Don't let my hours on Steam fool you, I have played this game for thousands of hours on various platforms, (PS3, 360, PC). I started out on PS3 and I absolutely adored it, at the time it was revolutionary and amazing. I have 1,200 hours on just my first character on PS3, and that was without doing some questlines. The game features such amazing quests, characters, locations, roleplaying elements, dungeons, loot, guilds, etc. And it feels like a vibrant, breathing, real world. (Although a little bit on the derpy side.) No other game I have played have I felt like I can live inside of a city inside the game, (except maybe the Witcher 3, just because of the sheer size and realism of cities like Novigrad). This is my favorite Elder Scrolls game (although I still love all of them, Daggerfall is among one of my favorites as well as Morrowind), and one of my favorite games ever. The graphics are slightly dated but have a charm to them, the faces are ugly and the landscapes look a bit like a painting more than a game, but in my honest opinion the landscapes in this game hold up better than Skyrims. It looks gorgeous, (save for the characters and some dated textures). The humongous modding community Bethesda games is now known for started becoming huge with this game, there is an abundance of great mods. From new weapons, armor, quests, cities, and even entirely new guilds and dozens of hours long quests. The modding community isn't as big as it is for Skyrim, but it still has an overwhelming amount of mods. The dynamic AI is both amazing (at the time it came out), and absolutely hilarious. Every NPC in the game can have a conversation with every other NPC in the game, and this can result in some hilariously stupid conversations. Although it is funny and stupid and doesn't work how the Devs intended it, I still think it adds to the world. Hearing people have dynamic conversations as you walk through a city going on a quest or to the inn is very immsersive and adds so much more. The guilds and questlines in this game are insanely good. If you were impressed by Skyrim's guilds they don't hold anything on Oblivion's. I was frankly disappointed by Skyrim's guilds (and NPCs) compared to Oblivions. The Mage's Guild, Dark Brotherhood, and Thieve's Guild especially are really good. And Oblivion even has minor (guilds) you can join such as the Knights of the Thorn or the Order of The Virtuous Blood. Every thing I've mentioned so far you can avoid and not play, most people won't even come across all of the guilds in their first or second or even third playthrough, and they are all optional. Now then, onto the main quest. Oblivion (in my opinion) features the best Main Story besides Morrowind in the Elder Scrolls franchise. You are a prisoner (big surprise) and you are in the wrong cell at the wrong time and adventure ensues. That is all I will tell you, because I enjoyed Oblivion's main quest a lot and wish you to experience it on your own. This game's story progession works somewhat similar to Skyrim's. In terms of in Skyrim the Dragons don't show up until you do a certain quest and kill one, the same thing happens in Oblivion. When you destroy the first Oblivion gate, that is when they start showing up around the map. The great thing about Oblivion though is that you can easily avoid the main quest much more so than Skyrim's. In Oblivion you can leave the sewers and go anywhere and do anything you want without someone going, ""You have to go here and do this!"" Like Skyrim does, in Skyrim if you go to Whiterun you are basically thrusted to Dragonsreach to advance the plot, if you do the starter Civil War quest you are thrusted to Whiterun to do the main quest. Oblivion never does this to you, you hear about the events happening and it might remind you to do the main quest, but it never thrusts you to the main quest without your approval. Oblivion's expansions add a lot as well, Shivering Isles is known as one of the best expansion packs ever, and I can't deny that. Knights of the Nine is also really good. Now onto the gameplay, Oblivion features the standard mediocre combat with hits that feel like you're using a nerf sword, except for one exception. The magic in Oblivion is extremely fun and diverse, unlike Skyrim it doesn't take up a hand. You can be a battleaxe using, fireball casting, robe wearing assassin. You can also make your own spells in Oblivion, (after a certain Mages Guild quest). The character creation is what to expect from Elder Scrolls, various facial customization, (except beards. . . C'mon Bethesda really?) and all the races. And let's not forget what Skyrim left out, classes. There are preset classes and custom classes you yourself can make and name. They don't restrict what you can do or use. They just enhance your starting attributes and skills, and make certain attributes and skills easier to level up in. Overall Oblivion is an amazing RPG and an amazing game in general. I would recommend it to almost anyone.			"

If you are into the genre and you've never played Oblivion, then you ought to do so. With its amazing soundtrack composed by Jeremy Soule, its unique and captivating atmospheres, its stunning landscapes and its pleasant and smooth gameplay, the valiant predecessor of the infamous Skyrim will certainly catch you.

												Let me preface this by saying I LOVE Elderscrolls games. Love them. Strapped a bedpan to my bum and played this game and Skyrim for months. First thing I do in every game is to get a feel for max difficulty. This game on max difficulty is legit hard. However, the only way to play on max difficulty is to create what I call ""The Pokemon Master"" build. Physical damage you do is soooooo reduced. Literally <1 damage. So the only way to play is to conjure pokemon to fight for you. Their damage is not reduced. So you let the pokemon fight until it despawns, then throw out another one. Lather, rinse, repeat. It prevents a lot of fun and creativity in a class. Sometimes you can poison your weapons and take them down with bug bites. It is boring.However! This game is GLORIOUS! Graphics may suck, but you will not care. The story lines are what grip you. The combat on everything but max difficulty is fun. The world does feel alive in this game. There is enough to entertain you for hundreds of hours, and that is just on one character. This was the first game in the series that I played back on that old crap box 360. There is a redesign mod that does improve graphics and models by a ton. It's on Nexus Mods. Definitely check that out. All in all, a great game worthy of every penny. It's like dirt cheap now so there is no reason not the pick this one up.			"

												It's Oblivion. Years pass, but even today it's fun to play. Even in vanilla state, the quests are amazing and the fantasy feel the world has is great. But once you start adding mods, it will get even better. Most of the flaws can be made unnoticeable with the right combination of mods. If you manage to convince the mods to work together, that is.

Pre steam im pretty sure i had 10k hours or even more.My life long dream is a rework of this game (which a fan is working on Skyblivion), but it would be nice if Bethesda themselves made a new engine and reworked oblivion with new expansions, allowing us to enter new oblivion realms.

												In my opinion this is still the best Elder Scrolls game. It is the perfect blend of an interesting and dynamic world, a unique skill system, combat that is showing it's age but still manages to be fun, and a great story. Like most ES games, the main story not the most interesting or fun but rather the various guilds and one off quest chains are where the game shines. Also check out the mod scenes to make this pretty good looking game great.			"

												Best game I have played so far.. This game is set in a massive world called Cyrodiil where you can play through the main story line, roam around exploring the world and its hundreds hidden secrets and things to do, or basically anything else you can want to do. If you travel through an oblivion portal you are teleported to an insane world of demons or daedra that hunt you down as you wander through the hellish world traversing its caves deep withinside it or out on the surface trying to climb the top of the towers without getting killed to steal the sigil stone and close the portal. This game is amazing, there are almost infinite things to do, and hundreds, if not thousands of hours to spend in this world. I saw another review of this game that I want to quote ""There are games you play, there are games you live in, and then there is Oblivion... Yes, its graphics might not be quite advanced as Skyrim, and maybe the combat isn't quite as good but it more than makes up for it with the entrinsic story line (Yes I know, i probably spelled that wrong), and the amazing sense of how small you truely are in this massive world.

												By far the greatest game I have ever played. I first played Oblivion many years ago, getting the Game of the Year edition on two disk DVD Rom. I remember falling in love with the world of Elder Scrolls Bethesda built in Oblivion. All these years later, I still find myself coming back to play the game again and again and again. Even with Skyrim and the Fallouts and all kinds of other things to play, Oblivion is the game that I always come back to. The stories and characters built in Oblivion truly showcase the epitome of an RPG, as does the customization and endless replayability. I'll always go back to Cyrodiil for more. I can't recommend this game enough.			"

												I originally played this game for over 200 hours when it first came out. This is truly one of my favorites of favorites the story and scenery are far more superior to Skyrim, but the graphics are a little dated but well enough (before modding) as well as the game engine a little buggy (I recommend the unofficial patch to fix). I went through another play through and modded it to look better and I can really say it looks better with mods almost as good as Skyrim after I was done with it. I’m also using Xpadder to map the keyboard keys to a XBOX one controller and I seem to be getting great results with it. I would say all and all this game is a great experience 10/10 for an open world RPG with no remorse starting out. you will get lost or try to wander at first, but try to stick to the main quest for a little bit till you get a little more powerful before wandering off.The thieves guild and dark brotherhood quest are some of the best game play in the series to date, and the add on DLCs are some of the best pieces of work I’ve seen take an already brilliant captivating game to a whole other level over and beyond  11/10 what it is and make it that much better. Note: If you played this on Xbox or PS3 Port, you my friend were bamboozled with sub-par graphics and lower res that’s just atrocious and downright unplayable. The PC copy (GOTY) edition with some mods (not to many) to make it look nicer, I’ll play it all day long and revisit time and time again.    "

Now for the Grope Troupe official review process: 1. Does it have Argonians? Yes2. Does it have Groot? Yes, he is called a Spriggan.Notes: Khajiits are still free (which seem to be a bug in Skyrim as well) hopefully they will eventually get patched to be slaves again.

The first thing you need to do is go and kill an innocent person and then sleep to join the dark brotherhood because that storyline is the most fun i've ever had in a game (I have a lot of games). The main quest is sad and fun and exciting and side quests are really cool too although the final battle in the main quest was quite disappointing. It was basically a really easy guy but he wasn't really a boss he was just someone that you fight near the end of the game and then it's just a cutscene as someone else does a fight. It's still a great game and the shivering isles expansion is amazing too.			"

												This is my first outing into an RPG that isn't Final Fantasy, and... After going back after playing Skyrim... Meh. It's got it's merits, no doubt. Easiest way to review, would be a point system.Pros:1: Soooo much ♥♥♥♥ to do! I feel it's more than Skyrim, or maybe they're just more densely packed.2: Hard to reach areas. Wanna reach that corner of the map? OK, here's... no path at all! You'll just have to go off road and find your way there, which is actually pretty cool, it gives a much more RPG-ish feel (I made a word!) to travelling. Altmer ruins are a MAZE to get to the bottom of, and you better stock up on supplies, because they are very long in time, and very big, and lots of enemies.3: Travelling feels like an adventure. Unlike Skyrim, which is still good, I feel compelled to actually walk around and explore, despite the boring environment at times, because there is always some cave with your name on it, where as Skyrim just is a slog if you don't fast travel to the nearest location. Without mods in that, you'll get attacked by Dragons every 5 seconds. Where as here, you can stop to just chill for a bit, no enemies for miles.4: Guilds. Aside from the Thieve's Guild, which is really the Robin Hood Fan Club, you actually feel you belong. Dark Brotherhood feels evil, Mage's Guild feels intelligent, Fighter's Guild is Pretty much Knight's Club, Arena feels like Gladiator Fighting, so something for everyone.5: Add-ons. Shivering Isles, Knight's of the Nine, Mehrunes Razor, they're all good Add-ons. And when you've dried the game up, off to Nexusmods you go!Cons:1: Combat is a drag. Later on in the game, you'll be hacking away at an enemy for 10 minutes, and they still won't die, which is really, REALLY, annoying.2: Can't play mage. Wanna be a mage? Wanna go burn everyone with Fire? WELL TOUGH ♥♥♥♥. By the time you have the skills for those powerful spells, they won't be so powerful anymore, making sword and shield the only way to play, really.3: Ridiculous Main Quest. Don't even bother with the Main Quest, go do everything else though. So I gotta go find an old guy who knows where this son is, and doesn't bother saving him? WHAT THE HELL!? Then you go back. So you didn't put the amulet somewhere safe, you dingus?4: Limited NPC personality. ""I saw a mudcrab the other day. Annoying creatures."" Expect to hear that A LOT. From every NPC ever.5: Lots of awesome but useless items. So you spent ages gathering money for that awesome sword? Too bad it doesn't actually serve much purpose after 5 uses. You're better off enchanting your own stuff.So overall, if you're looking for a fun romp doing exploring, attacking, looting, or just being silly, I recommend this. If you're looking for an incredibly deep, interactive, and moving game, look elsewhere.			"

												I like all the Elder Scrolls games, but there is something special about Oblivion. Many say it's the weakest of the games, I don't agree. There's something to the warm, vibrant atmosphere and the lovable potato faces, the daily banter about mudcrabs and the guards yelling for the criminal scum to stop. It has to be experienced to be understood. Or maybe it's just nostalgia talking. Either way, I recommend this game.			"

												All i can say for this game is it is truly a work of art for being sooo old.  I have put many hours into this game before it was released onto Steam.  And since the creation of mods for Oblivion you can practically fix anything you didn't like about the game such as character customization or add new weapons and armor.			"

												Let's be honest, this game doesn't need a review, all the positive user reviews speak for themselves. The game is so atmospheric and colorful, so many things you can possibly do, even the main quest isn't half bad. But for anyone looking to buy this game: JUST DO IT! It's a great game and even better with mods. So if you plan on getting this game please do look up how to download and install mods, because the game is literally 10x as good with them. Make sure to get the deluxe edition! This is a game you can literally spend thousands of hours on, exploring Tamriel. So what are you waiting for?			"

												Definitely my favorite game of all time. I could spend endless hours playing and never get tired of it. It's the most immersive game i've ever played and the story's great, the lore's great, the combat system is great, just an overall excellent experience. I may even like it more than skyrim!			"
