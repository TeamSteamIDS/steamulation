												TinyKeep is a (very) casual roguelike based, in part, around speed-running a scripted sequence of dungeon levels.After completing the game you unlock an enhanced difficulty mode. Hardcore Steam achievements presumably add some additional, longer term play value. The fact that this plays better as a speed-running game rather than a more traditional roguelike is obscured by the campaign scripting, which is written in a way that implies more story than is actually the case. Ultimately, the dialog is simply an excuse to provide some light direction to point the player towards what they need to do next. Room layouts within a level are procedurally generated. The rest of the game is fully scripted, including the sequence of levels (including dungeon graphics and type of monster), event triggers and (very light) mini-puzzles. There's no direct character leveling or stats, however there are altars scattered around which give you random, permanent boosts which accumulate, and therefore have the effect of making your character more powerful over time. As you might expect, some boosts are more powerful than others, meaning that the luck of the draw can play a part in the success of your run. There is no inventory system and no loot, other than picking up a sword and shield on the first level. The sword and shield are not in your starting room and the game can be a bit confusing here as you can't damage the guards until you get the sword, and it turns out that you need to do a crazy sprint to find these while dodging the guards, setting the tone for the rest of the game, although this is not explained. It is not possible to save your game, if you need to turn off your computer half way through you'll be starting again from scratch next time. (As of patch v1.2 you can, however, quit the game in the middle of a run and pick up from the start of your most recent level next time you play. Your save is still wiped, however, if you die.) The game plays best when you sprint around the levels as it can feel quite slow if you're just wandering. Playing the game as a speed-run, however, creates a nice flow and manageable craziness that does effectively get the adrenalin flowing. Combat is simple - attack with sword or block with the shield. The dev has suggested that timing hits is worthwhile, but I've not had any trouble just whacking away. Blocking seems kind of useless as successfully landing a hit creates a knock back that gives you enough time to launch the next attack. When mobbed there's even less incentive to block.To add complexity to play, there are a number of ways to use the environment to your advantage, for example traps effect both you and the monsters, meaning you can kite monsters to their deaths, and fire pits can be tipped over to set adversaries on fire. Monster types will also sometimes fight each other. The foundation of the game is incredibly solid. The graphics are evocative, gameplay is smooth, and I've found no noticeable bugs. To my mind, unfortunately, the game suffers from a noticeable lack of variety. Each run the levels are basically the same, and the lack of inventory, drops or emergent events leaves no great incentive to explore. This is a shame, as a ton of additional unscripted content would give the game a lot of potential staying power, particularly as a quick diversion.As things stand, however, I've bounced off the game in less than three hours, and I suspect most others will find the same. There's simply not enough here to justify the investment.Considering an alternative? I can highly recommend Full Mojo Rampage instead.			"

 TinyKeep  A bite sized snack of Roguelike frustration... Or is it? Fine! i was thinking about doing a review from another game, but then i saw this and my ADD for roguelikes kicked in..So what's TinyKeep? It says it is a roguelike and it is, to an extent. I'm now debating the way to aproach explaining the amount of valid critique i have for the game, for both i find it doing things right and at the same time having some features in it that also spoil some of those said good parts..Let's list all the things that i found valid critigue for:The game has a physics-engine, which to me feels a bit out of place in a roguelike. Although i can somewhat see the reason for it being there, giving more ways of trying to strategize your way through it. But i also found it.. Very annoying. Reason being, that gold usually gets buried under corpses or some of the fallen rubble and trying to get them from under the piles of death and crockery is really frustrating.The Altars and the buffs they give is also something that i found.. Well, broken would be the best term. If you have the gold and just spam the cheapest altar, you can easily get enough buffs to become totally overpowered, which i did mind you. (About 2 dozen[12] buffs.) And with all of those, the game immediately turned from roguelike to Hack&Slash. This might be just a bug or something that the devs will correct at some point, but it really makes the game, (keep in mind, ROGUELIKE.) just way too damned easy.And while i'm on the subject of mechanics, i must voice my disappointment towards the games option-screen. It is pretty non-existant, which cold be argued against with the games simplistic visual-design. However if the game does not have all the options visible on the main menu, (Most of the ""resolution"" and audio-options are only visible when the game has been started.) Will turn people of it. With the obvious quote of ""mobile-port"", which i kind of felt like using, but because i'm a nice guy i wont. It would be nice to set individual levels of detail, the game seems to have just presets and resolution options. Which is very bareboned..Now, for a roguelike. Some people, like me. would welcome the option of saving the game, it seems to be totally absent from the game. It is annoying and kind of selfish from a game to, ask for complete interest for its duration. Even if the game is about 2h in length... Hang on, 2 hours.. Uhm..With that i could also make a note of the price, 13€*. (Currently -34%, about 8,60€)*. It might seem a bit too much for most people, even if it's a roguelike with obvious re-playability value. It is still asking 13€* for, what i can see, only 2-3h of content. And with all that. The game is very easy, if you use the ""ÜberBuff"" tactic. It is just way too simple, which is both its charm and curse at the same time..Geez, this is hard.. I guess, there is an enjoyable roguelike game here to enjoy. However, the problems it has, need some massive correction work. Broken buff-system and the somewhat obnoxious physics with the corpses and the few bugs that i also managed to find during my short playtime. During which i got to the end boss-fight, which killed me instantly. Because my laptop hyperventilated, from all the crazy amount of stuff on screen just before that..Anyway..TinyKeep is a somewhat simplistic, but enjoyable roguelike. It has some features and issues that need repairing, badly.But in its current state, i could recommend it. But not for 13€*, only when its on sale and the issues with it have been fixed.Small edit: It appears there is a hidden level where you can purchase a resurrection power, giving you the ability to respawn infinately.. I have nothing to say against that, besides that it completely breaks the idea of a roguelike.. Another small edit:The games price has been lowered form 13€ to 10€.			"

												""Tiny keep"" is a treasure to behold and a somewhat interesting game to play. However, This game is lacking a variety of things to a rogue-like procedural death/dungeon crawler. Here is a small list: An inventory, Some sort of skill tree and leveling up system, new clothing/armor, and a variety of weapons. it does not provide neither a small nor large variety of weapons, only three.  Here is a list of a few obnoxious things that you're going to encounter, if you make the horrid mistake in purchasing this. Number one: the enemies bunch up and beat you to a pulp, even if you run they will FIND YOU; The dungeons have the same pattern, you beat two levels and then you move onto the horde stage where you must find the gem keys, unlock all the doors and unleash the horde, then you escape. They have you repeat the same mundane task over and over again. The voice acting is great while the fighting style is very repetitive and uninteresting. Sadly this is one of the worst rogue like game I have played. Fifteen bucks for a game like this is not worth it, I'd save my money for something of more value. Sadly it is a poorly executed game.

												Fiendishly addictive. TinyKeep hearkens back to the method of gaming that started it all in the arcades. Permadeath. None of that pansy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥handholding and coddling that you find in so many modern games. This is pure, distilled challenge. Easy to learn, difficult to master. You can complete the game in a few hours... but you aren't likely to. You get one life, and have to bust out of a randomly generated dungeon. You encounter tougher and tougher enemies along the way. There's a real sense of accomplishment when you have a good run, even if you don't win. The game stays fresh due to the random level generation, and the fact that you're always finding quirky new ways to kill enemies or interact with the environment (my favorite is to get an enemy chasing me, then jump over a fire pit... knocking fire onto the ground, which the enemy runs into and burns to death). Lots of fun little details to discover.The character design is charming as hell. And the audio and voice acting are all top notch. There is a lot of character and love put into this game. Sometimes the orcs dance when they're idle. Different types of enemies will often have conflicts and fight each other. What does that bubbling pot of green stuff do? (you'll find out eventually)In short, I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												Overhead dungeon crawler roguelike with some semblance of a story where you are trying to escape with your cellmate of 6 years and you can choose to help them or... not.The combat feels a bit clunky at first but once you start upgrading and the game ups the difficulty on you throwing out mobs plus bosses it can get pretty hectic and a lot of fun as you learn to use the environmental hazards and traps to your favour in the heat of battle. If you like hack and slash and action roguelikes... get this. It's good and not at all tiny considering the price.EDIT: Game definitely has some cool boss fights and powerups. Final boss has insta death attacks so no matter how strong you get he will kill you if you don't learn his patterns.			"

												This hack and slash suffers from a weak early game and a horribly created end boss. In the beginning you scramble for every gold coin to get upgrades. Once you get the majority of upgrades you actually start having some fun. Unfortunately, once you get to the end boss you have to rely on a time slow buff that zooms your view really far to dodge the one hit kill, but since you are zoomed in so far you can't see the boss coming. In addition, your character will get stuck on every ragdoll, object, or rock. Ultimately disappointed at what could have been a really great game.			"

												Controls feel sluggish and unresponsive. You press the button to attack, and then your attack happens half a second later. Movement is also slow and awkward.Seems to be a design decision, so you can get bonuses that e.g. increase backwards movement speed, but I just really dislike the way the game feels.The camera is also set up awkwardly. It's kind of a weird hybrid of over the shoulder and top-down.			"

												In this game you can:- Strike your sword upon an enemy and he will fart.- Release a prisoner who will try to kill you.- Release a prisoner who will run away from you.- Release a prisoner who will befriend you, but accidentally set you on fire.- Watch enemies kill themselves in spike traps on the floors and walls.- Die over and over and over until you get it right.Permadeath, randomly generated maps, rogue-like, indie dev goodness right here.  Highly impressed and is a complete steal at $15 ($9.89 right now.)Gotta get back in game.  Seems every run I make, there's something new to laugh at.			"

												Block, move backwards, counter attack, repeat until dead or victorious. You get knocked out of attack animations by taking damage, and if you get swarmed by enemies - which happens every now and then - there’s not much you can do beyond take it and die. You can run away, but if you’re surrounded you’re going to be taking a lot of hits regardless. Also you inexplicably run at about half speed when you’re on fire.It’s frustrating in more ways than Rogue-likes usually are. It’s fairly fun to play when the enemies are light and you can plan your routes, leading them onto traps and so on. But when melee combat is a necessity, things take a turn for the worse. You get stuck on objects that litter each room, which you then have to jump over, and you can’t block while jumping, obviously. It’s all just a bit of a hassle which, to be fair, I imagine escaping from a keep would be. That said, I like the style, and could potentially see TinyKeep as a light introduction to the genre but it is hard to recommend to veterans.			"

												This is the first time I've ever wanted a ""Maybe"" button.  Tiny keep works and plays great the whole way around, without a doubt.  The art style is unique, the environments and enemies very cool and well-animated.  I found no major glitches or hang-ups to worry about, and enjoyed the bit of time I put in to this game.That said, I couldn't recommend Tiny Keep.  What game mechanics exist are very polished, but also very limited.  There is almost nothing to keep you engaged in the environment, and that includes the weak-tea story that exists.  Combat becomes very boring.  With most of your runs being pretty short, you'll discover that there is a simple lack of diversity in the content.  Once you know the strategy for each floor, you're just grinding away to get it done.Tiny Keep is a wonderful, well-polished game that could have been much, much more.  Another good one to put on your Wishlist in case a nice discount comes along, but honestly an incomplete game at most prices.			"

												TinyKeep is a third person dungeon crawler with procedurally generated maps and roguelike elements. You play as a prisoner trying to escape from a dungeon, fighting off guards, skeletons, orcs, demons and all manner of other things along the way.The game is a roguelike in that permadeath is a thing - when you die (not if - when), you're starting over from the beginning. No 'rogue-lite' elements here. This may or may not be a plus depending on your personal preferences.The maps follow the same series of tilesets and themes each time you play through the game (in the same vein as Spelunky, for instance) - you always start in a dungeon tileset for the first 3 floors, the next 3 are in a jungle-ruin-esque tileset, etc., and each level within the set has a set theme and a boss, but the randomization of each floor is very thorough, and the room layouts are interesting and varied. There's occasionally some weirdness with the layouts like traps at the end of dead-end hallways or rooms that clip into corridors slightly, but I found this sort of thing to add to the game, rather than detract - all of these little architectural quirks can be used to your advantage, and that's really an important factor in surviving the game.There's numerous traps and environmental hazards which you can use to help you kill the enemies there (and the game actually recommends that you do so via loading screen tips occasionally). Additionally, enemies take friendly fire damage from each other, which creates some opportunities for tactical positioning or 'baiting' of attacks to eliminate other enemies - overall, the combat system, while simple, feels engaging and fluid, and the controls are quite tight.The game supports an Xbox gamepad (probably others, too, though I can't personally verify that) out of the box with no configuration required, and plays very well with one, though it's not required to enjoy the game.You become more powerful as you progress by way of randomized powerups that you buy for gold (looted from slain enemies and the environment), and these can be pretty major factors in how you play on any given run. For instance, on one run, I got a number of movement-enhancing effects, and on another I got a selection of damage-reducing / blocking effects, and the tactics needed in each case were vastly different. You'll need to adapt your playstyle to the bonuses you receive, creating a pretty dynamic feeling game.The graphics are cute, and the models are fairly simple, but the lighting and textures fit perfectly - the graphical style fits the gameplay very well, in my opinion.There are a few minor issues - environmental objects (boxes, vases, corpses, etc.) have volume in the world and inhibit movement (which in itself isn't bad - it's just something to take into consideration when navigating rooms), but occasionally through physics weirdness this can have undesireable effects - if you get boxed in by such objects, it's difficult to get out. Additionally, coins can occasionally fall in locations that are difficult or impossible to reach due to environmental obstructions, but neither of these issues really detract from the core gameplay.In summary, Tinykeep is a fun dungeon crawler roguelike with action-oriented combat and a cute graphical style. If you enjoy games like Spelunky and Binding of Isaac, this is probably up your alley.Alternate, more standard Steam review for the reading disinclined: RELEASED A PRISONER WHO KNOCKED OVER A BRAZIER AND SET ME ON FIRE, ENDING AN OTHERWISE AMAZING RUN. 11/10.

												DISCLAIMER: I am a Kickstarter backer.  This is important for two reasons.  One, I've logged more hours with the game than is represented by my playtime in Steam. Two, I obviously have a history with the game that influences my opinion of it, for good or ill.As others have no doubt mentioned, TinyKeep is a Rogue-lite with a number of distinguishing features.  Like previous and upcoming titles that fuse elements of the original Rogue formula with other genres, TinyKeep's primary offerings are randomly-constructed levels and permadeth wrapped in tactical, hack'n'slash gameplay.  Fans of The Binding of Isaac and its derivatives should feel right at home, despite this game boasting some significant differences.Room-to-room exploration is similar enough to competing titles, though TinyKeep frequently surprises the player with the myriad split-second decisions that each area offers.  A robust if masochistic physics implementation provides constant obstruction and destruction opportunities. Barrels, crates, columns, spike traps and highly-flammable (and more importantly unstable) braziers are strewn throughout the dungeon, providing neverending frustrations and delights.Combat is a mixture of swinging and blocking and, despite being simplistic, is extremely satisfying.  The game seems aware of this and frequently offers a slow-mo death cam for the player's viewing pleasure.I've not yet beaten the game as I'm terrible at it, but I've enjoyed myself the entire time.PRO(S)Graphics (highly-stylized, borderline cute and quite beautiful, really)Sounds effectsMusic (wonderfully appropriate music for 'adventuring')Gameplay (frenetic yet thoughtful, despite the improbability of anyone ever typing those two adjectives together)Random dungeon layouts (keeps the challenges fresh and forestalls boredom)CON(S)Occasional physics quirks (can cause irritation, though they also frequently benefit the player)HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE CONCamera movement (the entire level swings around your character as you rotate with the mouse, which may dizzy and even induce nausea in those easily-susceptible to spinning motions)I think most will find TinyKeep to be an enjoyable dungeon romp that will elicit numerous attempts to escape. The success-to-failure ratio displayed on the title screen won't be the only reason why.			"

												Basic premise: You’ve been locked in a dungeon and your cellmate found a way out while you were sleeping. It’s up to you to find your own way out – but watch out, there’s no extra lives, no saved games. Are you up to the challenge?This is an amusing game that can be a bit confusing at first. Things to find: weapon, shield, food, other prisoners? … explore to find out. The graphics are cartoony but fun. This is not a massively complex game (no classes, no skill tree ... just you and whatever you find) but it’s not simple to beat either.Pros: Great physics: Almost anything can be pushed or moved (this can be very useful).Amusing  quotes & many nice atmospheric touches.Good voice acting.Random generation means different dungeons every time.You can tell that a lot of care has gone into making this. (this was also seen during the KickStarter fulfilment process)Cons:Currently keys can’t be remapped (as a lefty I really hope this is changed in a future update) (hit [H] to see player controls- arrow keys work too.)No tutorial (This can be quite frustrating at the start - no you can’t pick up the club the guard dropped when you tipped the fire brazier in his path - but once you’ve played a bit you should have it figured out).Limited config. options (hit [esc] while in game for more)Saved games? (would be nice but would this spoil the perma-death  experience?)A fun little challenge the isn't as near as ""tiny"" as you might think, and might ""keep"" you occupied for longer than you expect.

												If I would be forced to classify this game in a few words, I'd describe TinyKeep as a: ""casual 'hack & slash'-game, with rogue-like elements"". But then I'd be inaccurate. Rather, this is a lovingly created dungeon-romp in which you need to escape your confinements while surviving hordes of malicious enemies and enviroments, by using your wits, weapons *and* said enemies and enviroments. Still vague, right? Well picture it this way:You awake in a dungeon, finding a note from a formerly-confined partner and an unlocked door. Your first frantic moments are spent dodging guards, releasing other prisoners (distractions for the guards!), throwing over braziers (traps for the guards!) and finding gear to heal you and do battle with. Once this is accomplished, you realize escaping is going to take some time. And brawn. And cunning. And running away from stuff.The dungeon's you'll traverse are quite small and their rooms are seldom empty. The maps are randomly-generated, so you'll never play the same floor twice. That being said, the levels themselves *do* follow a pre-designed path, allowing the game's story to unfold. For instance: after escaping the first couple of floors, you inadvertedly trigger a mechanism that allows an investation of undead to invade the dungeon's narrow passages. Enemies re-spawn at random locations as well, so you always need to be on your toes. The small dungeons and respawning enemies help keep the game's flow up in a positive way. My only gripe with the game is the lack of a save-feature. Every time you start a new game, you wake up in your original cell. I think permadeath has always been part of the game's original design, but hopefully saving will be implemented in the future. In the meantime, I'll certainly be putting more time in TinyKeep.			"

												This game falls on the spectrum somewhere between a classic roguelike and a fast-paced FPS game like Serious Sam. The core game is very solid, with attractive graphics, fast-paced gameplay that's just challenging enough to keep it interesting, traps and monster AI just complex enough to be both dangerous and useful, a pleasant soundtrack and engaging voice acting. What it isn't is a traditional RPG roguelike with levels and armor and gear and so forth. Instead, as befits a dungeon-escape storyline, it's basically a speed run challenge -- how far can you run before one of the Dungeon's terrors catches and kills you. As such, therefore, and in keeping with classic roguelikes, the game is fairly challenging, there is permadeath, and there is *not* a save feature.There are some limited loot mechanics (kill monsters, get coins, dump coins in shrines for randomized bonuses) but character advancement is a relatively small part of the game compared to other roguelikes. If you're looking for a more traditional RPG experience, this game probably won't satisfy you. If you're the sort of person who liked Hardcore mode speed runs in Diablo, though, this might be right up your alley. I've had a lot more fun with this than I thought I would. At first it was *very* frustrating to play -- it took me a while to wrap my head around the permadeath -- but the random elements keep the gameplay fresh and overall it's just really engaging. It probably isn't for everyone, but it's great at being what it is.			"

												As a huge fan of dungeon crawlers this game appeals to me, greatly. I like to keep things simple sometimes and not having to manage an inventory, or a skill tree, is a refreshing change of pace from games of this type. It almost reminds me a bit of how it felt to play the original Prince Of Persia. You're going to figure out how to fight, you're going to figure out how to avoid traps and you're going to learn to use your surroundings to your advantage when you can. My only real complaint is that the mini-map is crude, blocks your view when used, and just a couple added indicators on it would make navigation a bit easier.PROS:+Easy to pickup and play+Reasonable learning curve+(Mostly) Random level generation+No micro-managing inventory+Achievements are fun additions and realistic to obtain+Controller supportCONS:-Mini Map has very little detail-Mini Map blocks your view when used-Camera setup takes some getting used to			"

												I haven't played very far into this yet, but what I've seen so far is pretty good.The game does air a bit more on the casual side, so bare that in mind if you're thinking about buying it. But in my opinion that's not really a bad thing.A lot of people like playing games that are fast paced and easily accessible. Especially if you only have a few minutes to play between other business. The early floors can be cleared pretty quickly, with the difficulty and time it takes to complete them increasing as you advance.Killing enemies rewards you with coins you can use at altars to gain power-ups for your character, and as far as I can tell getting these is pretty important if you want to survive on higher floors. And surviving is a very good thing, because the game does feature permadeath. So it's casual, with a challenge.Overall I'd say this game is definitely worth a try!			"

Thumbs up.  4 stars.  Accolades.  TinyKeep is dope.  It's a casual action Roguelike.  While I didn't get a chance to beat the second boss (the one with the fire-red sword) I'm already really liking this game.  Blocking and attacking require precision timing in the later stages, but it's a little relaxed in the earlier stages while you develop your upgrades.And again, because I only played up to the 4th? level, I only had one set of shield and sword.  I'm not entriely sure if I get the neato sword by defeating the big-bad-guy, but I would hope so.In any event, it's not really necessary.  It's an action-y, arcade-y Roguelike.  Very easy to dip into and play but still has some meat on it to try and master.Luring HUGE enemies into traps. Triggering massive fights. Spilling fire on to your enemies.  Tight controls! Recommended.			"

												I have read briefly other reviews and decided nonetheless to purchase the game.  It looked cool and for the price range, I had reasonable expectations.  I was not disapointed.The gameplay is quirky only for the first seconds or minutes, although the very nature of the starting point does not help the first time experience.  It helped me to reduce the look sensitivity (mouse scroling speed) from 5 (1-10) to 4.  Mastering the game is another thing.The game look simple and yet it is not easy.  As pointed out in other reviews, ennemies ganging up on you can leed to your death quickly.  Be especialy cautious of the hordes, i was not and died for it.  I do intend to try again, but some of those achivements will be tough!As for the environement, i would not describe it as buggy.  Yes object are obstacles, but the advantage/disadvantage flows both ways and it's part of it's announced characteristic that it can be used to your advantage. Ennemies have to jump over obstacles the same way you do.  It gives a lot more options then just the basic doorway/bottle-neck tactic, since a lot of object can be moved.  That is without considering the traps or fires that can be used.Some review announced there were little weapons that you could use.  I cannot comment thus far on the number, but in my opinion it would do nicely with the very nature of the game's setting.  You are after escaping from a cell deep in a dungeon and should be thankfull your only weapon is not a shank.  This is not a game about looting, but then again, it's announced feature was being able to use the environnement to your advantage.			"

												If you want to buy a game that is about being super powered and smashing through dungeons with wave after wave of monster than this isn't the game for you and you don't understand what Tiny Keep is. Tiny Keep is more about staying alive and positioning then about acquring gear + spells. It's not super in depth and it doesn't require a huge time commitment.The game will send giant hordes of monsters after you that work together to try to make you meet your end. As the game progresses the monsters become more diverse and more devious.Tiny Keep is a quick romp through a dungeon full of crazy monsters and it's fun.This also plays as a roguelike game so if you die be prepared to start all over.If you're looking for a challenge and something a bit different I reccomend picking it up!

Voice acting is decent and a nice way to stay engaged if you want to have a story in a game. Otherwise, you can click through the sections to continue your crawl.

												Wake up, prisoner! It's time to undertake a swashbuckling, breakneck escape and free yourself of this fetid dungeon at last! But be warned - your prison isn't home to just lumbering guards and your malnourished and chap-fallen fellow prisoners. Dark things lurk around every corner, and they brought friends.TinyKeep brings a new whimsy to the oft-dark and foreboding PDL subgenre; this is Dark Souls meets Disney, with the tactical attack/defend combat of the former, and the cute and quirky art and music of the latter. The physics-based combat in TinyKeep requires skillful timing and execution, the mastery of which will only strengthen your chance of survival--not guarantee it.Equipped at the outset with nought but the tattered rags on his back, your macrocephalic would-be escapist must sneak about the keep until he can arm himself, and even then, he will only be just a bit safer. TinyKeep features a custom dungeon generator dubbed DunGen[tinykeep.com], which ensures a fresh and exciting run every time.The enemies in TinyKeep are not brainless drones that wander about drooling all over themselves; they are aware of you, their surroundings, and other enemies! With good planning and maneuvering, you can sometimes clear a level without swinging your sword!8/10 - An easy recommendation for PDL fans			"

Run through randomly generated dungeons, collecting donuts (coins), killing companions on accident, and managing to set everything on fire, including yourself. Kill monsters with traps, pitting them against themselves, and run from hordes of skeletons. This game is amazingly fun, smooth controls, and exciting action through every room. There is no part of the game that feels like its lacking, and the dungeons are set up beautifully, with just the right amount of enimies. Even if your not into rpg dungeon crawlers, I'd still reccomend this game to you. As a hack and slash game, I half expected to just grind down enimies, but some amount of skill is needed to defeat bosses and guards			"

												We’re back with yet another review. We just keep going, don’t we?Today, we’re having a look at TinyKeep!A dungeon crawler with randomly generated maps, you play the part of a prisoner who apparently sleeps so deeply that his cellmate, one “Maggie”, decided to abandon him, and leave a load of (somehow voiced) notes around the place to tell the story and help you out.Featuring fairly simple gameplay, you have to explore and click the guards to death before they manage to kill you. Not much to say on the gameplay front that hasn’t been done before, but it’s done well enough to remain entertaining. Sometimes the tried and true formula IS the good one.The sound design is decent, the graphics are perhaps a bit simple, but nice and cartoony, so all in all, the game scores fairly well with us. Enough to make us want to keep playing, at least, and what more could you want?Recommended!

			Tiny Keep is a 3rd person Rouge-Like where you escape from a dungeon. Available here: Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/278620/ HomePage: http://tinykeep.com/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if...		

Tiny Keep is a rogue-lite dungeon escaping experience. The art style is simplistic, with basic options that may or may not appeal to your taste. Thethemes of the individual levels stay mostly the same, but unfortunately the balance of difficulty is uneven. This can deter newer players or those who enjoy a slow buildupof difficulty as they progress.     One difference from level to level can be found in thelayout of the map levels. There are traps on each level, and while not a deterrant,you can use them to your own advantage to trap or kill your enemy. The traps breakafter so much damage has been done to the traps, which I appreciate.     The camera angle is a mix of third person and top down; that tied down with thescreen shake of the camera can lead some to become dizzy or nauseousas they progress.The camera angle also can be very disorienting as you try to find your way through the levels.     The gameplay itself is very simplistic; a hack and slash primal kill experience. Ifthat's what you're looking for, it can be good. There is very little in the way of tacticsor combination of gear sets or powerups. The game accomplishes what it sets out to do verywell, but it pushes the difficulty level too fast too soon, combined with the seasick feeling of the camera angle makes me hesitantly recommend it.  This would be a goodpurchase to get on sale. This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you towatch if you are looking for a more in-depth review.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												TinyKeep is definitely a game with a lot of promise and it has some really cool features, but ultimately it falls short of being anything more than just a distraction for a couple of hours. Let's start with what turned out good.The gameplay is fast and frantic, yet simple, giving it a very adrenaline filled arcade type feel. The art style is both audibly and visually charming even if the characters faces are a bit dead and lifeless. Every, chair, table, crate, cup, and bone in the game has full physics to it, which makes the environment feel messy and alive.So where does TinyKeep fall flat? Lets start with the big pink elephant in the room, Permadeath. When done right it can make a game feel challenging and suspenseful. When done wrong it can make it frustrating and repetitive. Tinykeep falls into the latter category.The gameplay is simple hack n' slash with no room for differing play-styles or player choice. The dungeon layouts are random but the content of each floor has little to no variation. These issues wouldn't matter for most games except your expected to play through the same levels over and over and over again every time you die. Other games featuring permadeath offer enough variation to keep each playthrough different. The player will have a chance to try a different strategy or approach, and they may discover new enemies, items, traps, and environments that they didn't see last time. TinyKeep offers very little in this regard.Short of that, my other complaints are merely nitpicks. Sometimes the camera angle and the clutter on the dungeon floor can make movement cumbersome and unnecessarily difficult. The map is hard to read, which is a real pain considering the layout is random. Traps are sometimes  hard to avoid, yet they do little damage, so oftentimes you will find yourself just running through them without care if they hit you or not. I could go on, but I'm sure the problems will be smoothed out with later patches.			"

			TinyKeep, a top-down procedurally generated dungeon escape game with permadeath - you die and it's game over (Rogue-like). Check out my first thoughts and an early playthrough.		

 I talk about my concerns and my likes as well as explain some basic gameplay mechanics.  I don't have much time into the game yet, but here are my first impressions.  It controls well enough, not great, not bad.  I really like the visuals, lighting and art style.  Music and sound is good, and the voice acting by whoever voices Maggie is pretty damn solid.  Not many item pick ups.  I have only found 1 weapon and 1 shield, but granted I have only gotten to the 3rd floor.  I think it is going for an The Binding of Isaac feel, but with fancier visuals and more melee focus combat.  The combat seems a bit repetitive, however, that maybe because I suck at using traps and monsters against eachother.  I would recommend so far, but if you still enjoy Isaac, maybe wait for a few more reviews to be posted.			"

												Pretty good game, but a bit less than I expected. The dungeons are pretty randomly generated, but there is not a lot going on. The game looks and feels like a mobile port and runs somewhat poorly on a beefy pc. You can not allocate stat points or find special gear, what really disappointed me. It's all about random upgrades you get for paying money on some altars. It's still a good game to waste some time and the random generation keeps a little bit of replayability.			"

												This game is great. A relatively straightforward game, everything is just a little bit nicer than it needs to be. Dynamic environment, cool assortment of baddies. You get upgrades randomly from tithing to shrines -- so you never know what you're going to get and it's a strategy in itself deciding whether to stack lots of 15gp bonuses, fewer 100gp bonuses... or should you be saving for 750gp stuff?! Combat is dynamic -- you can use the environment, block/attack, or my favorite is to get different monsters to fight each other. The environment and enemies both have personality. I enjoy this game. I am going to keep playing until I win it, and then I am going to play it again perhaps. Recommended.			"

												Fun game. I got it for three dollars from the weekend sale as of 1/25/2015, but its originally fourteen dollars and i cant tell if its worth that. Its a basic straight forward game that only uses wasd keys and L and R click plus mouse so that is a factor that makes playing rather enjoyable. I really like it.			"

												I dont have much time in this game, but so far from what Ive seen, its a simple roguelike. You are a prisoner, escaping the dungeon. The first few minutes are a mad dash as you race around trying to find a sword and shield while chased by guards. You cant hurt them, so better run. The game graphics are cartoony polygons, which is unique as most roguelikes use pixels or tiles. The game is top down, and is not grid based so you have complete freedom of movement. And you're going to need it, as you sprint past traps and jump obstacles. The full (except in game menu) and customizable controller support is fluid, LS moves, RS spins the camera and your character. Every button press is customizable. Thats a breath of fresh air for someone like me with limited use of a hand. My only complaint about the controls is I wish there was a way to ""flip around"" with say a RS double tap, or clicking RS. It sucks when a guy comes up behind you and you get hit in the back cuz you couldnt turn fast enough to block.Its pretty fun to block with your shielld while slashing away. I'm going to add more to this reviewwhen I get more playtime, for now though, I'm having fun with it.			"

 Crazy Fun Little Game!! This game is a trip !! If you love funny and good Rogue-Like games give this game a go ASAP !! The game has pretty decent gfx and good sound (FART). Once you have your controlls set up its just a real fun Block N Slash game.Nice mix of Power ups in there also that can stack as you try and make your way to the end.So if you are a fan of Rogue-Like games add TinyKeep to your Library !! Im sure you will enjoy it!! Also BIGTIME grab this if its on SALE 100% just a FYI :P "

												Tiny Keep is interesting - a roguelike (going up instead of down), Tiny Keep has some nice features too it - it's cute, good sense of humor, and does a good job of randomizing levels. I found not starting with a weapon a bit annoying, and the controls a tad diffcult to control, but I overall enjoyed the game.Here's a video of me trying it blind for the first time, if that may be of use to you:

My character no longer spins on the spot and I get the correct prompt to press H to see the list of keys.  Thank you Phi.  Game seems fun, i'll start properly exploring and playing with it later today!  The option to reconfigure keys is still required in my opinion though.			"

												A casual hack and slash. Cool graphics, but  pretty dark. Very simple mechanics, includes certain stealth. Little randomized maps, well balanced and designed, but quite similar. A game play lasts from 1 or 2 hours, depends on a ingame choice. High replayability, but for a short time. Wonderful for kids. By its short duration and evident limitations, buy with generous discount.			"

												Update 10/30/14:A recent patch introduced a temporary save feature, rebindable keys, an unlockable level select, and some other goodies.  It's important to note that the temporary save feature will only kick in when you finish a level, so my advice is not to stop halfway on a level if you can help it.http://blog.tinykeep.com/2014/10/tinykeep-v12-is-here.htmlAs such, I'm changing my recommendation from ""No"" to ""Yes"" due to the temporary save feature alone.  I've praised Indie devs in the past for listening to consumer feedback and the like (not all do, but most) and its nice to see that this particular Indie dev reinforces my position.---Written 9/29/14:TinyKeep isn't a bad game, but the lack of a savegame feature is a deal-breaker due to my busy schedule.  There's also no inventory system, no way to rebind keys, and only one difficulty level that could be described as ""challenging"".  The in-game map is too small for my liking and the enemy types are fairly limited.  I do like the fact that levels procedurally generate and that combat is pretty fluid to boot.  There's also a bit of strategy involved as you'll need to lure tougher enemies into traps while staying on the move.  While I didn't see any other weapons besides my starting sword and shield, you can gain random buffs by spending coins at wells you come across.  While it's a fairly decent game, I couldn't recommend it to those who have to address family obligations on a whim like I do.  If you're not tied down by such things and enjoy roguelikes, then I'd say give ""TinyKeep"" a shot.

												I've read reviews and some of them seem to be not lined to the game. Controls worked perfectly for me, entire game is taken with a large pinch of funny. Though at times you'll find it to test your patience, but you'll enjoy once you get the hang of it. It is a funny little game, as your cellmate leaves you behind, planting notes as she goes and you read them in her scottish voice and accent. A little annoying when it comes to getting stuck on everything (Personally, I think they should have removed the trees). Though you'll find that you do struggle at first, you quickly get a grip of the controls and start really enjoying it. Then you'll become so overpowered that there's no effort into the game anymore, but you keep going anyways!So get ready for a journey that will make you rethink your life, as you realise; - How little patience you have as you can't skip the death sequence. - How little patience you have as you can't skip the credits. - How little patience you have as you keep failing level 3. - How little patience you have as there's no quick restart. - How little patience you have as you fail to get the upgrades you had before. - How much you learn to value each coin as you spend the first 5 missions scavenging for every last one. - How little you value coins as you spend the next five levels ignoring them all. - How much of a anger issue you have as you die to something stupid because you just weren't being careful. - How much time you have to waste as you fail to be able to quit the game. - How often you use the excuse ""Just one last time.""

This game is not a game you can beat in the first play through and is not designed for exploring. You will die…a lot. With that being said it was fun at first but got boring rather quickly.Since this game is in early access there are still a lot of things that are still being worked on and I can’t wait for the final release.This game does have controller support but it was hard for me to control the camera with the controller. So I use a mouse and keyboard for this game. I still can be a pain but not as bad with the controller. "

												I'm sorry I just couldn't get into it, the controls feels clumsy and not in a good way. They feel unresponsive, both the movement of the character and the sword swings. The gamplay looks way better on video and doesn't actually reflect the feeling of playing it. I think it could be more polished, at times it feels confusing and camera perspective is akward (and makes you dizzy). Seems like a great concept that just didn't reach its full potential.			"

												This game is brutal. And not brutal but fun, like Dark Souls. You die, you start over from the beginning.Of the level? No, of the game!And although the levels are randomly generated the story (and thus the objective of each level) remains the same and starts to get stale pretty quickly.I\'ll readilly admit I couldn\'t do it, so I got a trainer and turned on god mode. I just wanted to see the end of this thing, so I kept hacking & slashing my way through. And what I saw was a cluster♥♥♥♥ of enemy humans, skeletons and an almost unending torrent of demons spawning into the later levels. If you can beat this game start to finish you are some kind of savant.I eventually did manage to get to the end and got one-shot killed by the endboss, something even the trainer couldn\'t save me from.At this point I\'d had enough.If you are some kind of masochist feel free to jump into this game, otherwise I advise you to leave it be.

												A fun little hack-and-slash dungeon crawler. The game features procedurely generated dungeons full of various traps, enemies, and shrines. TinyKeep has a very simple left-click-to-attack right-click-to-defend playstyle and relies upon its randomness (both of the shape of the dungeons and various abilities that can be collected) for replayability. At the time of writing this, I have about 5 hours of playtime and have only played about half of the game. Following the idea of 1 dollar = 1 hour of playtime, this game should suffice. All-in-all, the game is a fun little dungeon crawler worth buying (especially if it's on sale).(Hear more about what I have to say about TinyKeep in my ""Quick Look"" video here.) "

												So far I have played this game for roughly seven hours and I can say this game is pretty fun. The randomly generated dungeons keep things going (on my first playthrough I didn't find the sword until the second level). You can upgrade your character each level or you can try completing it without any upgrades at all! Same follows with killing; it is possible to go the entire game without directly killing any enemies. If there is one this I would like to see in this game is more diverse upgrades. Currently it is sort of a random upgrade you get after paying an x amount of coins to the ""gods"". I would like to see a skill tree maybe, and it doesn't have to include new skills. The same skills, but the player picks which skills he/she would like.I would also think it would be cool to purchase weapons with different stats. I understand this game was made to be a simple dungeon crawler survival kind of game but it would be cool to see all these to be put into play. All in all I have put seven hours into this game and plan on putting another seven in to complete it, which I still have yet to do so. I totally recommend this game (especially when it is on sale!)

												It is great fun to begin with, but doesnt have enough content to keep you coming back. The game has perma-death, and punishes you for skipping the early levels by always making yo ustart with 0 ""XP"", yet procedural generation of the early levels is so same-ey that it just becomes a chore to grind through in order to get the upgrades necessary for later levels.The core gameplay (running, chopping, exploring) is great fun, but as it is a few ""hardcore"" design desicions and a lack of content is holding it back. Buy it at a heavy discount for an hour or two of fun, but i would not pay the full pricetag.One simple thing which would raise this game a lot for me would be a semi-randomized loadout of upgrades whenever you begin a play-through from a later level. Not as many upgrades as yo uwould get from thoroughly grinding manually, but maybe 2 15-gold upgrades for each level skipped?			"

												HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!I bought this game on sale but honestly, I think it's worth the full asking price.the game is just fun and plays really well.The environment can be interacted with in unique ways that can screw you over or put you at an advantage over the enemy.The gameplay is simple and addicting and the character models are really funny and cute.The biggest pro I see in this game is how easy it is to attack and block. When you swing your weapon to attack but realized you should have maybe blocked, it's very forgiving in letting you cancel the attack to perform that block action.The only real con I think worth noting is the lack of character animations in general. You have run and sprint. I feel like for a game that relies on it's physics and environment, having the appropriate animations for walking, turning and straffing could add a lot more immersion to the experience.that and it sometime's feels congested trying to navigate the cooridors and dungeons.People complain about the lack of depth, but I think it's more designed to be a quick pick up and play sort of game. I don't want to have to manage inventory and loot, there are enough games like that. This game takes a more arcade approach to the dungeon crawling experience and that's fine by me.The game feels like a real lite, simplified 'Gauntlet Legends' experience, but it really isn't anything like that.All in all, I like the game, I like the simplicitiy of it and I see a lot of potential to improve upon what the developer aimed for in the playing experience.

												This is honestly the best dungeon delver (escaper, I guess) I have ever experienced. The combat is simple, yet so very satisfying. The soundtrack is absolutely grand, reminding me of LBP2 tracks, it is fitting and invigorating. I do suggest getting this as it is very good now and bound to get even better, and I myself see many hours of gameplay to be invested.			"

												It has been hard for me to find good Roguelikes that can capture my attention as much as The Binding of Isaac has. Most of the time I am left with a sense of wanting or feel like the game doesn't have enough to it to make me want to play it more, But TinyKeep is one that I plan to play for quite a while.It's biggest advantage is it procedurally generated environments, which I feel most in not all Roguelikes need. While each level of the dungeon has the same ultimate goal, the traps, rooms and enemies are always different. One playthrough might have you dealing with more archers, while hte next could have you dealing with more barabrians. And that's just the tip of the iceburg!The game boasts a unique leveling system, or at least unique in the sense that you don't really gain XP. instead, certain enemies and environment items from coins which you can exchange for enhancements to your character at specific alters placed in the map. There's always one at the end of hte dungeon, so you can save up until you get to it, or you can find the secondary one hidden somewhere. The second one costs much more in coin, but usually gives much better buffs because of it.It's not extrememly challenging when you're faced with only a few opponents, but soon more traps nad enemies appear, giving you less room to run, and that's when it gets tense and fun. I'd highly reccomend this to anyone who likes The Binding of Isaac or any other good Roguelike and wants to try something new.			"

												TLDR A game that's trying to position itself (almost successfully) as a lunchbreak RPG Roguelike, can be picked up by casual gamers and fairly hard core ones, but gameplay may be too difficult for casual gamers.GameplayYou've been sent to the bottom of dungeon, and must escape through randomly generated levels, following the footsteps of your cell mate, who has left the odd item and clue behind for you.3rd person/topdown view with a wide fov, but a very narrow draw dsitance, meaning you can never see very far ahead of you, although this isn't really an issue, and actually adds to the claustriphobic feel of the game.It's trying to simplify many things, RogoueLikes, RPG's, Dungeon Crawlers, and Lunchbreak games (games that can be completed in 1/2h or under). And it largely does a good job of this. It's actaully a good intro game into many of these genre's, as it simplifies many of their elements into sometghing almost casual. I say 'almost', as the difficulty puts this game out of reach of a Casual gamer.  This game is going to kill you and send you back to the start. a lot.Death is a thing. Perma death, level 1. no progression.MechanicsDungeon generation is similar to another game, Spelunky - that is, each level is made according to a formula, so you'll see the same obsticals and content each time on any given level, only the order of the rooms may shange.Items in the world are also obsticles - knock a vase over now and you'll have to jump over it later. this will get you killed more than once.enemies can swarm you, and you pretty well cannot escape once this happens.RPG elements are randomised, so that there is no overthinking about what skills to unlock, it just gives you skills, and you have to adapt your gameplay style on the fly. one run you might get a few speed buffs, the next, might be defensive buffs... etc.GraphicsTiny keep, Big heads. It's a cutesy art style, seems to suit the game well, and is beautifully drawn.Will run on even a modest computer.There is blood spatter, despite the cutesy - it's not gory, but it is there.Controlsstandard FPS controls for kb/mouse. I've hear of Xbox controller support. The game is simple, so the controls are too. they work well, feel responsive, but you can pick up on the controller thing, as the camera can float a little (isn't) directly connected to the mouse like an FPS)AudioWasn't working for me, sadly. I'll update this later.Interesting stuffThere's no Wiki - So how do you look up whether the big bone guy that 1hits you can be killed? Do the Skellies ever stop spawning>? I don't know, I haven't lived that long.OverallI actually kinda like it, but I'm not very fanboi, yet. It's a good pick, a solid game, one you wouldn't regret buying, as long as you have a idea of what you're getting into first.			"

												Excellent little game. ""Little"" probably isn't applicable to it though, I know it's going to gobble up a hefty, and good, amount of hours.AtmosphereEverything about it is charming from the art style, character design, great voice overs and acting, and sound effects. It gives me Torchlight vibes though is certainly its own unique style and take on the generic DnD-esque fantasy setting. I was actually pretty surprised at the voice acting between all the different monsters and even other fellow prisoners. Quite good.The way the dungeons are setup and the way enemies work gives the game a fantastic rat-race sort of feel. The feely feel that feels... Like capturing the enemy intelligence on 2Fort as a Scout and making a make-or-break dash out of the enemy base feel. Except you're a scruffy peasant being chased by a pack of angry Orcs  through trap-laden halls while also trying to remember if the invincible rock golem you escaped from earlier is up ahead and to the left or just around the next corner.[del]Now's a good time to mention there is no minimap or anything. You are, after all, a dingy little prisoner anyways. Thankfully you have a compass for this sort of thing in your HUD, and while it makes keeping track of where health potions and the like are sitting around that you'll probably need to run back to later as you run into more enemies, it adds to the atmosphere of this game.[/del] As noted below in the comments, there IS a minimap (Yay!)! You can't carry supplies around with you: You have two hands that are occupied by your sword and shield, that's it. The rest you have to scavenge for when you need it, which makes the rat-race feeling all the more dreadful when you're racing through halls trying to find that plate of waffles tucked away in a storage room while fleeing a monstrous skeletal ogre. Gameplay/MechanicsThe gameplay itself is surprisingly good for its simplicity. You're limited to an interact key, movement, a sprint key, a jump key, LMB to attack and RMB to block with your shield, and that's it. The spice comes from using the environment of the dungeon against your enemies, whether it's thinning out a throng of Orcs chasing you by leading them down a trap-laden hallway or steering a monstrous rock golem towards a pack of skeletons up ahead and making your escape in the ensuing chaos. My only complaint here is that knocking over iron fire pits or even large torches takes some doing; a kick key or something would be pretty handy. In the meantime I don't mind that it makes chases even more frantic while you struggle to knock over a fire pit with your sword to block a doorway soon to be teeming with prison guards. Apart from that, you can also use gold collected from slain enemies, treasures you've found, or from smacking boxes around, and place them in shrines in the dungeon. There's one that demands 15 gold per sacrifice and another that wants 100: Both generate a random buff or affect on your character. So far there's quite a large range of buffs these shrines give you, which range from faster sprint to taking less damage to making enemies bleed when you attack or an attack bonus against specific monsters, etc. It's a good feeling after you've cleared out a dungeon to empty your pockets into a shrine and watch the buffs and affects pile up (Getting a dup buff also stacks it which is great).And finally, permadeath. As aforementioned there's a number of reasons replaying won't get old, though I would like to add that, as you probably know, the dungeons do change upon replayability. There are specific enemies/events on each dungeon level, though the layout and the types/number/placement of enemies changes DRASTICALLY between each playthrough. The devs weren't kidding when they stressed the dungeon layout changing. ALSO NOTE that when you replay after dying you can choose to start at a specific dungeon level, though your buffs from your last life don't carry over. So it makes permadeath softer in a way which is nice; I'm more prone from starting as an underdog than building my tower of cards before reaching the dungeon I'm stuck on.SummaryPros- Great voice overs/acting and sound effects: Fantastic atmosphere- Charming and distinct art style- Simple gameplay mechanics with surprising depth - Just downright fun; it'll pay you back in full with gameplay hours Cons- No ""kick"" attack/mechanic (Makes triggering some dungeon elements hard)- No sneaking mechanic whatsoever (Though given how cramped the dungeons are there isn't really use for one, though there are some instances this would be nice to have)I bought the game for about $2.50 in a bundle sale, though I'd recommend it at full price. It's an honestly fun game with its own charm that will definitely pay back in hours of gameplay.			"

												Tinykeep is a topdown hack and slash Rouge like, featuring a lot of physics elements, traps and monster factions that battle eachother. While that sentence makes this sound  like a must buy, it has some issues preventing it from reaching it's full potential.1: The phyiscs objects keeps getting in the way, and at some point the massive piles of bodies just make it a sludge getting through rooms. I had to walk to the farthest corner to despawn the ragdolls during one level, because the corpses was lagging my game to a crawl. Floor traps sometimes break and fall off, i'm not certain if that is a bug or a feature.2: The maps are confusing, and the lack of locked rotation meant i got lost at many points. The map screens paint function makes reading the map quite difficult. The 3D enviorments sometimes gets in the way of seeing the character and the monsters he is fighting.3: The game is structured like a rougelike, with random level generation, random monster placement, and semi random powerups. However, the structure of the game dosen't really support this: There is nothing to do on a second run. All rooms are functionally identical, either containing traps, enemies or not. There are no special rooms, or random powerups to find, and very little reward for exploring but more enemies that might yield gold. You pay for the powerups using coins, but these are plain, and unintresting. Faster movement when your holding a shield, running backwards faster, jumping higher, increased damage towards certain types of enemies. Nothing that will change the way you do your run, and most runs you will simply have most powerups at the end anyway. But having it a rougelike means no save function, which means that if you die you have to start over. Which is fine, except 90% of the game is very very easy! There is really no problem defeating the first three ""bosses"", they are no harder then regular enemies. The last boss however, can basically kill you in a 2-3 hits, especially when your acid sword hits you both, making you slow and draining your health. If you die then, you have to play through 90% of the content.Which i just did.""Fun.""You could also jump ahead at try to defeat him with the starting sword and none of your powerups. Which kinda defeats the point of the rougelike anyway. Why not just have a save system?Still, worth the 3 euros, fun if flawed little experience.			"

												This has so much potential to be brilliant but it falls just short of ascending. The Characters have a Nintendo quality that is familiar and charming. The hack/slash block jump/run are fairly standard controls. They get more responsive as the game progresses but at no point do they evolve into more complicated moves. You're stuck just hacking away... it gets a bit repetitive and at higher levels, outright boring.I picked it up for $2.50. For what it is, it's brilliant fun. Levels 1-4 are fairly straight foward, The monsters don't vary too much after that- the bosses are kinda disappointing in that they behave just as regular monsters do- come at you swinging wildly. _______________Now for what it could be, that's a whole different story. Add a fighter class with a great axe, a wizard class with a staff, an Elven thief with a bow and a viking Princess with a spear and make it all multiplayer and we'd have the Gauntlet we wanted instead of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t gauntlet we got. I love the monster gates tearing open and streams of enemies attacking both other enemies and the player- it adds a great deal to the environment when you can sieze the opportunity and wait till the weaker baddies weaken the tougher baddies. The four icons lined up slaughtering a horde of fire breathers would be tons of fun...But we didn't get any of that. We got a single player Gauntlet. It's fun. It doesn't take a great deal of commitment. Doesn't demand a great deal of attention- it just clocks time. It's not disappointing at $2 bucks- I'm not walking away feeling cheated- but after seeing what it is and what it could have been,.. I'm left wanting the later. "

												I almost quit playing this game because I couldn't get past the jungle levels. I was frustrated for a long while and then by some chance, I made it all the way to the last boss. I still died, mind you; but then I realized how the game worked like a puzzle. My eyes lit up and a whole new aspect of the game opened wide for me. I was able to make the dungeon work with me as opposed to the dungeon killing me at every turn. After some ""puzzle solving"", I figured out the correct formula on how to beat the game from beginning to end. The beauty of this game was in unlocking the puzzles and its mysteries.As for the controversial ""unfair"" permadeath, personally speaking, it made every dungeon run cautiously thrilling. Permadeath actually made this game a valuable gem that is worthy of filling a spot in my games list. "

												TinyKeep is not at all a Roguelike game despite what the developers and others might try to convince you, in reality TinyKeep is a straightfoward action game with RNG elements. That's it.So let me explain by TinyKeep not qualifying as a roguelike game, it only has procedural generation and permanent death that can even barely and I mean barely qualify itself as a roguelike. The reason for this is simple: Permanent Death can be removed from the game once a certain item is obtained which removes a huge staple of the roguelike genre. Secondly procedural generation means jack in this game. Yes the dungeons are 'randomized' but if they always consist of the same things for each level, in my opinion it should not count as procedural generation.Now let me explain why it should not count as Procedural Level Generation. In the Binding of Isaac as a popular example, each floor has a semi-random amount of rooms with random enemies, a random boss, a treasure room with a random item, and two secret rooms for the bare minimum. The only floors that stay somewhat consistent are the last two floors along with the floor for Mom's Heart. In TinyKeep the first level will always involveFloor 1 - Prison, find Sword/Shield, only Archers/Brawlers with 1 Treasure ChestFloor 2 - Prison, Boss at the end once you reach the door note with 1 treasure chest and 1 throneFloor 3 - Prison unlock the 3 colored doors, unleash the skeletons, go to door and beat the big skeletonFloor 4 - Dodge stone guy and hit the end everyone is orcsFloor 5 - Orcs with 2 stone guys, 3 colored doors, unleash skeletonsFloor 6 - Skeleton Boss, super short with nothing in itFloor 7 - Flames n demons have to have fire proof perkFloor 8 - Flames n demons w/bossSeriously I can go on. Every floor is the same. I can't qualify this game for being Procedurally generated if every floor has the exact same qualities barely moved around. TinyKeep also has a whopping total of 6 enemy types (I'm not counting the fact that there's a goblin/skeleton/human archer as three different types, let's face it they're all reskinned versions of the same thing). And you know what floors you face which. I don't believe only having a floor layout randomizer should ever qualify as a roguelike, which is all that TinyKeep has.At any rate the game suffers from far more than the two elements I listed above. The only 'power up' of sorts in the game involves buying blessings for either 15g, 7 - 100g, 1 - 500g, and 2 - 750g. (The latter two are endgame).The 15g blessings can be bought up to at least 15 times in a row, at a complete RNG chance as to which of many skills it can give you will power up. The 100g blessings can only be bought one time each and are easily the most needed blessings that every player needs, and the last three (500g/750g) are for secret/broken powers.Here's the problem with these blessings. Most of them are worthless at the 15g level, -There is one for running faster which has diminishing returns because you only need to move so fast-Multistrike which is worthless past level 2-3-Serrated Edge which is an RNG chance of doing more damage-Arrows to Ether which is an RNG chance to dodge an arrow-Able to run backwards faster-Run with a shield fasterOut of all of these the only TWO skills that aren't complete garbage are the Tank skill and the Lightning Reflexes skill. None of the other skills are even worth leveling up but since it's RNG it'll probably happen if you want it or not.Also RNG only exists to screw you over in this game. -Chests can be empty for no reason-No vase spawns in a level-RNG for any of the 15g blessingsAnother problem with the game is the inclusion of a physics system of sorts, where walls will blow out throwing blocks on the floor, and enemies bodies will become obstacles when you kill them. It just gets frustrating especially in the latter levels of the game with the amount of clutter everywhere. Especially when the giant skeleton bodies seem to never go away getting me stuck numerous times.Finally one of the last problems is that 'farming' exists which essentially completely breaks the game. Essentially levels 1-4 are the scariest part of the game because it's so hard to get your hands on money, at that point in the game it's possible to only have around 300 coins. Once you hit level 5 you can get every single 100g power up and level up most of the 15g ones to 10 with ease. This is because the skeleton invasion never ends and you can infinitely farm them for however long you please.Overall the game acts like I'm having more fun than anyone could ever possibly have. It's really not fun to play through this game more than a single time and the game expects you to play through multiple times. The game is downright confusing with some of the 'secrets' such as the cauldron which is completely ignored until the loop begins. This makes no sense because there is another shrine which was kept out of the early levels to not confuse beginning players. Why this was included is beyond the scope of my knowledge.If this game had done the blessings differently I might not have such a problem with it, perhaps make them like Isaac to where they are powerups you can find throughout the level. Maybe even make it to where you could CHOOSE which one you wanted instead of rolling the dice each time. The game should also stop being so persnickity about secrets. It's cute that you want to include secrets, and I think most games should do more of them BUT it's stupid that the second half of the game is locked behind a 'secret' of sorts and I know most people who have reviewed the game probably don't even realize it exists. The bigger problem with that is that the second-half of the game is complete garbage. Again too much clutter and♥♥♥♥♥♥flying around everywhere making progress a chore. Furthermore it's even sillier that if you make it to the 2nd half of the game and die, you are forced to replay through the first half just to get back to the second half.Secrets can be done reasonably without being such an annoyance. The demon secret in this game for example was a good choice. The acid cauldron on the other hand was a very poor choice.All in all for 3$ on sale it ISN'T THAT BAD of a purchase. I just can't find any redeeming qualities to this game that feels like I could have played for free online. You will only get a few hours of playtime max (between 2-6 hours), and you'll probably not even want to finish out the game because of how frustratingly annoying it is.			"

												I'll qualify this ""Not Recommended"" by saying that with some tweaks and a bit more content, the game could be quite a bit of run. Right now, though, it is a Roguelike with only two Roguelike elements: Randomized areas and YASD (""yes another stupid death""... you die a lot). However, it is missing the plethora of interesting options that make lots of playthroughs worthwhile. In the first level, you run around until you find your sword and shield. This level is entirely uncessary and should be removed. You have no other actions beyond attacking and blocking, and thus failing to acquire both of these items cuts down on your decisions by a lot. You can't even punch the enemies.Secondly, the name TinyKeep is apt, as most of the rooms are cramped. This isn't such a big deal until the later levels when you are faced with (seemingly) unkillable enemies and retreat being one of your main strategic options. However, when every broken pillar and box slows you down, and when fire-shooting enemies cause you to permanantly slow down (by the way, if I were set on fire I'd be running FASTER... for at least a little while) and when getting hit caused you to flinch and stay in one place rather than continuing he direction you were going... it's all a bunch of self-negating feedback loops.I very much hope the developer continues to update and support this game. He's got something good here, and could unearth a real gem with a bit of refinement. But right now he misses the mark.			"

												I want to recommend this game! The visuals and art design are awesome and the fluid mechanics are grounds for an amazing game, but I can't help feeling like it falls short. I think it lacks depth. You'll get a few hours of enjoyment out of it but after getting really far and having to start all over with nothing to show for it, multiple times, you'll probably put it down. Of course some will find perma-death exactly why the game is so good and I have to agree to an extent that the challenge is definitely there, however, it becomes repetetive the more times you have to start over. Random Power-Ups add a bit of flair to each try but I think adding weapons, armor, and other random inventory items would make it even better and make each playthrough that much more unique.TL:DR: you'll probably get bored of this game very quickly unless you're familiar with the Perma-Death roguelike challenge and love it.TL:DW Review below. My reviews are short (usually below 2 minutes) To help you decide if you should buy or not.Edit on 12/28/2014:My initial review still stands for the most part. This game is not for everyone but thumbs down reviews  lower the chance of games being displayed on the front page and this dev doesn't deserve that. For the simple fact that he is continuing to work on the game, making changes based on suggestions and appealing to nobodies like me he deserves reward for his effort. So pick it up if you love rogue likes! This one doesn't hold your hand as much as some of the other ones on steam.

												My Review for Tiny Keep shall be as short and sweet as possible.This is a top-down style dungeon crawler. Its has many rougue-like elements, with perma-death and randomly-selected upgrades for your characters.In terms of how polished the game is, it could have been better in terms of physics and graphics, but besides that the game is as good as its gonna get.In my travels (only about 2.5 hrs of play as of this review, but growing) i've found every part of tiny keep exciting and fun. I started as a weekling, found some lucky loot, and started slashing my way through hordes of enemies. On my third try, i made it all the wayt to the end boss, only to slip up once or twice and get mercilessly squashed. Thus, i had to start over.While thats a huge bummer and a solid 2 hours of my life i shall never get back, i had lots of fun playing and will definitley play again soon.Overall, 8/10. Would be higher if there was a bit more to the game, (only about 20 5-15 minute levels).The Pros that give it this high score are:High Re-playability (unless you beat the game 100% on second try like i almost did. depends on the skill of the player)Fun Dungeon crawlinginteresting upgrade systemSolid plot that got my head right in the game.Highly recommend.

												This game is great. Easy enough once you understand what you're doing. The experienced player can get going quick and power up yet still hard enough to make you pay attention not to get cornered by baddies as you manuever. My kids love watching me run the dungeon and bait enemies into traps with clever commentary. Or set myself on fire (once fireproof and strengthened) and hug the monsters or bump into them as I run by saying ""Tag you're it!"" Or run up to the exploding demons and kiss them to start their detonation sequence before running away.Have I beat the final level boss? No not yet. But that's OK. A full run to the end takes 90 minutes to 2 hours once you know what you're doing and you want all the powerups.And yes, permadeath. Quit yer crying, grab your sword and get to work. "

												I wouldn't say TinyKeep is a perfectly polished and glitch free game but the 2.3 hours I've played it were fun to play, and I still want to play more. First I'll mention what I like about TinyKeep. -high difficulty. This one is very important to me since I like games in which the character faces very bad odds. This gives me a little adrenaline rush. The way enemies attack manages to give variety because they vary in size. A number of them could have spawned in one place which forces you to run away.-Cool traps. I think the traps I've seen so far are pretty cool because they are not only a danger to you but you can lead the pursuing enemies into those areas.-Random reactions from people you rescue. They might decide to help you. They could be useful. They could be weak and get killed right away. Some will run away and not help you. Then there are some who'll actually attack you. This makes freeing other prisoners a gamble, which I like.-limited gold and treasure. I like how you are not able to simply farm same areas and collect infinite amount of gold to eventually buy anything you want. At least at the beginning the gold is not common enough to allow you to buy something really fancy. Add to that the fact that you won't always be able to access a seller, so that causes to make decisions that will often decide when your character dies.-nice cute graphics. I like that the graphics run well on my crappy computer. The design of the dungeons and enemies along with sound makes them all kind of entertaining. I am not as happy about limited options you get to design your own characters.Cons:it is important to point out some annoyances and glitches I've seen as well.-While exploring the different maps that were generated each time I've seen areas where one unbreakable and unpassable object blocks pathways of the doors. Not happening very often but when it does I have to restart.-AI is pretty weak. Enemies often rush after you despite being near death, or go into the trap without any pause. They often do it in a straight line, which looks very distracting.-Too few options for character appearance. Would be nice to give them more body options.-When you encounter the store you might have just a few coins short of some expensive item. Unfortunately the stores usually do not have alternative ways to spend money on cheaper support items like potions, arrows, bad weapons. etc.Overall I really enjoy the game despite lack of polish or the annoyances. It could be much better if more updates came out.			"

												Found the control system to be slow to respond, especially the attacks. This makes it especially aggravating to kite around traps or dodge enemies. The map should have been integrated into the main UI instead of being a seperate screen, and the map details are drawn like a 3 year old sketched it. Some bosses (perhaps because of the random layouts of the dungeons) come out of nowhere and give you no where to kite or traps nearby to utilitze. You just get rushed and die. And sometimes you see the boss coming from afar and have ample time to plan a strategy to take him out.The game doesn't always allow player skill to factor into your success at escaping. Instead you have to rely on the mercy of randomness. Poorly designed.			"

												Another interesting dungeon crawler. Simple but still fun. It has its challenges and exploits (not bugs, the game is very well made).As for the time, you most likely will not be invested for long. It does keep you coming back for the randomly generated dungeons (I think they are at least). Each game you play is a little diferent than the last. Combat is limited to swing, block, use enemies to hit others and lure into traps. As far as I know, there are no other weapons to use other than the sword you get on the first level. A missed chance there.This game would be a decent buy at full price but I would recommend you get it about 50% off.			"

												TinyKeep, by Digital Tribe (pretty much a one programmer company), Kickstarted back in 2013.   It's changed a bit in theme and appearance over the development period, and though delayed in polished completion, has actually delivered a playable product.  It's a *simple* rogue dungeon crawler that relies on permadeath and a few amusing mechanics to provide entertainment.  There's not a lot off complexity, but if all you need is 5 or 10 minutes distraction then this won't require a great deal of commitment from you to have fun.  https://youtu.be/zQfvNZwVTv8 "

												Disappointing and confused gameplay.I was a backer for this on Kickstarter, and I was excited at the ideas behind it, but the product ultimately ended up disappointing.Genre:Is it a roguelike? No, not really. The levels are procedural (I think), but are same-y enough that it hardly matters. You either have room with spike trap/spin trap, or room without trap.Is it an RPG? Not really. The gameplay is strung together on a bare story, which deemphasises the player's role and emphasises another character.Action? Things feel too slow to be 'action'. Sword swings and jumps are sluggish and the rubble is annoying and slows you down.What about speed runs? For some reason the developer emphasised the time taken to play the game, making me think it is only for speed runs. If you like speed running, maybe this is for you?Gameplay:There is very little to the game. Run around, hit bad guys. No levelling of any sorts. No variety in items. No variety in player. Bonuses are passive, so not noticable in terms of appearance.I was excited about the AI behind the game, with many updates during the Kickstarter placing emphasis on this. But it amounts to enemies swarming you and attacking, or attacking other factions (which doesn't happen enough in the game).The game is insanely difficult for the first part until you farm enemies for cash and then it becomes too easy. The permadeath is incredibly annoying, because every run is practically the same. Using the traps against enemies is fun, though.On the plus side, controls are tight and responsive, but the physics-based gameplay just makes everything sluggish.Graphics/Sound:Graphics are ok. A bit basic, but the cartoony look works. The sounds are good too.Price:As a Kickstarter backer, I didn't pay the Steam price. And I'm fine with giving my money to the dev. But the Steam price seems FAR higher than the amount of game warrants. Perhaps at 25% of the price this game would be worth it.I'm sad the AI wasn't a bigger focus, that the gameplay is so basic, and that the basic genre is confused and cannot make up its mind.			"

												The greatest asset to this game is the pricepoint.  Apart from that, there is little draw to it.  Granted, *it has potential* to be very fun, but currently it does not meet standards.  Though this game has a nice concept, the absent replayablity, simplistic elements, and awkward design break this game's worth.First and foremost, this game doesn't have much replayability.  Granted, it's worth stating that no level is the same (other than the elements (different enemies, objectives)).  The layout is different every time, which is cool.  And I understand the rogue-like design of a hard-restart upon death (I love FTL).  But there is a huge difference in difficult and tedious.  You CAN skip a level once you beat it (e.g. go to 6/20); but if you do, you WILL lose.  This is because once you die, you lose any perks.  Later on, you can't really win without having a lot of those vital perks.  Having to go through levels 1-5 the first three times is okay.  But those get boring, FAST.  The gameplay is not exciting enough to get me through it each time.  The developer should at least allow a checkbox that let's the player keep perks upon death.  This would at least give me incentive to come back.--Honestly, I cannot see myself coming back after one or two more plays.I love the idea of a dungeon crawler that forces the player to use speed, cunning, and logic.   This game has some of those elements, but they are repeated and way too simple.  Hack, hack, block, hack.  Run away behind the enterance; wait for archer; kill archer.  That's the game.This is an indie game.  Bugs are too be expected; I get that.  But in a rogue game, where death means another 20 minutes wasted, it isn't easy to forgive.  Getting stuck on a random pointless vase or stone and getting swarmed is so disappointing.  I'm used to being disappointed in myself; don't make me have to change my thinking.Overall, it's a nice idea, but I can't really say I enjoyed it.  I kept waiting for it to improve and give me more, but instead it only got repetive.5/10 "

												For a procedurally created game, each level was basically the same. I didn't make it far in this game since it seemed like only the environments changed as you progressed, the way you advance didn't. After clearing 6 levels, I felt there wasn't much point in continuing to play if it was going to be the same throughout the game. Dying was disappointing since you weren't going to get a fresh experience in your next play through, just more of the same with a different layout. The enemies are essentially the same as well, your standard one handed brutes, shield bearing brutes, and archers. Bosses weren't very difficult or extraordinary. I could be completely wrong and I could have missed out on some pretty cool levels but I wasn't willing to put in the effort to get to that point.Controls were a bit iffy and the viewpoint took a bit to get used to. I had to change the mouse sensitivity down to 1 just so I didn't spin my camera around constantly. It is also very easy to get stuck on debri which adds to the control difficulty.This is an early access review and there is potential in this game. I'm not sure if it is going to reach the point where I'd suggest this $10 game to anyone. "

												This game stutters no matter what graphic setting you have when running at 120hz. Didn't try 60hz because I refuse to play in 60hz.As for the actual game, the physics engine is simple but fun, but the combat option are extremely limited with just one swing type and a block button. It's fun at first but gets boring after 10 mins or so. This game might have been good but somehow was deemed complete with barely any content in it. I was lucky to get it for 2.75$ CDN, or otherwise I'd be a lot more annoyed at how limited this game is, along with the stuttering problem.With all that said, the absolute worst part of the game is the camera angle. If you've played it, you know what I mean. If you haven't, you'll understand just how horrendous it is if you buy the game. My recommendation is don't buy the game.			"

												A good title for ""TinyKeep"" could be ""brutal without merits"".Tiny Keep is a 3th person roguelike game with a nice graphic, and a couple of cool mechanics and ideas, but still doesn't manage to succed.As other roguelike games, like nethack, angband & Co, this one is pretty punishing: it's possible to restart from the last visited level, but you start with no extra equipment or perks, and this makes permadeth a rule ""de facto"".However, unlike nethack and angband, where I get hooked despite the spartan gameplay and (often unfair) difficulty, there is just not enough (variety? fun?) here to worth my time. Starting the game from the first level is a boring chore, grinding and collecting every single coin waiting to have enough to activate some altars, while resuming at successive levels makes the game harder, so the game turns into a kind of trade-off between unfair difficulty, and boredom. Not very enticing, right?! I guess this could be a nice diversion, when you get bored between other (more satisfying) titles, but it's not the kind of game you work hard from start to finish.EDIT: tried to use this game as a diversion, a game here, one there. Still a boring, frustrating mess. F... this game!			"

												A game that is quite janky and not very good. Delayed sword swing that feels awkward. Blocking does not always block an attack, so taking damage is inevitable no matter what. I cleared everything behind me and opened a door with 3 enemies behind it. Out of thin air from behind come three more enemies. I was low on health so I got swarmed and died. Combat is very generic and janky. The game is very dull looking, very bland and boring. Levels are bare and not much to do but take dmg half the time you are blocking and swing a delayed sword into boring enemies. Overall it is one big jankfest. I've seen before in game forums people say ""explain what you mean by 'generic' "" and there are some games that I can point out that fully embody what it means to be a generic game. This is one of those games that I would point out to use to describe what generic feeling means. There is no good generic, just bad generic.This may be a Diablo 3 style dungeon crawler but if you took every bit of what makes that game so great and flushed it down the toilet you would get this game. This is just dollar store junk toy quality. Or dollar store off brand t-shirts that feel like cardboard or the ones that are paper thin and way too long and come down so far they cover up your♥♥♥♥♥""Do you recommend this game?

												TL;DR: I don't recommend it.Alright, I don't like when a review gives a whole intro and everything saying what the game is, what it's like- no. Just no. I'm gonna start right off and say that the game's not worth it, for many reasons. First off, the game is bland. It's a roguelite game, so it meets the standards of randomized levels, obviously. What it doesn't meet is entertaining replayability. When you start off the level is all new and randomized, whoop-dee-doo, but what is never randomized one bit is the combat. The combat style is a constant. The combat style should never be a constant in a roguelite game. You always find and use the simple shield and sword through the whole game. There are no upgrades, no changes, no new items. They're the same equipment. The fighting style was bad from the start, though. You click to slash the sword and position your character in the right way so that the shield is in front of you to block. There isn't even a block button. This is bad combat for any game, not just a rogelite! To top it, the enemy variety is abysmal. You can fight a human with a sword, a human with a bow and arrow, a skeleton with either , or a prisoner you freed (in the game there are various cages with people trapped in them. when you open the cages and free them, they can either run off scared and use bad a.i. to get stuck on a wall or corner, join you and help you fight, or go on a ""murderous rampage"" and attempt to kill you with their fists). There may be more but I never bothered to make it past the third level. Then there are the bosses, which aren't randomized either. It's always the same boss with the same gear and same look and same A.I., with the fight being either harder or easier than the last run depending on how the level was generated.I'm going to take advantage of that great segue I just made and move onto level generation, which remains on the topic of randomization but still deserves its own paragraph. The level generation can create some terrible maps or some simply average maps depending on how pleased Lady Luck is with you. There can be some very tight areas with tons of enemies piled into it which make for a terribly unbalanced and difficult fight, or a large mob of enemies that back you into a corner where they maul you until you're dead. There's also a problem with the randomization of the levels. Each level has a certain theme to it, and with those themes come some rooms or objects or enemies, etcetera, that are unique to it. These characteristics are employed every playthrough of the game. Take the third floor, for instance, which has a theme of  skeletons and skulls and cursed shizzle. Bad English and jokes aside, the level comes with a room contaning a giant skull and candles surrounding the skull like a shrine, and when you do something to it, which I've forgotten since I haven't played the game in a while, it spawns hordes of enemies that swarm down on you, back you into a corner and maul you until you're dead. The event that occurs when you do the bad thing, the look of the room, the room itself, everything is the same every time you reach that floor. The only thing that's different is the placement of the room.  This takes away from the ""new playthrough"" feeling a great deal, and honestly feels like you're playing your previous run over again, this time more boring because last time was one less time you played the game than now. Only when you reach a new floor do you get that ""new"" feeling, and when you die and have to work your way back up to that floor again, it won't feel new anymore because you already got there last time, and it's essentially the same floor.Yet another great segue. Getting back up to that floor again most likely won't happen because the game is REALLY REALLY HARD. Seriously, TinyKeep is balls hard. I can say from experience with both games that it's harder than Super Hexagon (currently I'm halfway through Hyper Hexagonest). I can also say from experience that it's harder because of bad design. The combat is crappy, we've already discussed that. It's not only crappy because it's very, very boring, but because it doesn't provide you with sufficent means to defend yourself in many situations. I described one situation earlier, getting swarmed into a corner and mauled. Your character isn't designed to be able to take a mob of 8-12 enemies, and yet the level throws 8-12 enemies at you. Another would be the blocking mechanic, which requires you to not click the right mouse button or push a key, no no no, that would only make sense and work correctly and be actually good, but rather requires you to turn your character to position the shield so that it blocks a hit. If an arrow is flying at you, you have to turn so that your shield is in front and your charcter is 30-45 degrees off target. Ridiculous, and entirely ineffective in a swarm. There are a few other situations where the combat system is put up on display for all the world to see in its horrible glory, but this review is so darn long that I'd be surprised if you're still reading.I'll stop here.

												TinyKeep is an interesting game that I honestly really wanted to like. It has a cool art style, its gameplay is quick and full of action, and the controls are snappy. When I first started playing, I honestly thought I loved the game! Then, after awhile, I beat a couple levels, and realized I was SO BORED.TinyKeep is a ""rogue-like"" in that you have to make muliple runs through the dungeon/prison you are escaping, learning enemy types and traps, and honing skills that you will need to complete the game. The problem is, there isn't enough of those things for you to stay interested in playing and there aren't ANY permanent elements that carry over between plays (until you beat the game)! Enemies/TrapsThere are only something like 10 enemies in the entire game, and a few of them play identically to each other. That being said, it gets worse because only a couple of those 10 enemies are actually any threat past your first play through! After only a few hours, you will easily defeat or avoid all enemies and really the only reason you might die is if you are trying to grab some tricky loot. The traps are exactly the same: ~10 different types, a few are nearly identical, and only 1-2 actually pose a threat.Upgrades/ItemsThere are NO items past the sword and shield you get in the beginning (I am NOT counting items you get after you beat the game). The main way you defend yourself is by buying abilities/buffs at shrines with gold you have collected. There are different level shrines and about 20 different buffs. The problem here is threefold: 1. the abilities/buffs do not improve the gameplay in any significant way, 2. the buffs are completey random, and 3. the buffs are not permanent through multiple play throughs. Problem number one is the biggest. A couple buffs give you special abilities, but overall, you will be playing this game exactly the same way in level 20 as you were in level 2. Most of the upgrades just beef up your character so you can take damage from enemies. Problem number 2 is very annoying, because buffs cost money and they are completely random, I have spent 300 coins to get the same one THREE times! Granted, some buffs stack, but the game should prioritize new upgrades with a higher probability when purchasing. Finally, problem 3 is actually no that big of a deal, since you can become OP by level 5 (out of 20) and never have a problem for the rest of the game. What TinyKeep boils down to is grind. For the first few hours you will have genuine fun as you figure out the gameplay mechanics and storyline, but after that its the same experience over an over: attack monster, bait monster into trap, avoid easy trap, collect coins, buy repetitive upgrades, rinse, repeat...Get it on sale...

												The start really got me at first. I love customizng my character ... but then....The Controls are sh*t. At least for PC.For this is a game can only can score through gameplay, It lacks exact that.Running left, right, foreward everything is okay. All movements are already very slow , but running backwards is so much slower. so you have to turn your camera to actually get aways from approaching enemies properly. And if a few enemies corner you - you cant get out, because you cant get pass their bodies - you cant push them away or sneak through them, or not even glitch through them. And that in the frist level having no other power than running away. And the most rediculous part is: The enemies even block you when they're dead. So if you lure them into a trap and they die on a stupid place,  you yourself get pushed in the trap. This is so outraging. I mean, the character is already so freakin slow and then there are bodies lying around - impossible to walk.The more I turn around the more the camera, because backwards is nonsense the angle moves itself up and no way to get it down with mouse.Turning around the camera all the time is so confusing and sickening. The controls for camera are so bad.So I thought. Well maybe its a controller-game so I plugged in a controller for PC and it got worse. It didnt get the buttons at all. Map and jumping are both now there where I usually can move the camera. No way to move the camera. what means, its the same problem now. The camera angle goes up and up and up....Well I of course tried to adjust the buttons, but there are only options for the movements not the Map or else.Maybe im just a noob, but this game is made for gameplayfun. And doesnt convince me. "

												Don't get me wrong -- I don't think that TInyKeep is a BAD game. I played through to level three... but therein lies the problem. I didn't really care to keep playing.It took me several tries to beat level two as I found the boss to be quite overpowered and had to rely on the stupidity of the AI for the boss to kill itself by walking into traps. The controls are not particularilly great -- it feels quite clunky, to be honest, and I get dizzy trying to constantly turn the character around to dispatch of baddies. Also, and maybe this is just my machine (I hope not, it's an Alienware M15X with an intel i7 in it) but I found the framerate randomly dropping for no good reason during important parts. Again, I would certainly not say it's BAD -- I just wouldn't particularilly recommend it.			"

												The start really got me at first. I love customizng my character ... but then....The Controls are sh*t. At least for PC.For this is a game can only can score through gameplay, It lacks exact that.Running left, right, foreward everything is okay. All movements are already very slow , but running backwards is so much slower. so you have to turn your camera to actually get aways from approaching enemies properly. And if a few enemies corner you - you cant get out, because you cant get pass their bodies - you cant push them away or sneak through them, or not even glitch through them. And that in the frist level having no other power than running away. And the most rediculous part is: The enemies even block you when they're dead. So if you lure them into a trap and they die on a stupid place,  you yourself get pushed in the trap. This is so outraging. I mean, the character is already so freakin slow and then there are bodies lying around - impossible to walk.The more I turn around the more the camera, because backwards is nonsense the angle moves itself up and no way to get it down with mouse.Turning around the camera all the time is so confusing and sickening. The controls for camera are so bad.So I thought. Well maybe its a controller-game so I plugged in a controller for PC and it got worse. It didnt get the buttons at all. Map and jumping are both now there where I usually can move the camera. No way to move the camera. what means, its the same problem now. The camera angle goes up and up and up....Well I of course tried to adjust the buttons, but there are only options for the movements not the Map or else.Maybe im just a noob, but this game is made for gameplayfun. And doesnt convince me. "

												Got this for $2.50, but I shouldn't have. It's a twin-stick shooter but with a sword and shield instead of shooting. There's random f***ing s*** (debris) all over the place, and you have trouble walking over/around/through it. Enemies are of the melee variety (block them then stab them, repeat) and the archer variety (block once then just rush them).That's all there seems to be, really. I found it pretty much boring and nothing about it made me want to keep playing.			"

												There is not a single thing that would qualify as an asset for video games in Tiny Keep. Here is the problems I encountered.- No options. Having only resolution and ""Graphics quality: good bad best"" options for a pc game is pitiful.- No controller support. I was using a ps4 controller (one of the best out there) and the game couldnt handle it. It's funny how in the store page they dare and say ""Full Controller Support"". HOW THE HELL YOU HAVE CONTROLLER SUPPORT WITH NO KEY BINDINGS!!!!- No key (re)-bindings!!!!! Wow!!! How can you make a game without key bindings. Not keyboard OR controller key bindings.- Worst map/minimap in gaming history. The game's map artstyle is ok. But the disign is so bad. The maps are always very bad, I have never come across in a good map. Also the minimap....... So the minimap is unhelpful and most of the time you cannot understand where to go within 1 second. And 1 second is much more than you'll ever have to check the map in this game. Furthermore the ""Sprint"" button is tied (unchangably) to Shift and the minimap to Tab. So you cannot see the minimap and sprint at the same time. Neither you can leave the minimap on in someway.- Zero gameplay complexity. In this game you can only attack with your sword through left click and block with your shield with right click. There is no chain attack progression. That's it. You will never ever have any different way to fight than JUST ONE SIMPLE SWORD ATTACK WITHOUT PROGRESSION!!!!- Zero visual updates to your character. So, you only got one sword attack. But also get the same da,m sword. Ah, a funny thing as well: See at the begging of the game you get a sword from maggy. In each run the sword looks different until you pick it up. Then it looks the same after you pick it up. LOL- Zero progression complexity. You only get some passive upgrades like %double damage etc. There is no originallity here and the whole system is pitiful.- Boring as hell. Blunt, unoriginal. Not even the artstyle is original. The music score isnt anything special either. Overall not something you would gladly give your time.In the end I would give this game 2/10 or 1/10 since like I said, you can't find something and say ""Well at least this game has THIS THING going for it..."". No, there isn't any ""this thing"" in Tiny Keep.I am really grateful I got it in a package from Humble Bundle. I would never buy this game for more than 1 euro.			"

												The game has very basic combat (One button attacks, another one blocks). You only have one weapon, a sword.  The passive bonuses made it tolerable and kept me invested, made me care. When you die the first time though, you lose everything, which means you have to do everything all over again, with the same basic combat and you have to earn each bonus progressively. I read in the controls, there's a button for a magic spell, but i've done, apparently, 8 of the game's 20 levels, and i haven't received one yet.If you decide to skip up to the stage you died in, you spawn with no bonuses at all, which makes the game very hard to continue from there. Because of the combat's limits, i didn't care enough to try again.			"

												permadeath: fun when it spawns an unattackable rock moster to♥♥♥♥♥♥you for trying to enter level 3. reading the reviews and dev suggestions it becomes clear the default way to win is to just run to the end. but there are some skills, but it's all random to cover up the fact the game is horrably off balance, judging from the devs own comments it seems he failed at figuring out what to do and just went for ""keep it simple stupid"" but it has nice adware on the main menu. So, it's a scream at 2.50$, but i pitty the fools that thought kickstarters had any integrity and curse them for unleashing this hellhound on the earth. i'm sure you'll all love being locked to the first few floors with no meta game to speak of. cause the dev is making a game he enjoys, which includes giving you a total progress reboot everytime the game spawns you wrong or you trip and have 1% health damage and eat a massive potion cause you can't press an action button to drink you just auto everything. stupid stupid game design choices all over. even with many main menu resets i still end up not able to get enough coins.then there is the bugs: straffing induces terrible stutter, i've heard suggestions that unity locks the camera to 60fps, so it might be an issue between the render frame and character frames. but who knows. apparently the dev can't see it.i've played lots of rouges over the years. this one's just stupid. but if you like being abused by a kickstarted hulk of nonsense and irresponsible and idiotic game design, this is perfect to dose yourself on.

												this game is gods gift to man kind , i got this game after playing skyrim so i was going in with high standards but this game just blew me away . when this game says its randomly generated it isent kidding i thought borderlands had a lot of weapons to chose from but it cant even hold a candle to this game with probably more weapons than there is particals in the universe and there all custimisable to , and while where on the topic of customisation lets talk about your charecter jeez where to start well there is 50 voice actors for each gender and in a game with 100,000 lines of dialog thats impressive.THE STORY!! the story is so immersive i swear i thought i was accualy my charecter and when my head got impailed by a huge spike for the 10th time and i took 1 damage i swear i really felt my charecters mild discomfort , also your best friend maggie is there for you the whole game giveing you all sorts of useful advice like how to beat the fiery bat deamon while your questing throu the great plains and you feel like shes a real person when your talking to her while at bace camp with all your other companions that you freed from the prison at the start of the game.But something that makes this game truely shine is the ai   its so ******* intelligent its like a real person x10 they set traps and plan attacks so stratigically that youd swear that they where real life SWAT specialists.overall id rate this game at -4/10 it killed my wife and made me a meth addictoverall if i had to change something about this game its all the invitory management theres just way to many items!!!!

												If you are looking for a nice little game to pass the time every once in a while(that's why I have it) Tinykeep is almost perfect for that. The graphics are quite nice, the controls are good enough for me, except the fact that you access the map with the tab key and sometimes when you are running with shift you accidentaly open the ""steam menu thingy"" and it ruins your chances of surviving. The music is also fitting to the environment and the action levels. I recommend buying the game if it is on sale like I did, but if you watch the trailer and you don't find it entertaining then don't buy it even then, because what you see there is all there is to this game. If you do buy it, good luck escaping friends!			"

												The game is fun enough but for one major reason.  It was great when they included the ability to save the game at any level you are playing on however you will lose all the progress achieved so far for that level ... BUT should your game crash you can kiss the entire run good bye because when I reload I find my save spot gone and have to start all over again.  Not very impressed especially when you spend extra time being very careful and collecting every possible piece of gold you can find.I die and have to restart enough as it is but should I actually stay alive my chances of a random crash keep increasing, which is ok if you just had to reload and restart that level.  But no it takes your whole game with it meaning I'm probably not going to play this game anymore unless they can fix the way the save mechanic works so you don't lose everything in the unfortunate incident of a crash.

Not downright awful, but pretty shallow, a bit clunky, a feeling of misdirection, and sort of formulaic, except minus half the formula.  One thing I want to add were that the physics of the bodies, tables, stones, and whatever else getting in your way are interesting, but ultimately super annoying as they just bump and stop you constantly.
