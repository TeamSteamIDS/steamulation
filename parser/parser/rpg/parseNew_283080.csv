								Hack and slash platformer from PestoForce. 2 person team of Father and Daughter.If you take games like Castle Crashers, Spelunky and Zelda, mashed them all together, you would end up with something very close to Super Chibi Knights. About the only thing game is 'missing' would be co-op.Fast paced, witty, beautiful artwork, responsive controls and wonderfully voiced by the daughter herself. Takes you back to the classics of yesteryear in the best ways possible. As far as early access games go its an absolute gem, cannot recommend it enough. :]﻿

								After playing the original flash game a number of years ago, all I could recall were extremely fond memories of upgrading my character and anticipating what the visual of the next upgrade would be. But Super Chibi Knight adds a whole new perspective on this, with much more of these awesome upgrades, mounts, quests, secret areas, and adorable voice acting from the developer's eight year old daughter. In addition to the awesome gameplay mechanic, different open-world areas, and an awesome element of ""go wherever you want, do anything you care"", Super Chibi Knight is a must-get.			"

Early Access Review
								Note: This game is unfinished. More content will be added. I am rating it based off of the part already released, which is about 2 hours of gameplay.This is a fun game with a small protagonist who has to defeat an evil in which many have failed to defeat before. The playable part of the game includes the town in which you live and the beast trail. The town includes different quests with dungeons and bosses. After the town, you are taken to a beast trail where you learn how to tame the different beasts and use them in battle. There are multiple quests that are different difficulties, and some you won't be strong enough to beat. If you get stuck on one quest, move onto another one. There are enemies scattered across the map, which also help with leveling up. I recommend this game because of the cool art style. I also like this game because it is very simple, and you don't have to worry about a bunch of different abilities. I also like the beasts because they are easy to get used to and are very helpful. There are a few bugs in this game such as not being able to quit the game properly, but these will likely be fixed quickly since it is only in early access.			"

												This is a fun, but fairly short game. I finished it 4.3 hours. A good chunk of that was in two particular places that I thought were a bit more difficult than they should have been for where you are in the game. The area leading to the final boss was a pita but the boss himself I thought was a bit too easy.Other than that, it was a very well done and worth the money.Edit: There are two paths you can take and the 4.3 hours only included one of those (the mage path or whatever it is called).

								I wasn't sure what to think of this game walking into it. I wanted a game to play before I took a nap and was honestly hoping for something that would put me to sleep. This was not the case. PestoForce did a good job of taking everything enjoyable about some of the older Zelda games and bringing those elements to life in this new and colorful universe. Overall, I think this game will be great once it is completely finished. Looking foward to playing more in the near future.			"

												This game in simple was flat out magnificent and nostalgic. I loved playing Chibi Knight when i was younger! The Flash game was amazing I woulplay it over and over and over again! (Of course I exploited that thing with the first boss being every hit landed awards xp on hit; nearly kill it leave then repeat.) I enjoyed this game just launching it and watching it brought a smile. I completed the game in one morning. Every part of it was amazing! It was enjoyaable and it was very challenging a lot more thaan the flash game. There were some parts that were a tad rage worthy but it adds more to the game to not jus tbe a cake walk once you max out everything! I would highly reccomend this game without a doubt. It is worth it at full price. However I am confused at certain parts with some secrets I collected but didn't know what to do with them. This game however seems to have had many optionals which you did not have to do but I'm, sure it helps out a lot later! The main cons I'd say are a bit of lag issues, the game lags a lot even though it isn't that heavy on my pc. Another would be the sharp sound collecting xp makes it hurt quite a lot. Then there is the achievments I did not collect a single one even though I completed them. I hope that can be fixed because I do plan to do another playthrough for completion purposes.

Early Access Review
								Super Chibi Knight is a Zelda-like game which focuses on adventure, puzzles, and fighting baddies. The map isn't huge, but it's densely packed with enemies, levels, quest givers, bosses, and secret areas. The enemies are brightly colored, with a very distinct art style. Levels start out flat, but later levels add moving platforms, switches which need to be activated by spells, and even deadly spikes.The leveling system is very unique. There are three separate levels: Amor, Special, and Sword. You spend experience on each of these independently. Experience requirements will only increase for the skill you're leveling. This discourages min-maxxing, and makes it easier to level all of your skills without spending massive amounts of XP.Super Chibi Knight is not a tough-as-nails Super Meat Boy clone. It's easy enough for young players or players who are new to gaming to pick up the controller and jump right into the game. But it's also varied enough for older players to enjoy it as well.Before I started, I thought that this was just going to be a remake of the original, but the introduction of The Beastmasters adds a whole new level to the game. It's fun to run around as a tiny knight in armor. It's even more fun to ride atop a giant purple beast which breathes fire, a large bison which charges at enemies, or a chicken which can glide.At the time of writing, the game isn't done yet. It took me 3.5 hours to get to the end of the Alpha version, and I expect a lot more content to be added to the game over time. The developer is actively taking feedback and constantly adding things to the game. This is one of the few ""Early Access"" games which I actually expect to be finished.If you're still on the fence about this game, check out the original Chibi Knight which was created by the same developer. Many of the game mechanics are the same, but Super Chibi Knight feels a lot more polished and varied than its predecessor, and we haven't even seen its final version.Original Chibi Knight: http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/526470 "

												Easily the most charming game I've ever played. I understand that the concept art was done by an 8 year old (the designer's daughter), so it has a very childlike, whimsical feel to it. The girl also did the voice work for the main character.  I played this with my 6 year old and we both enjoyed it very much. It's simple enough for him to play, but still very enjoyable that I can play it as well. Great little indie game.			"

												Super Chibi Knight is an all around solid platforming experience. The game is packed full of details and secrets that you will easily miss if you don't pay attention. It's true that the game is a bit on the short side, but if you want to grab all of the achievements you'll easily quadruple your play time as they require multiple playthroughs with different strategies for each.

								I'll make this brief.  I will probably never go back to play Zelda 2 ever again.  That's because this game is an indie re-envisioning of everything I loved about that game.  Free roaming side-scrolling action adventure game with charm all throughout.  So glad I backed this on kickstarter.			"

This is a fantastic game, there are different path options to take, so you can play it at least twice. This game could be fun for speed running, playing normal, or playing with family/kids. I am glad that I paid the 9$ for this game, it was completly worth it.I highly recomend this game if it looks fun to you; or if you played castle crashed. Not many bugs, challanging game, and full of suprises. 9/10			"

												Oh how much this game makes me miss the oldschool 2d platformers. Really reminds me i should play more of them. Honestly, i have no words to describe how much you should really play this game. It is just so good and it'll hook you until the end. And even then, i might challenge myself and go for some of those achievements! The difficulty curve to this game i think is somewhat a little sudden but even then it's simply because the bosses play the same as bosses in 2d games. Each one has a pattern, some are hard to see, some are obvious, and some of the patterns require you to have very good precise timing. You might have a couple of rage moments but it personally made me all the more want to beat the challenge. A couple of bosses i even threw my arms in the air in triumph. Now...for my 2 nitpicks. The final boss felt a little....er, underwhelming to me? Especially if you have completely several side quests. I wasn't expecting most of the fight to be out on the map. And even then, once you go to the second phase it doesn't feel as challenging than some of the more complex bosses like the Salt guardian, the ivan dragon, or even the panda witch. Maybe some others found it more difficult, whos to say? Thats just what i felt about it and i felt a little disappointed about it.This is just a small one but on mahou island where you go to that area to aquire the double jump, what is the point of that small little room that is underwater? Is there a secret? Because i felt a little annoyed to see nothing there other than some blocks you can destroy which don't give you anything. I get very ticked a little when i see a developer design an area with no purpose unless it's an easter egg. Could be something you forgot. Who knows!Music was good in some areas however it didn't click for me a couple of times. I know alot of people loved it which whos the judge? When it comes to music it's all about tastes. Ok blegh blegh enough negativity. I had such a great time with this game and it makes me wish for more! I love some of the mini referances you had and pleaaaase for the love of everything, HAVE YOUR DAUGHTER VOICE MORE. I find that so cute and creative that you had her do all the voice acting. I bet she had a great time recording too. Anyway, i made this too long because i just had to express my love for this. keep making games bro! "

I think it's great the developer made this with his daughter doing the voice acting, but also ensured that the game was quality, too! The character leveling up and progression is a nice touch and well-paced, with an accompanying visual flair for the player. I also like that after completing the second area, there seem to be branching options that will affect the gameplay, also; perhaps affecting replayability.Overall, $2.50 well spent. I'd have even gone $5 if I'd known how enjoyable this title turned out to be.			"

The game does have replay value considering there are different paths of story progression plus if you like to go for achievements.

												It's a great game. It has the basic gameplay style of The Legend of Zelda II: Link's Adventure, and does it rather well. The art style is nice, and I haven't found any noticeable glitches. I think this is most definitely worth the five dollar price tag it has, and was worth the 10-15ish price tag it had when I got it.			"

												As one of the many who backed this game on Kickstarter, I had high hopes for Super Chibi Knight, especially after playing the first Chibi Knight. It's safe to say that this game met, if not excelled, all of my expectations. All of the combat is fun and rewarding, the level system can be as simple or difficult as you want it to be, the story is interesting and the characters are fun. This is well worth the money I spent to play it, and I'm glad I took the opportunity to back it and help this game become a reality. Highly recommended,			"

The side quest, dungeons, and bosses are all fun. The game is colorful and an overall joy to play.			"

												Gameplay seems to draw a lot of influence from Legend of Zelda 2, even more so if you go the Mahou Island route for chapter 2. Also, despite the cutesy art style, combat is pretty rough, with the unarmored chibi knight going down in 2 or 3 hits, and even with max armor, late game enemies can still take you out fast. It's not a terribly long game, and I beat the game twice in about four and a half hours total, completing almost all of the side quests, but not hunting down every secret. I didn't see a new game+ mode, so you have to start from scratch to play the other option in chapter 2, but that's not too bad.The best thing, though, is probably the voice acting by the 8-year old daughter. If you don't think it's adorbable, I don't want to be your friend.			"

												I DONT KNOW WHY IM HAVING SO MUCH FUN WITH THIS GAME. Normally, I enjoy more difficult, adult-oriented RPGS. I'm a huge fan of anything Bethesda does. Have played 100s of hours in Skyrim, Cant wait for Fallout 4/ Currently churning through The Witcher 3. My favorite games of all time? Bloodborne, and the Dark Souls series. Yet somehow, this cute game has me captivated. It's just enough of  palate cleanser, with all of the necessary components to leave you bewildered, yet giddy with entertainment.It is astonishingly amazing, literally INCREDIBLE that it was created by merely a 33 year old and his 8 year old daughter... The amount of artwork created is insane. The gameplay and combat is surprisingly fun. There is enough going on to keep you interested. It's like a Platformer RPG, with elements of Metroid, Super Mario Bros., and other classics, all rolled up into a cute and artistoc bonanza. If you love RPGs and platformers, BUY THIS GAME! it's quite possibly the most			"

												Welcome to my review in which I´ll carefully analyze the game Super Chibi Knight.If you´re feeling lazy to read all the review you can just go to the conclusion and read a summary. Characters We play with a female character with armor and a sword.As we level up our armor and sword will improve.The character can also learn new moves when we finish certain missions.History The game tells the story of the evil General Tso that controls the kingdom of Oukoku, our character parts to defeat him.We travel through the world accepting missions of other characters while we level up.Gameplay The character uses two main weapons, sword and magic that will automatically improve as we level up.Our character moves in an open world in which creatures roam and when we touch them we are transported to an area in which we fight against them.We have a mini-map that indicates the location of our missions. Graphics The game has graphics chibi type (as the title indicates), chibi menas that everything has small, laughing and caricatured forms. Audio Here you can check the OST and get an idea

												Super Chibi Knight is a pretty alright game.It's a simple straightforward game where you go in one direction and you're essentially done.There's some side quests and achievements with a path where you either get to be one thing or another.My recommendation is to go the Beast Master route if you just want to beat the game. Replayable? Not really.A good game to waste an hour or 2? Yes.			"

												I didn't expect the game to be as fun as it was! The gameplay and storylines are pretty straightforward, and everything is really very cute. For a game as cute as this, there were some pretty difficult parts to the game. Surprisingly, the final boss fight at the end was actually not as difficult as the other boss fight encounters that you will meet throughout the game. There are some tricky bits that would require some thought and skill in maneuvering your character. Played both storylines for sorcerer and beastmaster, and definitely felt that the beastmaster was easier to play with.  Overall, 10/10 would play again, or if there ever was a sequel.			"

												Dont get fool by the player's puppy eye, the rest of the art is great XD . The only problem I found with this game are those f**king eyes, f**k I hate them.  Really good gameplay nice animations, and solid game flow, you never feel lost.  I would love to buy a dlc were you could use a pair of glasses so I dont have to see those ugly eyes. Thank god the rest of the npc have good eyes designs . I could sound stupid but I didnt buy this game until recently because I didnt like the design of the main character even though I like most of the npc. I had to watch a video to see that the rest of the art was awesome.Buy this game!			"

All I can say is this is the best £6.99 I have spent in a very long time I just can't put my joypad down. Also I think it's great the developer made this with his daughter doing the voice acting. So come on and buy it now and show your support. Hope thay will be many more games like this and maybe a sequel in the future			"

First if you dont pick up the quest and just start killing you will not be able to move on. i would love if there was something that would point out quest location as to not be able to miss any. 2nd idea i would like that if you do not pick up quest game  doesnt allow person to enter location with out said quest or just let them turn in quest as soon as they talk with that quest giver.i dont like at mountian town there quest do not go into your quest log.there a few othere things im sure you are working on but like if you bring son to the alter son is gone and you cant get that upgrade and move on. with that if you walk away from him you can go back to refight him .with all this said if you get this game it if fun and worth it just remember to get all the quest in town before you start becuase as of now you wont get pass the the mountain door if you dont, you wont be able to collect the 2 eggs at the end of the fire temple.

												I played the flash predecesor to this game and absolutely loved it way back when. So of course, when this came out, I picked it up and gave it a play. The first chapter of the game is solid and fun and harkens back to the flash game, although the pit was a tad difficult, but only due to playing with a controller, but I'll get to that later. Once I unlocked the second chapter, which it turns out was before I finished the first chapter, I found myself locked out from the first chapter. I had a mission that I had not completed from the first chapter, and when I finally unlocked a way to go back from the second chapter, which again was before I was completely finished with that chapter, I headed back to chapter one. Upon my return, the entire first chapter was changed, and I was forced into a boss battle I was not prepared for. After many deaths, I finally beat the boss and was pushed forward into the volcano area, only to feel underpowered and easily killed. Did you know its possible to get there with naught but a sword, armor, the lightning spell and the fire sword spell? I found that out the hard way. Of course, my second playthrough will go differently, and I will play through it again, leaving my current character to die there. I cannot progress. My armor and sword are maxed out, and I just keep dying. Part of the constant deaths seems to be the fact that the game is absolutely terrible to control on a controller, even though it allows support for controllers. Double-tapping a direction on the keyboard is easy and fast, but its diffcult on a controller, and dashing is required in many points of the end of the game.This game has a lot of flaws, and believe me I understand the love for it. But my god is it frustrating to play if you don't do things perfectly correctly.			"

												This game is a love letter to the developers daughter as it seems because she voice acted the character and the main is a female child. More importantly though it's an homage to Zelda II: The Adventure of Link from the NES days of yore... I think Zelda II is highly under rated and one of the most challenging and fun Zelda games in the franchise... I'd even go as far to say as I enjoy playing it more than Ocarina of Time just because of it's simplicity but for some reason Super Chibi Knight just misses the mark in a lot of ways.The art style isn't my cup of tea, it's a bit sloppy and childish looking but I guess that's the theme, I just wanted to try it for the RPG / Action elements but the problem with that is, the game mechanics are really bad. Hit boxes are very sensitive in this game and your characters reach animation is abysmal. You literally have to be micro pixels away from enemies in order to damage them. The sensitive hit boxes is a huge issue right from the beginning, but with some over leveling you can persevere and get through the first chapter. This however becomes a huge issue later in the game, even after you're maxed out, the enemies can kill you in only 4 or 5 hits and their range is far superior to yours.There are two paths through the game, Beastmaster and Sorcerer... but it's more like sword spell... The Beastmaster side of things reminds me more of Adventure Island II and is the easier path to take through the game. The Sorcerer side (Sword Spell) is much more reminiscent of Zelda II... which is funny because that path takes place on an Island... go figure.A word of warning, there are many missable achievements in this game, a lot of which are convoluted and cryptic and there are two points of no return which you are warned about before you proceed. If you don't happen to get things done in a specific chapter, then you'll have to start a new game from the beginning and try again. From what I can remember, Zelda II allowed you to backtrack to every area in the game so if you happened to over look something, you could always go back... this game doesn't allow for this... it's just lazy and sloppy game design in my books.I bought it for 2 bucks and some change, so I'd say, yeah go for it... but for an 11 dollar price tag, it's not really worth the price. There IS a lot of replay value here if you can stomach the grind, but to beat the game skipping certain spells / abilities and not losing a single life is a bit too much in my books... It will call for heavy levels of aspergers and OCD... as well as not having a life... as the achievement states.I appreciate the effort to re-create the magic that was Zelda II but Zelda II, it's not... 5 / 10. Needs a lot of fine tuning for the battle mechanics if it's going to stand up to a game as legendary and tight as Zelda. "

It has good art, good enemies, a good upgrade system, and you will play through the game at least twice to take the two different available story paths.I recommend trying out the original game which you can play online for free, Chibi Knight. If you like that, definitely get this game.			"

												This game is made by a father and his eight year old daughter. I recommend it on that alone.It feels very much like Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, and I don't care what nonsense you've been told about that game, because this is a good thing.There are enemies on the overworld map that cause fights when you bump into them, just like Zelda II.You gain experience when smashing said enemies in their stupid cute faces, just like Zelda II.You then use the experience to increase Attack, Defense, or Special, JUST LIKE ZELDA II.A lot of enemies may look different, but mirror attack patterns and behavior of enemies in Crystalis. Wait, I mean Zelda II.What I'm trying to say here is that if you enjoyed Zelda II (and you do if you aren't a huge idiot) then you will enjoy Super Chibi Knight. It's worth noting that this game is faster paced than Zelda II, and has more quests / charm / voice acting / daughters involved in the development.Still on the fence? Go google the original Chibi Knight, which is a free flash game, and try that out first. Or, you know, go play Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. It's really good, I promise. Don't listen to the people who talk bad about it; they are just bad at video games.Is it perfect? Not at all. It seems to run rather poorly in full screen, and could probably be optimized a bit better in that regard. The art is well done, but you can see some lines in the walls that give away the tiles.You can get stuck in situations that end with you taking unavoidable hits sometimes. Panda Witch boss, I'm looking at you.Using double tap to dash is really awkward while trying to do this in mid-air, because you have no forward momentum to your jumps. What I mean is, when you let go of the direction you are moving to initiate the double tap, you end up falling short a lot of the time because you had to stop moving to do the dash. You can also dash with the trigger buttons, but you won't know this unless you experiment on your own or go looking in the keybinds. ...Sometimes it feels like maybe they copied *too* much from Zelda II. Still, this is a fun game. It's worth ten dollars, especially if you plan to play through it more than once (there is a choice moment that might make you want to go back through a second time). You also get to support some really neat people with your purchase, and feel all fuzzy about that.			"

												I was really looking forward to playing this game but was rather disappointed in the end. I usually love hack and slash games with RPG elements - add cute graphics and a cool developer team of a father and daughter. What could go wrong? A lot apparently. Positive:- Simple controls- Nice visuals- Different storylines depending on a choice you makeNegative:- Frame-rate drops- Music is not particularly interesting- It is not always clear what you have to do, making it somewhat frustrating to play- Enemies sometimes behave in a strange way, making it awkward, difficult and sometimes impossible to hit them- Very strange difficulty curve (final boss is arguably the easiest boss)- Taming beasts is very over powered- Some jumps are very precise to the point that it's annoying- Health and mana is not well thought out - it can be very difficult to recover HP or MP, so it's often easier to just die- No real punishment for death (besides going back to check point). Easily exploitable for HP/MP- Easy to dash by accident - causing you to fall into instant death spikes- Block is quite useless after the early game- Extremely poor game design for one segment: literally could not proceed because my ""special"" level was too low. I did not have the mana pool to continue and since MP does not regenerate in this game, I had to back track and grind to increase my special level.- No new game plus. Basically your save becomes useless once you beat the game as it will spawn you at the final boss.Conclusion:I did enjoy the first 30 minutes of the game but it was mostly downhill after chapter 1. It's a real shame that I feel frustrated after playing it. I bought this game heavily discounted but I still regret getting it.			"

												So, Super Chibi Knight is a short-ish few chapter game with at least 2 playthroughs (more if you're achievement hunting).One of the only issues with the game i had is i soft locked the game during a fight. I killed a boss so fast that the health bar was depleted and I had to reset the room and fight the boss over again - which was a little annoying.The other only issue is that the achievments are really broken. I did one of the 2 paths you can take in the game (which is why replayability is a must). There's achievments you'd have to get considering you can't complete the area without doing them, but they didn't unlock.Super Chibi Knight is your typical armor games, newgrounds, kongregate flash game, just upgraded to a full scale game on steam. It can probably be beaten in an hour if you're quick, good, and speed running. Otherwisde it's a 2-3 hour run per playthrough. Considering it has 2 paths you can take for the story, and it's replayability you're paying $9.99 for about 6-8 hours of gameplay. There's some secrets you could probably look up, but they're decently hidden and it requires at least 2 playthroughs to get all the achievments... More if they never fix the achievment bug. And I mean in-game stats, not even steam achievments.It's a decent game. It doesn't tell you exactly where to go or what to do. A lot of people may find this frustrating, but inbstead of just screaming ""what do I do now"" or looking up the solution, give it a think or explore. It's basically just linear puzzle solving, and  very minimal backtracking. If you're stuck, its a problem on your end (unless of course the game soft locks and you cant beat a boss without resetting).I'd personally give it an 8/10 on some reduntant scaling system. With my short attention span one playthrough was enough, so if it's not worth the price to me, its simply because I didn't play the game twice, or go out of myway to find everything. And the achievment bugs relating to a story I completed is just infuriating, knowing I won't be going back to complete it. Whatever system triggers the achievments is clearly broken by the same mechanic that prevented me from killing a boss with no health bar. Again, this is very minor and just a personal dissatisfaction. Your results may vary, and it may be you even have a much happier experience!I enjoyed my time, you probably will too.			"

Posted: June 26, 2015
												    So this was my refund request that I decided to paste into this review, please do note that I may not be the best ""gamer"" but I do find myself to be likely above average. This was also posted without being able to get mounts, which likely would have assisted in the game, but the reason for this is explained further down.    As someone who has played the first Chibi Knight multiple times through, this game was a disappointment in quite a few aspects. The issue for the game is in its game play along with some other technical issues.It frequently crashed along with a variety of glitches that would interfere with game play. I would constantly encounter a glitch in which holding the down arrow to block would also move the camera down a good bit, and it would never return to its original position unless I died, or relaunched the game. Enemies would also glitch into floors and other objects making them unreachable, locking me into the area forcing me to relaunch if I were unable to leave the room and come back, even then sometimes the enemy would still be stuck. I've spent at least an hour just messing around seeing if I could fix the game and relaunching.    Battle mechanics felt clunky the whole game. Controls were unresponsive in dire situations and enemy attacks were absolutely infuriating. A great example of this would be the ""Panda Witch"" fight. This fight would start off with the Panda in the battle roaring, blasting you a good distance. The Panda would then roll at the player, and with experimentation, considering the game provides almost no guidance what so ever, the player would find out that they were to hit the Panda, causing it to bounce around the room. The witch, flying near the roof of the room, would be hit by this Panda EVENTUALLY (spending 2 minutes dashing under a panda with broken hit boxes is not fun at all). After the panda would hit the Witch out of the air, the Witch would fall to the ground, becoming helpless for a certain amount of time, letting the player wail on the Witch for damage. The Witch would recover and fly back into the air after the player deals a certain amount damage. The Panda would repeat its action, but the Witch would start blasting green orbs that home into the player that dissipate when they hit you, or after a few seconds. These move at a decent speed that the player could dodge with enough focus and skill. However, the problem with this phase is that the Witch would shoot out multiple orbs in quick succession, after the first orb is fire, about a second or less later the second one would be fired, making it almost impossible to dodge them. It is extremely difficult to jump over the first without getting hit, or sliding under it. The ""easiest"" way to dodge them is to run to the other side of the room before, or while she fires the first orb. However, you would then half to likely deal with the panda bouncing around the room, the chance to dodge this is highly unlikely. This has the possibility to have the Panda not hitting the witch out of the air once more. If the Panda cannot hit the Witch within a few bounces, the bubbles are likely to hit you, or the Panda will. This fight also has a third phase just like the second. This fight can most likely go on as long as it wants. Oh yea, blocking is completely useless in this fight. Almost like every other boss fight.    The last boss fight had a clever aspect to it. The more people you helped throughout the game would assist you in damaging the final boss, knocking its three health bars down. However, lets say that you helped the least amount of people possible, you'd be forced to have a tedious boss fight of swinging a shovel around at tentacles/giant eye, the target was unclear. Although its generally in your best interest to help others. I on the other hand, moved to the next island before being able to ""Free the Phoenix,"" collect some bugs for a poor soul, and never got the chance to ride a mob that was a huge new intro to the game. You are UNABLE to go back to the island until you complete everything you need to do on the second island, and when you come back to the original island, you are UNABLE to complete those quests and experience a large aspect of the game.    I had way too many peeves and bad experiences in this game. Bosses took experimentation, thus you would have to die multiple times,Bugs and glitches along with crashing often, The blocking mechanic which wasn't needed often,The lack of guidance that caused A LOT of random roaming around for a good 10+ minutes that was uneventful,The extremely annoying boss fights that were tedious and not fun at all, I spent over 30 minutes on the ""Panda Witch"" boss fight described above,The constant backtracking to healing and mana regeneration points,The inability to backtrack certain aspects,Some enemies are just plain annoying to fight, along with some levels that seem to be made to annoy the player (looking over at the ice castle that freezes you if you don't move)Situations that are plain stupid, such as the hole in the beginning of the game, if you get hit by a slime ball, you get stuck and try to force your way unstuck, next thing you know you get hit by ANOTHER and ANOTHER, I think you know where this is going,Platforming was an absolute pain the the♥♥♥♥♥ especially when you include platforming with water, considering that if you stay in water for more than 2 seconds you instantly die.Over all, I did not have a very enjoyable time at all.

												OMG, this game is awesome, BUT.......... it has the buggiest controls of any game I've played since the 80s!!!The controller comes up with weird default buttons... arrow keys are tied to attack and jump, right buttons are tied to dashing, shoulder buttons are tied to pause... my controller doesn't even have the buttons that are supposed to tie to actually moving. Oh, but they put in a very accessable way to remap buttons. Ok, cool, I remap them... oh wait, it doesn't save the remapped controls. I have to remap the entire controller every time I start the game. Huh...Ok, now I've remapped the controls... oh wait, when I'm playing, it seems that rapidly hitting the direction buttons (like, say, when you're trying to maneuver to fight the sandworm) can lead to them getting locked on or off... So partway through the battle, she starts runnign right without my input. I jam the controls a bit and it unsticks... a few minutes later it jams and she won't block (down).  Hey, I hit that problem once when I was making a flash games years ago! Makes the game pretty frustrating to play though...The only other concern... the ""block"" button is down... which is also ""zoom the camera."" Annoying. There's 4 thumb buttons on most controllers, and 3 actions assigned to buttons... why not put defend on the 4th? Honestly, the game has alot of personality, but until the controls get working, it's too frustrating to play.			"

												There's a Chibi Knight Flash game somewhere.  You should go play that first.  I thought this would be a considerable improvement over the flash game.  Then I realized that I couldn't really remember how the flash game ended.  However, neither game compelled me to play the flash game again to spot the differences. A major complaint I have is the voice acting.  In particular, to charge money for this I really thought the would clean up some of the audio in the game.  I know this was a father daughter product and I knew that going into it.  But the recording quality really made me feel like I was paying for freeware on the steam platform. It's a fun game but with 2 hours played through, I think I have full completion (or as much as I'm going to try) and I'll probably never install it again.			"

												Great RPG, but HORRIBLE screen lightning flashing half-way through the game... You want a seizure-invoking response, now you've got it. Nothing in the menus to turn off the frequent lightning flashes that happen every 3-4 seconds. Some flashes are double-flashing instantly for even more irritation. This terrible art element ruined the ENTIRE game for me even though I thought it was fun for the first 5 hours.			"

												This ♥♥♥♥ing game look good and all but when you play it, it's just so annoying how you have to start the whole level over and over and over if you die. The armor doesn't even help you at all because there are ♥♥♥♥ing monster every ♥♥♥♥ing ever you go and they do a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of damage to you. It just so stupid. I played the first one on armor game a long time ago, but now i remember why i hate this game.			"

												warning: may include spoilersi remember playing the first game a long time ago and i really liked it so then i found a sequel and thought, ""i have to get this game"". then i got it and it took a while to download, but it really wasn't much time to download so i thought that it would be a small game. then i saw the intro and thought that it would be a good game.well I cant change my gender, guess i'm done for.then I kill a pile of trash. (but did i really have to?)later I'm outside and I kill some giant wasps in few seconds and apparently that was supposed to be hard.i kill some more guys and end up with some 3 orb things and i go to some well and find some random floating thing and he says something like ""hey dude thanks for the orbs kbye"" and he flys away and gives me a giant bag and i think that im TOTALLY gonna use the xp cause the enemies are so easy in this gamethen i go into a desert and kill some sand worm thingthen i kill guys in a forest and put some guys lamp bright again.then i eventually go to a desert and find some super slash thingy that you can use to fire a beam thing that would be TOTALLY usefulthen i go in a pit and do some thing with a lever by using the beam to reach ita door opens and i go through it and about 30 seconds later im fighting a bossi kill it with rocksthen i get a kid and i bring him home and realise i was only just doing a questi go in the desert again and then go through a red cavethen i kill some yellow orc and get his blood, god i wasn't expecting thati get a keycard and go in some spacship and a snake puts the key card inthen eventually after the same annoying as hell enemies i get to some room filled with stuff in jarsi break a jar cause i hate everything in this worldthen a flying wombat comes out and craps every wherethe same thing happens with the orc, i kill it and it turns into jelly and i take its bloodthen i get some dust on my sword and help some drunk guy with the bloodi use the dust to cut down some rocks and go into a templei kill everything and i also kill a guardian at some point and free birds and kill them 5 seconds later and be a horrible person and take their eggsthen i go past a door and a huge eagle takes me to some edgy island with dragonseventually i go and fight a thing and i get a chickenthen i fight another thing and i get something else but i think it was the buffalo thingi talk to some cool kids and they give me some edgy rhinothen i have to get medicine and its really boring and this person isn't even sickthey are instantly better when they drink out of the dirty bucket which makes no sense and i go through some rocks on my edgy rhino and i find some purple dragon and i free it and explode it with my beam and ride it awaythen i get some fruit to put in a medicinei have to go on my most epic quest in the whole game just to get a carrot, some water, salt, a bucket and some sacred fruit that grows probably every century/millenium but they don't care, they're daughter has a cold and you have to help them. it would not be nice medicine and i think it would actually make you more sick due because you mixed SO many things together and its just, ewthen they have the medicine and are instantly betteri find a vault and look up the code to get in and i find the code online and type it ini get a crap ton of xpthen i get some jump skill thingsome time soon i break a door with my dragon and my hometown is destroyedyay i love this sight everybody is DEAD (or they are probably hiding in the pit)hiding from the FAT BIRDS!the bird somehow came back to live and are edgy as hellthe only hard enemies in the game i am facing right nowi rk them and go in the final arealater i fly over a bridgei get to my final boss and all the guys aren't dead and they came cuz i did they're quests and they rk the boss's healthi eventually get on the point and its really freaking boring because they only have 5 attacks and spam them in the same order over and over until eventually i kill itwhen i thought it was over i had to go in his mouthi eventually fight his heartwow that was easythen i get vomited out of himthe endthis game is awful, it has no replayability or purpose whatsoever and it lacks difficulty and it REALLY is not worth spending about $10 on itwait what when did i have 13.6 hrs? i never even play this!

												 Fairly well put together side scroller with about 4 hours of play time if you go through the two different playthrough paths. Take it for what it is and it isn't a half bad way to spend a few hours.			"

								Quite clunky controls with keyboard, fine with gamepadNice Presentation, although your characters voiceis annyoing.Split paths, dev still fixes bugs when people find em.Lots of small quests to do, but you often have toguess stuff and there are missable ones.All in all, a solid experience.

												Pretty short game beat it in 2.5 hours. If you like the flash it is a sequel to I'd recommend it for sure, but I am not sure how it would hold up otherwise. The whole time I was playing the game I felt like I had missed something though, like I missed some dialogue or tutorial etc. The special box showed a big red X for the whole game and I'm not sure why and I am not sure if it was supposed to or if I missed something. The game is also pretty glitchy. For a specific example, if you look up or down before using a teleporter, when you get to the other end it will spawn you in the incorrect location because it spawns based on the screen position, which is not constant since you can adjust the view. This can get you trapped to the point where you have to exit the game and reload your save. Also the game isn't very good at warning you went you are doing someone irreversable. MINOR(?) SPOILERS:When I delivered the phoenix eggs I didn't realize that I wouldn't be able to go back, and likewise when I left the mountain area I hadn't realized I wouldn't be able to go back yet again. I thought I'd be able to go to Oukuko and then back so that I would be taken to the start instead of having to back track all the way back to the monk. Well because of that I ended up being permanently unable to finish a quest on that save file. Also this game has a pet peeve of mine in games. When you go to reload your file after beating the game you are unable to continue play, level up, retrieve missed items, or finish incomplete quests. I never got to use the boat because I had planned to do it after delivering the phoenix eggs (since that was technically a quest) but then I was never able to go back. Also after getting Hebi there is no point in using anything else, which kind of sucked since you spend the whole game leveling up sword and armor only for those to both become useless by the additional health and massive power of Hebi. Using Hebi felt more like cheating or sequence-breaking than the correct way to play (but then sword did like no damage at that point). However I will admit from looking at the achievements I didn't get and a couple community forum posts, it looks like there is a lot of content I missed and there may be enough variety to warrant another playthough. Maybe it just went over my head and taking the boat gives you an alternate Chapter 2 or something.MAJOR SPOILERS:I did feel cheated that there wasn't a real General Tso battle, but just a world map battle (""and now for something completely different"") with Monocio and then a stupid easy curbstomp battle against his heart in the 2D sidescrolling format of the rest of the battle (the battle was a curbstomp because of Hebi being too powerful). Another complaint is that you can ""cheese"" most of the bosses. If you wait for Monocio to do the hand/shield attack if you are ready for him and attacking when he drops the shield the narrow area he goes to for that attack will trap him and you can get about 3/4 of a health bar down. Then back off for his next attack and move in again before he gets unstuck and you've basically already beaten him. Also if you die on the world map your mana is not regenerated due to I assume a programming oversight due to the nonstandard game over you get from that, so if you have none going into the fight when you get to the heart fight you are screwed (since I'm pretty sure you need Hebi to get over a jump, that or it is a very precise jump, but I really could never make it and there wasn't a double jump). So what you have to do is die in the heart fight so that the mana will refill and then go back and beat the world map fight and then you can actually do the heart fight. Maybe quitting and reloading would fix it as well but I think I tried and it didn't work. Either way it kinda sucks that you can make the final boss (almost) unwinnable by mistake But anyway I haven't invested much time in the game, and it sounds like there might be an alternate version of the final fight and of chapter 2 from the achievements? I don't know. I'm just calling it how I see it.In conclusion I  would *relucantantly* recommend this game, unless you like feeling lost, in which case I would definitely recommend it.			"

												I recommend this game in its content, but there are some graphical issues with 1920 x 1080 monitors and there is a weird stuttering issue every few seconds that I couldn't fix. I played it on my other computer with a 1080 x 1024 monitor and it worked great.Edit: I should have mentioned that the stutter bug is caused by an incompatible usb device. By graphical issues I meant that it looked a bit fuzzy on my 1920x1080 monitor but not enough to cause severe discomfort.			"
