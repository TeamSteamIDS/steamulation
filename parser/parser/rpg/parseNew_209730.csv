												Inspired by games like the Diablo franchise or Torchlight, Realms of Ancient War is an old school hack and slash dungeon crawler with very limited depth and breadth that is hard to overlook even tough it isn't a triple-A title. The story in the game is not the worst we've seen so far, in all honesty it's fairly interesting and one of the stronger points of the game. The game starts years after the so called Ancient War which divided the land to 4 territories (East, West, South and North...duh, imagination at it's best). The Northern King proposed truce so he invited the remaining kings to the Hero's Garden. Something went wrong because the Northern King was never to be seen again and the rest of the kings became soulless zombies. Yes, clichés after clichés, but it's not all that bad. The game contains some witty dialogues and turns.We can pick from 3 unnamed characters: wizard, warrior and rogue. Each have different styles but they aren't that different that any would change the gameplay significantly. Each class has it's own skill tree, where you can level up your attacks. There are 1 level and 3 level skills. Skills open up gradually. The first group right after the beginning of the game, the second after you reach lvl 10, the last after lvl 20. However, there are two problems related to your skill management. First, in every stage you can gain exactly one level. No matter how much you fight or how many side quest (there aren't that many) you complete. You can only get  1 skill point in each stage. That makes the whole level grinding procedure useless and dropping all the challenge. You will get your skill point no matter what. The second problem comes with the use of your skills. You have only 4 skills at your use at a given time. Two of them are to be activated with  the mouse and two with keystrokes on the keyboard. You can program these skills to the aforementioned buttons. If you want to use other skills you have to use the alternative set. Essentially you have 2 sets of skills, which can be changed at any time with a button push. Easy enough, in theory at least. Practice is a different beast. Remembering which skill you have assigned to which button in which set is pointless, painful and horrible. When a dozens of foes are attacking you there is no way this system can be use properly. Using this method is understandable on consoles where there are limited buttons to use, but on a PC it's unacceptable. This is where you realize that 4 skills/attacks are well enough to complete the game. At least the fighting and hack'n slashing is exciting. You are continuously attacked by tens of enemies, making the game challenging and intense. Sometimes it is hard to hit smaller enemies, like spiders which live everywhere, rain forests or volcanoes it doesn't matter for them. Graphically the game doesn't excel, but it's not bad either. For an XBLA title it's passable. Not are the audio tracks though. Audio effects are horrible and repeating. Listening to the same 3 grindings throughout 8-10 hours when you hit enemies is annoying. The music is on par with the rest of the audio. You get one passable song which plays when you start the game, the rest of the music tracks during gameplay are just pointless burrs.R.A.W. is a below average hack and slash game that tries to build upon it's great predecessors of the genre but fails in every possible way. It's chaotic, mediocre and boring. A game that is hard to recommend when you can get a dozen of it's kind cheaper (or even for free). If you can finish it once there is no point starting the game ever again.Rating: 45/100; Replay Value: 1/5; To Beat: 8-9 hours; Played on: normal.			"

												There are minor annoyances in the game, like having you confirm every single item you sell over and over, or not being able to hit a small creature like a spider that you are pointing at directly.  Then there are bigger issues, like ranged enemies attacking you outside the camera view or masses of enemies suddenly spawning en masse right next to you.  But it was at the point I spawned into a new room just to receive an attack from a ranged enemy that I gave up on this game.Realms of Ancient War feels like a first attempt at a Diablo style action-RPG which is fine as I'll play anything half decent.  Unfortunately, this game does not qualify.  It seemed the only way this game could provide a challenge is by swarming you with enemies that weren't on the same spot a second ago.  Or you may be trapped in a tiny area with no room to move around while fighting a boss.  Obviously things like this give the player a bad impression as opposed to any sense of challenge.  It seems I'm spending all my time attacking dwarves and spiders with the occasional lizard.Environment serves mostly to get in the way if you're a bow or magic wielder.  Even small rocks just above the ground can block your ranged weapons.  To make matters worse, they console-ify the game by limiting you to four available skills at one time along with a health and mana potion.  That reminds me a little too much of the limiting skillset of Diablo 3.  You can switch to a second skill set by pressing Tab while using the same keys, but that is terribly unintuitive compared to just giving us the action keys we need.  Keys are not rebindable either.I made it to level 10 but could not continue any further.  I suspect most will drop the game before this point.			"

												Hold left mouse button to move, hold left mouse button to attack.You're encouraged to make ranged attacks but due to the zoom level most times you can't see what's coming until it's htting you.99% of the loot is useless & sold for gold which is also useless. You'll pick up some good armour, level-upgrade some basic active & passive abilities, and be set for the rest of the game. You also get enough XP to unlock almost every skill upgrade so you don't have to choose wisely, and if you die you're resurrected instantly to carry on.The whole thing is so bland & so generic, the story is bog standard fare & the ending is equally unengrossing. Enemies are mostly the same throughout despite 4 seasonal flavours to the map, and there's only a couple of places where you think 'oh that looks nice'.If this game were on an ECG it would be close to flatline. Just a few hours of holding the left mouse button, Not worth the time or the money, buy something else. If you already own it, play something else. Anything else.			"

												This is one of those titles that you should not play unless you know what to expect going into it. On the surface, R.A.W. is another Diablo-style hack & slash RPG lootfest wherein you slay endless waves of strikingly homogenous minions and swap gear out for marginally better gear. In this respect, R.A.W. succeeds where many others succeed and fails where many others fail; gameplay is satisfying (if repetitive at times), programming is relatively bug-free, and the story is... well.. there's a story at least, some games don't even have that. What R.A.W. provides for Steam, however, is all of this formula that can be enjoyed both with a controller and with a local friend. If you own at least one 360 controller, you and a friend can enjoy quite a few hours of good old mindless RPG baddie slaughter. Overall, I'd give this game a 6.5/10; solid gameplay, proper controller support, and local multiplayer often outshine the game's general lack of ambition.			"

												I think a lot of people are unfair when they review this game, mostly because they review it thinking of it like a Diablo clone. In all honesty, R.A.W. is more of a Gauntlet clone, but with some more RPG elements thrown in.The game is mostly a slogfest. Kill enemies, maybe do a random quest, reach the next area. Most likely get one experience level on the way (there is an experience cap per area and once that has been reached you barely get any experience).Is this a problem? Not really. Sure, the game might feel sluggish at times, but overall it actually keeps on going pretty well. And except for the beginning when I didn't use the compass enough I never really got stuck anywhere. (Oh, and there's no map in the game, only a compass which shows the general direction you're supposed to go.)Overall: Not a bad game. Not the best game in the genre, definitely not the worst. Just don't go in hoping to get a Diablo game, then you'll be disappointed.			"

												I'm five hours in this game and I have to say:I must be an alien from another planet to differ from the overall opinion about R.A.W. - It might be a guilty pleasure, but I like it. The game is simple, you aren't doing much more than slashing through waves over waves of enemies and take their mostly not so spectacular loot.I wouldn't say it's too repetetive judged by the level design, which has quite the variety from each area. There's sand levels, ice levels, fairy forests, dark jungles, castles and a weird meta ghost world. And that's not even all. Enemy types could be more diverse, but at least there IS change to it - plus smaller and bigger bosses.You have three classes, I'm playing as warrior - and the levelable skills are satisfactory in my eyes. You can choose to be more defensive or more of a battle type.I don't about the story, but from what I understand it's okay to have a reason for all the monsters and quests. The game is very linear, don't expect any open world / sandbox feeling.If you search for a pure action RPG with lots of monster killing and dig a nice graphic style, then you might wanna try this out. You liked Greed: Black Border? Then definitely try this out. You want a lot of open world feel, a great variety of quests, a lot of voiced over dialogue? Then you might wanna skip this.Oh: You should play this with an Xbox 360 controller, if you have one. It plays GREAT with it ;)			"

												R.A.W. is a hack’n’slash RPG where you choose from the standard characters of warrior, dark sorcerer, or rogue. The four kings met in the North to fight back an ancient evil which is trying to come back. Only three made it out beaten and worn and the North King was frozen in crystal. This is where you come in and find the North King and he speaks to you telepathically asking for your help. He melds with your body and sets you on a task to open the four portals of north, south, east, and west lands.Playing the game isn’t bad it’s just not great. There isn’t much variety in enemies as you’ll fight mostly the same ones over and over which will become monotonous over time. Your weapons and armor don’t really make much of a difference in what you use. Basically you find a better one and it gives you a higher damage or defense. You can also have elemental damage of fire or poison to your weapons but those didn’t seem to add anything noticeable. Skills get added each level but none of them were that great or make me excited to level them up or unlock them.The story is pretty weak and didn’t really hold me or make me want to pay attention much. You’ll fight through the same levels or what seems like the same levels many times. Make it halfway through the game and then go back and do it all over again. Not too exciting if you ask me.Overall R.A.W. is a mediocre game which wasn’t bad to play but not worth playing more than once. Co-op may add a little fun to it but since I played it already by myself I don’t see the real reason to play it again unless you want all the achievements.Bear Rating: 6/10			"

												A run of the mill, bog-standard action rpg. 3 possible classes, 26 totally boring levels, bland and uninspiring skills, and combat that most of the time boils down to mashing the basic attack skill. Story-wise nothing spectacular either, and side quests (if any) are limited to simple ""go kill"" or ""go fetch."" Avoid unless you somehow have absolutely nothing else to play.			"

												Do you have what it takes to tolerate more than an hour of Realms of Ancient War? Do you crave bland action, boring levels, and uninteresting loot? Is the idea of pointlessly slaughtering millions of dull creatures for pitiful rewards getting you all hot and bothered? Then I dare you to take the ultimate challenge: Attempt to complete this game without pushing your PC out a window.I really tried to stomach R.A.W. I did everything I could to make the experience more pleasant for me. I played my favorite music, had something good to drink, and dreamed about beautiful and amazing things. Unfortunately, this game is just so by-the-numbers and repetitive. The way I see it, quitting the game would free up the use of my hands. These hands could be used for more entertaining activities...... Like drumming on the desk.R.A.W. is split up into multiple stages. In each stage you kill a few hundred enemies, and a boss or three. Sometimes these minions and/or bosses use ranged-attacks. Aside from the demon army from hell that constantly spawns, you'll also kill skeletons, spiders, humans, dwarves, AND elves. It's pretty silly if you think about it, since there's a complete lack of explanation as to why the races of the world hate your guts. The only people who aren't trying to kill you have quests or objects to sell. I recall at one point a man told me to kill a dwarf, but then the dwarf told me to kill the man, but when I went back to the man, he told me to kill the dwarf, so I gave up and moved on. The quests usually award an item that's worse than whatever you have equipped anyway. Sadly, the quests are perhaps the only time the game actually tries. Everything else that occurs in each stage is merely tedious. You'll spend large chunks of the game with only 1 or 2 skills to use, which makes combat even less exciting. The level-up system is an absolute joke. When you enter a new stage, the first level-up will come very quickly. After that, the experience point awards drop off a cliff. The cycle begins anew as soon as you reach the next stage. Why even bother having an experience system? Just have the player choose what skills they want, as soon as they arrive at a new location. Instead there has to be this mind-numbing half-baked system. The enemies drop mostly junk, so outside of the slim possibility a boss will drop something decent, there's no incentive to fight. Once you get your guaranteed level-up, you could probably just run past everything. It doesn't seem to matter one way or another.While the opportunity to slay countless elves & dwarves does sound appealing to me, I had to get rid of R.A.W. It's a thoroughly mindless hack & slash that is bested by hundreds of other titles. If you happen to discover this game in your library. My advice is not to panic. It probably crept into one of your indie bundle purchases. Just ignore it and move on.			"

												Enter the Gauntlet Overview:RAW is a Gauntlet game. It is NOT a diablo-style action RPG.  It is a (generally very linear) mob-fueled beatem-up (probably best with some friends) with fast action and a few hit and miss ideas. Not a bad game. Not the best either, but not by any means awful.Pros:Fun skills (Although it could have used more per class and more classes).Great artA variety of places and enemiesA loot system that generally works really well.Cons:It is pretty short (around 6-7 hours).Only 3 classes. They are also the most cliche classes ever.Every once in a while I had framerate issues. Not frequent, but it was odd.Pretty easy. Played on normal. I would recommend the hardest difficulty probably if you are playing with more than 1 person.Some ""posess enemies"" sections that while interesting could have been implemented better.			"

												Honestly this game is fine. I don't get why there's so many negative reviews. It's an ARPG, like Diablo II. The game has barely any bugs, if not at all.The difficulty is just right, althrough I found the mage to be overpowered in my opinion. Playing Co-Op is a lot of fun and the skills are interesting, you can make a few different builds with three classes.Also the levels are very varied and vast, they sometimes take 20-30 minutes to clear and there's a bunch of them too. The story is alright and the graphics are alright too. The animations are a bit wonky, but it's not that important.If you can keep aside the fact that most of the loot is not very useful and that it feels like an older game, then you could very well enjoy it. I think $15 is a bit too much though, but for around $5 I'd say it's worth it.			"

												The game itself is alright and quite fun to play. It can be best described as a poor man's Diablo. It has a similar feel and playstyle just less characters and is shorter in walkthrough. The quests are straightforward - run from A to B, meet C, he says to kill D and E to get magic items to open the door and stuff like that. The only two downsides for me personally are:1. No ingame map. I mean I want to know to which parts I've been to, where the quest mob is and what not. 2. Bugged achievement in the form of Eternal Hero. :(Overall, it's alright in a sale, and a sorta complete once or thrice (with all characters) and never open again type of game.			"

In comparison though the skill tree and the abilities contained within are quite bland as are the graphics: generic locations with depressingly linear pathways. The loot and equipment are unimpressive as well.RAW is just completely average and bland. There are so many options available these days that RAW is a pointless and uninventive timesink.			"

BITESIZE:SIMILAR TO: Sacred, Paths of Exile, Titans Quest, Grim Dawn, Van HelsingWHAT TO EXPECT: Pretty graphics.  Linear but replayable levels.  Solid, if repetitive gameplay.  Limited character creation.  Decent range of skills.  Decent range of equippable items.ACHIEVEMENTS: ONE BROKEN. ONE GLITCHED.STATUS: COMPLETED.WHEN TO BUY:  ONLY ON SALE.More info below....THE LOWDOWN:Realms of Ancient War is a solid if average ARPG set in a familiar style fantasy world.  Choose a character from: Warrior, Mage & Rogue.  Move through 26 or so replayable levels killing a variety of animal, humanoid and etheral/undead enemy types.  Face a few bosses and demi-bosses.  Perform limited sub-quests.  Gain experience to spend on a variety of unique upgradeable skills.  Equip characters with a variety of armor, weapons and jewelry.  Open chests.  Trade with a vendors for unwanted items to buy ones you do.  Get to the end of the level to make the next one available.  Rinse and repeat.THE GOOD:+ Solid KB/M controls.+ Simple well designed interface shows everything perfectly from quick slots and their associated hotkeys.+ Good inventory design with equipment slots and general area for other carried items.  + Use of Soul gemstones provide player lives.  Are great for average ARPGs like me.+ Levels can be replayed in any order to grind gold, experience and or items and purchase unique items at traders.THE BAD:- No manual saves.  Checkpoint locations and frequency is good though only reusable at certain times.- One broken achievement - Eternal Hero.  One glitched achievement - Critical Hit, requires Rogue character.- Coop achievement requires an Xbox compatible controller to gain.- Trader interface has no mass-sell option and is devoid of hotkeys making it tedious to use.- Only local coop is available but its stable.- Must be replayed 3 times; once with each class to get the final achievement.- No camera controls means fixed view.- Experience is limited to one character level per game level.  So once you get it dont expect to be able to farm xp on the same level.AND THE ORDINARY:* 3 standard archtype characters to play: Warrior, Rogue & Wizard.* Very basic level design.  Almost all maps are overly linear though.* 12 or so skill types for each character.  Can be upgrades three times each.  Pre-requistes required.* Pretty above average graphics.  But present a dark, sombre ambience which is perfect for the setting.* Okay selection of sounds gives action the proper audio impact.* Solid background music track that changes depending on the gameplay taking place.* Small but significant item economy with sporadic traders allows unique items and potions to be purchased.* Solid model animations.  Pretty and unique spell animations.* Stable on Win 7 Pro & Win 10.VERDICT:When compared against other games of its type, Realms of War is a solid if average to above-average ARPG.  Its gameplay feels very arcadey and repetitious but there is some tactical value in position, and repositioning your character and choosing the right ability at the right time.Its probably more suited to hardcore fans of the genre that dont mind taking a drop down from quality titles such as Grim Dawn, Titans Quest or the like.  In addition its virtially linear gameplay is perfect for casual players if played on easier difficulties especially given the simplisitic quest system.  Though the ability to replay levels over and over any time is great for grinding out extra gold and items if you need them.All aspects of game production are solid when evaluted together but overall the game is an unremarkable experience.  Note that the one broken achievement requires three playthroughs; one with each character type.  Its not the sort of game that I would want to play three times in a row.  My second playthrough as thief waited 4 years to be started.  However given the decent range of individual character abilities there is some scope for replayability.  Unfortunately the game is limited to local coop. I would imagine this game would be much more enjoyable played with a friend, sitting on a couch with some munchies nearby.You probably noticed that I used ""solid"" alot to describe many aspects of this title because all-in-all Realms of Ancient War is to generic for my liking.  Though it did kind of grow on me during my second playthrough when I wanted a brainless ARPG that wasnt too taxing.  I expect most gamers would find it quite bland and boring.  Which is why I would prefer to neither recommend or not recommend it.  If you are still interested I would suggest only getting it on sale and only if you really, really dont mind playing what is an average if well-made game.  If thats the case then dont expect too much and you wont be disappointed.  If you are a completionist stay away as you wont be able to complete achievement.  No support will be forthcoming as the developer is defunct.EDIT: Broken - Eternal Hero achievement may be glitched rather than broken.  Unverifed.			"

												WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?""R.A.W"" is nothing but cheap ripoff of diablo and torchlight together, honestly i can't even say that because of several reasons, both games have at least half linear gameplay, what i mean, you have options to do either side quests and obtain better gear or just stick to main quest or farm for experience and gold, but in ""R.A.W"" it's totally irrelevant, forget about side quests, there is only one option you have to stick to main quest there is no way back, not to meantion path is so small and tight that sometimes there can run into invisible walls which are blocking from moving. Incredibly idiotic AI, they can get stuck at walls or invisible walls trying to get to shortest paths there is... Game likes to play jokes on players, because you know why not. Best part is, it would make lot of sense if there was health bar on each enemy, if you are damaging it or not, when you came across but instead they rush at you, surround you, that basically means you are dead, just as soon player gets damage it cancels all your attacks / animantions, because you know why not. Sometimes it's impossible to notice when player gets attacked by spiders and what's with the spiders, every new level has spiders in it. Could not they come up with something else besides spiders? Is this some kinda dungeon crawler spider killing simulator? I love some parts of game when there is ""HUGE Boss type event"" and game just simply spawns huge mobs of enemies either behind you or in front of you, killing them does not help in any way because you have to move ""somewhere"" and how people can know this when there is no in game map? That adds even more frustration.Whats with Local coop? Is this game from year 2000? Dreadful story, plain dumb tips, unresponsive controls, no rebindable keys, redundant UI and skill trees, no in-game map, yeah you know why does player needs map when ""R.A.W"" is so freaking linear tight game.

												It looks like the devs did not care about anything but the graphics of the game. It has many flaws but it is not a bad game. The levels are mostly linear but the atmosphere is good. I finished the game with all 3 classes. The mage is way overpowered because you can win the game by spamming the fireball spell. It has the longest range, the highest damage, fastest attack rate and also area damage. I found the rogue to be the most challenging and fun to play. It is just mindless action. You can play a couple of levels per session because it becomes tedious. Despite all the flaws I liked it and recommend it.			"

												I play the PS3 version, forgot I even had the PC version. If you liked Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance on the PS2 then you will get into this one. It's not as good but very close.You can't jump..... Stupid. Annoying ""Hah!"" while you attack, and the satisfying impact sound effects that BG DA had are non existent in this one..Other than that I've had a blast playing it!			"

												what sucks.1. game starts in a very small screen and does not show any options to make it fullscreen, you have to go digging for the file and launch game from config.2. also there is now way to change the keyboard settings, i am level 11 and i cant even use some skills becuse the second tier does not let you hold a button down to charge the second part up.3. controls are wonky, sometimes you get stuck attacking objects like spider eggs or boxes.4. no character customization. they offer diffrent color armor for what reason i do not know, you are allways going to use the strongest item you find and the character is so small you can really see the color anyway.5. no bank or way to give your other characters items.6. THERE IS NO SAVE BUTTON you gotta play thru the whole level and when you start a new level the game will save, but it does not tell you that. its a total f ing scoobydoo mystery. "

												As far as dungeon crawlers go you will be better off finding a better game. I couldn't even bare to play it past the first level. For a game of this caliber the graphics are poor at best, the gameplay is bland, and the overall art and story are boring and cliche. Try Torchlight 1 and 2, Diablo 3, Icewind Dale, or any of the Dungeon Siege games if you want a compelling dungeon crawl.			"

												R.A.W. Realms of Ancient War is a very generic ARPG which offers some average gameplay and a less then interesting story. The game begins with you selecting one of three classes (Warrior, Mage or Rogue), as with most ARPG's each class has a different skill tree made up of around 16 skills some of which have level requirments before you can use them. The story within the game is really only there to push you forward and is presented through text based conversations when meeting important characters. The graphics and effects within this game were overall nice to look at and the art design was actually quite beutiful, however it will really be nothing new for this type of game. In terms of gameplay you are constantly fighting wave after wave of enemies which overall was quite enjoyable however it did get repetative quite quickly as there is not that many different types of enemies on offer within the game, the 'boss' fights if you want to call them that took close around 5 - 10 seconds, with the final two bosses in the game taking around 45 seconds, for me this was a bit pathetic as it did not present much of a challenge at all and required little to no strategy.Overall I found the experience that is on offer to be okay and taking around 10 hours to complete all 26 levels and side quests the game is on the short side so maybe wait for it to go on sale if you are considering purchasing it. I would recommend this game on the basis that I did enjoy certain areas of it and prior to playing this I had never really played many Hack'n Slash games.Rating: 5/10			"

												""I played games 10 years ago that outdo this in every way""Having been a fan of the Snowblind engine games on consoles like Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance and Champions of Norrath, I had some interest in this title as well. Unfortunately, this game has left me massively disappointed. StoryYou are wandering around when you get attacked by some creatures. A voice tells you to head through a portal. You find the voice belongs to one of the 4 realms Kings, who is trapped in crystal and yet still able to communicate. He wants your help to activate 4 gates and stop these creatures at the source. More stuff happens later, but it doesn't get any better. The story is boring and forgettable. I quickly lost interest in it myself.  PresentationGraphically, this game is decent. Not great, with the fixed camera, boring locations and constant repeated enemy types, but it isn't horrible. You at least know where you are on the screen, most of the time. Music and sound effects are poor at best. Fortunately, you won't remember it after you are done with the game. ControlsThe keyboard / mouse controls are just awful. Please, don't even try to play this without a gamepad. Playing with a gamepad has its problems still, but it can be played at least. You are unable to remap anything but the four face buttons, which could result in some irritation since the game doesn't follow the standard controls for similar games that use a gamepad. GameplayMove forward, beat up enemies that spawn out of nowhere within sight of your character, and repeat. The randomly spawning enemies are quite a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it doesn't help they don't even spawn out of camera. Gear is boring, with each piece of equipment for your chosen camera being the same as your previous gears in every way but stats. Speaking of stats, only gear can change those, levelling simply allows you a skill point to power up mostly pointless skills. Each skill doesn't even give you specifics on their enhancements, instead saying stuff like 'Minor damage, Moderate damage and Greater damage', meaning you won't even know how useful a skill is without spending points on it. At least there is an item you can use to have all skill points reset so you can later invest them in better skills. Wandering around each level can be bothersome as you have not been given a minimap of any sort, just a compass to point you towards your current quest location. Most levels aren't so big that you require it, but its sill an annoying omission. LifespanIf you can somehow beat the game even once, you still have the option of beating the game with all three character classes. I pity the people attempting such a goal. This also has a rather poor co-op mode, with the second player having a character with a scaled level and default equipment, that won't be saved between levels. Beyond getting an achievement by having a second player join in, I doubt anyone will bother with co-op. ClosingEven ignoring the much better competition that was released years ago, this game is a poor choice for purchase. I would recommend against purchasing this title, your money can and should be spent on much better items.			"

												I beat the game as a solo wizard on normal. It took about 8 hours. I got the satisfaction of my character upgrading his look as the game progressed. Unfortunately, the simple combat and forgetable story made the 25 or 26 levels a grind. The enemies (wolves, dwarves, elves, humans, etc.) and locations (desert, catacombs, forests, etc.) were varied enough. At times the game's enemies were reminiscent of Left of Dead's infected swarm. Likewise, so did the strategy of sticking to a corner and blasting wave after wave of enemies. I beat the game essentially with only 3 skills (fire blast, push, and poison aoe), Maybe it's better with friends.			"

												This game is not worth more than the humble bundle I received it in. It is the definition of a backlog game. You know, one of those games in your steam list that you never get around to playing. The only reason I even played it is because it's a mindless, linear slashfest to hack away at while skyping with friends.It is essentially a stripped down Diablo clone. You play as one of the three generic classes, and then walk through some of the most linear level design you will ever experience (except for the first level, which is for some weird reason a maze). You just grab some gear, level up some skill points, and go forward. That's it; nothing else to it. Perhaps it would have been even the tiniest bit better if you could do co-op, but it's LAN only. Yeah, a game from 2012 on the PC is LAN only.If you managed to get this game for a dollar or something, maybe it's worth trying it out for an hour to see what you think of it. But your time would be better spent on any of the other Diablo-ish games out there, like Path of Exile, Van Helsing, or, you know, Diablo. But otherwise, don't bother.			"

												I can't even bring myself to play a whole hour of the game.First we have very clunky feeling control. This is a bit subjective, but I hate how you move your character and attack with the same god damn button. When you're fighting you're constantly spam clicking on the enemies, but lots of enemies are tiny, like spiders for example. Which means you'll be akwardly switching between moving towards the enemies and attacking them because you move and attack with the same button and the spiders are too tiny.It also feels incredibly boring, part of this is how easy it feels. I played on normal mode and got 10 extra health potions within 5 minutes. In a well thought out game this would either not happen, or the game would be designed around an excess of potions. There's no real delay between using potions, so you can just spam them whenever you're low on health.Overall not a well made or fun/enjoyable game.			"

												I found playing RAW quite refreshing and fun!You get the opportunity to enjoy a thoughtful story, combined with great gameplay and fun characters. I do not understand why some of these reviews have a problem with the game.""Easy"" mode gives you a relaxing, enjoyable romp, learning and advancing your character while also having the time to take a breath and give the scenery a chance to seep in.""Normal"" mode is a bit more intense, I found that I died far more and would recommend starting off with easy mode to anyone just getting a feel for the game. However, this will give more of a challenge to those interested.""Hard"" mode gets stupid, if you're looking to get your face pounded, go ahead. The game also has full controller support which I enjoyed quite a bit.Highly recommend everyone to purchase this title, great job guys!			"

												My buddy and I had a great time playing this one together... took us about 25 hours to get through the whole thing, and we didn't fret too much over finding every little nook and cranny, but we're probably a little more methodical than most (i.e. slow).   We played a couple areas multiple times to beef up a bit for the next area, but not enough to be annoying.  I detest games that make me do the same stuff over and over.  The game is nothing super-duper regarding story, graphics, sound, gameplay... but it all was perfectly okay IMO, and most importantly, it was fun and kept us playing.  And I'm kinda tired of the ""this game sucks unless it has 34 stats to compare on every item and 17 branches in each skill tree of 20 different classes"" mentality in all the ARPGs these days... I don't really think that makes a game MORE FUN.  If anything, it kinda turns it into a ""job"".  Replay value?  Grinding the same thing over and over provides little or no replay value (to me).  Anyway, the combat can be tough at times (usually due to certain mobs catching you off-guard), but in general, the game is rather easy once you get the hang of it.  There are some of the skills that work in tandem between the characters different characters.  There was a ""suck all the enemies to me"" skill on one of our characters, and a ""BOOM goes the neighbors"" skill on our other character, and the combo just seemed to never get old when we got the timing right.If you like games Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance, Grim Dawn, Torchlight, etc., or maybe you're just tired of over-statting and grinding, or you just wanna get a friend and go hack and slash and blow up stuff with magic... then this is likely be a good fit for you.Use gamepads... everything is laid out to take advantage of an XB-compatible pad.  I appreciate how they made this work.  It reminded me of LotR: War in the North, which I really liked as well (an others hate on because there's not 34 stats to compare and 20 classes and 17 branches... blah blah blah).This game is definitely worth it for a Diablo-style romp with friends.  Didn't play single-player, so that might be a different story.  I find that ARPGs are generally better co-op anyway, especially if there aren't any NPCs or summoned companions to force the fights away from the ""everything on the screen just shoots and chases ME""... BORING!Anyway, get this puppy on sale, and grab a friend or two, some gamepads and put it up on the big screen...			"

												First off, I'd like to say that I had a mildly enjoyable time playing this game in the first couple of hours. It's not all bad, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a good game. RAW is a game that doesn't do anything very well. It's mostly generic, with no inovation whatsoever, and then with a subpar combat due to being designed for consoles.Combat and Controls.The most important thing in a game like this should be the combat. I've finished the game with the Mage class, and it feels very ""spammy"", since you click to launch a fireball, and that's your main attack. The Skill Trees are simple enough, having 3 tiers from which you can level up abilities and get some new ones. The bad thing here is that half of them are useless, and the upgrades are very straightforward, none of them being out of ordinary.Another big problem with it is that you only have 2 mouse button, plus 1-4 for abilities, 3 and 4 being necessarily your potion slots. You can hit TAB to switch to an alternative 1-4 set of abilities, but it's just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to do so in the middle of combat. Seriously, why the ♥♥♥♥ would you port a game to a PC and not change that? How hard can it be?! It just demonstrates laziness from the developers, imo. The Difficulty is also too easy. Far too easy. I've played this game in Heroic Mode and I've barely died. And when I died, it was because I was very much distracted (Yes, since the combat is mostly pressing LMB, you lose focus pretty easily). Also, the ""difficulty"" only comes from swarming you with enemies that appear out of nowhere, and their attacks can stun you for a second.  On the other hand, they also died very easily, providing no challenge. The big mobs, Bosses, if you will... are the easiest. They're big and slow, make it very easy to dodge their attacks and just knock them back as soon as they get close to you.Enemy variety is close to non-existent. There are like 2 melee units, one faster than the other, then there is a ranged unit, and then there are spiders. Lots of those. Every enemy is essentially a reskin of the mentioned. Mini Bosses are pretty much larger versions of those enemies, far slower and with more HP. None of them has any noteworthy ability, it's just dodging projectiles, and killing enemies from afar.Graphics.This game looks okay. Nothing that blew me away, but it looks pretty good nonetheless, even if rough around the edges. For the first half of the game, you're traveling through different places which gives a good variety to the levels. On the second part of the game, you're going through the same kind of places, which gets a bit tedious, close to the end.An important issue I had with the graphics, is that the enemies are always the same color as the background. Why the ♥♥♥♥...?! How could they not see that? In every level, you can't even see most enemies very well due to all the colors being very similar. This is just bad design and I have no explanation for why they'd do it.In regards to effects, they're generally good enough, with the exception of the Fireball, which looks pretty bland.Animation quality is service-able, it's not bad, but it's not stellar either.Sound.Sound effects were also pretty bland, nothing noteworthy here. The music fits the setting, but, again, nothing to write home about. This feels more of an arcade game rather than an ARPG.Level Design.Despite their visual variety in the first half of the game, there's nothing unforgettable here. Levels are quite short, and have nothing interesting. Nothing to tell the world's story, other than ""everything is mad at you and will attack you"". Except for vendors, who are not attack.. for some reason. Later in the game, there are a couple of different levels, more of an arena and labyrinths, but they're like 2 or 3 levels. Out of the 26 available.There was room for much more here... Side quests are very uninteresting as well, and require almost no sidetracking. Mostly ""Get this random package to this point ahead in the level"", or ""Kill this bad guy"".ALSO, no map! Seriously? Why? This makes no sense. It's not that one would get lost all that much, but it would be helpful to keep track of where the player is, and what's left to explore. AND, at one point, part of the main quest is to slay monsters in West, SouthWest and NorthWest. Fair enough. The problem is, there are no ♥♥♥♥ing directions. No map, no compass, no direction indicator. And South isn't just down. West was Down and to the Right. There's no ♥♥♥♥ing reason for that to be west. And that kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. That just makes no sense, and was a piece of very bad design in my opinion.Achievements. Uh. Why would one review achievements? Well, I believe that achievements can help the player try out new things, explore a bit more and discover interesting things in the mechanics or the world. Well, not here. Achievement are very generic as well, so... yeah. They might as well not be here. Conclusion.Unfortunately, this game doesn't really do anything very well. It does some things pretty badly. But it's not something I'm mad that it exists. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless you really like this type of games.I took some enjoyment out of it, it's not all bad, but there's sooooo much that need to be reworked here... Well, maybe the next game will be better. And please, do not make it all console-like again if you're porting it to the PC. That might have been the cause of most of its problems. Cheers. "

												BAD:Ok, so...it started out ok with some little problems. No minimap, no way to activate health bars on enemies & it can be hard to click exactly on a particular enemy at times. Sometimes the character gets stuck attacking the air for a few seconds after you kill an enemy. I thought, ok, I can tolerate this since howlongtobeat.com says this game only takes about 10 hours to beat. The skills feel satisfying to use and I was having fun murdering bunches of enemies at a time.Then I discovered this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ death mechanic. You get soulstones, which are like ""continues."" They get used up when you die. There doesn't seem to be any way to get more of them. I was playing on hard, so I lost all my continues at the end of the first level because the quest caught me off guard. The screen just fills up with enemies that constantly respawn. You're supposed to fend them off for a while and then go into some portal, but they all block you pretty hard. The warrior has a leap slam skill, but you can get interrupted when casting it. When you lose all your continues, you start the game over from the beginning. Its kinda wierd because I still have all my skills, gear, and experience. Why do I have to restart from the beginning?! I think it might just make you restart from the beginning of the level you are currently on.I perma-died twice more and finally got through the level. I'm at level 3 now. My sister walked into my room and asked my why I was frowning so hard. I didn't even realize I was. My body is rejecting this stupid game pretty hard. I'll tough it out and try to playthrough to the end.Theres only local-coop, which is stupid and useless. This might be my new ""worst diablo-clone"" game, right under Silverfall.			"

												The game looks quite nice, but that is it. I could not even make it to 90 minutes of play. It's just that bad. I played as the archer, though 90% of the time, I used her daggers. Mobs bum-rushing you makes the bow rather pointless. There seems to be little use for gold, except to buy health potions. It looked like I could get all the weapons and armor needed from drops. The two merchants I found had crap for sale. And the drops themselves made little sense. Five different sets of daggers had five different sets of stats - though the name of the daggers was exactly the same. Likewise with the training bow - same name, different stats. Armor had the most unispiring names I have seen in a game - ""blue leggings"", ""white leggings"", etc. Wow, I am excited to try all these colours! But wait, none of them actually changes the look of your character.Attacking is random and frustrating. At times I could hit the enemy with ease, and at other times, I had the cursor above the enemy and nothing was happening. Then suddenly, the game registered that I was doing something and I exploded with a huge strike, hitting every enemy around me. The AI is also pretty random. Most enemies will attack right away and, as other reviewers pointed out, from way off screen. Dwarves, however, seem to be particularly stupid. I could walk right up to them and they didn't notice me until I attacked. Finally, hilariously, I tried to attack spiders and dwarves from the opposite side of a gate from them. A gate with large gaps between the bars. My character turned to the side and shot arrows into thin air, never once aiming at the enemies. With that, I was done. Uninstalling and removing from my account. I wish to have no memory of this terrible game.			"

												R.A.W. isn't remotely interesting to anyone who has played pretty much any other action RPG out there. It's a poor man's Diablo/Torchlight. The graphics are realistic and actually look alright, but the environments are dull and uninteresting. The voice overs are pretty decent, by the way.Unfortunately, it brings nothing new to the table except for the possession ability. And even that's limited to some of the more powerful enemies, not just any enemy.I regret purchasing this. Instead of buying this one, I suggest you pick up Torchlight II or Diablo III. They're so much better in every way.[Rating: 61/100]			"

												I believe I got this game as part of a bundle at one point and never played it. Recently I was going through my games to see what I haven't played yet and I couldn't remember why I decided against downloading this game. So I gave it a shot...and then remembered why I hadn't wanted to play.The gameplay video on the page shows the player fighting off hordes of enemies. Just mob after mob, and that's pretty much all the gameplay it shows because that's all you're going to be doing. I know hack-and-slash games are really popular but I've been fairly indifferent towards them; I don't hate them but they're not my first choice for a game play experience. I've played Diabolo II and enjoyed it for a few weeks before the repetitiveness got to me.  I couldn't even spend an hour playing R.A.W. before I had to give up and just delete it from my computer.Not only is it pretty much just you fighting horde after horde of creatures, it's really buggy at the same time. You can click and click while making no progress and I found myself getting stuck in the middle of a large group and unable to move or fight so I ended up dying. And this is at the beginning of the game! There's nothing engaging or original about the story and the combat is more frustrating than anything. It's an exercise in futility and I am really glad that I didn't really buy the bundle for this game.			"

												I have no idea why I played this game for more than 10 minutes.Atmosphere:   4/10Gameplay:      2/10Story:             0/10Content/Price: 3/10Graphics:        4/10This game is the worst Diablo-Clone I've ever played. Dont buy it for money, except its in the Humble-Bundle for 99ct. Overall this is just very bad gamedesign or maybe they ran out of money or time. I probably played it for more than 10 minutes because I am an achievement-hunter (qq).Just some of my impressions:- incredibly boring and ultra predictable story- very bad loot- and gold-system- 60% of skills are useless- no character developement whatsoever- some of the graphic effects could have been made in paint- game bugs and bugged achievements- the only unique game mechanic that separates this from other games is absolutely overpowered			"

												The game looks quite nice, but that is it. I could not even make it to 90 minutes of play. It's just that bad. I played as the archer, though 90% of the time, I used her daggers. Mobs bum-rushing you makes the bow rather pointless. There seems to be little use for gold, except to buy health potions. It looked like I could get all the weapons and armor needed from drops. The two merchants I found had crap for sale. And the drops themselves made little sense. Five different sets of daggers had five different sets of stats - though the name of the daggers was exactly the same. Likewise with the training bow - same name, different stats. Armor had the most unispiring names I have seen in a game - ""blue leggings"", ""white leggings"", etc. Wow, I am excited to try all these colours! But wait, none of them actually changes the look of your character.Attacking is random and frustrating. At times I could hit the enemy with ease, and at other times, I had the cursor above the enemy and nothing was happening. Then suddenly, the game registered that I was doing something and I exploded with a huge strike, hitting every enemy around me. The AI is also pretty random. Most enemies will attack right away and, as other reviewers pointed out, from way off screen. Dwarves, however, seem to be particularly stupid. I could walk right up to them and they didn't notice me until I attacked. Finally, hilariously, I tried to attack spiders and dwarves from the opposite side of a gate from them. A gate with large gaps between the bars. My character turned to the side and shot arrows into thin air, never once aiming at the enemies. With that, I was done. Uninstalling and removing from my account. I wish to have no memory of this terrible game.			"

												It's an alright game. I snagged it when it was released for Humble Bundle and gave it a whirl this weekend. Not a bad game, but nothing really to write home about.The Good:+Gameplay: The mechanics of the game are really, really simple. Click, shoot, kill. Much like diablo. Easy abilities, common sense tree, not too many glitches, you move fast, etc.+Feel: It's a very easy game to just get into. Doesn't really require a tutorial, but it gives you a quick and dirty one right at the beginning. +Voice Acting: It isn't amazing, but it isn't that bad. The voice actors are about average and makes the game a bit more enjoyable. Although, the premise of the game has been done to death.The Bad:-Dumb-dumb AI: This game, on normal at least, is stupid easy. They run at you in a straight line, no matter where they are. If you're behind a wall, they will run into the wall at you. So, killing them is boring. If you're a rogue, set down a trap, slow them, shoot in a straight line until they're all dead. Really basic, nothing special, all of the enemies are like this. Even the bosses.-Kinda Dumb Premise: So, I don't really see a reason to finish this game. Nothing special, I don't expect a rewarding ending and the premise is standard. Four nations, must go to all four, unlock stuff, fight bosses, get loot, no explanation as to why you're the chosen one, etc. Same BS, different game. Not worth finishing.Overall:If you really sit down and just burn through this game you can finish it in a day or a weekend. It's not hard, and its not really that fun. I mean, its alright game to burn some time. It's not horrible and if you're just looking for a time waster, play it. It's enjoyable in that regard. But, if you're looking for a Diablo clone, go download Path of Exile (F2P) and just play that.			"

												It is exactly what you expect it to be.  Where it shines is the controls.  You actually control your character instead of pointing and clicking.  Much like Diablo 3, R.A.W suffers from it's genre more then it's quality.  These games have not advanced in over 10 years and all the hype in the world isn't going to fix that.  When a game stands out for not being a point and click in 2013....you know the genre is dead.			"

The only negative thing I've found so far is that sometimes he runs into a completely wrong direction. But that's just a minor thing.All in all I recommend it for quick casual gaming.			"

												Don't let some of the lower review scores of this game fool you. It is not clunky or poorly done, it is very smooth and has good production value and very nice graphics. It got low scores because it is a bit basic compared to games like Diablo 3 and Van Helsing, but it is still a fun action game nonetheless. IGN, who are my fav review site on the net and I normally agree with them, gave this a 5.5 which I highly disagree with. I feel sorry for whomever was playing it because he said that you die a lot in this game. He must suck bad at video games because that isn't true at all. I've died maybe twice so far and I have been playing a while with my mage (lvl 19 so far). And when I died it was avoidable. I was just being lazy. 5.5 is a very unfair score for this game.Despite its basic console game feel, this game is well done graphically and gameplay-wise and can be a lot of fun. The classes (mage, warrior, thief) are all fun to play and have cool fun skills. My favorite things about the game are its graphics and the ultra smooth gameplay. It has really well done smooth graphics and good sound. Not having a block or dodge sucks, but otherwise It feels really smooth and easy to play because it has a great game engine. And besides, you will have enough healing potions plus you can put points into a rechargable self-heal skill that is a must-have. This game sorta reminds me of Van Helsing in how it feels, but even smoother, and for this game I use my wired xbox 360 controller which is highly recommended because it is designed for a controller.It's a fun game and well worth what I paid for it because of how incredibly smooth it plays and how good the graphics imo are, 7/10			"

												Started the game, followed the first quest, got swarmed by over 30 creatures, got told to reach a portal, creatures won't let me move, died. Before that I clicked on enemies that don't hihglight or show their names, so it's pretty much guessing if you actually target an enemy or just the ground. The presentation is really lackluster as well. It's brown and really not pretty. There's just not much to this game that other games do way better. It might be worth a look if you're really desperate and have nothing else to play, but I highly recommend you have another look at your library before you play this title.			"

												They understand that hack and slash should be a basig horde game where a ridiculous amount of enimies are coming at you. Problem being my basic level 1 spell has an AOE effect that on most cases one shots everything, on top of that its also  interrupts attacks and spells so you can kill a boss without getting hit once. At level 3 I lost complete interest in the game because all attacks I had had a knockback effect as well. I dont see this being an entertaining game at all.			"

												After getting this in a Humble Bundle, I figured I'd give it a try despite it's bad reviews... I should have listened. I can usually find the good in a game, even one most people think is nothing but crap, outside one or two things, there are too many bad poaints here to warrent anything but a negative review.While the gameplay itself is your basic hack-n-slash, the controls are a mess, even with a controller; potions bound to the triggers, item pick-ups with the R. Shoulder and the d-pad used **only** for menu navigation?? Horridly stupid. Even the KB/M setup is difficult to use effectivly. You;re supposed to have 2 ""skills setups"" but switching is often not even necessary. You;re also limted to gaining only **ONE** level per stage, so grinding so you can overpower the enemies/boss of the next stage? Never. Gonna. Happen. Takes almost all of the fun out of exploring the map. Why bother killing everything in a stage when after a point it nets me no rewards aside from gear that I probably won't use?The story is OK, if a big cliche. There is almost no distinction between the 3 characters and the respawn system is just annoying (needing a special item JUST to respawn at a checkpoint?!). That's not to say it isn't playable, just that whomever came up with some of the mechanics here needs to rethink their choices. The fixed top-down camera used here is also a problem, as environmental elements will often get in the way of seeing things like chests and sometimes enemies. There's also no mini-map, so you're stuck looking for you quest goals (marked by a sometimes nearly invisible symbol about it) with nothing but an arrow you can make appear around your character.If you're looking for a decent top-down hack-n-slash game, go buy Van Helsing and support a game that gives you a good challenege, great writing/voice acting and far better visuals and gameplay that what you'll find here. Plus the devs of Van Helsing actually read the forums and listen to our suggestings and bug reports.			"

												The developers label R.A.W. as an action-RPG when in actuality it more resembles classic hack n’ slashers like Baulder’s Gate and Gauntlet. But a game like Gauntlet is no fun with broken multiplayer, and abysmal difficulty. There’s no apparent way to set the game up for online or couch co-op. And the enemies are so painfully easy that the games notion of difficulty is spawning them en masse.There is a rather entertaining gimmick of taking control of the stronger unique enemies, but it’s used so infrequently that it is hardly worth noting.Further, broken achievements with no fix in sight due to developers abandoning the game.If you’re looking for (reportedly) 12-15 hours of game time in a mediocre excuse at an ARPG than look no further. But your money could easily be spent elsewhere on titles like Van Helsing, Diablo, etc, or not spend any money at all for Path of Exile. "

												It's a decent enough game for the genre. I always play it with a controller (as I do with all Hack & Slash games) & the controls are quite simple (I looked at the setup for mouse & keyboard & it reminded me of MOBA games--yes, MOBA games have more controls, but it just looked a bit similar). I definitely recommend using a controller & playing with a friend.To be honest, I had been looking for a game similar to Dark Alliance (console game), and I happened to have this in my library already (must've been from a Humble Bundle because I certainly don't remember buying this by itself). Overall, I had some fun. However, it fell short of what I was looking for (Dark Alliance was a much more enjoyable game--it should not have been cancelled). Pros:-Simple controls-Local Co-op-Decent gameplay-Decent story-2 Skill sets (easy to switch between them mid-combat)Cons: -No map-Frequently hard to see some incoming monsters-Leveling system (replaying any level gives you a miniscule amount of EXP, but the next level always levels you up then goes to being miniscule once you've gained one level)-Items are almost always useless (either not for your character or it's just weaker than what you already have--I had a set of armor from LVL 5 until I finally found stronger armor at LVL 25-28 (IDR the exact level, but a merchant had some way later) "

												Bland and repetitive.  I got this game only as part of a package that other games came in.  Otherwise, I wouldn't pay more than a couple bucks for it.I played on the top difficulty setting, and it really doesn't make the game ""difficult"".  The beginning is annoying because you get swarmed by immense amounts of enemies before you get crowd control abilities, but once you do, it's a piece of cake (even though they literally pop out of thin air which is a stupid spawn mechanic).The possession ability is keyed to wheel-click which is stupid.  A lot of mice don't even have good wheel clicking. Focus skills don't seem to work.  Leveling up is basically capped to one character level per game level.  You still gain experience, but it's not at the same pace as the first level you gain.  Story is dry and typical.  Game length is short.Outrightly plagarizes from other series such as Lord of the Rings with Legolas and Ents, and Baldur's Gate.All and all... meh out of 10.			"

												Not much in the way of a sense of quest or storyline, all very linear, very few options on how to play your chosen class, and the gear scaling seemed a bit poorly designed.Gameplay was also very humdrum - click, click, click, click, click. Go somewhere else. Click, click, click, click... etc.I got the impression that most of the game was in there because 'this type of game must have these features' rather than anyone wanting to put together an interesting addition to the genre.This is the type of game that makes me appreciate how much thought and effort has gone into games like Diablo and Titan Quest (which themselves are really just a lot of clicking, but also a whole lot more fun ;)Not worth £11.99, maybe buy if it's on sale and you're really bored and something makes you not want to pick up a cheap copy of Titan Quest.

												It's a meh Diablo clone. The talent trees are just not exciting enough. I don't even remember the story. And it just didn't grip me like other isometric dungeon crawlers. It just doesn't have...much. I honestly don't know what else to say about it.			"

												Got it in a Humble Bundle of course ^^.The few hours I have played this game have been great. Good graphics and good soundtrack. It does need a better story and its pretty much just a long run through the whole game and no sidequests. Well, there are sidequests but they go on the same route as the main ones...Pros- Graphics- SoundtrackCons- Okay story- No real sidequests			"

												Hello my fellow steam reviewers and review readers. This is my first review and I hope it will help you along as other reviews did for me!First things first, the game looks good. I like both, the style and the effects. Well I guess that's it with the good things. The first hour was fun. After that it became really boring. All you do is clicking the enemies dead. You spam your fireball and in the few cases the enemies would reach you, you will cast a second spell. That's it. That's the gameplay. Until lvl 10 you will have 3 offensive spells. You won't need them. Fireball and a poisencloud from time to time is more than enough. If you reach lvl 10 you will get another offensive spell. Nothing more to achieve. As you might noticed I played a mage. I can't tell if the other classes are more fun. Since it is told that the mage is the most vulnerable character I would assume, they are at least as boring as the mage. Let's talk about two other points that are very important talking about a Hack & Slay title: Loot: There is loot but everything is kind of waste. It's all the same in different colors. You will get something rare from time to time. But you don't feel any difference between the grey standard gear or the epic gear that will drop from time to time.The second point are the enemies. It might be the second worst part after the gameplay: it is always the same. Spiders everywhere. Two fireballs and they are dead. But there are lots of them.  I don't know why you design a game without a few different monsters. After two hours of game time I've seen about 6 to 8 different monsters. Some have more HP than the others, some have a gun and therefore a range attack. But it doesn't matter if you fight a skeleton, a dwarf or a red spider that throws fireballs. It remains the same. No differences in behavior - no challenge. It gets really boring and is nothing compared to other titles in this genre.Greetings, Wave "

												Haven't played for very long, i'll get around to playing it more, but not too bad atm. It would be better if they added like dungeons you can do in Co-Op, based around weekly, every week they'd change for excluse gear? And maybe you could do PvP? Just some suggestions to make this game better!			"

												I recommend you to buy the game only if it's on sale. The game is at most an average representant of the aRPG genre.A dull plot and poor mechanics make it a one hit title - you finished it once,you won't probably come back to it. The Diablo-clones are all about replayability,unfortunately this one doesn't have that thing keeping you grinding the monsters for hundreds of hours.			"

												This game is straight garbage and boasts a laughable price point of $15 at the time of this review. I'm not sure there was anything I liked about playing it. Graphics, control, general gameplay all were severly lacking even for 4 years ago. I could only handle a brief stint before I completely gave up. Overall just a poor excuse for an ARPG. If you insist to trying it make sure you get it at a sizeable discount.			"

												So far, I've found RAW to be, overall, pretty darn good and quite fun indeed. It may not be the next Diablo, but so what? It's still very enjoyable! In my opoinion, the experience is much better with a controller (I use an Xbox 360), movement is smooth and combat responsive in a way the keyboard & mouse can't quite match. This is definitely an action-oriented game, not a more literary or strategy-minded RPG - and that's one of the things I like about it. Sometimes you just want to bash hell out of stuff! The graphics are better than many of the other reviews here indicate, but anyway these days the graphical presentation of any one game is such an incredibly subjective thing that as long as a game runs smooth visually, that's what is really important. And RAW does. The environments are detailed, the atmosphere is well-crafted, and the overall look of the world is consistent. Oh, and the lighting is very nicely done as well! I've really enjoyed my time with it thus far, and will continue to do so, I'm sure.  -XT			"

The genre makes it somewhat playable.I have now finished it but will say no thanks to finishing the 25 mission long campaign on 3 heroes for 100% achievement completion.Edit: Finished in co-op mostly.

												What a strange game. It's quite fun but it's so simple, yet it comes away with it. It's a ""diablo clone"" so to speak but has crazy amount of mobs at once.It's extremely linear,  got a few bad quests and level design combinations, leveling and xp is strangely balanced (almost impossible to grind). Hard is hard, unless you play the OP Wizard (fireballs!!). Soul stones is a nice enough idea i guess too, enabling you to go Game Over, rare as default in this kind of game.But they put alot of effort into story and skills though and fighting big mob packs.

Don't say I don't like it because I am a COD fanboy check my profile I don't own any of the ♥♥♥♥ing COD games. Second. They tried to make it big so we explore thats good right? How about ♥♥♥♥ing no. I have no urges to explore. When I play Oblivion I do.Third. You can't really change the weapons or customize. You can spam anything it was like Minecraft when it came with its first bow you could spam the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. And it became boring after awhile.Fourth. They didn't put any effort it isn't fun. So thats why some people hate it and don't. Some are serious gamers who don't want fun and some want fun. This is what they did. Lets make some quests don't care whether its fun or not I bet its going to be an awesome game so lets put this on a ♥♥♥♥ing high price.Five. Storyline. (Normally I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about storyline) So I just done a level and suddenly I am placed at some random island and four kings or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Were the developers on drugs?Don't buy this even if you think ""I always like stuff people don't like!"" sure do you like boring♥♥♥♥♥♥with no storyline spammy ♥♥♥♥♥tuff bows. Anyways I don't think theres alternate ways. You just run in shooting everything you see.Don't buy this unless its on a 80% sale and you are desperate enough for a game like this.It has a metascore of 39 and they don't show it on their steam page.

Posted: November 9, 2014
												Realms of Ancient War is an action/role-playing game with a strong affinity for hack ’n’ slash, developed by Wizarbox. At the beginning of the story, you must choose whether you are going to spend the game hurling fireballs and deadly spells at numerous foes as a Wizard, slowly ploughing your way through armies of enemies as a powerful Warrior, or utilise your endless skills of survival striking from the shadows as a Rogue. You are then presented with a quick run-through of recent events of the last few decades or so, and then are thrown head-first right into the action, slowly turning your character into an unstoppable whirlwind of fury, complete with a power pretty unique to Realms of Ancient War that allows you to take control of your enemy’s strongest units and turn them on their own.In the first impressions, Realms of Ancient War has obviously had a lot of time and energy invested into it for its graphics, which really shine through at points. The loading screens are actually some of the most pleasing to the eye and the scenery in the game tends to be very well-put-together. The magic spells especially, although only visible for a short time, look great and the scenery, again, is overall of a very high standard. The title has also managed to ensure that the dead bodies of your former opponents stay on the battlefield instead of evaporating as they tend to do in most other titles, which allows for an enhanced sense of satisfaction as you look around caves that are now marked with your handiwork. In contrast, the actual character design, which looks stunning in all of the artwork, is disappointing. You will certainly notice the main things about your character as they change throughout the game and you equip them with different coloured armor and weaponry, but on the most part all of the little details have seemingly been quickly brushed over, leading to an overall effect which just isn’t quite satisfactory, especially at higher levels where you look almost identical to how you did at the start.The combat in Realms of War almost certainly delivers on its promise of being a hack ’n’ slash as you work your way through innumerable enemies of different varieties, depending on where you are along the storyline. You will find yourself being ambushed by large amounts of enemies that don’t tend to have that much life at all. You can breeze through most of the game as long as you are careful as to where you run to so you don’t get blocked in, because once you are blocked in you will almost certainly be cut down by the horde which has beelined straight for you – a design you will very quickly be able to use to your advantage. Throw down a poison trap and walk backwards a few steps and it is guaranteed that whatever is running at you will completely disregard the danger and run straight into it. Running away is your number one and only form of defence, seeing as there is not a control for blocking or dodging at all.Wizard and Rogue classes allow you to use ranged attacks before you go charging in, and although they tend to look great and give you the upper hand in small skirmishes, more often than not you will find that any distance between you and your target has been closed down before you can manage more than a few shots. Luckily, as you grind through enemies you also grind up the levels and you will be given skill points to assign to different characteristics, such as increased ranged damage or an increased mana pool, which make these ranged moments a little more useful; but in the most part, the skill points you assign tend to actually do very little.Combat-wise, you will also come to grips with the soul gems. During each level, you are only assigned a certain amount, which are used to revive. Running out of soul gems means you are sent back to the start of the level, and it is not until late in the game where you will be given the opportunity to avoid using one. However, it definitely adds a twist to the game, which notches up the difficulty a little and makes the game a little tenser as your supply begins to dwindle.In addition, Realms of Ancient War has a less-than-gripping storyline, and you will rarely feel the compulsion to carry on playing like you do with other games of the same genre. The lore is vague, and the opening sequence of events that explains the recent history gives you very little idea into this world of warcraft and wizardry and the relationships between the four different sections of the continent, and you don’t really cover much more of this as you work your way through the game. Furthermore, the levels can be a little confusing to navigate at points, due to a strange choice of deciding not to include a map or mini-map; as well, directional arrows tend to point as the crow flies, but if you have some experience with these types of games then there should not be too much problem with finding your way around. The way the dead bodies remain on the floor will almost certainly signal to you that you have been there before.Finally, although the game lacks multiplayer, you can engage in a co-op campaign by connecting a few wireless controllers. This makes the game a lot more playable and does reduce the chances of your character getting mobbed by the throngs of creatures out for your heads. However, it is a little bit disheartening to find you cannot team up with somebody over the Internet, which would have made the game a lot more appealing in an era where almost every game has some form of online capability.In conclusion, Realms of War is a title that is on the lower side of average in the genre it exists in. Although the graphics are great from the menu screens and scenery, the characters just never seem to look that detailed or magnificent as you would want them to, and it contrasts greatly with the artwork displayed throughout. The combat system is very basic as it lacks a mini-map, blocking, and dodging; and you tend to spend your time in the middle of a sea of monsters. But to give credit where credit is due, it is still very enjoyable to hack your way through such a large opposition and come out the other end, and the brief moments of rampage as you take charge of some of the stronger units are definitely great fun. In terms of length, the game will take up a large chunk of time if you decide to play through all three campaigns, but it does lead to the question whether you will truly enjoy the game for that long.Only On Sale "

												i dont hate it but i dont like it either..... its just bland, average, generic, etc. . combat is ok but not enough variety to make it good. you can only have 4 spells binding which is ok for consoles but not ok for pc. combat is repetive so are enimies. the looting system, you forget that you have gear because they add nothing. i kept the same dagger the whole time i was playign till i quit and i never needed to change. never died, only used the gear i started with to exception i equiped to rings. i compared the new daggers if oudn with the ones i kept and dont really change much. attributes are non existent and only changed by gear so you only use your skill points for passive and active but they dont add anything exciting. its just an average arpg like everyone else said. glad i only got it for a dollar from the humble bundle.

												What I like about this game:+ graphics( very nice main character design, decent environment world design, antialiasing )+ good controls (I use XBOX 360 controller)+ character classes ( no dwarfs, or strange looking characters, subjective like here I agree :) )What I don't like:+ no map ( seriously... ). You do have a direction pointing arrow, but it's awkward to access it since you have to go to the menu first. The world is small so the existence of a map is debateable but still I think any RPG should have one. What I would like to see in the future (expansion/dlc/major update)+ beautiful enemy character design ( now it's kind of ugly)+ bigger maps to explore+ more side quests+ more abilities+ auto-target, at lest for the archer character ( when you're moving in a direction and you want to shoot in the opposite direction. Now you keep shooting in the running direction, not in the one that the enemy is chasing you)+ more classesOverall, I like the game, in my list I would give it an 8 score mark. Happy playing! :)			"

												I just recently got this game in the Humble Bundle.  If you don't already know what the Humble Bundle is, go to humblebundle.com RIGHT NOW.  It is amazing.  Anyways, I do really enjoy this game.RAW is a good game when you just want to relax and play some mindless hack and slash type of game.  It basically is a low budget Diablo III.  It probably isn't as fun as Diablo, but it is still entertaining.I really like top down RPG type games.  If you liked Baulders Gate: Dark Alliance, then this game should be right up your alley.  If you have some spare change, just pick up this game for the fun of it.  It is co-op but it is still fun just by yourself.My main gripe with this game is the combat system.  You hold your mouse button on an enemy and you have to follow your mouse with the enemy.  It doesnt work very well, but most of the time it gets the job done just fine.  But, if it is possible, play this game with a controller.  It feels much nicer and you can tell that this game was made to be played with a controller.The story is something to be forgotten, but that isn't why you would pick up RAW.  You would pick up this game if you want some fun hours killing thousands of monsters.  It can be a challenge sometimes, but that just makes it more fun! I would reccomend this game to others to play. 6.5/10			"

												This game was probly one of the worst Action Rpgs ive ever played... The combat was endless button mashing, no combos or anything out of the ordinary to make it intersting. Just the same taping of the same damn button i found it to be very dull combat wise. A lot of endless taping. The story line was by far the lamest thing ive ever seen. Mobs and sounds were over used. No voice acting. Music was not vibrant enough for the areas. Gear skins were horrible and basic, changes were very small in appearnce. Storylines per character didn't differ at all, so over all No replay value... So Why play more then once? Oh and Co-op split screen blows.. You can't save in Co-op and theres no online services. The only thing positive i will say is the graphics were ""fair"".			"

												I'm honestly not sure what to say. The combat gameplay is addictive, no doubt about that. The game lacks a variety of items, and enemies. They completely overcrowd the levels with tons of spiders running at you, like the assume you have some sort of arachnophobia. The lack of an option to change the resolution or set it fullscreen, is another factor that makes this game horrible. At times it feels like you can't even see what's going on. The interface is not laid out properly so at times your eyes scan the whole window to find what you want. I still compliment the developers for their efforts but if you really want a dungeon crawler, you can grab torchlight for exactly the same price.			"

Half hour -maybe less- into the game, and you know pretty much everyhing you need about the game. I used wizard the first playthrough, and dare I say spamming fireballs -the first skill set- is probably your main and only needed skill to last you to the end game. Completed wizard in 12hrs.

May still play other chars for achievements sake, and for atoning my mistake from starting this game in the first place.Verdict: not worth your time & money.			"

												This game is pretty fun for about 2 hours at a time. I play with a friend in local co-op mode with 360 controllers. I do like the fact that the game supports controllers and has the OSD for the buttons. There is just enough items, upgrades, and skill points to keep my intrest for a while. After a two hour session the game seems quite repetitive. Another aspect of the game that makes this relitively easy is the fact friendly fire will not hurt you.

												This is a rather basic action RPG, which I enjoyed playing with a gamepad (I have no idea how it plays with a keyboard and mouse.) The actions map very well to the controller, and auto targetting of ranged attacks avoids frustration. As a matter of fact, general combat and maneuvering are what kept me playing. If you need to have deep customizable builds on your action RPGs (e.g. Torchlight II), you may want to pass on this one. The skill trees do not allow for really varied builds and the random items are uninspired (yay, an item called 'purple hat' or 'orange chain mail' with minor bonuses to stats...)It seems that this game was designed to be played co-op, and in my opinion the Wizard is the most viable if playing solo. Still, you have to be very careful of the frequent ambushes of mobs that spawn out of nowhere, often surrounding your character. By the middle of the game I had configured a ""panic mode"" alternate set of skills just to handle these situations. The 'possession' mechanic adds some novelty, effectively allowing the character to change into a monster for a while. I wish it was explored as a general mechanic throughout the game, rather than used mostly in specific spots.Visually, I found the game to be satisfactory, with varied environments, and decent visual effects and animations. The background music did not draw my attention, for better or worse.To sum it up: I would recommend this for someone looking for a quick fix of action-RPG (mostly action) that can be played with a gamepad, preferably if it can be picked up on a sale.

Its worth buying on sale when it goes really cheap and will give a bit of intertainment.I find the enviromental graphics quite nice and appealing, nice landscapes/dungeons. And its not buggy or anything; just not well designed in some places (like no tooltips on items; you have to click on the item to have info show up in a section at the bottom). These missing UI features are a little anoying because they usualy aren't the most complex thing to code, but at the same time, they aren't bugs or issues.			"

												R.A.W is a very simplistic version of popular hack/slash action RPGS like Diablo. It's simple, the skills are nothing to get exicted about and the gamplay is literally click and kite as much as the game alows. Mobs will body block you resulting in some "" really? "" deaths. Cleared out a room to prepare for a elite or boss? The mobs will spawn behind you so hopefully you can hack/slash through those so they don't body block you while you kite the elite mob. What's the story? Oh right four guys got together and somehow three of them escaped easily while they tripped and left behind the fourth guy so he ended up traped in crystal. Don't worry though he's speaking to you telepathically randomly to inform you that "" Oh that's a dead end better go around into more mobs "" You have to fight through the other three realms to free him in the fourth. Enjoy your quest Hero. Joking aside I actually really enjoyed this game. It's simplicity and clunky game mechanics made it so I was always trying the kite huge mobs under the worst circumstances and I didn't have to spend hours reading up on skills or stats on armor in order to midmax. I just played it put on whatever upped my damage minimally. Buy it on sale. Worth the $3 and enjoy that every chest spawns a huge mob right on top of you!			"

												RAW dosen't deliver anything new or refreshing to the ARPG genre, but oddly enough it's slightly more entertaining than Diablo 3 despite both are made for console usage. Technically you just got all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ things removed in RAW, which killed Diablo 3, particulary being equipment and ""rubberbanding"".From the aspect of playing a Warrior, then he's pretty basic. Limited range, but very destructive melee and it's sort of delightful using a first skill capable of ""vortexing"" units and then blast them out again.RAW is a 2nd hand game, so don't expect epic sounds and graphics. It's just decent and it's ok to my opinion. The story is sadly a bit short, so wait until you see a savings running on this game...being the reason I noticed it :P			"

												It's a decent game.  Graphics are decent, sound is pretty good (along the lines of Bard's Tale), but game play is barely more than clicking.  Once in a while when the forces grow large you need to plan out your assault; otherwise hack and slash to your hearts content.  Making money is easy enough and the rewards (coins, armor, weapons) are OK.Edited 11-11-2014So...I'm several more hours invested and now feel I should update my opinion of the graphics.  Really a nice job overall with seemless loading transistions. detailed characters and environments, and good variety of all of it.  I have experienced zero glitchiness of any kind.  If there is a down side it has to be in the shortish/small levels as a general rule.  The story also improves over the course of the game with an interesting twist at the mid-point.This interface has lot more potential than is being taken advantage of for this game.  I like their short skill trees as it stands for the level of current character/level development.  It provides for some decision  making without being a hassle for the casual gamer and does impact the performance of the chosen toon.  The variety of objects within the game is excessive and uneccessary however.  Too many items that will never be used for anything but selling for coin.  This game does a nice job of being playable in both short and epic sessions.			"

												I'm honestly not sure what to say. The combat gameplay is addictive, no doubt about that. The game lacks a variety of items, and enemies. They completely overcrowd the levels with tons of spiders running at you, like the assume you have some sort of arachnophobia. The lack of an option to change the resolution or set it fullscreen, is another factor that makes this game horrible. At times it feels like you can't even see what's going on. The interface is not laid out properly so at times your eyes scan the whole window to find what you want. I still compliment the developers for their efforts but if you really want a dungeon crawler, you can grab torchlight for exactly the same price.			"

												As much as I like Hack & Slash RPGs, I'm not fond of this one. Why?+++Pros++++Tries to be unique with the soulstone system & different stages.---Cons----Nonexistant character customization.-Can't allocate stat points for every level.-Limited choice of skills.-Can't level up more than once per stage. This is my biggest flaw, because games like these are about gaining exp and leveling to get stronger and better gear.-Got boring kind of quickly (hence my limited hours of play).It's a hack & slash, but far too boring and removes a lot of the fun that other series like Torchlight & Diablo had for them. If you're a fan of this genre, I say skip this title.			"

												In a world where we have lots of isometric games (some like to call them Diablo clones) R.A.W. is just another blade of grass in the lawn. It's not bad, but it's not good either. It has nothing that sets it apart. Oh so you can possess SOME enemies, but that's it. Coupled with it's multiplayer being LOCAL only really drops making it worth buying. Maybe back when I was a console player and saw it on XBOX Arcade I should've picked it up, probably would have been worth it then. Now though... it's a NO.			"

												I just finished the game for the first time.  I really enjoyed this game.  It comes down to what you are looking for.  I was looking for a fun hack'n'slash style game with rpg elements.  There is a ton of loot to collect and I almost always had some awesome piece of armor or an amazing weapon that I was waiting to be able to use in my inventory.  This makes you want to level up more so you can use the equipment you've been gathering.  The skills are really fun too!  Other reviews stated that there is no real strategy, just mashing buttons.  For me, I would disagree.  There is some strategy here, but not so much as to frustrate you.  Overall, I really enjoyed the game and look forward to another playthrough with a different character.

												Buy? Unlikely. (Note, I played as the Mage) It's a Gauntlet Legends style game with the appearance of a Diablo Clone. It's an Xbox title and oddly enough, works better with a controller. With that, you have less keys for skills, so you're often running and kiting enemies to stay alive and spamming your main attack for kills. The first major AoE attack for the mage has a long cooldown, and isn't reliable for dealing with the large hordes thrown at you at a regular basis. This game would have benefitted from having a twin stick shooter controller setup that would allow you to simultaneously move and shoot. Instead, you're endlessly kiting groups, stopping to shoot for a a second, and then repeating that process. You also have enemies that shoot deadly, multi-way projectiles, which wouldn't be a problem if you had a dodge button or a better control scheme to deal with it - you're constantly running, leaving you less time to deal damage, since you don't have alot of strong spells where you can sit in a group of enemies like other Diablo clones. The game might get better further into it, you get the ability to possess big, tanky creatures - but even the first one I possessed became surrounded and I was stuck in a flood of enemies. R.A.W. Might be more bearable with a 2nd player, but there are many better games of this type out there. It's a shame, I like the art style and music here.			"

												Realms of Ancient War is worth its price tag for one main reason; it's an ARPG like Diablo, but it has controller support.  That may seem inconsequential, but if it were, then why is Diablo III ported to the consoles?  If that in-and-of itself doesn't convince you, I don't think this is your type of game.  I played D3 at my desk, but sometimes it's nice to chill on the couch.  If you're in the console/controller/couch mood at the same time as being in the Diablo mood, this isn't bad.  There's little-to-no voice acting and the story is totally forgettable, but the action is solid.  I pre-ordered it after playing the demo and I wasn't disappointed.  For its specific niche, I might also recommend Dungeon Siege 3, which is fully voice acted, has couch co-op, and has very nice graphics.			"

Half hour -maybe less- into the game, and you know pretty much everyhing you need about the game. I used wizard the first playthrough, and dare I say spamming fireballs -the first skill set- is probably your main and only needed skill to last you to the end game. Completed wizard in 12hrs. I'm guessing it'll take 4~7hrs for speed run. May still play other chars for achievements sake, and for atoning my mistake from starting this game in the first place.Verdict: not worth your time & money.			"

												This game is pretty fun for about 2 hours at a time. I play with a friend in local co-op mode with 360 controllers. I do like the fact that the game supports controllers and has the OSD for the buttons. There is just enough items, upgrades, and skill points to keep my intrest for a while. After a two hour session the game seems quite repetitive. Another aspect of the game that makes this relitively easy is the fact friendly fire will not hurt you. I bought this game on Humble Bundle in a pack with others for cheap. I would not recommend paying full price for this.			"

												This is a rather basic action RPG, which I enjoyed playing with a gamepad (I have no idea how it plays with a keyboard and mouse.) The actions map very well to the controller, and auto targetting of ranged attacks avoids frustration. As a matter of fact, general combat and maneuvering are what kept me playing. If you need to have deep customizable builds on your action RPGs (e.g. Torchlight II), you may want to pass on this one. The skill trees do not allow for really varied builds and the random items are uninspired (yay, an item called 'purple hat' or 'orange chain mail' with minor bonuses to stats...)It seems that this game was designed to be played co-op, and in my opinion the Wizard is the most viable if playing solo. Still, you have to be very careful of the frequent ambushes of mobs that spawn out of nowhere, often surrounding your character. By the middle of the game I had configured a ""panic mode"" alternate set of skills just to handle these situations. The 'possession' mechanic adds some novelty, effectively allowing the character to change into a monster for a while. I wish it was explored as a general mechanic throughout the game, rather than used mostly in specific spots.Visually, I found the game to be satisfactory, with varied environments, and decent visual effects and animations. The background music did not draw my attention, for better or worse.To sum it up: I would recommend this for someone looking for a quick fix of action-RPG (mostly action) that can be played with a gamepad, preferably if it can be picked up on a sale.

												Copyinh games like the Diablo franchise or Torchlight, Realms of Ancient War is an old school hack and slash dungeon crawler with very limited depth and breadth that is hard to overlook even tough it isn't a triple-A title. The story in the game is not the worst we've seen so far, in all honesty it's fairly interesting and one of the stronger points of the game. The game starts years after the so called Ancient War which divided the land to 4 territories (East, West, South and North...duh, imagination at it's best). The Northern King proposed truce so he invited the remaining kings to the Hero's Garden. Something went wrong because the Northern King was never to be seen again and the rest of the kings became soulless zombies. Yes, clichés after clichés, but it's not all that bad. The game contains some witty dialogues and turns.We can pick from 3 unnamed characters: wizard, warrior and rogue. Each have different styles but they aren't that different that any would change the gameplay significantly. Each class has it's own skill tree, where you can level up your attacks. There are 1 level and 3 level skills. Skills open up gradually. The first group right after the beginning of the game, the second after you reach lvl 10, the last after lvl 20. However, there are two problems related to your skill management. First, in every stage you can gain exactly one level. No matter how much you fight or how many side quest (there aren't that many) you complete. You can only get 1 skill point in each stage. That makes the whole level grinding procedure useless and dropping all the challenge. You will get your skill point no matter what. The second problem comes with the use of your skills. You have only 4 skills at your use at a given time. Two of them are to be activated with the mouse and two with keystrokes on the keyboard. You can program these skills to the aforementioned buttons. If you want to use other skills you have to use the alternative set. Essentially you have 2 sets of skills, which can be changed at any time with a button push. Easy enough, in theory at least. Practice is a different beast. Remembering which skill you have assigned to which button in which set is pointless, painful and horrible. When a dozens of foes are attacking you there is no way this system can be use properly. Using this method is understandable on consoles where there are limited buttons to use, but on a PC it's unacceptable. This is where you realize that 4 skills/attacks are well enough to complete the game. At least the fighting and hack'n slashing is exciting. You are continuously attacked by tens of enemies, making the game challenging and intense. Sometimes it is hard to hit smaller enemies, like spiders which live everywhere, rain forests or volcanoes it doesn't matter for them. Graphically the game doesn't excel, but it's not bad either. For an XBLA title it's passable. Not are the audio tracks though. Audio effects are horrible and repeating. Listening to the same 3 grindings throughout 8-10 hours when you hit enemies is annoying. The music is on par with the rest of the audio. You get one passable song which plays when you start the game, the rest of the music tracks during gameplay are just pointless burrs.R.A.W. is a below average hack and slash game that tries to build upon it's great predecessors of the genre but fails in every possible way. It's chaotic, mediocre and boring. A game that is hard to recommend when you can get a dozen of it's kind cheaper (or even for free). If you can finish it once there is no point starting the game ever again. "

												RAW is a budget game with all pros and cons. I'd recommend it for fans of hack and slash RPGs who have finished all other games from this genre and are desperate to play some more. The others should probably look up for the better games first. Torchlight or The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing are examples of the better games.There are bugs in this game. The first occurred when I tried to load a save file. The game froze. What's more, the game sometimes doesn't recognize pressed buttons, thanks to which your character won't use his/her special ability or drink health/mana potion. My character couldn't continue his journey to the next room because of a bug, so I had to restart the level. However, the biggest problem I had with the game is that it won't save your position in the level. So when you quit the game and want to come back to it later, you have to start from the beginning of the level. And yes, the enemies respawns. I also don't like that the game saves my progress only on checkpoints instead of anytime I wish(like in Van Helsing or Torchlight). On the other side, the combat is good. I've chosen warrior class and was happy to see how enemies flew away from me whenever I hit them. I felt like a true hero, an unstoppable force who can slay enemies by dozens. The beginning of the game was a bit hard and boring, but after unlocking some powerful skills which could heal me and kill many enemies at the same time, the game began to be fun. The graphics is also good, in my opinion. As for the soundtrack, it does good job to enhance the grim atmosphere of the game.Beside the warrior class, there are two other classes that you can play- mage and rogue. There are also a few side quests you can complete. The story isn't bad, but I think it's role is something that will motivate you to go further, not something that you will remember.			"
