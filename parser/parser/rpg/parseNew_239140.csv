												Glad to see the misinformed reviews have been thrown out of from the top page. For those who have said that Dying Light's day/night mechanic is not what they thought and that time doesn't actually change in the game clearly haven't played past the intro missions. The first two missions are obviously there to get you started, so they're not going to thrust a timed day/night cycle before you get the hang of the environment and the mechanics, and thus in the intro missions, time does not change if you don't progress the quest. Past those two missions, day/night becomes very real, and incredibly terrifying. /endRantGameplay:I'm sure it's been said before, but this is what Dead Island should have been. Everything from the parkour to the combat just feels incredibly fluid. Running around is great fun, and jumping into abandoned houses and exploring/finding loot is constantly fun. And this is where I got caught in my first night phase. I was running towards my objective when ""oh look another shelter, let me go secure it,"" then ""oh look there's an air drop nearby, let me go grab it,"" then again another shelter nearby, on top of random houses and zombies (sorry, ""biters"") to loot, and before I knew it, I got my last radio call telling me I should get to a shelter quick (mind you, the Tower warns runners a few times before nightfall to get home, but I just have to keep scrounging for loot). I checked my map and realized I was pretty damn far from the closest shelter, so I just booked it. This is where freerunning gets exciting. With how seemless and smooth it is to run around/through buildings and across rooftops, the run to my shelter didn't feel annoying or like a chore, but more like a challenge to find the smoothest route (very similar to Mirror's Edge). Long story short, night fell, I♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants and crouched my way from rooftop to rooftop, listening to the horrifying screams of the nighttime biters as I eased my way into my little shelter. I've since tried to go out at night and see if I can tackle a nighttime bonus objective of a quest, and I can tell you, as of right now, I am definitely not prepared... but I'm damn excited to finally face the challenge.+ Fluid, seemless parkour+ Combat is fun+ Enemy AI is surprisingly smart+ Terrifying and exciting night cycle+ Scavanging every nook and cranny for lootCharacters:Some characters are well-performed while others just aren't. Gazi's performance, in my opinion, is laughably bad, but I began to think that it may have been intentional? And Rahim... he must have played a lot of Jak and Daxter back in the day, all he needs to do is dye his hair yellow. Brecken, Jade and Lena are among my favorite so far, with Lena reminding me a lot of Cassandra from DA:Inquisition with her hair and accent. Overall, characters are decent, and that's all that really needs to be said, so far at least.+ Some interesting characters- Some poor performancesTechnical:Graphics are gorgeous, and surprisingly undemanding even on my single GTX 970 with everything cranked to max and at 1920x1080. Though many report a huge framerate difference by changing the View Distance option, I can barely see much of a difference in-game with that option set to half or max. The only issue I've noticed is that very very rarely, when you're fighting biters with melee weapons, the game randomly hitches, then continues normally. It only happens in combat, but not often enough to be annoying and that might just be my system. Overall, everything looks great, and the graphics and effects are wonderful. For an ugly game, the visuals are surprisingly beautiful.Sound:Music is great, but my only comment is that the music that plays when you're outside has one part where a random singer begins to chant, and I swear it scares the crap out of me every time. Bashing biters with blunt weapons sounds very satisfying, and you can tell when you've hit the right spot, while hitting the chest is usually a muffled thump. I've yet to get a gun though (I've spent a lot of time just wandering around so I'm not too far into the campaign) so I can't comment on that. Also, make a little bit more noise and you'll hear bone-chilling screams in the distance of the more agile biters coming to get you. Very satisfying sound work overall.Story:I haven't gotten far into the story so I'll hold off until I've completed it to fill this section.I basically wanted to come out and say how much I'm enjoying this game and to tell people to ignore the false statements about this game and give it a try. If you liked Dead Island, you'll like this game. If you hated Dead Island, you'll like this game. If you're a fan of first person, open-world games, then I'd bet you'll like this game.			"

												This is a great game. How often have I not decided to go do this quest a few hours before sundown thinking ""plenty of time"" only on the way to the objective I stumble on some other stuff to do, like this dude that wants help retrieving his fishing rod or something. *Looks at sun* ""sure I can do that, plenty of time still"". Then only 5 minutes before night, I complete the mission and reallize how close to evil night I am. Frantically begin sprinting and parkouring for the nearest safehouse. On the way I find a police van practically unguarded! Knowing how good the loot can get in these police vans I just gotta open it and get the goodies. After all it could be rifle ammo, or a new shiny weapon! Im usually not more than a minute or so picking the lock. Done looting, but oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's almost 20:00, my watch is beeping, night is coming now! A few hundred yeards from the safehouse still it's too late, monsters emerges and I need to slow down and try to stealth my way back. Jumping over a fence I dump down practically in front of a dreaded volatile. Knowing it can rip me to shreds in seconds I flash my ultra violet lamp in it's general direction and decide to beeline straight for the safehouse. Several horrible grows tearing the silence behind me and action music fills my veins with adrenaline as I sprint for my life. From the growls I gather that several volatiles have joined in the hunt. Jumping down into a shallow wide crevice with a cracked concret pipe running in the middle I quickly slip into the pipe and crouch down in the corner hoping no one saw me go in. The monsters are shambling around on the outside with the distinct sound of them breathing. Sounds like air being sucked through shredded meat. But I think they don't know where I am. Then glorious ""pursuit evaded"" message appears. Phew. I now pay attention to the search cones on the minimap and successfully sneaks back to the tower.			"

												Lemme give it to y'all straight, who are on the fence;- Yes, the game is very much worth it at full price.- One of the first games in a long while, that has kept me up until 5 A.M. in the morning, because of how lost I get myself into it.- Doesn't do dumb jump scares, save for a VERY FEW TIMES, and each one counted.- The game is maybe one of the best zombie based games out there, so long as you do enjoy it with action.- Parkour in the game is AMAZING. Sometimes I like just playing the game, so I can runaround, across roof tops, and attacking zombies while talking to friends.- Co-op in story mode. Freaking amazing. No dumb lobby. Just click 'Join game' and bam,you'll be thrown a few feet away from a friend without them sometimes even noticing you joined!- Single play and Co-op have a huge impact; co-op feels fun, slightly safer, and adds a lot in the form of friendly rivals! Single player feels way more tense and everything you do counts, making you second guess some choices, for fear or death. Night time in either mode is fun as heck, though four co-op makes it pretty easy.- Night and Day feel almost like two different modes. In the day, zombies shuffle around, falling off rooftops, being dumb, easy to avoid and kill. Night time? Get those UV Flares ready, and be ready to flee if they catch sight of you.- Even after beating the story, I keep coming back for more, as it's super fun.- Took me around 30 hours to do the story, which also included only HALF of the side missions. Still got a little over 50% left to go, and looking forward to it!TL;DR - Get the game, find friends to play with, enjoy the hell out of one of the few games worth it at full price.			"

Dying LightNote: Each field is weighted differently, and thus affects the overall score differently.  Field Rating Review   Graphics 9 A pretty game to look at for sure, though it suffers with some animations on the part of NPC humans, particularly when they are speaking. The environment is very well put together, and the general ambience of the game, especially at night, is fantastic.   Gameplay 10 I have never played a game that offered such satisfying zombie smashing. On top of that, you have a variety of ways to dispatch of the zombies.  The sound design is incredibly well done (save for the voice-acting, it is average at best), every smack of a weapon against a zombie is satisfying and has some weight behind it. Also notable is the parkour system in place in the game; It is extremely well executed, and gives an incredible sense of freedom to go where you want, and do what you want. The weapon system is reminiscent of Dead Island's, though gathering parts feels much more intuitive now. Missions feel varied enough that they don't come across as just ""fetching"" quests. They even serve to push you out of your comfort zone and into the dreaded night.   Story 7 A zombie game that calls zombies exactly that, for once. The story in Dying Light isn't anything spectacular, but it has enough interesting moments to keep you moving forward, wanting to know how things will turn out. Again though, this is a zombie game, so don't be expecting Shakespeare.   Multiplayer 9 Easily join up with four friends for some co-op fun which allows you to play the entire game together, main quests and all. Though frustrating at times that you must have EVERY player in the vicinity to start a mission, or even have dialogue with an NPC, the frustration is quickly forgotten as you get back to bashing zombie's heads in. Occasional co-op competitive events show up as you travel around the map, challenging you to beat your friends at killing the most zombies, finding the most loot, saving survivors, or racing to an objective. An absolutely hilarious blast of a game to play with your buddies. Note: I have not yet played ""Be the Zombie"" mode (5-players allowed, instead of just 4), so I will update this review when I have the chance to try it out.   Replayability 8 I thought that perhaps I would get tired of bashing zombie's skulls in, and jumping around the world. I have found myself to be pleasantly wrong in both regards. Dying Light executes these two mechanics so fantastically that I find myself constantly drawn to it, especially when friends are able to hop in-game with me. Though I can see the missions becoming burdensome and tiring after having done them a few times.   Overall 9.1/10 Of all the zombie games out there, Dying Light is number one on my recommended list. A well polished, extremely fun game by yourself, throw some friends into the mix and you have a winner. If you enjoy zombie games in the slightest, or even if you don't, give this game a whirl. Thanks to Dying Light, I find myself bummed out when I play other games that I cannot jump and climb so freely. You know something has been executed well when you find yourself wishing it was in every other game you played.

												Imagine if Dead Island wasn't a wonky,  glitch-filled mess. Imagine you could freerun, go anywhere, do anything, meet weird people, and occasionally judo throw a zombie off a roof.

												I've never been one for zombie games but this game changed my mind!  Below is a review of the single-player campaign (I don't play multiplayer so can't comment on these elements).  Hope it helps you. :)What is it?Dying Light is a superb open-world game (a mix of survival, first-person action and RPG) where the citizens of Harran (a fictional place in Turkey) are becoming infected with a rabies-related virus.  Your task (as protagonist Kyle Crane) is to locate research regarding a cure on behalf of the Global Relief Effort.  You join a garrisoned band of survivors in Harran and take on the role of one of their 'runners' (people who carry out the dangerous work of gathering supplies and carrying out other requests on behalf of survivors) as a guise while you try to infiltrate and locate a wanted man and some vital data.The game's large, open-world environments are incredible - set in the slums of Harran and (later) Old Town - both locations offering a different style of parkour.  Your movement will be a mix of running, jumping, using a grapple hook or sliding down cables.  Oh, and the odd swim!  The parkour is fluid, easy and not over-fantasised (it is not beyond imagining that a fit and strong man could perform the moves the game offers).  The campaign itself is of good length and enjoyable, and there is a wealth of optional side missions and challenges to complete.The game is divided into two scenarios: day and night.  By day, the infected and 'virals' roam the streets aimlessly (often in huge numbers) but don't present too much of a danger provided you keep to rooftops and higher areas.  At night though, everything becomes much more sinister!  Not only are the infected out in greater number, but a darker, almost indestructable breed of the infected comes out for the hunt.  They're stronger than you, faster than you, and would like dinner with you (you as the main course).  There is no other recourse but to stay indoors and sleep until daybreak, or dare to go out and use stealth and speed as best you can.  It's worth it because you'll get double experience points, but you might not last too long.  You have been warned!Weapons and upgradesThe game uses three large sets of upgrade paths for Crane: survivor, agility and power. You'll earn upgrades by gathering experience points in each of these three areas.  The weapon system is wonderful.  At first, you have nothing but bits of wood, table legs, the odd wrench here and there - with which to pummel the infected until they die.  But as your survivor experience points ramp up, so does the quality and power of  the available weapons and it won't be long before you're one-shot-killing the bulk of infected people.  Weapons can be upgraded with enhancements and buffs as you collect them, but they don't last forever.  You can repair a worn-out weapon only so many times before you must find or buy another in Harran.DifficultyFor more skilled players, a HARD mode has been added.  Good luck with that!  For the rest of us, I would say the difficulty is at medium level when playing on 'normal'.  You'll be in for some fights and reliance on parkour from the start, but nothing feels unachievable.  There will be enemies that at first will be too tough to confront head-on, but nothing is beyond reach.    At first, I tended to cling to roof tops and would become easily overwhelmed by the infected if I found myself in the middle of a street, but I didn't have to wait until too long before I was easily able to defend myself and reap all the resources infected bodies still carry once killed.  The only element of the game I didn't enjoy difficulty-wise was the small number of speed challenges (same sort of thing as the speed challenges in Assassin's Creed) but these are totally optional and nothing is lost for any player who prefers not to complete them.  The parkour is really nicely done - it's easy to imagine that it's real-world achievable for a fit and strong person without being beyond realism (no silly platformer manoeuvres here).  As for choice of controller, I actually found mouse and keyboard much easier for the parkour than my XBox 360 gamepad.  Both are supported and hot-switchable but I found Kb/M more accurate.  Overall, gameplay felt fluid and fun, with very few frustrating moments throughout the game.Game quality and lengthI have not yet seen a game world that is more detailed than this.  It's clear the designers absolutely loved what they were doing (the level of detail in even the least consequential things is astonishing).  The dust and particle effects are stunning.  The voice-acting of Crane is absolutely first-class and really gives personality to the protagonist.  I didn't feel many of the NPC characters were quite so strong, but they weren't bad either.  It took me over 100 hours to complete the game, but on average I take twice as long as the average gamer, so expect at least 50 hours of gameplay.  The story was enjoyable without being too predictable (a few twists and turns along the way) and it has left me wanting to replay the game.Performance-wise, I only had problems with one area towards the end where framerates dropped and grass polygons were no longer rendering correctly.  Out of 100 hours, that was about 10 minutes of gameplay, but I'm running the game with a 6Gb nvidia Titan Black on a new 6-core i7, so there is a good chance there will be the same or similar problems on anything less than that (caveat: I did ramp up every single setting in the game) so you might need to dial back some things, but frankly, no matter what level of settings you use, you will still be impressed by the graphics.Anything not to like?While the side missions were varied and fun, I didn't much like the speed challenges as they really didn't fit well with the story and were a tad too difficult for bad gamers like me!  Sometimes, 'trap' zombies were placed purposely behind closed doors with no chance for the player to take avoiding action, resulting in immediate death; death isn't a huge problem (you'll just lose a chunk of experience points) but it felt a bit unnecessary to put these deliberate traps in the game.  Finally, there is a big announcement on-screen about being about to embark on the final part of the game (it's really just to tell you that while the game will end you will still be able to finish off other missions and such).  This totally broke the immersion for me (I would rather the game just flowed into that final sequence) but it's a petty thing really, demonstrating that there really isn't much to dislike about the game at all.ConclusionDying Light is an incredible game.  Single-players are getting a LOT of game for the money here, and even at full price it feels like a bargain. Even if you're not struck by zombie games, if you like a GOOD open-world game, I really recommend it.  A huge thank-you to the developers for giving me a fantastic 100+ hours of quality entertainment!			"

												Dying Light is an open world adventure horror game, developed by Techland and published by Warner Brothers, releasing in January 2015 for PC, PS4 and Xbox One. This game sort of came out of nowhere, it didn’t have very much hype behind it prior to release and it came as a welcome surprise to a usually quite month of the year for big game releases. The game play in Dying Light reminded me so closely of Dead Island. You play in first person view as you explore the world. Of course, the world has been overrun by zombies. One of the changes to the “Dead Island” gameplay style is the parkour system. We have seen parkour systems used in games such as Assassins Creed and Shadow of Mordor, but Dying Light’s version knocks them all out of the park. A third of the gameplay is based around the running and jumping across the landscape – you are able to hide from the zombies when you are jumping rooftop-to-rooftop so it is really in your interest to get to grasp with it as soon as possible. There are times when you will be thrown into the combat situations; this is where the Dead Island mechanics come in – melee weapons are going to be your primary source of damage and they work exactly the same as DI. Your weapons take durability damage each time you hit, but you can repair them on the fly with the required parts. Once you get your hands on a gun, the odds swing dramatically in your favour, but you do get the downside of the noise it creates, and it possibly attracting even more zombies to your location.  One of my favourite mechanics Dying Light introduced though would be the dynamic day and night cycle. During the day time, zombies will act in their usual manner, whilst they are still a danger, they can definitely be managed fairly easily. Once it is night time though; boy oh boy, you better have your running shoes on! The zombies transform into a much more dangerous form, they can sprint, and see a lot further away, as well as their heightened sense of hearing – meaning you will find it very hard to by-pass them.  The day night cycle lasts for about 70 minutes in total, about one hour in daylight, and 10 minutes at night. Graphically, I am very happy with the quality of graphics on show. I was nowhere near able to push out the game on 4k, even on the menu screen my frame rate plummeted, and I even struggled on 1440p, so I had to make do with just 1080p with all of the settings ramped up.  The lighting effects, explosions, and scenery all look absolutely stunning. Textures are all high resolution and the animations of everything in the game are faultless. Whilst there is a lot of animations that can be annoying after the first few times, such as when you open a chest, you have to wait 2-3 seconds whilst the animation plays out of you opening it; personally I would have liked this to be skippable but it is a really minor issue. Dying Light starts out in a very easy fashion, allowing you to get to grips with the game mechanics, and the tutorial at the start of the game introduces you to the game very well too. The parkour mechanic can take a little while to get used to as sometimes you will probably fall whilst climbing buildings because you aren’t used to the way it works and feels, but it just takes practice. The only time I had real issues with the combat difficulty would be the later stages in the game, when you are just getting hammered by hordes of zombies over and over again. Little tip; conserve your ammo!!!The vast open world you are playing in very rarely leaves you with nothing to do; there are tons of side missions, collectables and loot to find. There are over 100 different melee weapons, and they can be modified in different combinations (over 1000 of them!). The side missions do seem a little but samey after a while. I completed about 13 or so out of the 44 before I finished the main story and this was because they are very repetitive. A few other optional objectives consist of finding relief packages which is where you race the opposite faction to get a supply drop, saving survivors from the opposite faction’s men attacking them, and the same for zombies. You can also go out of your way to find collectable items such as trophy’s and notes around the world. Completing the main story and about a ¼ of the side missions has taken me just over ten hours. Right now I don’t have a dying urge to go back in and complete the rest of the missions, purely because of the repetitive factor, but I will be keeping Dying Light installed so that I can in the future as well as the anticipated DLC which will be releasing soon. The devs have reports that with all of the current content in the game, you should be able to push 50 hours. I struggle to believe that, I would say you can get about 20 hours out of Dying Light at the time of writing this. I didn’t have any technical issues. The game ran very well at 1080p at a steady 60 fps, the only time it dropped sub 60 was in extremely hectic scenes with hundreds of zombies and lots of explosions but that is to be expected. I played the game with keyboard and mouse, and should be strongly recommended you do not attempt to play with a controller.To sum up, Dying Light is a really nicely done zombie adventure game. Personally I feel it is a much more rounded off game compared to the Dead Island series, and adds plenty of depth to the genre rather than re-hashing content that’s already been done before. The main story and core gameplay mechanics make’s Dying Light one of the standout games to be released in 2015 and I would strongly recommend this game to any open world genre fans out there.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												I'm not one to sit around doing every single side mission in a game because I have 2 little kids and just don't usually have the time. But for this game I took the time. And I enjoyed every bit of it! I've even been working on all of the achievements because I want an excuse to keep playing the game.At first I thought, ah dang, a pipe? a wooden board? I won't last a minute in this. And I didn't. :) But as it progresses I get better weapons. Oooo a bat! OMG A MACHETE! *Never uses anything besides a machete again.* And running and jumping over everything was ok....but then....GASP! Grapple hook! I love you, grapple hook! So wonderful! I'm Spiderman!A few days in...I suddenly realize it's dusk and I'm NOWHERE NEAR THE SAFEHOUSE. It rapidly gets dark and I hear terrible sounds getting closer and closer and I RUN AND TRIP AND FALL OVER EVERYTHING and almost kill myself falling off of buildings just to make it back. I peeked behind me while running and almost had a heart attack. D': I <3 you safehouse. I'm never going out at night again. *** NEXT MISSION *** : Go out at night and collect some plants or something of the sort............................... O_O10/10 Would use my glowing green machete on volatiles again. You don't scare me anymore! (jk) :')(Btw, I enjoyed this so much more than the Dead Island games!)Update for The Following: You get to drive cars and run over zombies! What could be better?! Great addition to the game.			"

												It's like Far Cry and Mirrors Edge got married and then later had a divorce and Mirrors Edge married Dead Island. They had a baby but the baby actually belonged to Far Cry and Mirrors Edge knew that but Dead Island was all, ""What the ♥♥♥♥ is this, where are the zombies?"" And then they had another baby and this one belonged to Dead Island and Dead Island found out that Mirrors Edge was lying to him so Dead Island shot his wife and then himself. So then afterwards Far Cry's kid and Dead Island's kid had incest, and out popped Dying Light... So yeah Dying Light is pretty good.			"

												I don't often sit down and write game reviews, but I had to make an exception for Dying Light. It has been a very long time since I dropped $60 on a game and felt this good about it. I am a zombie game junkie, I play as many as I can. This one is hands down the most satisfying experience I've ever had. These are a few of the ways this game stands out to me as head and shoulders above the rest: Combat- The combat feels amazing in this game. From jabbing at things with pipes and wooden boards in the early game, to a slow motion decap later on, it just feels amazing to kill the zombies. They're an actual threat to you, and you can quickly find yourself overwhelmed if you linger in the streets. There are so many ways to dispose of them. About 23 hours into the game, I have several different guns, swords, axes, throwing weapons, molotovs, and a variety of combat moves that let me stomp on their heads when I knock them down. That's another thing I love so much. This game isn't just another start game, grab a gun, shoot everything game. You don't even SEE a gun till you've done quite a bit of getting your hands dirty. Guns also present their own danger. If you shoot a gun, or set off an alarm, you bring the attention of the masses of zombies in the streets. Not just one or two, they swarm you and it happens fast. The decision to pick off an enemy with a firearm is one you make very very carefully. There are genuine consequences to how you choose to confront your enemies. Progression - I can't say enough good about it. They have done an absolutely brilliant job with the balance and overall gameplay in Dying Light. In the beginning, the first time you poke your head out of the building you start in, you are terrified by the strength of the zombies, and they are everywhere. The entire game grows with your character. Searching boxes early on you get low end gear, but the stronger you get, the stronger the enemies get across the entire city. New zombie types start to appear, even in the daytime. Night time is just a NOPE! Unless of course you rock the stealth thing. I myself am too prone to running in wth my machete swinging. Eventually you are driven by the story and quests to HAVE to complete missions at night, and it's a rush from beginning to end. Loot gets progressively better based on your own progress, there are no ""junk"" areas of the game where the mobs become laughable and the loot even worse. The overall experience- If you're an adrenaline junkie, you WANT this game. You learn very quickly that your life depends on mastering not only the weapons and combat, but also the parkour. You don't ever stop running and jumping, leaping to and from rooftops, over fences, cars and other obstacles. If you miss a jump, the horde will be right on you, grabbing and clawing and biting, and bringing plenty of their friends along for the snack. I would highly recommend this game to people looking for a truly action packed experience, this one is not for the faint of heart!!  "

												Dying Light is a zombie game that focuses on atmosphere and player movement. If you have played Dead Island you already know the basic mechanics; craft melee weapons and bash zombies while collecting supplies. But Dying Light employs numerous changes that improve on this.Atmosphere is perhaps its best asset. The day-night cycle is a crucial component, as there are major changes to mood and gameplay as the sun sets behind the horizon. At night, the tension elevates as you experience reduced visibility and face zombies that are nimble, fast and deadly. You will be tempted to venture out at night for extra rewards. During the day, you battle hordes of shambling zombies that are fun to eviscerate with a broad selection of weaponry. The difference between night and day provides a genuine rollercoaster ride.Parkour movement makes navigating the world immensely enjoyable. You are able to run, jump and climb over buildings with ease. You just look at a ledge and hold the jump button to climb. As you come upon zombie hordes you analyse the area quickly. Do you attack or use the environment to avoid danger? Various slides and kicks make dealing with zombies, and human foes, quite interesting. Traps placed around the world can be triggered to slow pursuers or distract zombies, giving you an edge as you learn the world around you.The single player is surprisingly entertaining and lengthy, with side quests that are often better than those in the story. Characters are well-defined and memorable, with more effort given to justify the game world. You run between areas, clear safe zones, rescue people and collect items. Story missions might even feature shootouts in indoor levels. Progression comes via a skill tree that unlocks significant character upgrades. You will also learn to craft items like Molotovs and flares to make you more formidable against the various zombie types.Dying Light is also a cooperative game and playing with others is easy. The basic cooperative action works well, aside from rigid animations, and you can undertake just about every quest from the campaign. You can even open your game to a 'zombie invasion' where another player joins and takes the role of a dangerous night-hunter zombie that can instantly kill survivors with a pounce. Your goal is to destroy zombie nests before you lose a certain number of lives. Whether playing alone, or with a group of four, this versus mode is actually good despite its relative simplicity. It gets hectic when four players are battling tougher zombies and running all over the open map while being pursued by a night-hunter that can summon exploding zombies. Dying Light is a terrific zombie game that greatly improves the core mechanics from Dead Island. It emphasizes the world and how you move around in it. The changes between day and night are refreshing and memorable. There is a healthy amount of content that will provide dozens of hours of entertainment in solo or cooperative play. Dying Light mixes intriguing elements to craft a zombie experience that is entertaining, atmospheric, visceral, and frenzied.			"

For first, I'm not much of a writer and since English isn't my main language, I prefer to keep my reviews very short. But Dying Light is an amazing game and it's on top of my favorite games on Steam, so I'll do my best to write as much as I can.Dying Light. It is truly a great and flawless game, I personally love every single aspect of it, be it gameplay, story, graphics, visuals, mechanics and etc. What I especially like is that, at the beginning it's much more of a survival so you'll have to avoid zombies as much as you can, as you level up and progress towards story, you'll unlock many various items/skills/gadgets that it may even turn the game into piece of cake on normal difficulty, of course if you invest some time and enjoy the game instead of rushing quests. You can also change difficulty anytime.The Gameplay.Gameplay heavily adapts on your skills, weapons and story progression. It's really interesting how you level up, unlock game changing skills and slowly develop your character by finding better weapons, upgrading and crafting with even more deadly upgrades. Dying Light sometimes reminds me of Skyrim, and all that huge amount of fun I had from it. If you've played and liked Skyrim, you're most likely to enjoy the Dying Light.Skil Trees. You have total of 5 skill trees. From the beginning you'll have three, Survivor, which you gain by completing quests, saving survivors, delivering air drop packages and etc. Agility which you gain by running, jumping, climbing and harder the obstance more experience you earn. And power, you gain power experience by killing zombies with any weapons. Fourth skill tree would be Legend which I've explained below, fifth skill tree is a Driver which is only accessible in The Following DLC.The Story. Dying Light has a decent and serious plot. It is a very interesting, memorable and enjoyable, there might be some plot twists and sad moments. The ending is very exciting and satisfying.Although the story isn't the strong side of this game, I mean the story is great of course, but still the most fun thing is killing zombies and doing various stuff, even after beating the game on 100%.Saving/Checkpoint System. Saving system is simple, but also a little bit of different and complicated from other games. In Dying Light you cannot save game manually, though almost on everything you do, autosave is triggered, even when you quit the game. Making it almost impossible to lose your character progression. However, checkpoint system is complicated, and it depends on which mission you're on. For example, do not be confused if you spawned somewhere else after you were close to your mission objective and you either died/quit/restarted game, you haven't lost your progression, neither any experience or item. Everytime you continue your game, you'll spawn in area depending on which quest you have selected.Weapons. You have a huge amount of choice in weapons, melee weapons such as wrench, axes, machetes, knives, swords, scythes, katanas, great axes/swords and etc. Throwable weapons such as shuriken, want to be ninja? well you can. As well as ranged weapons, pistols, revolvers, SMGs, assault rifles, shotguns, bows and crossbows. Each kind of weapons have quality tiers. Melee weapons have durability and repairs, that means you cannot keep repairing single melee weapon infinitely, it'll eventually downgrade and break.What I love even more about Dying Light. It is the bows and crossbows, and their awesome and smooth mechanics. Also the fact that you can pickup and reuse the arrows/bolts which is really fun. You'll never run out of arrows this way, unless you're forced to flee the from area, being unable to retrieve arrows.Bows and Crossbows never downgrade and since you can pickup arrows/bolts, you can always use them if you run out of firearm ammo or your melee weapon breaks. You can also craft arrows, even elemental arrows, or buy them from merchants.Perfectly Polished. Over 700+ hours so far, and not even a single game breaking bug, of course I've encountered some minor glitches but they weren't really worth much of a trouble, in fact I can't even remember any of it now, and actually it was fun.Legendary Levels. Legend skill tree is a great addition to the Dying Light, it came with Enhanced Edition and The Following. Once you max out one of your Survivor/Agility/Power skill trees, you'll unlock a Legend skill tree, all the experience gained from that skilltree then goes towards the Legend, which adds 250 extra levels and a great opportunity to invest some more time in harran. Legend skills are greatly useful Nightmare difficulty.Huge Content. And I mean it, I've started The Following DLC after 700+ hours, I've beaten the base game multiple times and still going for more. Dying Light is worth even the full price.Great Developer. They've upgraded the game to the Enhanced Edition totally for free. And if you purchase the game now you also get ALL the DLC to date, except Harran Ranger, Gun Psycho and Volatile Hunter bundles, though these 3 are very cheap and not really necessary to enjoy the game. You also get everything that's included in season pass.The biggest downside of the game so far is people who cheat/dupe/abuse glitch/exploits. If you see a person with only 30-60 hours in Dying Light, has 250 legend and knows not so much about the game, it's probably a person who duped or received cheated packages from another cheater.My score would be 10+/10.Some other things you may like.Do you want to be Oliver Queen?(Arrow)Do you want to be Daryl Dixon?(The Walking Dead)Do you want to be Spiderman?Do you want to be Rick Grimes?(The Walking Dead)Do you want to be Rico Rodriguez?(Just Cause)Do you want to be Faith?(Mirror's Edge)Do you want to be One Punch Man?Do you want to be every character listed above, at the same time?Do you love atmospheric games?Do you want to have your own upgradable vehicle with fuel?Do you love beautiful games?Do you love killing zombies in many various ways?Do you love being chased?Do you love stealth?Do you love games with huge content and high replayability value?Do you love games with NG+(Keep your inventory/skills)?Do you love games with a lot of levels?Do you love parkour?Do you love rewarding games?Do you love games with awesome physics?Do you love games with awesome skills?Do you love games with ability to pickup arrows and reuse them?Do you love games with infinite world?(Supplies/Everything respawning)Do you love games with dynamic day/weather cycle?Do you love open world + survival?Do you love games with endless stuff to do?Do you love games with a lot of easter eggs?Do you love games where you can join others with your own character?Do you love challenges?Do you love games where you can do whatever you want(Sandbox)?Do you love games with almost nearly no bugs?Do you love perfectly polished games?Do you love generous developers which actually care about their game and community? Do you love pick-locking and looting?Do you love grappling hook?Do you love swords?Do you love awesome story and progression?Do you love very interesting, smooth and truly awesome gameplay?Well, then this game is definitely for you.If you're worried about your melee weapons being broken down and becoming useless, then worry no more, check out my Dying Light guide about how to refurbish weapons and restore their repairs/durability.If you need help in-game, or simply looking for partner to do whatever, add me.

												消逝的光芒（Dying Light） 绰号：蜘蛛侠的光芒作为波兰开发商Techland呈现给世界的2015开年大作，消逝的光芒有着优良的画面，各种元素的杂糅，跑酷+打怪的生存机制，真实的黑夜与日夜模拟系统，但因为放在年初发布，当时2015的硬件升级潮流还未开始，其较高的配置要求让诸多玩家望尘莫及。涉及了很多元素，动作，射击，生存，潜入，逃亡，开锁...就射击方面，也只有那么几把枪，而这样一个丧尸密布还有不少“跑酷型”甚至无尽的黑夜中的“夜魔”的世界，肆意放枪令人感觉很不科学，手感一般，一般是打BOSS和跑跑跑收拾残怪时用，平时还是喜欢刀刀剑剑斩首断骨，潜入方面...基本上感觉没有，赖斯的手下很容易发现自己，一般是蹲行对小僵尸使用背后扭头的技能，生存方面，初期真心是确实惊心动魄，血少刀烂，还跑得慢！至今记得到那个第一次邂逅夜魔的夜晚....配合全黑的画面，确实是充满逃亡的紧张感，不过到后期，游戏就越来越容易了，开锁王随随便便就是一把1000的单手剑，蹲一小洞里，三下五下就是一只夜魔，而在初期，当初跟吧友联机，那真的是18般武艺全上完了，三个人猥琐在管道里杀一只夜魔杀到天亮.....开锁....挺考耐心的，有简单到困难的难度分级，越困难的箱子获得宝物越好，当然，获得武器的等级是随着自己等级而改变的，就像巫师3：拾荒一样，单纯来讲，Dyinglight是一款丧尸题材的作品，相较于前辈《死亡岛》来说，添加了很多东西，不逊色于镜之边缘的跑酷元素是首当其冲的。FPS一向容易导致3D眩晕，尤其是动作幅度较大，画面摆动较大，甚至出现视觉颠倒的情况（典型就是孤岛危机1Core失重关卡），很多""体质""不行的玩家在上手他们馋嘴却又望而生畏的第一人称游戏之前，都还得吃两颗晕车药，而就是因为3D眩晕的问题，造成将于2016年发布的第一人称动作游戏，镜之边缘：催化剂的跑动头部晃动较09年的镜之边缘大幅缩水，不得不说这是一个妥协的产物，再扯回来，虽然在赞其跑酷元素，但消光也仅有翻越，攀爬，减压滚等基础动作，没有Free-running，即自由奔跑的那传统观念里对跑酷的印象——花哨的体操性动作，当然由于是沙盒开放式的地图，拥有充满棚楼与地中海风格建筑的“贫民窟”和“老城”两大区域，相较于镜之边缘更为自由，奔跑更为舒畅，游戏中的垃圾堆和汽车顶可以无视距离趴地缓冲，每次都能听到那“啊哇~~""的一声，反科学娱乐感十足，游戏也带有升级系统，分为""生存”，“敏捷”与“战斗”三大技能玩家初期三大技能树都贫瘠的时候，很辣鸡，渣渣的武器，攻击力低，打两下就生锈；体力差，超慢的上墙速度，跑两步就喘气，打两下就眼花，要靠玩家剧情的不断深入与玩耍时间的增加，获取更多的技能点来提升，但是达到满级时，又会突然发现，简直就是克傲天（玩家操纵的主角叫克莱恩，Crane）有击打系统，可以拳击（即空手没武器时），可以脚踢（默认E键踢，我改成F），以及摔角里常见的Missile Dropkick（导弹式重脚踢）很反科学，这游戏反正哪里都是不科学。不过用起来挺爽的，还能改文件力量踢上云霄武器的特技有跳锤，还有360°回旋锤，以及高处落下击爆僵尸或人类的脑（刺客的光芒）等消逝的光芒游戏自带拾荒探测技能，画面的显示给人一种外星人扫描的感觉一样，反观今年的各大作，都有拾荒与配件合成系统，确实是符合资源节约型社会发展潮流，画面方面，赞一个，建筑与自然景观，地中海Style，不过那个远景确实是耗资源大户，1080P似乎要970才能全开，游戏画面最大的两点就是""真实""的黑暗模拟，众所周知，“黑暗”在游戏里一向是被暧昧地渲染出来的，即“黑”得不“黑”，像比如使命召唤的各种需要带夜视镜的场景，其实不戴夜视镜也还是看得清，不是那种黑的伸手不见五指的情况，下水道画面阴暗出众，但是对于黑暗，也并非完全还原，为什么？因为黑成一片了，还玩毛啊？但消光的开发商就是要大声地对世界说：“No”，在游戏中，进入黑夜，差不多晚上10点到2点的这时间，如果不照灯，那走在路上真的是黑成一片，真的是伸手不见五指，而且黑暗中还埋伏着众多的丧尸，以及晚间日常Boss——夜魔，就是那些赤身裸体浑身烂肉红白相间怕紫外线的跑酷大师，100%的黑暗，算是业界一流水平吧，不愧是消逝着的光芒，黑得彻底，黑得让广州的歪果仁都心服口服。由此，这游戏不但对硬件要求大，对显示屏要求也大，面板黑场越真实越好，一般的IPS一到晚上关了手电筒，那露点光，泛蓝，泛灰，真的是毁氛围。游戏背景设置在一个叫“哈兰”的临海城市，对于该地区究竟在哪里玩家间曾有过热烈讨论，我认为差不多就是地中海那疙瘩的.游戏剧情，可以说是最辣鸡的了，稀里糊涂空降到一个地区，稀里糊涂给一个不知名的叫什么GRE的卖命，自己的好兄弟和MMA女神相继死去，悲怆，然后那个一直以来的反派大BOSS赖斯，不知道跟你邂逅并打算杀死你有好多次了，但都没把你杀死，典型的烂片人物，那种宁愿装逼到死都不愿意一颗子弹正中靶心还废话老多的感觉，当然，最后猪脚与赖斯殊死搏斗，终于将其杀死，总体就是，砍砍砍，跑跑跑，主角的话挺多的，这点值得表扬，不像某些FPS，操纵的完全是哑巴，而且情感丰富，在好兄弟与女神快要死去的场景，都有实力配音的表现，这对于丰富人物形象有重要作用，更加生动逼真，有代入感，可是，主角克莱恩再丰富的内心活动，本质上也就是如孤岛惊魂4的阿杰盖勒那样的一个杀杀杀，任务任务任务的形象，个人观点。呼。。。一本正经地打了这么多字，当初的那一段时间的上手感受确实记忆犹新，弥足珍贵，仍记得到2月跟吧友重开存档，联机联到午夜3点，四周也是黑黑的，好有气氛，屏幕前单机还是太孤独了老想捕捉一丝共同冒险的兄弟情。自由度高，爬墙时能转动头部，这点比镜之边缘灵活，游戏元素与文化内涵丰富，画面不赖，还有业界最真实的黑夜模拟，只不过各种东拼西凑后，还真找不到主题了，剧情一级的水，但某些场面是做得挺好，比如那个主角产生的杰德妹子的幻象，总体来说挺不错的游戏，波兰人在世界游戏界分量今年子一下子加重了好多好多而我们的单机游戏.....市场情况，真的就要像国产造相机一样吗？ "

												A great, spiritual successor to the Dead Island series. Much improved on graphics, mechanics and playability. Storyline is short, but the sidequests, repeatable quests, and parkour challenges makes this game quite enjoyable. It's quite fun to play with others, however, it may take awhile for someone to join your game. Although playing against the Hunter is very hard, the gameplay is tolerable once skills are high and weapons are highest grade (orange). May remind you that parkour is the key to survival - will give you the urgency to climb and jump building to building in other, zombie apocalypse games. Personal Rating: 9/10			"

												Is it just another zombie game? No. It is THE ZOMBIE GAME.This game is an amalgamation of every cliche, dilemma and trope found in zombie-related games, comics, films and culture. Though this may seem like something you've seen a hundred times, Dying Light has managed to implement and capture the core aspects of what made those devices work by adding in the right amount of survival horror and scares.Death comes swiftly at every turn if you slip up in the night. This game captures the intensity and tension of fast-moving zombies from 28 Days Later, adds in a horrifyingly wonderous night-time gameplay that drastically limits vision and introduces enemies that are genuinely frightening; both when they jump you and when you are trying to sneak or run past them while listening to their guttural growls and screams.The most amazing part? YOU are in total control at every moment. YOU will understand why and how you die. YOU are definitely equipped with the ability to outrun and outlast them all. Yet Dying Light still manages to keep up the fear despite giving you every tool at your disposal once the game opens up. And for the seasoned veterans, think the game is too easy after a while? Wear a pair of surround sound headphones, attempt it in Nightmare mode or turn off your HUD. Good night... and have fun!			"

												This game sold me on the amazing parkour and freerunning;  I've never had so much fun running and jumping among rooftops with friends. It is such a rush! Visually the game is easy on the eyes. The combat can be fun but only later in the game. It can be frustrating at the beginning but stick with it. You won't be disappointed.The sound is well done.  If you shoot a gun in the city you can hear the stronger ""28 Days Later"" zombies coming your way from all directions.  And once night comes, it's no joke.  The zombies become real strong and 'volatile' not to mention its tougher to run and jump from building to building because you can't see.  I obtained the elixir/potion creation ability early on and it made all the difference at night.  One potion allows you to see at night and this makes it easier to play cat and mouse and get more points for surviving the night outside a safehouse.Now to the story.  It's nothing special and the ending was dull but trust me the game is so much fun due to the parkour that you won't care.  I loved it. 10/10.			"

												I played this whole game in co-op mode with 1 other player, so my review is based on the co-op version of this game.The Positives-  PARKOUR!!!  Extremely fun. Even more fun in coop when you're racing across buildings and somebody jumps the wrong way and falls to their death. The movement is very similar to that of Assassins Creed.- The storyline.  It's engaging, dark and maintains your interest.- Kyle Crane , the protagonist, is a pretty cool dude.- The environment  is stark, eerie yet strangely beautiful.- The day/night cycle is really innovative and makes it EXCITING!  I cannot tell you how much I screeched on that first night, when darkness fell and suddenly 6 special zombies were howling and chasing me. It was terrifying and hilariously fun.- Upgrading weapons, when you know what you are doing, is fun.  So I can stick a little gas canister to my cleaver to make it set zombies on fire? Or add a small voltage so it electrocutes them? Yes, yes I think I will do these things. - Skilling up.  As in lots of games, you have skills trees where you can become more proficient in power, agility and survival. I really enjoyed gaining skills and using them to my advantage, particularly the agility tree, where you can learn to jump over zombies and the like. The Negatives- Weapon degeneration.   I didn't like it in Dead Island, and I don't like it in this. - Weapons lacking... something.  Although this is a melee based game (guns draw zombie attention), I felt the few options for the guns (pistol, shotgun, rifle) were a bit boring. What I would have given to use a bow and arrow, crossbow, silenced weapons and the sort...- Item making.  For lack of a better phrase, I got quickly bored of fannying about looking for a small axe, a large axe, 3 pieces of string, 4 batteries, a blade and 6 metal parts to make a weapon that wasn't as good as the ones I could pick up at various points in the game.- Bland side missions and a quick main game.  We powered through the main mission in 13 hours flat because it was exciting, only stopping to do one side mission. Not because we were trying to speed play, but because we didn't feel the need to complete the missions - they didn't offer anything particularly exciting, just a bit of money that you can obtain from selling the 10000 pieces of string you pick up anyway. They weren't well 'advertised' either - we happened across the one we actually played by accident, thinking it was a safe house.- Co-op felt like an afterthought.  I didn't follow the development for this game very closely, so perhaps it was. It just felt very hastily put together. You play the same character, so there's just 2 of you running around, looking the same. I do understand why - you have to be Kyle to get the information, to take the calls, etc. I just would have preferred a different character to co-op with -  e.g. perhaps adding a couple of other characters from the Tower. I just felt that in co-op, 4 Kyle Cranes looks a bit silly.- You cannot complete the finale together. This one really bugged me. We had played the entire game together, working alongside each other, healing each other and occasionally laughing at one another's misfortune. It was a shared game. And then: You must play the final in single player mode. Whaaat? Having seen the finale, I completely understand why it can't be done cooperatively. Which makes me definitely think co-op was an afterthought. I would have really like to have done a joint finale, battling together against the bad guy to gain a shared victory.Over all, I really did enjoy this game in a co-op mode, and the hours I did get out of it were highly entertaining. I would recommend it, particularly if you enjoy zombie / survival games, and if the prospect of free running your way around a city whilst being chased by a f*ckload of zombies appeals to you.			"

												Dying Light combines the fun of a zombie apocalypse with decent zombie ai, smooth parkour, and fun multiplayer coop up to 4 players or the ability to play as a zombie, which somehow just works out. A much more improved version of dead island IN FACT this is what Dead Island should had been. Video review

			This is something I was working on Last week so I decided to log in as zombie to hunt but I couldn't connect to the damn game anytime I wanted so I decided to become the hunter from my own games.		

 Pros + Great graphics fitting of 2015, 60 fps and runs well for the most part+ Smooth parkour gameplay which is easy to understand and pull off influenced by mirror's edge. ( Like a ghetto version of it but still good)+ Rpg system that feels balanced with 3 variety of skills that are leveled in different ways. Isn't easy to level. Max level is 24+ Addictive zombie head bashing gameplay using melee weapons (there are guns but rare), kill with traps and a handful of blueprint items+ Coop play with up to 3 other friends for a good times where this time it actually works out well+ Zombies in the game levels along with your level, they start off slow and stupid and gradually become powerful and dangerous+ Dynamic day and night cycle where morning is easy hunts while nightime the zombies gets even more dangerous and super intense.+ many gameplay elements such as the weapon color system and modded weapons were brought over from dead island. (The good stuff) CONS - Fps issues for some people out there which happens to certain hardware or could be a bug (Hopefully this will be fixed with patch and I will just get rid of this line- Dolphin Pinging for items and for searching for items breaks immersion a bit- When grabbing quests all players need to be nearby when it should be easy for one to grab quests for everyone.- Multiplayer hunter mode humans who sit in the safe zone and never comes out to actually play it, getting dropped by people joining a game- it is hard to be the zombie to invade games or can't find any games, they need to rework this.- No leaderboards for the multiplay- Zombie Ai has one super flaw which can only be seen when there are hordes of zombies, Not all zombies will be distracted or pay attention to the player but rather it grabs them randomly to attack while the rest ignores. Go up to a high area and throw firecrackers and molotovs to see this example.- Playing multiplayer zombie is really really tedious just randomly spamming to join a game, everytime you join one if another joins then it automatically kicks you out so you spam some more.- Qte's are lazy and when you get to the finale, well...... (Other) +- Story starts great then goes  off slow but gradually gets better, many sidequest to do.+- - Sidequests are a bit tedious after a while but overall has a nice lore to them and some of them are excellent, just many of them aren't. They get better LATER in the game. There are many, many many many sidequests for mods, money, and materials			"

												Dying Light is one of those games that does many things right, and it is a whole lot of fun.  Techland created a zombie game in the vein of Dead Island, with huge improvements, but without the campiness.  The zombie world of Dying Light revolves around a great premise. The sidequests range from somewhat fun to damn cool. There are many different scenarios, and they are events and occurrences that would more than likely occur in a post-apocalyptic world. There are 44 side quests. While they may not be all worth doing, the player may be surprised by some of the adventures they bring.  The parkour is fluid and connected, while building off on climbing and jumping mechanics that makes free-running exhilarating.  It starts off slow, but once you get going on the agility skill tree, free-running is really fun. I highly recommend putting points in the fall damage mitigation, and forward roll. For instance, parkour/free-running has three stages of upgrades.  You start off as a novice freerunner, and as you progress through the skill tree, you become more athletic, therefore, traversing the world faster with less stumbles. These all make for smooth controls that are very responsive, and it does not miss a beat.  Fun times.You can also combine abilities from different skill trees to perform combos.  For example, you can use ""vault"" on a zombie, followed by a ""drop attack"" for a satisfying combo finisher.  If you are trying to connect Dead Island and DI: Riptide to this game, it probably shares in common some visual art design, melee combat, without the campiness. But the melee combat has been greatly improved. The melee combat is extremely satisfying.The gameplay is where Dying Light shines. Gunplay is so much better too. Throw in free-running abilities, the three skill trees, and gameplay is a blast. Dying Light sports the best melee/parkour combat to date.And while I feel the gameplay is the best part of the game, Dying Light does many other things right too. In another light, the ending was predictable, although it could have been handled differently. I would have liked to see a twist in the story.  I feel like the premise of Dying Light could have served a multitude of story branches.  A missed opportunity, indeed.It is one of those games that takes bits of concepts from other games like Mirror's Edge, Dead Island, Far Cry 3+4, and executes it well. It does not feel like you're playing those games per say, but it does remind you of them. If that makes any sense. It feels different, and more than enough to stand on its own. If you guys have a chance, give it a try. But if you choose to focus too much on its flaws, you will  probably end up not liking it, and you will probably dislike it for the wrong reasons. I felt this way in the beginning, but this is one of those games that really grows on you. It is not amazing, but it has some spectacular moments.The visuals are up to par with modern games, atmospheric and immersive, slick and smooth controls--button mapping is great to accommodate for melee combat and free-running, extremely detailed game world,  combined with satisfying melee combat complimented by three skill trees that enhance gameplay incredibly.The sound design is excellent, from the cries of a zombie from several yards away, to a great soundtrack (some 80s/90s music), There are many different zombie types--common, stronger common, special, and nighttime zombies all make for interesting enemy and A.I.  During nighttime, some common zombies behave more aggressively, and the nighttime zombies like the Volatiles come out on patrol.  Volatiles, like the more alert and aggressive common zombies, have a cone of vision that appears on the mini-map to show the player if they have been alerted.  A eye icon appears over the actual zombie on screen if they have spotted you, and the icon fills up with a red color indicator to show if you are being pursued. The zombie A.I. is smart. Day-zombies may not be much of a threat as night-zombies, but day-zombies can be a threat in numbers.  ""Free-runner"" zombies are former runners that turned into the infected.  They move and run faster, and they can climb objects and structures, unlike their common zombie cousins. They are more aggressive and they relentlessly pursue you until you put them out of their misery.  The physics is good, and it makes for some unintentional, hilarious moments. I highly recommend crafting and experimenting with every weapon, even if you feel like you will not like ""throwing weapons"" or ""trap bombs."" In this game, you're going to want to try everything. They're all fun to use, and they provide for cool gameplay scenarios you can come up with. Achievements in Dying Light are worth hunting, especially in co-op mode.  Take a little time to read through them because they encourage you to experiment and try different things. I am glad I looked through them. Point being is, get creative. Use your imagination and try to do everything. Experiment.Nighttime is really intense because that's when the more hellish zombies come out and stalk you. You have probably read that other players have reported that the game does not feature real-time day and night cycles, and that is untrue. Early on in the game, there are a few story missions that introduce you to nighttime. I think this confused players. After you have completed those, day and nighttime cycle kicks in. Day lasts several hours, and nighttime only lasts for a very short time. And this occurs without story mission/side quests. You can fast-forward time by clicking on a bed (wait until night or morning), and go off on your adventure. However, I do take issue with the timer for nighttime. There could have been a setting to change how long nighttime lasted. Seven minutes isn't all that much, even though it can sometimes feel like ""forever"" with Volatiles chasing you across the city.There are mini-games spread throughout the world of Dying Light. These include ""challenges"" that you can participate in, like a free-running challenge, killing a specfic amount of the infected in the quarantine zone, or a challenge scenario where you need to kill 40 zombies within a limited amount of time. It sounds simple on paper, but these challenges can be pretty entertaining in spurts and especially with a co-op partner.Dying Light is one of those rare videogames that was designed thoughtfully. Single-player and co-op intertwine in harmony, and one mode does not hamper the other.  After having played over 50 hours of Dying Light, I can genuinely say that this is one of the best single-player/co-op campaign games out there. With Invasion mode and nighttime adding a whole new dynamic to zombie-killing madness, gameplay is intensified and it brings fresh new gameplay that would have been missed had it not been included.  It is one of the better games that have been released in recent years, and it definitely stands out from the crowd of new-gen games.9.0 out of 10.   - Highly recommmended.  - Huge improvement over Dead Island- Excellent and thoughtful single-player/co-op design- Extremely satisfying melee combat system- Great parkour that is fluid and highly responsive- Deep skill trees, and game mechanics like crafting and upgrades- Great visuals for an open-world game - Immersive and atmospheric- Cool characters- Solid writing for the most part, and good dialogue - Great premise- Many zombie types provide for dynamic gameplay - Excellent zombie A.I.- Innovative nighttime zombie gameplay- Excellent and responsive controls- Missed opportunities in plot twist- Ending was anti-climatic- Missed opportunities in potentially good scares- Main protagonist feels hollow- Most characters are forgettableCPU: i5-2500K @ 4.1 GHzGPU: EVGA GTX 970 Superclocked ACX 2.08GB RAMOS:  Windows 7 64-bit Home Nvidia driver version: WHQL 347.25Resolution: 1080p			"

												Pros:+ Game does a REALLY good job at being an open world zombie survival game. You have to craft things, weapons break down after a while, guns are scarce, ammo is scarce, zombies are attracted by loud noises, they attack you in hordes, they don't die easily, etc.The game reminds me a lot of the Walking Dead: Survival Instinct PRE-LAUNCH. All the things we were promised in the game that either weren't there, or weren't as good as it was in the final release, you can guarantee are in here. There is a strong emphasis on using your environment to aid you in killing zombies. There's scattered spike traps you can lure zombies into, there's puddles of oil to ignite, oil barrels to explode, so on and so forth.You also get to kick enemies. This can help you knock down enemies, and you can also kick zombies off of anywhere. The ragdoll is pretty damn funny, and boy is it amusing to knock a zombie off a 6+ story high building.Also, if you've played Dead Island, then this will definitely be very familiar. Only difference is: this is actually a good game.+ Free running was a brilliant ideaThe game has its fair share of fetch quests, but they are much less tedious due to the method of travel which is the free running. Every surface, ledge, window, balcony, is all climbable. It's pretty much a first person Assassin's Creed game in this particular aspect. You also unlock a grappling hook which is awesome. There's also cars in the DLC.Getting from point A to point B is pretty funny, and not tedious like I mentioned.+ Skill Tree is pretty goodThere are a lot of abilities you can unlock. You can unlock more stamina, health, faster health regeneration, the ability to slide, jump over zombies, curb stomp zombies, being able to roll after jumping off of high places, etc. It's seperated into three different categories: Agility, Survivor, and Power. They each have their own levels and XP progression, so doing specific actions only count towards that specific category of skills.For example, you level up Agility by doing free running. You will gain a certain amount of XP for every jump, climb, etc. For survivor, you earn more XP for doing quests, side quests, picking up care packages and delivering them, and what not. Power levels are earned by killing and hitting enemies.If I had to complain about it, I would definitely say there's quite a few skills missing that should've been in the game. + The game changes the setting half way through the game.You go from a beach resort/urban city looking place in the first half, to an old Roman inspired looking city in the latter half. What I love about this is it offers a breath of fresh air to the game. I don't know too many open worlds that do something like this, but they need to do it more often.I started getting tired of the first city (Harran), and the second one (Sector 0) was refreshing to explore for the first time. I don't know, props to the devs for doing this.+ Enhanced Edition has a lot of valueFor $30 (or $23.99 on sale), you get the game, and the Following, which is like another game in of itself, and some other crap that's neat I guess lol.Cons:- Hard Mode is sometimes unfairI probably would not recommend Hard Mode for this game. I selected it thinking it would just be more challenging and require more strategy, which it DEFINITELY DOES, BUUUUUUUUUUUUT, it is pretty damn unfair a lot of times, and it's genuinely frustrating.You will lose surivor points everytime you die. Not sure if that's only in Hard Mode or not, but even if it's not, you die more often which will make you lose the points a LOT. As a result, I was half the survivor level as I was for my Power and Agility level.One good thing about it though, I found myself using the spike traps more often. Same with the oil barrels and puddles. Also, dodging is necessary for a lot of enemies. Get it ASAP!*Then let's talk about whether it's a good port or not*Overall, yes. Completely good port. If I had to complain, maybe not a whole ton of graphics settings, and not a lot of in depth one's (for example, there's just an on and off setting for Anti-aliasing instead of FXAA, MSAA, SMAA, etc.)The performance is good for the most part, but the bad part is understandable. A lot of zombies can be on screen at once which drops the framerate a bit. Sadly though, lowering some settings didn't really ease this by much (maybe 5 FPS more when I turned some stuff down.)Overall, it's good. Good controller support, yata yata.Light 8/10, is a definite must own if you like Zombie survival open world type stuff.  Cannot be missed if these kind of games are you stuff! "

												I liked this game from the first few minutes, but I decided I would finish the main story before writing a review, so here it is...Super short review:A superior Dead Island.Review:I like many things about this game and as I went forward in the story, it proved to deserve it more and more.Graphics and sound:For those who like graphics, this game offers beautiful graphics and great visual effects.  I didn't pay that much attention to it, but I did like the music and the sounds - they bring you in the atmosphere that you would want in this type of games.Combat:The combat is okay.  At the beginning you rely on small one-handed weapons that don't deal much damage, but as you progress through the game, you get very good knives, machetes, and you can even customize your weapons and add things like poison, shock effects, extra bleed damage, and all that.  Later on you get your hands dirty with a pistol and 2 rifles (there are more, but I didn't really use them), but they won't be used that much because of the scarcity of ammo.  To be honest, I prefer it that way.  After you progress through your levels, you can get good hand-to-hand skills like grappling, drop kick, kicking while sliding, stomping, and other, which almost remove the need of having any weapons at all if used correctly (I still use my old school baseball bat with shock effects just to be a boss).What I do not like about the combat is the AI.  Some AI, especially the humans, retreat very often.  They run against you, then they stop, then they just retreat slowly and you have to go chase them, which may take some time.Don't start thinking you will go rambo style at the beginning.  It will be hard to face more than one enemy at the time at first, but when you get good skills, you will be able to fight waves easily if you use them right.Parkour:Jumping from one building to another, climbing towers, or jumping over obstables will make you feel like you're playing a mix of Assassin's Creed and Far Cry.  It is very well done even though sometimes you can make jumps that are really over the bounds of reality.Story:The best part for me was the story.  I love playing single player games, so I played the story all the way through by myself and I have to say it was fairly addicting.  Even though it is very easy to predict, in fact I knew what was going to happen at the end in the first 30 minutes, there are some things in the middle of the story, or the way the things you thought actually happen, that will surprise you.  You will not want to take a break because you want to know what happens next.Unfortunately I cannot talk about game optimization.  I'm running a GTX 980 SLI, an i7 4790k 4.8 GHz and an SSD, so the game runs smooth for me at max, but I can't tell about about mid range specs.  One thing I did not like is that I cannot (or at least didn't find a way to) use DSR (dynamic super resolution); when I switch my res to 4k, unfortunately the game doesn't really make it 4k but something lower.  I'll have to look into that.Bugs:You'll probably find a few bugs, nothing really serious.  The worst in my experience was getting stuck once, but I went back into the main menu, I pressed continue and I was 5 seconds away from where I got stuck and ready to go.Conclusion:Overall the game is very, very good.  If you wanted a great Dead Island, here it is.  Great story, beautiful graphics and good gameplay.  Is it worth $60? Depends on how much $60 is for you (doesn't mean you have to buy it at $60 anyway...).  You  can simply wait for a sale and grab your copy.  It will be worth it. The main story is a good 15-20 hours (to me it says less because I played it a lot while my connection was down).  Then you have many side quests that will probably take a lot of time.  I do not regret my purchase and I recommend this game to my friends.			"

												Dying Light is a damn good game, in my opinion, one of the best zombie based game you'll find on the market.It's fun, addicting, very well crafted and beautiful to look at, here's exactly why:GAMEPLAY:I want to start with the gameplay, which is the highlight of the production. First of all, this game was brought to us by Techland, pretty much the same developers of Dead Island, in fact this game shares a lot of similarities gameplay-wise with their previous title.So, just like Dead Island, Dying light is a first person action zombie game, focused mainly on malee combat, with survival elements and an RPG level system. What makes Dying Light way better is how much flawless the gameplay is. A lot of thought went into it and it shows, let me explain: Dead Island can be very boring at times because you spend a lot of time just moving around, on your way to your next objective doing nothing except dodging zombies, because killing them is no more fun. Dying Light avoids this by making ""moving around"" the most exiting thing ever! This game has an excellent parkour system, so instead of just running, you're jumping on rooftops, climbing buildings, jumping and sliding on zombies front-flipping your way to your next assignment. It just never gets boring.The fighting is not as crazy as Dead Island, that had friccking Thor hammers and fire blades. You can still make special weapons but they're a lot more down to earth. To compensate that, Dying Light has a lot more weapon variety, while malee weapons are the clear focus, there are lot of throwable weapons (like shourikens, even explosive ones, or axes), molotovs, granades, a bow and some guns too, but they're not upgradable nor that satisfing to use.The enemy design is pretty standard, there are your basic zombies: the normal one, the suicide one, the one that spits acid, the big one, the bigger one and your everyday human baddies.As you can tell fighting is not as groundbreaking as the parkour system, but considering it implements some of the agility of the parkour, it can be fun sometimes.Where the gameplay is taken to next level is on night time, because the dynamic time of the day doesn't just change the lighting of the eviroment, it changes how you play the game: when the night comes, zombies are faster and meanier, at the beginning you can't even hope to fight back and all you can do is run for your life, use traps set around, hide in the shadows and wait for the sun to rise again. The first nights are traumatic and you'll try to avoid them, but as the game progresses and you learn more, you'll conquer the night a little bit, so there's a good sense of progression.THE STORY:After playing through the story I asked myself of much developers must love Far Cry 3. A lot of similarities with that game, especially the crazy main bad guy obsessed with caos who kills his own men and the tripping on drugs platform sections. That, and quick time events boss fights.Anyway, the story it's pretty forgettable, nothing really memorable to highlight but I won't spoil it. Some sidequests are pretty decent, there are still some of the usual delivery boy missions, which zombie game really love apparently, but at least here there are some fun side characters to meet. A few of them at least.THE PRESENTATION:Well it looks really good, the lights are beautiful, sunrises and sunsets are very pretty. What wins me over with the presentation is when you're standing on a high ground and you get to enjoy all the enviroment around you, it really looks beautiful.One little complaint is how the water looks from further distances, it's pretty weird for me.THE SOUNDTRACK:Barely remember any of it. Some nice tons here and there, nothing else to say about it.ADDICIONAL CONTENT:""The following"" expansion is a very good downloadable content. It's relatively cheap and it offers a lot. They changed the scenario to a countryside, where instead of jumping around you're using a dune buggy, which is awesome, it's upgradable, customizable, fun to drive around for a while. The story of this DLC is actually a little more interesting, with this cult who is apparently immune to the infection, a little more creative. A problem is that it requires you to do some sidequests to continue the main story and there's a lot of them, so it might become unfocused.All that considered, if you like the game you can pick this up with no ripercussions.The Bozak Horde is one those challenge missions that you can repeat how many times you want to, so it can be fun a few times if played with some friends.Speaking of friends:THE CO OP:This game is excellent to play in co op with some buddies, running around and killing zombies becomes more fun and looking around for resources becomes less tedious. Also, dying in the game can be pretty stressfull because it kills the ""momentum"", luckily coop deletes this issue because a friend can just pick you up when you die, even from a fall, so you don't have to restart somewhere far away, after a immersion killing loading screen, less interested in keeping to play.In the end, if you're a fan of zombie games, or first person games in general, or you want to spend some quality time with some friends, this is definetly a game worth buying. There's zombies. There's parkour. And if you have the DLC, there's dune buggies. What's not to love?			"

												After a few dark years of bad zombie games, we finally got one that's good!First off I didn't play Dying Light when it came out, I was pretty tired of the zombie genre. But after seeing it was on sale and  a good recommendation from my friend, I had to pick it up. This game runs super smooth with everything maxed (I'm on a 1070 and i5-6600k).  Everything from textures, animations, and lighting look great. Even the facial animations are above par which is one of the more difficult things to get right. So I have no complaints in the visual department.The gameplay is solid. Most of it will consist of melee combat but there are bows, crossbows, and guns. But all of those pale in comparison to the things you find to beat over the heads of zombies. There's a huge variety of melee weapons and I find it badass that I can electrify a wrench then zap a zombie with it. Also the deatils that appear on a weapon when you craft it into a zappy blunt force meat pulverizer is cool as hell. The parkour really is what makes this game awesome. The combat seemlessly flows into running up and onto walls. This makes for a very unique experience.There's also a fully fleshed out perk system that adds to the combat, crafting, and parkour.The only thing I don't like about Dying Light is the shift it takes in the second half. You change settings and personally I prefer the first area to the second, but that's just me and I have friends who feel opposite. Even with my one tiny problem I still think this is a great game that shows us why the zombie genre is awesome. I'd definitely recommend buying this whether it's on sale or not.			"

												About 55 hours took me to finish that game. And I need to say that was a good time with a great game.If you haven't played Dead Island:This is mix of zombie survival horror with parkour simulation and RPG elements like quests and character progression and all of this in open world. Is this good mix? It's more than good, it's great! And I need to say that literally all elements of that game work just fine. I haven't experienced any annoying bugs. Graphics and music/sound are excellent. This is absolute great game, you have to try it if you like good games.If you played Dead Island:This is very similar game, but improved in every aspect and many new possibilities are added. You will not find any places you can't reach, day/night mode is probably the best I've ever seen. If you liked Dead Island, you will love Dying Light.VERDICT:This is absolutely must have for all gaming maniacs.But if you're not gaming maniac, who the hell are you and what are you doing here?Like this review?

												Before I bought this game I had one overpowering thought: Dead Island was the most boring and unsatisfying zombie game I have EVER played.  Co-op was bland and rarely worked. Weapons that broke after 2 hits.  The same boring few enemies, including those big guys you couldn't hit.  Everywhere looked the same, getting lost was guaranteed and intensely frustrating. Dead Island is possibly the worst Co-op game I have played.Why am I talking about Dead Island? On first appearances, Dying Light looks like another Dead Island. I sat on the fence for a while before buying this game.  I'm glad I did try it.  It's nothing like Dead Island.The weapons are varied and fun, the ability to climb and move around the scenery pretty much everywhere is well thought out and implemented.  Co-op works straight away with no fuss and has some good features.  Set a waypoint on the map and you can race the other players in your session there.  You don't have to, but the winner get a bit of extra XP (and bragging rights).  It's a nice feature that makes things that bit more entertaining.Your weapons don't instantly break either. Enemies are interesting and varied. You rarely feel safe. See what I mean by ""It's nothing like Dead Island""?The skill trees are full of both useful and entertaining options. I felt myself looking forward to each new skill, there was always something to aim for.  (insert nothing like dead island again) The variety of night and day cycles was a great choice by the developers. Night time is not nice, but the rewards are sometimes worth the risks.  TLDR: Nothing like Dead Island, great game, play it! "

												Well after about 50 or so hours of playing this game and grabbing everything I pretty much can, I feel like I need to write a review on it! (With lots of Dead Island hate)Short review: It's basically what Dead Island should have been but mixed in with some Far Cry, Mirrors Edge, and a little bit of Assassins Creed elements.  If you want a superior Dead Island get this.LONG REVIEW TIME:PROS:Better story (as far as a zombie game goes): As far a a zombie game story goes this is a lot better than Dead Island.  Basically- oh yeah SPOILER ALERT -you're a man named Kyle Crane who is dropped into the infected city of Harran to find some guy that has stolen a very important file from the GRE.  And guess what happens the minute you get dropped in? You get bit, of course, lazy pr^$k couldn't move fast enough.  There aren't many twists and turns in the story, but there are some very interesting parts here and there but not much else.Characters: Compared to Dead Islands bland Characters, these actually have some soul to them (Take that for what you will) each one is pretty interesting, some are kind of bland, but not as bland as the ones in Dead Island anyway.  Each one seems to have some weight to it or at least some emotion.Fighting the Biters: Fighting the zombies actually feels like it has some weight to it, with each hit you make, each gunshot, everything.  It doesn't feel as lifeless as it does in Dead Island with swings or with guns.  The hit sounds are solid, the impact and weight with each swing you make, the bone breaking for biters, everything, it feels pretty solid.Scavenging for items: To craft good weaponry or even some distracting tools, you need items found throughout the world.  Aerosal, sawblades, chemicals, ductape, everything you find is useful in someway or another.  This is how you make throwing stars, strong elemental weapons, explosives, and more.  Plus my OCD says ""GRAB EVERY DAMN THING YOU SEE.""  Not only that but almost every single building you go towards you can go into and scavange for some loot, very nice touch that you can enter most of the buildings to get stuff.Traps: There are traps riddled throughout the world that you can use to your advantage, like a car trap.  It sets off the alarm and the zombies gather around it, after about 5 alarm horns it goes off with an electric shock, pretty much killing everything in the area around it.  Or like the electric fence, which makes a loud high pitched screech to draw enemies over, then zaps the fences below them with electricity, useful for dealing with enemies on your tail.Different enemy types: There are different enemies instead of just zombies.  There are the Spitters from Left 4 dead except they are even MORE ANNOYING.  Demolishers, which as basically just really big buff zombies that can knock down a lot of your health and get quite annoying.  The Runner Zombies, they are basically runners that have been infected, they're as fast as you, and can climb up buildings to catch you. The prison zombies (I suppose this is what they're called) they are basically just a beefed up version of the regular biters except with a big piece of Concrete Rubar that will hurt you with the swing and knock you over if you're too close.  Hazmat zombies that can't get caught on fire, but have a air tank on their back, hit the tank, and BOOM.  The Volatiles, they come out at night to patrol and can sense you if you get too close, this basically goes as a cop system like GTA, the longer they chase you the more will follow, and the longer they'll try to search for you if you lose them.  And then my most HATED ENEMY EVER, the Suiciders, which can kill you instantly if you are within like 2 meters of them.Weapon Variety: There are a lot of weapons you can get, each has it's own little property based off what it is, bone breaking, slicing off body parts, etc.  AND THE GUNS ACTUALLY WORK LIKE F%#KING GUNS.  Headshots apply to pretty much everything except for volatiles I believe, they do have some damn good sounds, and the impact of shooting a enemy is very rewarding.Parkour!: How could I forget one of the most entertaining things of this game?  Years after Mirrors Edge came out i've been trying to scratch a very unbearable itch mainly because that game left me with wanting more of it, and since Dice is lazy with making the 2nd game, I kept hearing about this game and it has free running properties, thankfully it's done correct.  It doesn't feel like a mess, it feels very fluid, except for when you start off when you trip over every thing you see and grab onto, but it keeps you on your toes when you are being chased by the Volatiles.Progression/level up: Progressing with your level in this game is pretty good, there are 3 types of levels.  Survivor, Agility, and Power, and each is leveled up based off of what you do.  Survivor is for helping people out with quests, getting air drops and giving them to the quarter master for some experience, or exploring and helping people in need.  Agility is for parkouring around the place, the longer/more deadly the jump, the more points you get from it, meaning the more dangerous things you do the more point you'll get from it.  Power is what you do to hurt biters, can be throwing stars, your own melee weapons, guns, traps, anything, even just smacking the zombie with your fist will get you points for it.Day and night Cycle: people complain about the Day and Night cycle because it isn't introduced at first, which it isn't, but I think that's a good thing, I don't want to roam around at night not knowing what's gonna happen.  After a few missions it introduces you to the day and night cycle and it works correctly, plus all of your Power and Agility points are doubled at night since it's so risky to go out.CONS:THE F#%KING SUICIDERS: I hate these damn zombies the most, not only are they a pain to get away from, they aren't obvious from the rest of the crowd.  Need a example?  I was on the bridge trying to get to the top, while walking on the bridge and going through the zombies, there was one with his back turned, I figured ""Ah why not"" I hit him, BOOM, dead.  Turns out it was a stupid suicider zombie, but THEY ARENT OBVIOUS ENOUGH.  They blend in with the common infected so well it just starts to get annoying, like if you're in a battle with lots of zombies and they are blocking your path and you have to kill them, and then a suicider just waltzs in behind them and you hit him you just screwed yourself because of it.  I'm not saying they should get taken out, i'm saying I wish they were more obvious to see and identify.The grappling hook: This isn't a con becuase I don't like it, it works great, but it's Kyle when he uses it.  If you grapplehook to certain things Kyle I guess goes artard for a moment and doesn't want to grab onto whatever I aimed it at.  Like one time I aimed up near a building roof and hooked at the edge, but instead of grabbing onto said edge and climbing up he just decided he wasn't even going to try and grab it, and then just fell and broke his legs.  Good going Kyle, a%#$ole.Throwable items: Most of the throwable items are really useless, like later you can make burning and freezing throwing stars, yet burning is the best out of them all since not just zombies but the enemy Humans will start flailing around a little giving you time to attack.  And then the explosives, the only useful one is the Explosive firecrackers since they gather around it and blows them all up.CONCLUSION: After playing Dead Island and then Dying Light, Dying Light is clearly superior, and since i'm running out of a word length, i'll just say this, it gets a 8/10 singleplayer, and a 9/10 for Co-op, it's fun, it's entertaining, and I haven't gotten bored of it since.  I'm not going to let AngryJoe or Benjamin ""Yahtzee"" Croshaw get in my way of saying it's another zombie game.  It's a lot of f%$king fun.			"

												Impressions with pictures here, review will be amended when I finish the game: http://gamewalkers.com/games/dying-light/articles/dying-light-impressions/Words:It was a bit hard to be hopeful about Dying Light. You see, I didn’t like Techland’s last zombie effort, Dead Island, all that much. I found it tedious and repetitive. The crafting system was cool but combat was quite a drag. I actually disliked it to the point that, when I originally saw early Dying Light footage, and it looked a bit like “Dead Island with grappling hooks and parkour,” I dismissed it, thinking that it would retain the overwhelmingly tedious combat that was present in Dead Island, only making getting around easier.After about four hours of play, I can honestly say that I could not have been more wrong. Dying Light, while still presenting combat that takes effort, has removed the tedium by quite a bit. Sure, you won’t be killing zombies in one hit with a pipe but you certainly aren’t going to be watching yourself chip away at a zombie’s health bar while his friends attempt to overtake you the way that Dead Island and its semi-sequel did. It’s challenging, it’s fluid, and it really feels like you’re fighting something that has a fair chance of killing you if you aren’t careful.This is helped quite a bit by the fact that the game provides mobility that I didn’t expect in combat, in addition to outside of it. In Dying Light, you can sidestep and backstep, as well as sliding at zombies, possibly tripping them, kicking zombies can send them flying if done right, or maybe just knock them down, you can bound over zombies that you’re fighting...the entirety of combat has been built around the idea that you’re a guy that would possibly want to get around fast. It’s not always about killing the zombies but, perhaps, just making sure that you have enough time to escape their grasp.And escaping will be an absolute joy, at that. Once you’ve kicked them down, or killed them if you actually had the chance, you can leap and bound over almost anything you can see. If you can see and reach a ledge, you can climb it. It is pretty much that simple. To say I was astounded at the sheer amount of scenery that I could scale wouldn’t cover it. The game rivals Assassin’s Creed’s openness while providing less automation, giving the player the utmost control over their actions. Even dropping down from one ledge to another, a simple action made extremely complicated in many games, is made extremely simple in Dying Light.Amongst all these great mechanics, you will be spending a lot of time scavenging, though. It is a post-apocalyptic game through and through. Resources for crafting medkits, amongst other items, will be crucial to survival. Simply bounding over enemies won’t always cut it. Eventually, you will slip and fall, or you will need something from a vendor, and, if you haven’t been scavenging, you might be screwed. Sometimes, you may even have to pick locks. The game uses a lockpicking system similar to the Elder Scrolls series, only a bit more forgiving. I was honestly a bit surprised that a system like that was used and not one based more on luck.This is alright, though. Getting around is easy and scavenging is made easy by “Survivor Sense,” which is essentially a short-range radar for lootable items. If that weren’t enough, if you play in co-op, the game provides “Competitions,” such as collecting the most loot in a specific amount of time or doing the most damage to a larger zombie within a specified amount of time, that you can sidetrack to keep yourselves busy during a long bout of scavenging. Scavenging may be necessary but the game does everything in its power to break up the monotony of running from house to house, collecting things.Speaking of co-op, it actually works rather well. For the first time in ages, there was no discernable lag during a co-op game, with one of the people being on the opposite end of the country from the others. I don’t know if they use some sort of lag smoothing techniques or something similar but they did rather well hiding even the slightest hint of lag. Every player’s movement is incredibly smooth throughout. It also doesn't hurt that they included in-game VoIP that worked without any extra setup.It’s also well-designed in terms of gameplay. In addition to the Competitions mentioned previously, players can also sacrifice medkits to heal each other, as well as reviving downed allies. Players can rest easy about their loot, as well. Each player can loot each loot source independently. Zombies, lockboxes, cupboards, you name it; each player gets a separate set of loot from each. This is exceptionally welcome as the resources for critical items, medkits even more so than weapon repair materials, are scarce enough to begin with. Imagine four players fighting over a single player’s medkit resources. That doesn’t sound all that enticing.I wish that, at this point, I could talk a bit about the story but, put simply, four hours into the game, I still have no idea what is going on. All I know is that you’re undercover, attempting to get back some stolen file, and some of the local residents are less than reputable. The cast seems rather well-balanced personality-wise and I have yet to meet a character that felt boring or out of place, other than those that don’t talk at all, but the fact of the matter is that, four hours later, I still don’t have any idea what is going on in the city of Harran. It gives me a bit of hope, though, that the game will be lengthy and the story rife with commendable plot twists.Now, I’ve said quite a number of words about my thoughts on Dying Light after four hours of play but the most important of them come down to this. If you had told me that the first game of the new year to suck me in for a four hour first play session would be a zombie game, I probably would have laughed at the notion. From the outset, Dying Light exceeds all expectations and creates an experience that is genuinely fun and well-designed. It remains to be seen what will happen once my character has been upgraded a bit more but I am more than hopeful that it will only become more entertaining from here.			"

												This is an incredibly awesome game. I'll admit I was expecting an average mindless zombie game, but I was completely wrong,  I was really impressed with it.It mixes elements of the best games out there and does it flawlessly this was the biggest surprise of 2015 to me, and its a real shame it is not a GOTY contender. It came out too early in the year and people forgot about it.Absolutely thrilling ride. Totally recommended.			"

												The light is dying, you are alone  stop your crying, you're in a safe zone.  Dying Light is a zombie infested open world action adventure game with RPG elements, a very fun combat system and a campaign story that drives it all forward. It has its frustrating faults but not enough of them to ruin the experience.  So, you are thrown into a zombie infested slum city and you need to survive. Do you pick up that tire iron on the floor there? Climb the tallest building, curl up in a ball and cry? Run like that one dude in that movie? It's up to you, Dying Light does not care how you play and just rewards you for doing anything but dying. There are three different progression systems: agility; level by running & climbing, power; points for killing things, survivor; helping people and progressing. All systems offer ability points to spend on passive and active skills that can sometimes be a hit and miss. Some improve the gameplay while others actually hinder your abilities (yay grappling hook, nay tic tac wall jumping).   The ""agility"" aspect of the game, a more passive approach, is all about running around zombies, climbing buildings assassin's creed style and general parkour shenanigans. While ""power"", a more aggressive play style, offers different ways to killing zombies such as ground pounding with heavy melee weapons or conjuring shrapnel explosives for maximum blood spray. While gunpowder based weapons exist and are plentiful later in the game, the meat of the action is melee combat. Light and heavy weapons weigh off speed vs damage and feel right when wielding. Katana swords swiftly cut through flesh and rotten bone whiles heavy axes bludgeon and crush skulls. Weapons do break and will have to be fixed (limited amount) and later replaced for better ones. Weapons can also be modified for extra damage, speed and conditional effects such as electricity, poison or fire.  Of course this would all be nothing without a zombie wonderland to explore. The campaign takes you around two different stylized maps: Brazilian-like slum ridden outskirts and a European styled old town. Both are large enough to get lost in and provide a handful of things to do. Quarantine zones - filled with lots of loot and zombies, different challenges based on the agility and power play styles mentioned earlier, safe houses to secure and side quests that can be fun (and some are fairly well written) but the majority revolves around fetch quests. A saddening fact considering the writers had such an unique world to play with. Luckily the main campaign story is more entertaining. You can of course forgo the story and play at your own pace. After all it is a sandbox at its core.  I played the game in co op and had a lot of fun doing it. 30 hours spent while I could easily dive in for more. If you like killing zombies, fast paced action in an open world with a sense of direction if only you need it, look no further.			"

												This game taught me many things about real life:Episode 1: I was locked out of my house last week, and I realized I had a paper clip and pocket knife in my car. I figured, ""this will be a cinch"" I started to pick my lock: click, click. Sh%#. Paper clip broke. Yep, lock is ruined. *Hops wall, grabs key from under mat, and enters through back door* Wife: ""Why the hell did you come in from the back?"" Me: ""I locked myself out"" Wife: ""Why didn't you just knock?"" Me: ""I've been trying to learn parkour."" *parkour into back room* Pursuit evaded.Episode 2: I have to take the trash out, but it's getting dark outside. Wife: ""the trash is still overflowing"" Me: ""True, but its almost dark. I don't think I can risk it."" Wife: ""Risk what?"" Me: *looks at couch; chooses to wait until morning* I wake up. Wife: ""now that it's light out, how about that trash?"" Me: ""HELL YEAH. DOING IT!"" *Grabs machete out of closet; ties up trash bag* Wife: ""what the hell is with the sword?"" Me: *parkour into front yard* Trash delivered. I feel stronger. Episode 3: It's night time. Wierd noise on roof. Feeling unusually brave, I grab my new teddy bear (aka my machete) from under my pillow. Using my parkour skills I climb up my aluminum rain gutter. Rain gutter buckles under my weight and I crash to the ground. Startled, the cat on my roof scampers away. Mission accomplished. Episode 4: My wife and I make dinner. I am cutting vegetables with a Hardened Beef Cleaver. I go to the bedroom and grab my Machete. I lay the Machete and Beef Cleaver on the counter. Me: ""Which of these is better?"" Wife: ""For what? Why have you been acting so wierd lately?"" Me: ""Agreed."" *Chops carrots with machete* 11/10 Would take this course again in the Spring.The Following taught me even more about real life: Episode 5: Been training for awhile now with Teddy. Let’s just say we eat a lot of squirrel for dinner. Came across a Javelina unexpectedly while trying to fix our stupid water pump (living in SW USA) and realized my skills weren’t exactly “legendary.” Teddy failed. I failed. I ran. Wife understood, but I could see the disappointment in her eyes. So, naturally, I think, “F-THIS” *Jumps through kitchen window; hoofs it to the tool shed* *Sets Teddy on the workbench, grabs tazer, duct tapes tazer to Teddy, wraps metal wiring from tazer around blade, activate tazer, Teddy lights up like a F’in Christmas tree*YEAH! *Heads back to water pump* Javelina is there, staring me in the GD face like a drunken frat kid. “OH, I’LL COME AT YOU BRO” *Charges Javelina, Teddy sparks like a damn firework*Wake up 3 days later in the hospital with a giant gash in my side. I see the blurry outline of my wife, “Did I get him?” Wife: “No, he got away; the cops took your weapon.” I pass out again. Episode 6: After some time at the hospital, I come home, wrap some alcoholic gauze around my arm like thirty times, and I’m back to full strength.  Wife: “Did you hurt your arm too?” *Looks at gauzed up hand* Me: “I need more firepower.” *Looks at wife* Me: “Honey, do you trust me?” Wife: “No! I absolutely do not trust your judgment right now. You just nearly died!” Me: “Exactly! We need wheels.” *Grabs car keys, limps out the door* Me: “I’m gonna need more gauze.” Episode 7:  I return home with PigF$&%er, my sweet new buggy. I honk the horn in the driveway. I stand brandishing my recovered Teddy in all his glory and as my wife opens the door, I activate taze mode. Teddy lights up like a damn sword with a tazer attached to it. Wife: *closes door* I realize she’ll only love me again if I kill this swine. *Buggy screeches out into the night* Experience Doubled.

												This game is incredible for some portions. I was lucky enough to get a preview build from Techland, and finally a final copy earlier this morning. I have been playing the game in Offline mode for roughly 13 hours now - almost close to the ending in Normal Difficulty.A lot of people will tell me ""This is just Dead Island but with Parkour.."" Which would be true, but the game's characters, the storyline, the various side-quests and unique random interactions make this game far more magical than Dead Island could ever hope to be. The only issues I have so far is the day/night cycle and the characters lip syncing and their mannerisms. The Day/Night cycle is AWFUL. I'm sorry Techland, but it is! You would think it is tied to a real-time day/night cycle...but it's not! It is cleverly marketed as a ""Dynamic Day/Night Cycle,"" which is SOMEWHAT true. It is dynamic in the sense that the zombies get super aggressive at night compared to during the day, but the entire DAY/NIGHT cycle is tied to quests. It does not become night until the quest says so. Don't expect to stand around and it to turn night-time. Doesn't happen! It will be day-time forever as long as the quest dictates it will be. Severely disappointing and false advertising in my opinion.In terms of character lips, I completely hate how ""last-gen"" the lip sync is to the animation of the dialogue. We should not have characters that seem like they have been generically dubbed over as they say ""Something wrong?"" and it could be ""How is everything?"" The audio just poorly matches the lips...very annoying. Secondly, I find the mannerisms unrealistic. When you are running from an intense night-time mode or having just been invaded by the hunter (which several devs did in my game as I believe I'm one of the few playing it along with some notable YTers, etc.) and you get to a safe zone - the characters proceed as if NOTHING happened. Like you didn't just come gunning from hell. They walk around casually...and tend to say the same thing across all safe zones. Poor.All in all, the game is worth the buy, especially if you have the Oculus Rift DK2. I played it on the Oculus Rift DK2, and there were definitely dizzying moments to the game. I had to stop playing after 25 minutes. Perhaps its just me, but the character wobbling up and down as he runs may need to be adjusted to prevent people from vomiting in VR.How much would I personally pay for Dying Light? $39.99. Not $59.99. I think a -$20 ding is appropriate for the two annoying issues that are definitely immersion breaking.PLAYTIME INFO: UNLOCKED by devs at 7 AM PST. Only 2 hours logged because of a different steam beta/program branch for early pre-retail access. PLEASE NOTE - the review went live at 12:01AM with 2.6 hours logged (this would be impossible for a non-video game critic as the game did not unlock until 12 AM PST worldwide) - so please do keep this in mind before insulting my integrity.UPDATES TO REVIEW:Many people have mentioned they have realtime day/night past the intro quests. I and many others do not however even after several hours into the game past the introductory quests. Techland may have to solve this issue as it could possibly be system specific or hopefully not random.UPDATE # 2:After reinstalling and updating  some files/verifying integrity and speaking with Andy at Techland - I finally have ""dynamic"" Day/night cycling. Why on earth it did not happen in 13 hours for me in my Day 1 playthrough = no idea. Devs had no answer for me either, and some of my friends are still struggling with it.  Again, these things become more apparent only after a lot of people get their hands on the game and different systems put it to the test. For those saying I rushed, I assure you as I have before -I did not rush for the day/night cycle to have an impact...or maybe I did. I cannot be sure. I played it very normally - but focused solely on main quests. My point stands in DAY/NIGHT cycle being awful. Most of the game is day-time, with little to no variation in the actual day to night variance. As many have mentioned, the ratio of Day:Night is very large, so it's mostly daytime. They should have kept it realtime. At least the day/night is not tied to the quests solely, and I guess this serves as some reprise to my former statements in the review.			"

												Somewhere between a fantastic City Sandbox, a fair Survival Game and an interesting Parkour world. With some forgiveable failures and interesting genre meshes, it's a fun time if you can forgive the dumb story and lack of realistic parkour and survival gameplay.HighlightsMost people like to call this ""Dead Island done right"", and I'd agree, but I'd also call it Assassin's Creed done right, and reference a few other games it beats in terms of mechanics and solid gameplay. It takes elements from lots of other games, and doesn't add anything, but enhances them to the point that they fit very well and add to the game.* The tech tree is basic but good, and works well as a progression and goal system offering useful and interesting additions and upgrades.* Parkour is basic but good, and makes you love running from building to building while escaping the grasp of the hoards.* The crafting system is basic but good, and gives you a desire to scavenge and collect.* The combat, exploration and world are all fairly basic with mistakes, but overall good.Mistakes and AnnoyancesThere are a few problems with Dying Light, and they're mostly what you'd expect from an AAA title, but they're mild enough, or the rest of the game is good enough, that they're forgiveable. Most of the problems and negatives of the game stem from the fact that it tries to be too many things, presumably because of the publishers demands, and the lack of focus on story or survival means this game doesn't become anything special.* The storyline is complete trash. The characters are one dimensional, often unbelievable, and even side quests have bland, boring plots and dialogue. There is no character development at all, and basically no arc or story curve other than perhaps a couple of characters from early quests being dotted throughout the second half of the game.* Small design mistakes are frustrating, for example locked doors being interactable but locked serves only to waste time. There are plenty instances of things like this that are small but jarring.* The voice acting is a mixed bag of fairly good and terrible.RecommendationsPriced at £39.99/49.99€/$59.99 at the time of review. Personally I don't think any game is worth this much, but compared to other triple A's its pricetag isn't too inflated. It works out a quarter cheaper if you have friends and use the 4-Pack option. Wait for a saving of at least 50% for this to be better value for money.The DLC scheme is a complete joke. The Ultimate Survival Bundle offers 2 Quarantine Zones, which were one of the most boring parts of the game. The Bozak Horde is worse, offering badly designed co-op trials. You can bet the 3rd planned DLC will be equally awful. In short, completely ignore the DLC.			"

												The apology for Dead Island we all wanted.I got this gifted, and having just finished the main games' story and all the side missions, I can vouch for this being super amazing. Coop-ing with a friend, I've enjoyed slaughtering my way through zombies combined with neat parkouring. So many great moments, so many laughs. It also has a good mechanic for changing between single player story and playing it with someone, and from what I've heard you can actually play 4 people at a time. Any competitions are optional, as are plenty of side missions, which is a good thing as the game is letting you decide where and when to go anywhere you like.Starting out can be tough, seeing you have no special skills to defeat the gnawing dead wanting you for their last supper. The games' brilliance, however, lies in letting you get points ALSO FOR RUNNING AWAY and AVOIDING danger, as well as combating enemies, so you always feel like you're winning and getting stronger by leveling up three different skill trees.This helps greatly with any frustration you might experience when dying many times over. You always have the choice of just running away and you'll get better at running, climbing and parkouring the more you practice - as in PLAYER skill, not just character skill. So it's a win/win most of the time. The occasional slip from a ledge or grabbing hold of the wrong parkour point is only minor and doesn't in the slightest detract from a superb game.Definitely worth your money and your time, this is one of the best and funniest game experiences I've had in a while. Get this and enjoy it alone or with friends - I guarantee super good times either way.Edit: I just finished the expansion and my review may as well count for that as well. Add some cool and fun buggies to the already fun gameplay and we are all set for zombie survival.			"

												Been playing Dying Light for a while now and I am impressed with how much better Dying Light is to its predecessors. Below I have made a tidy review for you to read.    [/tr]    [/tr] [/tr] Pros Detail  Large open world The world is large with many areas to explore. There are 2 main maps in the standalone game (Slums & Old Town) each with their own unique feel. Many buildings in the game can also be entered   Weapons In true Techland fashion, there are a plethora of weapons. From Axes, daggers and swords to crossbows, rifles and revolvers.    Great optimisation  Initially I was quite worried about whether I could run this game. I'm using an I5 4570s with a GTX 580 and managed to easily get 60 frames whilst on near maximum settings.  Upgrades If you've played any of the Dead Island games, you'll know about upgrades. Find 'blueprints' which you can use to craft weapon 'mods' such as an electric machete. There are dozens scattered all around the map, many with different effects which you can use to beef up your gear.  Attention to detail. Techland really went all out. The world is absoloutly stunning. The use of animation on trees, shrubs and clothing really adds life to Harran making it less dull and making it more alive. Another little detail is the changes your weapon undergoes after heavy use which is a nice touch http://imgur.com/a/9U0cZ   Day/night cycles  Dying Light features a day and night cycle. In the day expect a glistful warm sun beaming across Harran. At night, expect pitch-black darkness and heavy storms. The day/night cycles and weather changes are the most realistic I've ever seen in game.   Combat  Decapitation galore. Dying Light's combat system has been overhalled since Dead Island. The are a range of weapons that can be used and depending on what you use, they will have a different effect on the enemy. Sharp weapons like swords allow you cut enemies in half, down the middle and allow you to target body parts such as heads and limbs. Blunt weapons like hammers may allow you to break bones which will be shown through an Xray when done correctly  http://im.ziffdavisinternational.com/ign_it/screenshot/default/x-ray_6zfk.jpg Human enemies also provide a challenge and will attempt to dodge attacks, block attacks and throw missiles when you're out of reach.   Parkour/Free Running  One of the main selling points was Dying Light's movement system. The Parkour system is done really well and the upgrade tree allows access to new moves such as sliding, wall runs, Kong vaults and combat rolls. You will be using Parkour for most the game and because it's  been done so well, navigating areas is fluid and fun.  Free DLC (duh!)  Techland upgraded Dying Light to the Enhanced Edition which is automatically applied when you buy (or redeem a key of) Dying Light. This DLC includes a brand new map with 10s of hours of new content, free! The Enhanced Edition also provides new clothing, dune buggy skins, challenges and weapon mods.   Cons Detail   Loot Although I like the idea of scavenging areas for loot, I feel like there wasn't much variety in terms of what items you can get from looting. Most chests  nearly always offered me items like coffee, nails or gause, much to a point where I practically knew what a box would hold. There are many items in the game, why not use them?   Difficulty Normal difficulty felt too easy. Items are always in abundance meaning powerful weapons can be crafted too quickly. Unless you're playing on Nightmare mode, you will have stacks upon stacks of resources. I had over $200k & a top-tier inventory upon completing the game. To put that into context, a top tier weapon might cost between $12k-$25k    Ending  Without adding spoilers, I don't like the idea of quicktime events on an ending; however, this is open to debate. Overall I would give this game 85/100 due to the large amount of content, beautiful maps and the great combat system. "

Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.I've been looking forward to Dying Light for nearly 2 years (I had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer during its release, and had to save up for a much better one), and the whole time, I've been hearing things like, ""This is what Dead Island SHOULD have been"" and ""This is Dead Island... If Dead Island was a good game"".Well, I can tell you with 100% certainty that this game is everything Dead Island should have been and MORE.The gameplay is actually challenging, the crafting was improved, and the parkour just feels SO ♥♥♥♥ing natural. Unlike Mirror's Edge, the parkour doesn't feel forced and controlled, it feels like you're actually DOING the parkour.Basically, if you liked Dead Island at all, or played it and felt like there was something missing:Get Dying Light.If you're a fan of fun: Get mother♥♥♥♥ing Dying Light.Seriously, do it. You won't be disappointed. "

												This is a game worth playing. There is no easy mode, there is no easy way to play. Its either run, fight, or die. Thats what makes this game worth playing. The story is one of the best that I have played in years. The graphics are fantastic even on the lower settings. The parkour is actual well developed, rather well thought out, and fun. The killing of zombies.... Thats just fun. Smashing a zombies head to pieces is just so relaxing. The maps are expansive, and they merge quite well. I have beaten the game, and I'm still playing it. That is a testament to what a years wait has brought us.On a side note there are a few graphical glitches and in game glitches, although they are far and few between. For users of crossfire with massive FPS drops, turn off crossfire.Good Night to all, and Good Luck.			"

												I'll be short. There are already many reviews, most of them positive. Nothing more to add, the game is good. Solo, coop or PvP, the game is good for who play fair.As i'm writing these words, the community of Dying Light is full of cheaters who use modded weapons builded by few hackers and duplicated ingame by who know how to use glitches... and everyone know or can easily learn how to do it. The first times you play, you'll meet many players who will give you weapons for free, automatic crossbows, gold weapons... All these will ruin your solo experience. There is no need to be overpowered to enjoy the Dying Light solo game. The skill tree is, in my opinion, very well balanced for that. Cheating will ruins the fun.I have more than 800h of gameplay, finished 4-5 times the game solo and then played PvP. I played with modded weapons and reached final human PvP rank. Then i replayed again & again without these modded weapons, with all legit stuff, for more fun, based only on my skills... and reached final human PvP rank again, of course. And it's really more fun!Even if hunter uses glitches to move faster, counterattack when not allowed, Dying Light is a game of CHALLENGE! Challenge yourself in solo session with legit gameplay, challenge others without modded weapons, challenge cheaters by showing them they still can loose.			"

												I put 60 hours into this game in 6 days, finishing the main story and doing every side quest.Every side quest.All of them.The short version is, ""Dead Island but not bad"". The long version?Dying Light is an open-world zombie game with a focus on melee combat. However, unlike its predecessor, Dead Island, Dying Light also has a new mechanic: Parkour. The beginning of the game has you weak to the point of single zombies being threatening presences and parkour being something of a slow endeavor with an inivisible stamina bar that quickly depletes. However, interestingly, the game rewards you with experience and skill points not only for engaging in combat, but also for running from it, and surviving in general- in fact, each activity contributes to its own skill tree, Power, Agility, and Survivor, respectably. The parkour, after a bit of getting better at it- both in level and player skill- makes combat in many areas almost entirely optional, and in fact seems to encourage you to skip over it. The combat on the other hand starts you off as sluggish, clueless, and easily tired, forcing you to bash even single zombies over and over again. However, as you progress through the skill tree, rather than simply increasing numerical values- though that does happen, it happens mostly through the weapons you find- it also feels like the combat maneuvers you learn have actual uses that make you more effective. The crafting and looting is never too intrusive, though it would have been nice to have an option to make more than one medkit at once. The main game's story is nothing particularly amazing, but it has its moments- a particular sequence pretty late in the game comes to mind, as well as  much of the finale, QTE final boss notwithstanding. If that's not enough, the game comes with The Following, a follow-up to the main story that has similar mechanics but adds in a focus on driving and upgrading a buggy, complete with a brand new skill tree. Again, the story is not particularly amazing- though, I will say, its ending had me quite surprised. With how relatively lukewarm the ending of the main game was, the ending of The Following, which wraps up the plot for good, caught me off guard by hitting hard and fast, and not pulling any punches, though I wish it had been foreshadowed a bit more. Rambling and gushing aside, this is an excellently-balanced and dynamic RPG, with plenty of distractions for the easily-distracted, mechanics for the mechanically-minded, and zombies for hitting with sticks.I rarely like games as much as I like Dying Light, so with how few problems it has, I can't in good concious give it anything less than a 10.

												To be honest the storyline was pretty predictible BUT don't let that stop you from buying this game. It was and it still is a joy for me to play everyday. I always find something to do when I run, jump around places. Should've been more quarantine zones and more side quests for people like me but still with all the things coming our way as DLCs and patches, I'm probably going to be playing this game a lot more. Definitely a must buy!			"

About the Game: Dying Light is a first person ""parkour zombie"" game. Think... Mirror's Edge with zombies, with healthy amounts of Far Cry 3/4's climbing and skill point systems. The story has been done many times before; you're dropped into a post-plague infested area full of zombies, and work with the survivors to restore order. You have access to minimal abilities and weapons at the beginning, and grow your character throughout the game. You gather allies, weapons, and materials to use in the games wonderfully built crafting system. Your skills are divided up into 3 categories: survival, power, and agility. You gain small amounts of xp whenever you jump onto a roof (agility) or crack a zombie in the head with a baseball bat (power), then use those points to gain more skills do better adapt to the challenges that the game throws at you. There is always plenty to do. Too often I was running through zombie infested streets on my way to a quest marker when I was sidetracked by something that just happened. Oh look, a pharmacy! I should head in and see if I can loot some valuable meds. Oh look, a zombie all alone, I'll bash his skull in. Oh look, a plane flying overhead, I'd better run that way to grab the supply airdrop before another faction gets a hold of it. Oh look, a safehouse I need to take control of. And the sun is about to set...Night time is absolutely terrifying, and really changes the game up a lot. This isn't Skyrim where everything is dark, but you can still see. It's pitch f*cking black, and all you have is a flashlight. Thank god slenderman isn't creeping around the corner. Nearly as terrifying though are the volatile zombies that will pursue you in packs, should they spot you. Or the hunters, which are actually other players invading your game playing through the ""be the zombie"" mode! Thankfully you can sleep through the night at any safe house you've secured. Time passes throughout the game and if you aren't back by nightfall, bad things happen.Pros:Gorgeous graphics, beautiful environment, terrifyingly awesome looking zombies.Intense sound, especially at night. I dare you not to spike your heartrate while being pursued by volitilesTight controls, playing with a controller feels natural and responsiveGreat use of questing, crafting, and skill systems to make you feel like you're growing stronger throughout the game.There are a TON of things to do!Cons:A little buggy. I ran into a few minor issues, but nothing to interrupt the game. I've heard some people having more major issues but it's been very minimal for meThe story isn't quite as fleshed out as it feels like it could have been. There are a ton of interesting characters, factions, conflicts, etc. But the game doesn't spend long enough on any of them for you to really feel invested. Still, there's enough here to give you a reason to keep going.Conclusion: I love this game. It combines elements from Mirror's Edge, Far Cry 3/4, Dead Island, Dark Souls, and Skyrim into a ridiculously fun package. Did I mention there's co-op? Oh ya, there's co-op. 9.5/10 Buy this game.

												Dying Light is the follow up game to Dead Island from the polish developer Techland, but will it be worth your time ?Dying Light puts you in the shoes of Kyle Crane a GRE operative sent into the Turkey city of Harran to find a man named Rais who is a political figure gone rogue who has a file that could destroy the GRE. When you arrive there you find yourself fighting against Rais and helping other survivors led by Brecken.The story is this games biggest weakness. The story is beyond horrific, with much of the plot holes not making much sense. Not to mention throughout the game you meet a lot of characters and the game expects you to be emotionally attached to them in the more emotional moments in the game. But that is impossible when the characters you meet are incredibly stupid. Almost all the characters are useless and you find yourself not caring for any of them.The gameplay is amazing and is  a massive step up from the previous Dead Island titles. The combat is way smoother and not as clunky as the combat in Dead Island. But of course the biggest reason this game is so huge is the parkour system. You can free run and climb up everything you see and it all works perfectly. It's incredibly fun just to take time off of doing main missions and just explore Harran at your own pace. The game also has a day and night cycle where during the night it's pitch black and more dangerous zombies emerge out of the dark corners of Harran. Early in the game night is the most frightening thing in the game as the zombies become stronger and faster. Graphics are top notch, everything looks outstanding maxed out, both the city and the slums are designed really well to fit the fast paced action of the game. The CO-OP is also a big feature in the game, but it feels kinda out of place with this game. Every character is Kyle Crane and it sort feels out of place. Not to mention the Prologue and the end game are both played Solo only so don't expect to jump into CO-OP straight away.The ""Be the zombie"" mode is also quite interesting. It's pretty fun to play as the zombie and it's also quite intense to fight the zombie as well. But there is a massive problem with this mode. It's incredibly hard to find a game, because as soon as you join a game the host drops out. But there is an awesome reward if you beat your opponent.The soundtrack is beyond amazing. The soundtrack is awesome 80's synth music and makes you feel like a zombie movie like Dawn of the Dead and some great movies from John Carpenter. I played the game CO-OP from the start. To complete every main quest, side quest and every quarantine zone took me 23 hours. After finishing the game you can always go back and explore Harran. There are also a lot of parkour challenges around the entire city so you can go play those. Not to mention the ""Be The Zombie"" mode, there is a ton to do in the game so you can expect hefty amount of play time.The game ran smoothly from start to finish. Never dropping any frames whatsoever, so if you have a strong rig, you shouldn't experience any issues. But there are still a ton of bugs, but nothing game breaking.Dying Light is a great game and a major step up from Dead Island and Dead Island: Riptide. While the story is horrific the game is fun enough to play through at least once. Final Rating:8.5/10 - Worth PurchasingIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												A mixture of AssCreed, Mirrors Edge, Far Cry 4 and Dead Island. All rolled up in one airtight zombie slaying terrain flying package. 50% of story in one map, the other 50% in another. Plus night time gameplay (scary as♥♥♥♥♥♥ makes it feel like 3 different game modes in one. Also, when playing with friends, you can turn everything into competitions. Get to the airdrop first, collect the most loot, kill the most infected. This is by far better than DI. And very fun to play. Even ""be the zombie"" multiplayer is fun. 9/10Good night, and good luck. No kidding. P.S. A couple additions after several of the same questions-Q-Are there any repair benches?A-Yes, but only cosmetic. :D You can repair when the weapon degrades, with each weapon having a set number of times you can repair them. Also, a perk increases the chances you won't use one of these ""number values"". Q-Special Infected?A-Yes. Ala ""L4D"" spitters, witches ( a freaky baby), 'bomber' zombies, and VOLATILES, the freaky night time super zombies.Q-Crafting?A-Yes! Weapon mods for burning, electric, toxic and force damage.EDIT: A year later and these guys are still bringing awesome updates. What a great developer...EDIT #2: 2 years later still more updates. This game gets more love than some early access titles...			"

Dying Light - The StoryNo other game came really close to what DL offered me in a wide comparison to the many zombie games I've played over the past 10 years. Dying Light offered what some would say to be a similar clone to Dead Island, but DL took it a few steps further and then some.As far as a story goes, it is somewhat predictable and a bit underwhelming at times, but the characters are believable and the voice actors do a fantastic job. Kyle Crane's VA does an especially good job. He is real and authentic and the few bits of his sarcasm and boldness towards others make him very believable. The music score in this game by the way is absolutely terrific. Definitely check it out if you get the chance.Dying Light - The BTZ Mode/DL's Primary FocusThe true greatness and entertainment from Dying Light can only come from it's BTZ (Be the Zombie) mode. This mode truly captivated me and the second I entered as a zombie I knew this game mode offered something very special. The abilities are great, the vast, agile, movement is extremely fun and the tendril locomotion was a brilliant idea in reaching any height or location necessary.The skill curve for both sides (Survivor & Night Hunter) is balanced in my opinion, but sometimes you can feel truly outmatched depending on where the nests (Survivor's goal in BTZ) spawn at. The BTZ mode always hinges on how you approach every scenario and how well you handle the spawns that you're given.BTZ is where Dying Light's core focus has been for me the past year and a half. The game should have always been centered on that and hopefully if the developers plan on ever releasing a second game, they will put more time and energy into a game mode similar to this. Unfortunately BTZ has seen the last of its greatest days due to the high volume of cheating weapons, items and present hacks that people use in the game.Without question though, DL proved to be one of the funnest zombie games I've played in recent memory and hopefully leaves a huge stake in the ground for years to come.

												I like this game. The parkour and the combat system make it feel like a more polished Dead Island. Content-wise it's very meaty and you get a good chunk of story to go along with several challenges and side quests.The game gets a bit too easy once you reach survivor rank 25 though. Weapons (when upgraded to the greatest extent) can kill Volatiles, Goons, and Demolishers in 1 or 2 hits. It makes the night phase a joke.As of writing this review, there are currently a handful of achievements that are bugged and one is definitely broken. Various players report very different experiences when it comes to how some of their achievements are tracked. I had a friend who I played co-op with for the entirety of the game and he ended up 1 quest short on his progress bar (we were stuck at 44/45 while he was stuck at 43/45) even though we played every single quest together.There's also a few glitches that were mildly annoying. I fell under the map once while travelling near a fishing village. A friend also has demonstrated the grapple hook glitch that pretty much sends you flying out of bounds.Now you may be thinking that with half of the interview mostly being about achievement bugs and glitches, I may not even recommend this game. Nevertheless, I'm still going to recommend it. I've enjoyed my fair share of zombie games and while the Dead Island games were kind of 'meh', I still enjoyed the open-world setting. Dying Light is a better version of Dead Island. I'm recommending the game because Techland's games are progressively improving. They just need to bring their A-game when it comes to the aforementioned bugs/glitches.			"

												So far dying light has been an great game. So I will just quickly sum up what I feel on the game so far.Graphics 9/10 - Although the game is hard to run at max settings even at medium settings the game is beautiful. The only thing I don't like is the film grain. Truly a ""2015""  experience.Combat 8/10 - The combat makes you feel like you are really trying to bash somethings brains out. The stamina system helps with this factor a lot because of the struggle it takes to kill something without your stamina.Movement 9/10 - The parkour in this game really gives you the rush of doing parkour, running from the strong as hell night zombies is really an experience. Parkour is what lets you live in this game, without it you would be dead.AI 7/10- The AI in this game is outstanding. I love how the sound is a big factor to the zombies and they  will chace you for a nice amount of time, but i do wish they would go back to hunting you as soon as a distraction wore off.Multiplayer 9/10 - It works, thats all I have to say. (Works very well)Final Verdict 8/10Should you buy this game? Yes. Its a good game if your PC can handle it.UPDATE 1: After beating the game I would like to say the mistakes of the game. One mistake is the game is just easy after you beat it. The game needs to be a lot more harder. A seconds mistake is you level up way to fast. A third mistake is the grappling hook is a little to strong, I think it should be only able to work on ledges above you and it should have shorter range. Over all the grappling hook removes the point of running away at night. So hopefully they will make the game harder, as for the grappling hook you can just not use it.			"

												After thoroughly enjoying the demo for this game, I buy it. About an hour in, I start to get a whole lot bolder. So i'm outside at about 20:00 (the night officialy comes at 21:00 and you don't want to be outside at this time) and I see a random encounter nearby. I think ""Yeah, I can do that real quick, no problem."" So I go and kill the group of Rais' men and it takes about 30 in game minutes. I start looting nearby buildings because there is a nearby safezone. 21:00 comes and I'm still outside (bad idea), the safezone is about 100 meters away and I don't have very good weaponry. Surrounded by Volatiles I think ""Well, I could just run..."" (also, a bad idea) so I take off running towards the safezone with about 4 Volatiles behind me. Just as I turn a corner *BAM* I literally RUN INTO A FREAKING VOLATILE. After my ears are filled with epic music and the sound of my own heart pounding (and almost peeing my pants) I turn the heck around and start running the other way not remembering, the four volatiles I was already running from. To make matters worse, there aren't many nearby buildings I can jump up into. So i hang a hard left towards the safezone and I see it, the safezone. Relief starts to creep up on me when something else comes to my attention, how do I get in? Whoops, I didn't figure out how to get into the safezone beforehand. Realising my mistake and misfortune, I break for the nearest safezone that I can guarantee I can get into, the Tower. Which, is about 200 or so meters from me. After about 100 meters worth of running, jumping, screaming (like a little girl) and frantic button pressing, I finally lose them atop a building which has 0% visibility. Yup, I'm stuck in a building and can't see much of anything outside except the Volatiles. I decide that the best course of action would be to stealth my way back. After a while, (which felt like a lifetime) I come up to a wall that I may or may not be able to climb, problem is, there are 3 Volatiles with there sights juuuuust away from me. Every bone in my body, every instinct that I have, were all saying in concert, ""RUN YOU IDIOT!!"", and of course, I did the exact opposite. Something inside me froze my fingers and everything just stopped. After a short time, one of the volatiles looks STRAIGHT AT ME and does its horrible scream thing. Completely motionless, i sit there until it's finished and has turned around. I successfully make it back to the tower without dying and realise, I LOVE THIS GAME			"

												Genre - Open world Zombie GameAbout me - I enjoyed all the Dead Island games I have played and am a fan of teh Walking DeadSo I got this game a while agon on the Steam sale. However, some new DLC being released got me to boot it up for the first time. I wasn't sure what to expect but had read about free running being used that I had probably only seen before in Titanfall and Mirror's Edge. This actually goes great in a zombie game when sometimes you just want to get passed and complete a quest.The weapons are very much like in Dead Island and you can craft and upgrade them. They all have limited uses so you can't get one powerful weapon and use it for the whole game. To help you there are guns, molotovs, bows and arrows and traps etc. You will also get upgrades for your toon to allow them to free run, fight and use resources more efficiently.You can jump into other players games or get them to join you. At night things get a lot more hectic with the ability of player invasions starting a mini-game (if activated) where they are the infected and you have to destroy nests. You will need to rely on your UV light to survive, and probbaly one or two allies.The story will keep you interested enough, and the various sub-quests will have you running around and interacting with various NPCs. The graphics look nice and the sound is atmospheric, the growl of the larger zombies still puts me on edge.If you were a fan of the Dead Island games you will definately enjoy this as it is ultimately more of the same, with more free running in the city but less sea and sand.

												This review is a bit overdue!I love this game! I'm typically horrible at games like this, so this was a welcome change for me. Music- 10/10 I really enjoyed the whole soundtrack. I even found myself hanging out in old town with the guy blaring a local radio station during my down time in between quests. Story- 9/10 Mildly predictable, but it's kind of hard to find something that hasn't been done nowadays so I'm pretty forgiving of this. I enjoyed the story regardless of the zombie genre being a bit overdone.Dialogue- 7/10 Love most of it(especially Stavi), sometimes I wanted to punch Rahid/Jade in the teeth though. Something about their characters just irritated the hell out of me everytime I had to deal with them.Visuals- 9/10 Very Solid, not groundbreaking, still looks pretty on low settings! :)Replayability- 7/10 Decent. Plenty of DLC if you're into that sort of thing. It keeps you busy and gives you something new to do for a while but I can see it getting repetitive.  "

												Dying Light is ""another zombie game"" but done right. In my opinion of course.Positives: +Parkour is great, its smooth and it works well. Not quite Mirrors Edge level smooth but not exactly far from it either. +Graphics are good, zombies look good and some very interesting. +Crafting, crafting is fun and sometimes necessary if you want to live/survive. +Progression, leveling up is always fun and adds a fun small RPG element to the game also tricks/skills are fun.+A lot of side quests. +Includes CO OP+Good combat.+'The Following' DLC that includes is a lot of fun. Includes a Buggy. +Great sound.Negatives: -Story isn't anything special, but characters and the protagonist make up for that. -Story is relatively short-Zombies look interesting but if you've played a Left 4 Dead game you know the zombie types.-First couple of hours are a little bit boring.-Final boss is a quick time event, a big let down. tl;dr: It's fun, but has a rough start.8/10			"

												Dying Light started off as an incredibly difficult, slow, and intimidating piece of work. Upon playing some more and becoming more in tune with the game, I realized it is truly a fantastic game. The combat certainly has a learning curve, and at the beginning of the game it is difficult sometimes to kill even one zombie let alone a horde, and the parkour is slow and you tire easy. As you play however, you get better, faster, and stronger. Soon you're able to destroy hordes of zombies and bad humans alike, and suddenly those impossible feats become possible with a little bit of practice. 100% recommend.In regards to the DLC, the Bozak Horde is actually quite enjoyable. Very difficult, and at times frustrating, but very rewarding especially in co-op. The Following, however, is everything a DLC hopes to be. It puts you into a (HUGE) new map and gives you a car and a new skill; driving. Speeding around the countryside ramming zombies in fields and using nitrus to outrun demolishers is incredibly fun and if I could go back and do it again with the same wonder as the first time playing, I would in a heartbeat.

Posted: April 23, 2016
												It seems to me that Dying Light has found some kind of sweet spot, striking an ideal balance between zombie shooters and the sea of open-world crafting/survival experience games, most of which remain stuck into Early Access territory.Dying Light's world is open, but not randomly generated - the base game's main two areas are gigantic with an extremely high level of detail. Each area was carefully thought out and offers plenty to do and to discover. The sense of freedom is further reinforced by the excellent ""parkour"" system, which essentially allows you to climb pretty much anything that can be grabbed onto. I was surprised by how easy it was to get the hang of it, Techland has really made it as intuitive as one could wish for, and the scope of what the system allows you to do easily outweighs its (very) few minor flaws.Dying Light has a crafting system, but not the kind that will have you punch trees and pick up rocks for hours to build a shelter: it is limited to weapon upgrades, healing supplies and various kinds of combat equipment: throwing stars, explosives, flares, firecrackers to distract the zombies, etc. The amount of different craft parts and blueprints to loot still leaves you with plenty to do, but remains limited compared to more hardocre crafting games.The combat in Dying Light is primarily focused on melee, with a huge amount of different weapon types that can be upgraded in various ways. It's not easy to get the hang of it, especially early into the game when you don't do a lot of damage; but it becomes quite rewarding later on, when the skills you've unlocked give you access to a comprehensive set of moves: grapples, stuns, takedowns, ""drop attacks"", etc. It's all very satisfying to use, but the zombies will keep you honest and it remains easy to get overwhelmed.The ranged options are somewhat less developed. You only get a bow and three gun types, with scarce ammo drops and no silencer. Clearly, in most situations you're not supposed to shoot your way through; the guns are loud and the noise only attracts more and more zombies. This part left me wanting, more gun types and the ability to craft silencers would've been very welcome.Sometimes, though, Dying Light turns into a corridor FPS for story reasons. This brings us to the story, and it's clearly not where the game shines. Despite the promise of the initial setting, the way the story develops is far from convincing. All the characters are stereotypes, and the lead is the only one with some degree of depth. The pacing of the action has its moments, but then you'll go to bed counting the plot holes to fall asleep. The side quests are a mixed bag but several of them were quite fun to do, much like the parts of the main story that take place in the open areas; it's really the more linear sub-areas that break the flow of the game, as they restrict your freedom in how to attain the objectives.What Dying Light has really nailed is the atmosphere. You never leave the first person view, from start to finish, and everything is done so that you'll enjoy losing yourself into the vast confines of the city. The immersion is further reinforced by the fact that it's very easy to die, and you'll genuinely be fearing for your life. This is especially true when you're outside at night, as stronger zombie types come out of their nests and will relentlessly hunt down the player once detected. This makes surviving your first few nights outside a very unique and satisfying experience. Other games have a day/night cycle but this is surely the most convincing one I've seen.Multiplayer is a mixed bag too. Coop is functional, and can be great fun, but the game isn't really designed around specific coop mechanics, skill synergies and such. Public coop campaigns have limited appeal, but going through the game alongside up to three friends can be pretty nice. There is also PvP support in the form of a ""Be the Zombie"" mode which lets you ""invade"" other people's sessions as a special kind of zombie, the ""Night Hunter"". It's very cool once you get the hang of it, with interesting gameplay on both sides. You even have a specific skill tree as zombie!Bottom line: the scope, the ambition, the atmosphere of Dying Light make it a milestone in the zombie genre. Definitely recommended for a good 30-50 hours of single player experience, possibly a lot more if you're a completionist and/or with the multiplayer modes. It will sometimes infuriate you, but also make you feel things few other games do.			"

												I sat on the fence with this title for such a long time. I think it was due to Dead Island (I thought it was the same company who produced DL), as it ran like a dog with no legs. I just couldn’t play it due to the stutter problems on my system, despite the workarounds.I had seen demos and play throughs on youtube so I knew it ‘looked stunning’ but did it play as well as it looked. Simply put, yes. For the first hour I was like OMG this is amazing, just trying to soak it all up. I was catapulted into MP with a bunch of mates, jumping from roof top to roof top just trying to avoid the carnage below. Burning cars and zombies clawing out at you in the streets.I remember falling though a wooden roof on a slum building. The sound attracted a group of Virals, who are fast movers compared to the regular walkers. I got a bit of a kicking but managed to get out alive, such a buzz. It really makes you aware that your actions can affect the undead.This game has to be the single best title for Zombie smashing, Left4dead 1+2 was good, very good infact. But this takes 4 player coop zombie hacking to different levels. You can play the coop campaign with up to 3 other players. The original game (you may as well buy the Enhanced edition), comprises of two large area maps ‘The Slums’ and then ‘Old Town’.The DLC, ‘The Following’ introduces Vehicles to the mix…or a Vehicle, The Buggy. And of course a new map (unsure if there is more as haven’t completed it yet) more open so as to stretch the legs on the vehicle.  This can be customised so you ultimately making it faster and more durable across the undulating terrain.So have since started another character to do it at my own pace. I very rarely do , as I don’t really class myself as a completionist of games. However this game is so much fun I just keep coming back to it. One great aspect of the SP/MP is that you use the same character but whichever mode you play it uses the same character so development is consistent. So your game time will always attribute to your characters development. Which is good as you earn xp for completing missions or just generally killing, Parkouring your way around the map etc. There are numerous Easter eggs and developer Blueprints for some weapons.The sound effects are brilliant, the ambient sounds as well as the moans and groans of the Infected. Love playing this game at night with my headphones on LOUD.  Especially with the day and night cycle. As it gets a lot more intense at night, the introduction of a new creature into the fold and the average walkers become a lot more alert and dangerous. Earlier in the game (depending on the difficulty), the night is horrendous. As you progress through the game though you become more capable and attuned to it. I nearly forgot to mention the weather effects too, from fog to monsoon type rains with lightning thrown into the mix. Executed really well and adds to the level of immersion.STORYThe story is cheesier than a Primula spread but hey, it doesn’t detract from the game. Some of the characters you really couldn’t care less about. As the production value is so good you just roll with it. See it as filler for the more glorious task of smashing up zombie hordes.WEAPONSDuring the actual game you can expect to wield a number of weapons. Some more useful the others, then you can craft and add buffs to weapons (I guess similar to Dead Island but way better). Axes, Knives, A piece of Pipe (told you some where crap) Swords, Shotguns, SMG, Assualt Rifle, Throwing stars etc. There are some other Traps etc which are within the maps themselves which you can interact with. You can change your clothing, you can even wear your national colours so you can look like a football yob and cave in heads just like you used to on the terraces back in the day!It’s a cracking game, with stacks of fun and replayability, it must be if I have gone back to it time and time again.

												This is an incredible game.I always seem to love the free roam games like Skyrim, Zelda, and Super Mario 64. This game is no exception. The level of freedom in this game is beyond that of any of those games. You see a place where you want to go? You can go there, unless it's out of the playable area. The massive variety of weapons and tools that can be used in the game are wonderful. If I had anything to recommend to the devs, it would be to add more tools that affect the player.The story is pretty cool, too. It might seem a bit overwhelming if you're not paying attention your first playthrough, but it's easily understandable if you get into it. Crane as a character is pretty realistic as he changes his mind throughout the story based on what he knows.The graphics are beautiful. Positively breathtaking in some areas. There are details in places you wouldn't expect them. NPCs have animations for everything they say, as well as a variety of idling animations. Lots of interesting and entertaining visual effects for different events. It even includes a trippy psychadelic scene for people who are into that kind of thing. Framerate is consistent if you have a good computer.Multiplayer is great. Love playing online with other people and seeing the unique weapons they found and what they do with them. Racing challenges are the best. I love competing with other players to see who can get to the next point the fastest.The DLC is nothing short of incredible. The amount of time it took to make something like this implies that these guys are obsessive. Some parts of the story really tie together certain unexplained parts of the original game. The buggy is so much fun. Love running zombies over, and of course racing friends. The plot is so crazy, especially at the end. ***small spoilers*** There should be a sequel to both endings of the game. ***end spoilers***The developer secret weapons are one of my favorite parts of the game. These guys made a serious game, but have all kinds of silly secrets that are totally unrealistic. It's a game, why not include some random button that teleports you to different parts of the map, or a chicken on a stick that does more damage than most swords?Seriously. If you play first person games, I can't recommend this game enough. It's worked its way up to the top of my list of favorite first person games. I kid you not.			"

												I've actually finished this game long time ago, but here is my review.   INTRODUCTION   Dying Light is an action survival open world game presented in first-person perspective. It may be squalid and zombie-infested, but Dying Light's city of Harran isn't a depressing wasteland – it's a vibrant, ambitious, open-world playground. It could be similar to previous zombie-survival you had played like Dead Island maybe? But here, buildings are for climbing, the undead are there to be destroyed in creative ways, and there's always something interesting to be discovered nearby.   STORY   Pretty interesting story. Spoiler alert! In summary - Kyle Crane is GRE agent who is tasked with recovering data from the overrun city of Harran that could cure the virus rampaging throughout the city. The virus transforms the victim into a zombie like creature or into special mutations of that. After getting bitten inside the city, Crane has to blend in with one of the two main factions of the city, while staying undercover to try and recover that data. But he may have bitten off more than he can chew.    GAMEPLAY    The FPS perspective makes it looks realistic and incredibly fun as in you are really exist in the game world where you roam an urban environment devastated by a mysterious epidemic. Scavenging to craft - Make your own weapons, medicines and bold your pockets by looting some trashes, boxes, lorries, zombie corpses, and etc . Crafting also comes with delight various level weaponries. Scavenge for supplies to send back to the safe zones.  Team up for missions in multiplayer mode - Engage in competitive challenges, or just run around and bash zombies together. It was fun; they even have mini challenges with your partner throughout the multiplayer mode to earn some achievements.  Invade other people - in Be the Zombie mode. But it is sometimes frustrating because most of invaded players always immediately quit or even disable for being invaded. Weaponized your self - Discover a new rare blueprint is most blithesome feeling in this game. It’s so rare! You won’t expect it will be placed in that kind of place.  You are leveling up as you are surviving, parkouring, and beating some asses! Especially in the nighttime. Set up traps –  Players can also use environmental traps, such as spikes and electrified fences to kill the infected. Throwing stars, tomahawks, etc. are ranged throwing weapons that can be aimed and used to take enemies out silently from a distance. They are silent and do not summon virals, unless you use them to ignite a gas tank.  Explosives are either in the form of grenades (thrown and explodes) or bombs (which attract then explode). They all cause noise and attract virals.  Molotov cocktails spread fire where they're thrown and will ignite the infected. Can often spawn virals after using.  Support items each have their own role, flares repel zombies, firecrackers distract them, and the UV flashlight for stunning infected at night. There is less used items like the Pyza Suit which lets you glide.  The slow motion combat is gory and so cool!  Last but not least, when you have unlocked grappling hook, here comes the spidey !    CHALLENGE LEVEL   when nighttime comes everything changes. The zombies get faster and stronger and new mutations called, Volatiles come out to ruin your day. Good night and good luck.   CONTROL   Dying Light control scheme seems pretty familiar and at the same time highly customizable, with a couple of unique elements. In high pressure situation your survival in the game will depend on your performance and how quickly you react, thus, if you want to improve your gameplay and effectiveness you should take maximum advantage of your custom key binding scheme.   GRAPHIC   Really atmospheric and warm with a great depth of field. The blood and gory while slashing the zombies especially while slow motion are fantastic.    REPLAYABILITY   Definitely will come back. Ive replayed a couple times – especially to finish all the side quests.    What's New on The Following Expansion DLC    NOTE: The Following DLC is meant to be for a player who has finished the main story. Because, on this expansion zombies are a lot harder to fight. Hence, I highly reccomended to take this DLC to experience new area that will transform your Dying Light experience through new game mechanics, environments and challenges on top of the established core of what made Dying Light a break away success for millions of players around the globe.  NEW MAP | AS BIG AS DYING LIGHT  For the first time, you’ll go outside the quarantine zone only to get thrust into a hazardous outback overrun by the infected and populated by pockets of survivors who consider outsiders just as threating. Dying Light: The Following is choke full of new environments, characters, quests, and secrets to discover.  DRIVABLE VEHICLES | YOUR DEADLIEST WEAPON YET  Break pursuits and travel through the quarantine like never before.

												Do you know that awesome feeling when a game surprises you? Me too. Some developers (like the Alien: Isolation developing team) have done their job successfully and made me enjoy every single moment of playing their game. That feeling, dear people, is one of the coolest ones you can find (especially if you didn't expect the game to be great).Surprisingly, Dying Light ended up as a good game. Actually, we can talk about it as a spiritual successor to Dead Island, a game that always looked like a not really interesting open-world version of Left 4 Dead. The truth is, Techland has added some parkour elements taken from Mirror's Edge to Dying Light.Then, I decided to give it a try, and, believe it or not, the game is a good combination of those Left 4 Dead, Mirror's Edge and Dead Island elements, but some games like Dark Souls as well. Dying Light is actually a first person survival horror game which mainly focuses on zombies and some ""parkour moving"" with a really great dynamic day-night ""relationship"".Zombies are pretty slow, ""stupid"" and not really dangerous. Well, that's so when it's day only. When the night comes, well, you better run for your life because ""zombie parkour"" is around, and zombies, that can be stopped only with UV lights, are about to attack.The funny thing is, it took me a while to survive the first night after trying to escape an attack for a couple of times. Later, I realized there are some ""circles"" on the mini-map which indicate the zombies and their view radius.You'll be able to find some really cool and epic zombies, but only when it's night. As mentioned above, don't expect much ""horror fun"" at days. Though, don't underestimate them and make no noise or their brothers and sisters are gonna take you down.What I have to mention whenever I talk about Dying Light, is that parkour. All these things (like the epic zombies and the night fun) would be pointless if parkour was badly done. Luckily, in our case, it ain't. Parkour, in my personal opinion, is the best part of the game. You'll be able to jump from one place to another without much effort and it's rarely gonna happen that a small brick will prevent you from reaching the goal (like it can happen in Assassin's Creed).Beside the great game menu and the map, which has been developed nicely, the game features modding tools. Techland seems to like the idea of seeing community-made content for their game, which I have to give a big PLUS. The developer tools (a.k.a modding tools) are for now pretty poor with options and possibilities, but soon, I am sure they're gonna be much better.Overall, Dying Light is a great and fun game that you can play even online. However, there are some cons which definitely shouldn't have occurred. The story as well as all the characters don't make much sense and should have been re-done before the developing started. There are many quests that seem pretty uninspired to me. Boss fights, well, need an improvement as they look pretty """"boring"""" for now.From my view point, this game is definitely worth a try. Go for it if you like zombies, night and parkour.			"

												So how is Dying light?PC Specs:I7-4790 @3.6ghz16 gigs of DDR3Nvidia GTX 770 2 gig(Relevant cause it's a bit stuttery at times on max settings so reduction was required)The game itself is amazing, the graphics are great (provided I have to run a bit lower graphical settings), and story is rather long in comparison to other games. The game also isn't linear which in its self is amazing and no need to feel rushed to do objectives. Missions? There are several types of competitions, missions and such. The missions types for example escort,  quarantine zones, various collection requests/retrieval based quests, bounty hunting type of quest (Go kill so and so basically), and securing safe houses. There are also dynamic quests you can do such as hunt thugs, random crazy people attacking you at times, secure airdrops for loot, help survivors in trouble with infected, and even the miniboss fights with survivors.Gameplay/physics?The running, climbing, fighting, and surviving without dying as much benefits your character in levels. The levels are ""Power"" (fighting), ""Agility"" (running,climbing, jumping ect), and ""Survival"" (doing missions, surviving at night, turning in airdrops, and various side missions) are very intergrated in the game and are a must because they add features like ability to camoflage yourself among the infected sneak up behind them and break their neck. The leveling up and upgrading features also add a bit to the game. I mean like who doesn't want a sword that can electrocute and burn someone at the same time and be safe in your hands? The physics can lead to some pretty funny and fun situations like climbing to top of a tower and finding a random zombie there and spartan kicking him off. It feels pretty satisfying watching the zombie spiraling to the ground and well of course dying. Then there are timeings where adding a impact blueprint to your baseball bat can lead to you slinging the zombie as if it was a homerun.Best moment of gameDodged zombie on top of a towerFell from towerLanded luckily in garbage bag pileLooked up to see the zombie falling at me.Panicked, swung my sword, halved him in mid air.10/10 would slash falling zombies in half again.Edit: Found EXPcalibur early on broke it (Has like 8 durability or 8 swings/impacts into objects) but still overpowered baseball bat/sword using it to level my agility by throwing zombies off the bridge into the dark depths of the water below. Best weapon in game.Edit: 2/17/2015I know some of you have seen the ""Mod"" DMCA and such. However, they've recently added modding support and such for those of you who hadn't read on it. I've glanced at some mods and currently their mostly behavioral improvements on the infected to make them more.. aggressive or harder. However, there are some mods that I've read on that makes it more hardcore survival like reducing the amount of certain resources founds, making crafting more expensive, and also mods like increase in levels to like 40 in Survival (One of three skill trees that you have to level up). There isn't a workshop on steam yet so you will have to go gather information on mods via websites like Nexus.			"

												Dying Light is an incredible game. Although extremely similar to Dead Island, it’s a more perfected version of the zombie slashing series. I feel that the added parkour and dynamic day/night cycle is what gives Dying Light a unique edge not only from Dead Island, but from all games out there. Debuting the new Chrome Engine 6, I was seriously impressed with the graphical fidelity of the game. The various weather patterns, lighting, and the overall quality of effects (explosions, decapitation etc), made me feel like I was finally playing a next gen game. You can tell that the game was built around the fluid parkour movement system, but at the same time they managed to create a believable world with realistic design. One of the most impressive aspects of Dying Light is how relevant I found the upgrade system. Every skill felt like it had meaning and wasn’t just there as an option. I found myself using almost all the skills in normal combat throughout the 50 hour or so campaign. Techland advertised a 50 hour campaign and I can safely agree with them. It took me 50 hours to complete every quest solo, and complete several random encounters, and challenges (not all of them though).As great as I found this game, there were some balance issues for me. The night sequences are supposed to challenge you against faster zombies, but I found myself either avoiding or escaping them all too easily. Towards the end of the game I was straight up hunting them down. Repairing weapons uses metal parts which are ridiculously common. The grappling hook made free-running obsolete and made the night sequences even more trivial. Be The Zombie mode is just a glorified version of Left 4 Dead’s asymmetrical multiplayer. In other words, nothing special with little reason to play it over the standard co-op. This will appeal to some people, but it really didn’t seem special to me. The Old Town level should have been the modern metropolis setting we get to see in the distance from the Slums level. It felt like an entirely different country instead of being consistent with the Slums level. Overall, you are definitely getting your money’s worth with Dying Light. Despite those few issues, there is plenty to do and plenty to keep you playing for days to come.			"

												Dying Light~~~~~~~~~ What an exquisite cut scene at the start of the game. Jumping out of a cargo plane, the sun glare in your eyes and this sensational feeling of free falling toward the nice coastral city of Harram.  Unfortunately you miss your landing and you find yourself stranded, should I say hanging on the side of a building wall. In any case you manage to cut the strings of your parachute and drop awkwardly onto the street, where your tourist guides welcome you with open arms. This game has the essence of Dead Island and Mirror Edge combined with the in-depth character options from Far Cry 3 and 4. Levelling up skills and crafting well needed weapons and other items the likes of lock picks to Molotov cocktails, and if you feel a bit festive just light up some fire crackers! The controls are very easy especially if you have already played games like Dead Island or Far Cry 4. In terms of combat, it is well done and depending where you hit the zombies you might trigger the slow motion (very briefly). Scavenging Zombies will be one source of finding useful items. Plenty of cigarettes and bottles of alcohol; after all, it is party time in Zombieland!What I find the most thrilling so far is night time. You really have to sneak around and make sure you are not being seen, otherwise you are going to have to make a run for your life - jumping from building to building and running as fast as you can to avoid DYING!Good graphics as you would expect. Oh, one thing I find quiet funny is when you launch the game. During the loading process you will get the following comment:“All characters and locations used in this game are fiction. Any resemblance to real persons and places is purely coincidental” I am just wondering how they know Bob, my local Zombie who runs our corner shop!Now to the frustrating part of the equation – I experienced a lot of crashes to my desktop. Actually every 20 minutes or so before I did the following:1)	Put my resolution down to 1920 X1200 (I am running a GTX 980)2)	Disable Nvidia control panel3)	Turn off Vertical Synchronization, Nvida HBAO+, and Motion BlurNow, it seems to run better but I do have the occasional crash. For $70, I did not expect this to be truly honest. And just for comparison, I can run Far Cry 4 on 3840 X 2160 with everything turn on without a problem. It seems to me this game was rushed.Positves:~~~~~~~ -	Great idea (combining Mirror Edge, Dead Island)-	Nice graphics (could be better in higher resolution)-	Co-op or single player-	Play the Zombie-	Good cut scenes-	Plenty to do-	Achievements-	Trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	Frustrating crash issuesLook, if you can make this game runs smoothly it is fun and I am happy to recommend it. But I am also happy to recommend waiting until the bugs are fixed or the price is lowered. Sorry, I call it as I see it.7/10MORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HEREFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE "

												While Dying Light isn’t a sequel to Techland’s 2011 release of Dead Island, it ought to be. If Dead Island was a proof of concept, where Techland taught themselves that an open-world, first person, zombie survival RPG was possible and fun, Dying Light is maturity of said concept. Dying Light is an ambitious game, one that takes this core foundation from Dead Island, and adds flavor from across a number of genres for AAA gumbo. Ultimately, Dying Light is a surprisingly focused and well put together game compared to its predecessor, even if it borrows most of what it brings to the table. There’s a lot that is really good about Dying Light.It’s got a lengthy single player story, drop-in drop-out cooperative play, and a versus mode that pits player controlled zombies and soldiers against one another in Techland’s dense open-world playground. Dying Light is a refreshing spin on the zombie apocalypse story that’s been told and told again in gaming. Like its predecessor it has a lot of systems in place: a day night cycle that introduces survival and stealth mechanics, a deep crafting and loot system for weapons and gear, and a multi-tiered progression system that allows players to grow as the plot unfolds. Oh, and it’s got an incredibly fun parkour system that allows you to easily traverse the zombie infested world.There haven’t been too many risks taken with zombie apocalypse games in the past. Dead Island, the 2011 title which Techland also made, had a very distinct flavor though. It’s the clear foundation for Dying Light, though many changes have been made to that formula, and it has been expanded on greatly. Like Dead Island, Dying Light is still not a game that will have you mowing down hordes of infected zombies. It’s a game about survival and stamina management, not a power fantasy. It’s a game where you feel lucky to find or craft a powerful new weapon, items that you’ll use sparingly going forward to give you your best shot a surviving when you absolutely must fight.Playing as the capable freelance operative Kyle Crane, you are sent in to the fictional locale of Harran on a secret mission to locate sensitive information about the outbreak. Once you touch down, you’re bitten, then brought into the fold by a group of do-good survivors. Crane answers to The Global Relief Effort who sent him to Harran, but the majority of the gameplay revolves around helping this faction who’ve taken him in, avoiding and surviving the sea of zombies, and fighting against a strong force of rebels led by a warlord in the zone. While Techland doesn’t necessarily break the mold with its storytelling, open world mission structure, or delivery of said missions, Dying Light is constantly challenging players to survive in this harsh environment.The biggest tool in the player arsenal are the parkour abilities. They give the player an edge on both the zombie and human factions, by allowing quick movements and traversal across the environment. Crane can scale buildings and make death defying leaps all over the massive map, allowing him to get out of trouble quickly. And while there’s certainly many times that you will stand and engage in the brutal combat found in Dying Light, this versatility allows you to outrun just about anything…during the day.At night on the other hand, Dying Light changes considerably. More dangerous varieties of zombies appear, and its best not to be seen at all by them. Vision cones that are frequently found in stealth games come into play, and if spotted by these “Volatiles” you’ll be in for a fight. Well, not much of one actually. If they catch you after being spotted, you’ll most certainly die. If you do escape, you’ll earn bonus points towards your survival progression tree. Harran is most dangerous at night. Missions are best taken during the day, but many quests will have you venturing out in the dark, or you’ll just find yourself trying to wrap up a quest as the sun sets. The good news is there are ways to remedy the darkness. You can go to safehouses and sleep through the night, venturing out when your chances of survival are better. You can use light traps throughout the city, or a UV ray to get out of jams. Safezones are your best bet, but they need to be secured though, and you can do that at anytime by clearing them of any zombies beforehand. The day/night cycle is one the most interesting mechanics in Dying Light, keeping each day feeling fresh, keeping each night feeling dangerous.Dying Light is an open-world game though. While there’s a rigid storyline to be followed, you can play it any way you like. You can hit one story mission after another, or you can wander around the city looking for loot if you choose, picking locks, and finding supply caches. You can track down and secure cargo drops before the rebel factions get their hands on them. There are a myriad of side quests to be taken on as well. There are random encounters, safezones to lock down, towers to climb, and collectibles to be uncovered. There’s plenty to keep you busy in Dying Light. You can do these activities on your own, or with other players if you choose to invite friends to your private game, or open your campaign to the public.The more you do in Harran, the more you’ll uncover in Dying Light. The more missions you take on, the more chests you open, the more loot you’ll find, the better weapons and equipment you’ll be able to create. The deep crafting mechanics from Dead Island have carried over to Dying Light, though you don’t need pesky workbenches to perform them. There are a ton of melee weapons to discover, modify, and use. There are also quite a few guns to be procured Blueprints will allow you to make modified weapons that carry specific attributes like electricity or toxicity. Now if this sounds familiar, it’s because just about every open world game follows a similar structure these days. Dying Light does get it right though. It feels focused, accomplishments feel worthwhile and something that build towards becoming stronger and more capable. The attributes and skills that you earn give a strong sense of actual progression. Instead of a map littered with side quests and items to collect that bear no impact on the player or the game, Dying Light feels like everything has a purpose and reason for being there.This is the sort of attention to detail that’s found throughout Dying Light. A great presentation, solid gameplay elements like the brutal combat, traversal and crafting. It's cohesive, and carries over perfectly to the online aspects of the game.  In fact, it’s all pretty seamless if you choose it to be. Opening your game up to the public will allow other survivors to join you, or invade your world as a zombie. All the aspects of the single player experience are accessible in cooperative play, you can choose to tackle story missions, side-quests, or just mess around. Occasionally, you’ll also be offered group challenges, which are mix of dynamically created content and quest relevant tasks. All the while, you’re still building towards your character progression.Dying Light is one of those games that could have easily disappointed. You know the type of game. The one that has a laundry list of features, none of which really work all that well. One that has a lot of things that sound ambitious, but never really pan out. It could have been that game, but it isn’t. What it is, is a surprisingly well put together open-world survival game with a lot of moving parts, all of which add up to something pretty fun to play. It’s not going to blow your mind in terms of story, and the mission structure of the campaign is certainly familiar, but Dying Light has cohesion between its parts that make it enjoyable. The day night cycle, the deep crafting, parkour and brutal combat, Dying Light attempts to be all things to all people, and does a better job than most at it.			"

												Now that I finished the game 100%, I can give my honest opinion. It was pretty fun and worth the 60 dollars, but the only reason i had so much fun was because I was playing with a friend. The side missions were really plain, and the story wasn't the best.  Some of it felt really .. .Anti-Climatic.  1 Death shocked me, But the other one, it took so long to happen (for those who play, you probably know which one) you were trying to finish the climbing / jumping event just to get on with the story. The gripping Hook will become your best friend, saves you so much time! The game ran OK for me, I had no problems after I turn down view distance, But the game didn't have amazing graphics to begin with to be excited with. The graphics remind me of Dead Island, just lighter.  The issue was with the graphics is , when we got to the last 2-3 side missions, all the cut scenes seem to bug out, the person talking was lending on nothing or facing the wrong way. My finale Rating:7.5/10Why so High? well I do love games that are co-op the whole story (besides first mission, and last) If you can find a friend(or 3) that will play the whole story with you, go for it! I got 40 hours out of it, from doing the story AND side missions (all of them), so you will get your money out of it.			"

												Ah, the game Techland always wanted to make. This is what Dead island always wanted to be. The Parkour in this game is unbelieveable, and after playing it, It's hard to play another FPS and not want to climb a building, jump to the neighbors roof and grapple 100 feet to a bridge. The movement is fluid and just works so well. The pace and speed are on point, and the combat is incredible. However, don't expect to enjoy this game much if your player is under level 7, the weapons are too weak, and it takes 10 hits to kill anything. My advice: Go level yourself in both combat and agility as much as you can before progressing in the game. Make sure to do things at night when its 2X XP boost. Oh... AND RUN YOUR A$$ OFF!!			"

												IMPORTANT: for expansion: on the main menu, go to ""PLAY"" then ""THE FOLLOWING"" -Many people think after defeating the boss, ""That's it?"" NO IT'S NOT.just don't press ""CONTINUE"" when done with the main campaign.A simple description of this game would be ""Dead Island + Mirror's Edge = Dying Light""...But there's just so much in this game, since ""The Following"" got added, it's basically double as big as it was on release.Skill system: check / Melee: check / Firearms: check / Parkour: check / Zombies AND Human enemies: check.Dying Light Development Kit gives access to make your own maps, quests, weapons and items too! (If you know how to use blender 3D to make 3D models, you can make new items from the bottom up!)In the Expansion, The Following, there's a buggy, a drivable vehicle! new weapons, NPCs, places and quests!a solid 10/10 from me.

												As someone who is not a fan of horror games, Dying Light walks a well balanced line bordering on action adventure and zombie slaying goodness.  During the day you are playing a game of ""the street is lava,"" parkouring through the rooftops only making a quick dash onto the street to scavenge supplies or make a more direct path to your destination while avoiding zombies. Any interaction results in a fluid combat experience that only escalates as your character levels up.  Night brings many more challenges as your visibility is sharply reduced and the abundance and difficulty of zombies exponentially increased. You will need to move much more slowly and avoid detection by the larger zombies which will trigger a chase if they spot you. If this happens, run, dont fight, just run to the nearest safe house.Early on, focus on leveling up your agility class as running and avoiding zombie hordes is your main tool of survival.   Overall the gameplay is fun, fast and fluid. Crafting is nice but can get repetitive with the same items being scattered all over the world.  Graphics look nice but can be enhanced by removing the grainy look through some script modification. The game is not too well optimized for PC at launch (mainly for AMD users) but turning down your draw distance can help combat some of those FPS jumps. If you have an Nvidia setup (like myself) you should be well off for a smoother gaming experience.  Overall I give Dying Light a 8/10 mainly due to some repetitiveness in item scavenging and distortion of how under powered  you are early on compared to late game but it is definitely a title worth checking out.

												Took me 36 hours to finish, I completed all main quests, all side quests and unlocked 32 out of 50 achievements.Dying Light is a great game, simple as that. It's the perfect mix of parkour/zombie killing. Techland has improved on the formula they created with their previous game Dead Island, in almost every way, and added features that will surely be a mainstay in open world zombie games in the future. I will start off talking about the parkour and combat. The parkour is a more streamlined version of free running seen in games like Mirror's Edge and Assassin's Creed. The amount of verticality and player control this gives you is essential in a game like this, were fast movement and even faster enemies are needed and prevelant. Ocasionally there are moments were the parkour doesn't work as it's intended (mostly due to the late game unlock of a grappling hook, which hooks onto anything regardless of if you can actually climb it) but overall it's a great system that really feels like it's the next natural step in the zombie survival genre.The combat, while simpler than Dead Island's analog swing system, is still a visceral, engaging, and tactile combat system that almost gives you the feeling of overpowering your enemies but the balance of power can change at any minute due to the games stamina system, were swinging too much or running too hard will gas you and let the zombies get the upper hand. The gunplay, is the weakest side of the games combat system, the guns don't feel as good as they should, comparitive to the excellent melee system. and there are no upgrades or custom blueprints for them, unlike the melee system which has really interesting and often over the top upgrades for weapons. The guns feel like a bullet point on the box that were added to satisfy a small portion of people who need guns in their zombie games, they absolutely could be better, and more time could have been spent making them a more viable and fun option.The story is nothing to write home about, it's typical bad guy/bad organization doing bad things while good guy has to stop them, the cast is sort of interesting, with some stand out characters, but most are typical character types seen in many games before. The side quests have some of the better story interactions and characters in the game, they sometimes go in a goofy or outlandish direction which is fun compared to the serious, sometimes overly so, story quests.On closing, Dying Light deserves praise for how well it's gameplay systems work together to take the genre in the direction it was naturally going, by adding an excellent combat system with a neccessary parkour system. I look forward to playing whatever Techland does next with the series and I hope other games borrow the features of this game and use them in theirs.Pros- Very nice visuals, the slums and city look real and gritty, and the gore is top notch- Parkour is well done and feels right- Combat feels more streamlined but still incredibly satisfying- Some fun side quests make up for lack luster main questlineCons- Main questline isn't great, it feels very generic and predictable- Gunplay isn't as deep or as fun as it could be- Minor technical problems occur (most have been fixed but a few remain, like a bugged achievement remains, while performance and a couple stuck quests have been mostly fixed).9 out of 10			"

												This game wasn't on my radar when it came out so I picked it up during a sale and OMFG... this game is so much fun and is very VERY underrated.Story: The plot is good that can give fun little twists that you weren't expecting. Though the only good character and the one  with the only good voice acting is the main character who is voiced by Roger Crag Smith (Chris Redfield and Ezio Auditore). Although my biggest issue is that the story just feels very cliche at like every big action moment and they don't try anything creative. Also the antagonist was being way too serious that it became very annoying to listen to him... Clearly he wants to be a Vaas character but fails so bad.Gameplay: Best part of this game is how much variety there is in the gameplay. This is a survival game and you have to search throughout the city for items to craft your weapons and other items. There is even a leveling up system for both your weapons, agility, and survival abilities to unlock more perks, best perk of all is the drop kick. You can find blueprints throughout the game to help make even more interesting weapons and add boosters to them more powerful. The parkour system may feel wierd at first when your doing the tutorial mission based around it, after a while it becomes very fluid and responsive that you can pull off some very cool moments with the parkour. Melee weapons do have the same animations over and over again but killing zombies with them just never gets old that you just want to go through multiple killing sprees of zombies. Gunplay is honestly only ment for human enemies since the sounds of the gunfire will draw in zombies but the weapons are very well designed for either situation. At night time the game turns into a horror game that you have to run away from certain zombies that will almost instantly kill you. Side missions are more interesting than the main missions and you will spend a lot of time with it. The only problem with the gameplay is at the beginning of the game you don't have the most powerful weapons so they just degrade fast and takes forever to kill zombies.Conclusion: Dying Light is a very well made zombie survival game and should be played by every fan of these genres. The story isn't really something you will remember or you probably are gonna careless about but it still offers a thrilling experience. At the start of the game it may feel harsh on you for having weak weapons and stats but later on it pays off. If you have a group of friends to play with this game would be a good option since it is co-op and you can play through the whole story together.Rating: 8/10			"

												I guess we can all admit this is one of the recommended Zombie games out there besides Left 4 Dead 1/2 or Day Z or State of Decay. If not, one of the most fun ones that is not just action, but horror.Pros:-Parkour (Who doesn't like that♥♥♥♥♥♥)-Zombies-Storyline is fine. -Two areas to visit which makes exploring better and more fun.-Great graphics. The AMD issue has been resolved so kudos to the company for listening to the consumers.-Great skills and items. Especially *SPOILER*(grappling hook).-Way better when playing co-op with a friend (Been playing this with a friend entire playthrough)-Combat system is alright.Cons:-Still some game-breaking bugs. -The one we encountered is where the elevator does not move and we are stuck in the elevator. Great save point too. That is when we stopped playing and are waiting for a patch.-Funny how jumping from a building and getting incapicated lets you get revived besides getting blown from explosive barrel which kills you instantly.-Needs more content. Legit. Weapons and such. -No facial expressions when NPCs talk. Sad about that. Makes it less immersive.-Note: The hitboxes in this game are sort of♥♥♥♥♥♥ So, expect a hard time when trying to aim somewhere besides the head. You will do a headshot even though you aimed at the leg or torso.All in all, until the bug is fixed, 8.5/10. That game-breaking point destroyed the fun out of it.			"

												One of the best, zombie-apocalpse game in Steam. An awesome blend of FPS and action w/ an addition of creepy, gore and horror. The Following - Enhanced Edition is two games: Dying Light and Dying Light: The Following. This edition fixed all the glitches from the original Dying Light game with added content such as an outfit pack and weapon pack. It's a single player game, but can be played multi-player via online up to four players. -Shortcut Review-A great, spiritual successor to the Dead Island series. Much improved on graphics, mechanics and playability. Storyline is short, but the sidequests, repeatable quests, and parkour challenges makes this game quite enjoyable. It's quite fun to play with others, however, it may take awhile for someone to join your game. Although playing against the Hunter is very hard, the gameplay is tolerable once skills are high and weapons are highest grade (orange). May remind you that parkour is the key to survival - will give you the urgency to climb and jump building to building in other, zombie apocalypse games. -Full Review (Somewhat Spoiler free)-The beginning is very challenging because it takes some time to get used to the parkour skills: one must find a place on the wall to grip, use crosshair to aim n press button to jump while holding on to the grab button and having aim in place with gamepad stick. Player will follow a level-up system that upgrades perks and abilities. This is forgiveable because the start is an (epilogue) or tutorial and acts as part of the storyline. Also, the game also gives some useful hints to evading zombies early on. At first, it's somewhat difficult to find weapons and can be tough to defend with them because the weapons are the lowest-grade. They have a high breakability and also low attack power to kill zombies. They also require materials to repair them if found. As for the items like gauze and alcohol to make medkits, they are pretty easy to find and don't require much scavenging. I think it's great that there's no ""overcumberance"" when reaching the max capacity in storage bag. It just simply doesn't allow the player to gather anymore items. There's too many games out there with this nuisance.The characters are likeable, even though, they're created in a cliche way. We have a typical, rugged mercinary, a naive, yet brillant engineer, his athletic and♥♥♥♥♥kicking of an older sister, a clueless leader, and a ruthless, dellusional villan. The voice actor, Roger Craig Smith (RE series), does a wonderful job with Kyle Crane - he keeps his character relatable with the audience by a running occurance whether he is doing right or wrong in his actions. Unfortunately, the writers made the character to be just another, war hero with vanilla morals. All of these characters are complimented by each other because they have to survive against a higher power and the undead. See how where this is going? Overall, this game easily makes you forget about the horrors from Dead Island, literatly. Techland learned their mistakes from the DI franchise, regrouped their tactics and created one, badass of a game with this one. You can get it for a great discount on sale (Summer and Holiday sales) at $15, even though, this game deserves to be paid in full price. Thanks for reading!			"

												After 45 hours of being a citizen of Harran and completing the story and all story-related sidequests I put my police baton and machete to rest for a while - only for the time of writing this review! This is due to the fact that 25% of the achievements still remain - I have yet to spend more time with multiplayer as well as completing the challenges Dying Light offers.If you do not know what Dead Island is:Dead Island was Techland's first zombie FPS title back in 2011. While Valve's Left 4 Dead franchise put down the basics of this genre Dead Island was certainly a great boost - if you think about it developer companies create their rip-offs left and right nowadays.DI featured an open world environment with lots of missions to complete, 4 protagonists to choose from, craftable / upgradable melee weapons and TONS of zombies. All set on a tropical environment where all hell broke loose once an unknown virus had been released. The story mode could be played by up to 4 players and fighting the horde of walkers included some RPG elements - blueprints helped us modify our melee weapons (mainly adding elemental damage to every swing) and killing yielded us experience points; once a new level was attained we could pick from lots of skills - all divided up into 3 skill trees.The game had a long story but with mediocre characters and pretty banal dialogues. Still, it was very good and the story continued in a stand-alone expansion called Dead Island Riptide.If you know what Dead Island is:Dying Light offers the ultimate Dead Island experience! We can finally do all kinds of parkour techniques and by doing so reach the top of just about every building. This is something I missed from Dead Island - I did figure out how to jump on to vans (from a car) but it was pretty annoying that no climbing was possible. Later in the story we receive a grappling hook that further eases the movement to the point where it is almost too easy to escape!However, Dying Light features some pretty nasty undead creatures called the Volatiles. They only appear at night and can almost outrun our hero - they run and climb very fast and spitting deadly acid towards us is also in their repertoire. So, don't think for one sec that climbing makes the game very easy - there are some challenging side missions that primarily focus on nighttime adventures. Of course, during nighttime we can barely see anything - our quick sense allows us to see the Volatiles even through walls.The story: Finally, we have one! Our hero, Crane, works for a government agency that drops him into the quarantined zone to find out who stole some secret files from them. There are 2 groups of survivors waging war against one another and Crane is about to make friends with both of them. While co-op gameplay allows us to roam the world in groups of 4 everybody looks like Crane - there's just one hero this time but more decent writing went into the game so we finally have a crazy protagonist such a story deserves. Also, human enemies are also good at fighting with melee accessories so you'd better buckle up and prepare!Getting XP in a game has never felt better! Dying Light - similarly to its predecessor - gives us 3 skill trees. However, all 3 can be upgraded parallelly as depending on what we do yields us different types of XP. Completing missions helps us achieve a high Survivor level while fighting zombies increases our Power level. You are just running around climbing / sliding / using grapple hook but not really fighting anybody or doing a mission? Don't worry, your Agility is definitely getting better! The game dares you to play at night as not only are you stronger but gaining XP is doubled this time.Goodbye, workbenches! Yes, you read it right: crafting weapons is now done on the go. Of course, you still need to find a place where you are not bothered by walkers but there are numerous safe houses you can unlock - or you can just get to the rooftop of a very tall building. Also, there's no rage this time but getting closer and closer to the bottom of each skill tree makes you pretty strong without it. If you want the hardest challenge you can choose a higher difficulty level and pick nighttime for all the parkour challenges! Oh, and there are no cars, either, but since the roads are littered with debris and crashed vehicles who would want to cruise the highways when you can just look around and see how beautiful the game is? Sound design is excellent and the lighting / water effects are pretty cool. Severing the limbs of the walkers was already present in Dead Island but now we can see some changes done to the torso of the victim. Character faces also look better and now there are more variations as there are many NPCs asking for favours. Dying Light is an awesome game! Disposing the world of zombies is the most satisfying I have ever experienced in this genre! The clever fighting system, the on-the-go crafting feature and a fully realistic day-night cycle make this game a memorable experience. The story is also much, much better: not Oscar worthy but some scenes will make you remember.I look forward to Dying Light's expansion, The Following, and hopefully Techland will pick up Hellraid and finish it next year (or the also cancelled or indefinitely-put-on-hold Dead Island 2).

												I was worried upon purchasing this game as I percieved it nothing more then Dead Island mixed with Mirror's Edge.Then I played it and found it was Dead Island mixed with Mirror's Edge, For real, this was ♥♥♥♥ing incredible to play.There is just something about the game that is amazing to me, perhaps it is the incredibly fluid movement from surface road to freeway to rooftop back down to the road and all the while destorying zombies?Perhaps it is the satisfyingly gory combat of crushing zombies heads, juking and dancing around heavy hitting brutes, sliding under projectiles from acid spitters, or the rush of ziplining only to land and crush a wandering viral?Maybe it's the fun quests, the even more fun side missions that ask laughs or uncomfortable chuckles of you and your friends as you explore the weird variety of Harran's citizens?I'm sure there is more to this game then I can possibly fit in one respectably long review, but what better way to show you the game then for you to check out twitch streams, steam broadcasts, youtube videos.Just know that all of these things won't give you the feel of the game, but even seeing the game is damn entertaining!So go out, collect kickass loot, destory the violent infected and save your buddies from the gloriously creepy nightmares.Good Night, and Good Luck.

												When this game was first announced, I had mixed feelings. I didn't know it was gonna be so DAMN good, but listen, the main story lost me. It was kinda corny, and could have been a lot better. The parkour, the buggy driving, the zombie killing, blueprints, and all that was absolutely amazing. It definitely exceeded my expectations. The Following was a perfect expansion pack, and all the DLC for Dying Light is worth every penny. I cannot wait for a Dying Light 2 and more DLC!If you enjoy zombies then definitely get this game! It really is a great zombie killing experience. It's even better when you're with friends and playing on the Nightmare difficulty! It's hard, scary, and you must have a level of teamwork. If you ever need someone to play with and you have a microphone, then feel free to add me. Dying Light is among the best horror zombie survival games ever made. Congratulations!			"

Posted: February 9, 2016
												So I just got the season pass to get The Folllowing and the other new DLC today. I loved the original game, me and my boyfriend are currently in a two person game.This is a normal difficulty game.  Currently we're still in the slums (back tracking for sidequests) We discovered first off, you run a TON faster, it's almost like you have a natural speed boost, just without the stamina boost to match. We've also discovered that if you're in different outfits your character moves slightly different when standing still. The Ninja has a tigher, smaller posture, like you're ready to bolt off the nearest building and end up 3 blocks away. The Urban Explorer makes you look angrier, darker and well... angry just fits his tone to the character.  (Yes, we're the kind of nerds to notice the random crap like this xD)  Also, GRAPHICS, HOLY CRAP GRAPHICS! It's smoother, cleaner, prettier, the weather system REALLY shows. you can see individual rain drops hitting the ground/buildings/assorted random objects, the wind is cleaner, very realistic, the wind rustling through the trees matches beautifully.  The runners have an upgraded programming that makes them more intelligent (to a degree in terms of where they can climb) and... they seem faster and more aggressive. Alright... tried night mode, and whoever is in charge really needs to evict the new neighbors... They're quiet rude. It's changed a bit, the night stalkers are faster, meaner, deal more damage, come in larger numbers, summon larger hoards of volatiles and have gotten uglier. Not to mention, they're much harder to kill... I got stupidly lucky and managed to kill one from the back with 2 shots from the Golden Double Barrel but that seemed to have been a fluke and it took 10 shots for the next one. You either find the sweet spot, or you run out of ammo trying to find it. Make sure you're stocked up on night vision boosters, not being able to see now can be a death sentence when before it was just a minor annoyance to accidentally fall off a building. The merchants now have pictures of every item they have for sale, so if you're looking at buying a katana you can see what it looks like. The new guns, we've so far found a golden double barrel shotgun (2550 damage) that will happily take out small groups of zombies, only downside is it only has 2 shots per load, so it's a slower weapon but the damage and destruction it causes are so worth it. Just as a side note on the shotgun... When you get this weapon, find a group of like 20+ zombies and just start shooting into the crowd, the reload is so fast if you're far enough away (about 20 or so meters) none of them can get you and you turn the entire street into jelly. The gun my boyfriend got is the Advanced Military Rifle (274 damage) which is replacing his Camo Military Rifle (137 damage) he can't stop raving about the damage increase and how it seems more accurate from the hip while moving. The Golden German Pistol (331 damage) similar accuracy and handling to the original German pistol but with more damage and a bit more accurate. Reload is similar to the regular German Pistol. The Engraved Semi-Auto Shotgun (2550 damage) rapid fire compared to the Golden (8 shots vs. 2 for Golden) not as good as the Golden Double Barrel it seems as there's a definite accuracy difference between the Golden and Engraved, Engraved having a slower reload time. But overall the shotgun has had some MAJOR improvements and will definitely be used more than it was in the original game where you could be 2 meters away and still miss the zombie... The Advanced Police Rifle (368 damage) basically the sniper rifle for Dying Light (at least so far without testing the crossbow yet) watched my boyfriend pull off a ~75m headshot on a zombie. Two shots to kill a runner, the handling when sniping ""is sweet"" (his words haha) but if you've got something up in your face it's just like the old police rifle but with more damage, awkward and misses some times. So far, if you find a gold colored weapon, it'll most likely just become your new best friend. (Note: None of these weapons have been upgraded or adjusted in anyway via weapon upgrades) It was a bit of a shock to see the bow AND arrows for sale at any shop when we still haven't completed BOZAK, but.... they still suck for damage, accuracy, fire rate... it's a nice novelty weapon but otherwise... meh.  Looking forward to finding the crossbow. As for the zombies, the overall intelligence and aggressiveness of them seems to have been overall increased, nothing too crazy like ""oh-my-god-I-ran-into-a-group-of-5-or-more-zombies-and-died-instantly"" more like their ""eyesight"" got better and the crowds are larger, a LOT larger....  Random note, discovered you can put dents in the roofs of cars, chop down stop signs, do basic vandalism and the like.			"

												Amazing game, it certainly sets a new standard for action zombies games. It's exactly as it seems from the trailers: a mix of Dead Island and Mirror's Edge. You'll spend most of your time running from rooftops to tiny ledges, gliding on ropes, smashing doors and butchering a million zombies. The game is VERY fun and exciting, you'll be surprised at how long the adrenaline can be effective: I've spent almost 100 hours under its effect :) Non stop action at its core.For the characters and story it certainly doesn't top off Dead Island, characters have no charisma - including your main character who's really a lameass. The main story is meh and almost non existent, its dialogues totally bland. Music is good, not as good as DI's one, but still good. The surrounding and environment are more impressive in Dying Light though: huge buildings and slums mixed in a very realistic settings: little roads, shops, houses, dumpsters, stairs, etc. Sure it's really missing the exotic island beach theme feel but it's compensated with the crazy action. BTW you'ld better not have a fear of height because the second main map is even more geared toward the rooftop runs than the first one!Most of the quests are good though, some secondary quests really making up for the main story. I was surprised with the quantity of stuff to do, things to collect, quests to do, parkour runs, , blueprints and loot to find! Quests givers are spread out in the maps, there's also a lot of parkour races to do and a lot of achievements. The controls are perfect and very responsive (I used an XBox controller). There's several difficulty levels and even a new game +. Like in DI the multi mode isn't mandatory and you can play fully solo, with no other player entering your game. About the weapons, well DI wins this one, Dying Light's weapon crafting is pretty meh and slow to unlock in the beginning. Most of the blueprints are more or less hidden in the huge maps and you'll often trip on boxes containing them. However the weapons never seem that powerful, except for the last ones ofc. Zombies seem to have a huge pool of life (how ironic) and weapons wears off very fast. Be warned that the first 5 hours of the game (if solo) are VERY hard, mainly because you're totally helpless: no good weapons, unable to hit more than 3 times before panting, out of breath, unable to even run efficiently and having very few possible parkour movements. But you'll eventually begin to unlock some good skills and that's when you'll begin to really play. The game really shines when you unlock the grapple and you suddenly transform into Spiderbatman (yes, it's a huge bat with leg spiders *nods*), it really makes the exploration really really fun!Can't wait to grab the expansion when it goes on sale. I'm a huge zombies games fan, and this one is very good. I totally recommend it and really hope they make a sequel - or a ton of expansions, anything!			"

												Imagine if Dead Island wasn't a wonky, glitch-filled mess. Imagine you could freerun, go anywhere, do anything, meet weird people, and occasionally judo throw a zombie off a roof. Imagine getting a running start and drop kicking a zombie so hard his body gets stuck in the geometry of the map. You don't have to imagine it, I've lived it. Follow me.10/10			"

												Disclaimer: At the time of this review I have not yet beat this game but I am at about 80% completionDying Light is a seemingly well-put together game made by Techland (the same group that made the Dead Island Game(s)) which seems to have a lot of focus on the fine details of combat in a would-be zombie survival scenario (all of the different evade moves and the night time dangers for example).  And seems to pretty much be a different and improved upon version of Dead Island (albeit Dead Island is a different game and has a different gameplay feel and varied combat aspects from Dying Light).  Dying light, in my opinion, has a well thought-out focus on weapon-dealing damage systems as well as a functional and fairly easy to use inventory system (although I don’t like the fact you can’t reload your firearms in the safe zones so you can top off ammo but I digress).  The combat is fun and satisfying (I especially like the mortal kombat x like x-ray bone breaking crackly sound and visual effects when you hit enemies a certain way).  And the enemy reactions are what you would expect and were programmed very well in my opinion.  However some of the aspects I have noticed in Dying Light that I do not like are the facts that a lot of the other specialty weapons you obtain thru quest completions and upgrades seem very obsolete and awkward (for example the shield, yes I do like it, but I feel it has an extremely limited use in that it breaks too quickly).  Also some of the combat moves in the upgrade skill tree seem somewhat clunky and confusing; such as the turn and evade and grapple perks although I found some use in them, they seem to negate their effects in that when I try to grapple I often get hit in the process which is what grappling is supposed to do (which is stop the attack).  I also think that some of the throwables seem kind of obsolete in that in times when you need them they seem underpowered and by the time you get upgrades for certain throwables your weapons are already doing enough damage (and you have firearms as well) that your throwables become somewhat obsolete (however molotovs and explosives seem to be fairly effective across the board), however this is not to say throwables are completely of no use though and some players may find a need for them despite their seemingly underpowered aspect (and when I say throwables I am mainly talking about non-explosive/molotov throwabales/consumables).  Overall in regards to items I do like the diversity in what you can create and use to help you in your adventures across Harran(although sometimes the choices feel overwhelming at times).  And I really like how the firearms (especially the aspect on how ammo is acquired) are a nice improvement over Techland’s predecessor game Dead Island (but don’t get me wrong I still like Dead Island!).  And of course the parkour aspect of the game is very fun and immersive and very nicely done.  Overall I do recommend this game, but be warned, if you already have Dead Island or Dead Island Riptide this game may seem just like an upgrade so purchase it at your own will.Below is my pro/con breakdown:Pros:*Nicely done combat system that feels satisfying (them breaking bones/fracture/crackly sound effects when you hit enemies a certain way are a nice touch).* Good atmosphere that leaves you in a state of fear and on your toes most of the time (night/day differences in difficulty...literally and figuratively).*Good inventory system and overall layout for ease of use in regards to your HUD and upgrade capability (no more workbenches!  Some of you might get that reference).*Good graphics and nice touches and details here and there throughout the game (such as the little animations when you pick up items and search objects for items).*Well done and engaging cut scenes that add to immersion and overall storyline that are an improvement upon Techland’s previous title(s).*Diverse (but somewhat seemingly obsolete) choices in weapons and utility items for the player to utilize (this is both a pro and con).*Parkour in a zombie survival game (yes this is a pro on its own, and I think you will agree if you play it or even watch it being played).Cons:-Somewhat clunky upgrades in terms of functionality and practical use (the grappling move and turn-around-and-evade upgrades seem kind of obsolete as well as other upgrades/perks at times).-Somewhat obsolete item craft/upgrade options that feel clunky and just of no use at times (this is somewhat optional depending upon playstyle but I felt it was worth noting as a ‘con’ due to all the options. Which there seems to be a lot of, not implying many options are bad though, but when you have so many and your current weapons do just find it seems somewhat obsolete as well as some of these consumable/throwables seem underpowered as mentioned in my description above).-Diverse (but somewhat seemingly obsolete) choices in weapons and utility items for the player to utilize (this is both a pro and con).-Some classical glitches that make a return from Techland’s previous titles (you either laugh at them, or hate them) glitchy ragdolls and zombies at times along with some other minor glitches here and there but it’s not really that bad to be honest but some people might be annoyed by them (personally I get a good laugh out of most of them).Rating Breakdown:-1 clunky upgrades-.5 items seem obsolete in comparison to other weapons-.5 too much choices aren’t necessarily a good thing at times and can be clunky if not implemented properly((out of 10 (10 – 2 = 8) = final rating of 8/10)I give this game an 8/10, it’s a pretty decent and very fresh experience (the parkouring REALLY helps make it the overall experience it is) IF you don’t own another game similar to it (like Dead Island).  In closing, I recommend it IF you don’t own another game similar to it, but if you do, I still think the game is a decent buy.			"

												It plays like Dead Island during the day. In fact it's so exactly like Dead Island it's almost indistinguishable, with the exception of the parkour. At night everything goes to hell and the difficulty gets ramped up. You can unlock safe zones to sleep in, there's lockpicking, all in all it comes off as sort of a Assassins Creed (parkouring around) meets Bioshock (the macho-jerk character and storyline) meets Dead Island (gather/quest/craft/kill zombies), while your character does dumb plot-related stuff that you probably won't agree with but can't really control.There's a skill system with many branches to unlock, and your at-first clumsy character will soon be flipping over zombies like a pro.My only gripe, aside from the storyline being on rails (which I don't personally care about because I'm more interested in gameplay, which is solid), is that you can kick a zombie 1000 times and your foot will never wear out, break, whatever. Hit a zombie with a metal pipe 10 times and it's broken, and if you don't quickly repair it, it'll soon break. Your foot, meanwhile, outlasts pipes, knives, table legs, shovels, you name it. If you're going to put weapon durability in a game (which I don't like; do you have any idea how freaking hard it is to break a metal baseball bat? Especially with bones?) then you need to extend it to everything, and fists should sprain, tendons pop, all that, and your foot would break long before a metal pipe. Because of this, until you upgrade your skills the endless kicking and punching can make your character come off like some kind of inexhuastable, but physically very weak, Bruce Lee.			"

												Background: This game came out during the Wave of Zombie Games riding on the push the walking Dead and that Brad Pitt movie. Anyways I have always enjoyed a good Zombie survival game and when you mix it with RPG elements I can't pass up a game like this. Combat Mechanics: The game mixes the usual cast of cobbled together survival melee weapons like baseball bats, axes, and police batons, with the ranged option of guns and homemade explosives. You also have skill tress to increase your ability to survive and even hide from enemies. Now lets add in Parkour. Instead of having to rely on dead sprinting for doors and jumping around mindlessly the game blends in a set of basic to advanced parkour techniques that gives the game a certain verticality (excuse the pun). It makes navigation fluid and more realistic than not being able to climb onto a building to run away.  Social Mechanics: Slim to None. Story is straight forward. Most enemies are scripted to engage you in combat without conversation. Usual Evil dude quips over the handheld radio, standard survival dialog.Final Thoughts: It is a breath of fresh air in the mass arrival of zombie games. It blends open world with crafting, parkour, co-op challenges, and cliche enemy bosses into a game worth playing for the freedom of Survial.			"

Amusing to play, beautiful to look at, terrifying at night and sometimes even very addictive to live, the latest from the parts of Wroclaw is one of the best things that accompany the words ""survival"" and ""horror"" that can be found currently in circulation .

												Zombies and Parkour. One of the best new matchups I've seen in a game. When I first heard about Dying Light over a year ago, not only was I excited at the gameplay but also the possibilities and potential that this game has.  Now with it being finally released I was hoping to see that the game promised on what it would deliver... and it really did.You can definitely see the Devs inspiration throughout the game, taking focus from Left for Dead, Far Cry and (obviously) Dead Island. Personally I could not believe the difference that this game gave me within the first few hours to the rest. To start off with I felt a bit.... A bit like I wanted to run before I could jump (in terms of Parkour) I didn't have the moves and it would take me forever to run around and scale across buildings. I was slow, low on energy and useless with weapons. It would take me from anywhere between 6-10 hits to kill a zombie, going through my stamina bar twice before eventually dislodging the undead brain. Towards the start of the game I was dreading that this was what the game was like - but further on when you learn the ranking system and start to level up and earn points to redeem skill.... it is like a completely different game. It is absolutely fantastic and a breath of fresh air for anyone that wanted to experience the zombie gamestyle again but with a different slant. Character progression is excellent in the game, and im happy to say that I was fairly pleased with the way that the story went - but more so impressed with the optional missions/side quests in the game, for me this is where the game shines. Very interesting and a diverse range of different challenges await. Alongside all these positivities are some negatives - noticeably the fact that in Harran you will see a certain head model put on 25% of the people throughout the game (you all know who Im talking about!) and the fact that some parts to the story are extremely predictable and a bit tedious. Dying Light is gorgeous, there are many moments where you just want to stop what you are doing and appreciate the environment - the sun rays, the shadows, the change of weather... it really is nice. Just make sure to check your back before you do though as Harran is littered with the undead! Before game patches came out I had to manually edit the files to Dying Light to remove parts that I didn't like, the film grain being my main gripe. Now though its nice to see the Devs listening to the community and seeing what they want - now there is an option to remove film grain in game settings.Melee, dismemberment, blood, screams, satisfying? More than ever before. The first few hours of the game I felt like a fat slob that had never attempted to swing for anyone in his life, shortly afterwards through level progression I was becoming more and more the ultimate ninja warrior that I knew I could be one day! Delicately carving up zombies with a variety of highly modified & rare weapons. Maybe use my electrified sledgehammer to take out the knee caps? then move to my Korek Machete to aggressively perform facial deconstruction? Sure why not. Through a variety of weapons and equipment there always seems to be fun around every corner in this game. So much more to talk about but I tend to leave my reviews at a similar level of depth, the last thing I wanted to mention was that Co-op with this game is an absolute blast and I would recommend all newcomers to give this option a go. The availability of drop in drop out with up to 4 people makes it really easy too. You can simply toggle your game to ""Public"" and within moments  you will see people looking for games and coming in to join your fight. Overall, really pleased with how this game has started and its provided me with so many hours of entertainment. I am looking forward to DLC to continue my Dying Light experience. Its rare to find a game that can mix different genre's so successfully but through this combination of horror and action, Dying Light is a solid recommendation from me and a great base for future games in the series.

												Amazing game! If you like parkour and you like to kill zombies, then this is a must have for you, it's basically a Mirror's Edge with Dead Island, the story is amazing, you do the main quests or side quests or parkour challenges and a lot more, all those are really fun to play specially playing co-op, you need to deliver things, you need to run, you need to survive, you need to kill the zombies, on daylight things are kinda calm you have some zombies there you craft weapons and kill them, but at night things gets complicated, all zombies runs like crazy after you and there's special zombies that only appears at nights, it's scary, good night good luck.

												A REFINED DEAD ISLANDI really enjoyed Dead Island so I've been lookng forward to this game, it was worth the wait. It's not a masterpice by any means, but it kept me entertained for the 30 hours it took me to complete the game.PROS:- Excellent combat which gets more fun as you progress through the game, due to the well thought out upgrade system- Loads of weapons and ways to slay the zombies- Nice graphics and stable performance (post patching)- Does a great job at creating atmosphere with music, sound and visuals.- The freerunning is superb- Co-op multiplies the funCONS:- Side missions are the standard and get boring- Although enemy variety is a bit better than Dead Island, it's still lacking- Underwhelming and lack of boss battles- Story and characters are decent, but cliched to hell- Variety of environments was a bit lackingOVERALL - Great game, does nothing new or nothing wrong - it's just fun.

												Probably the first game in at least a year that actually warrents a $60 price tag. The game is COMPLETE. It has an entertaining story, with developed characters, and pretty decent amount of depth for the main story. There is emotions all over the place. Anger, humor, pity... It also progresses at a good pace. The challenges of starting, mid game, and end game are perfect. Harder zombies are introduced as you go along at just the right pace.For the most part the controls feel pretty natural. However at times (when zombies lunge forward, or when you are dropping on them from above, or trying to exexcute a ""finish"") they can be a tad clunky, leaving you unsure when you were supposed to time the button press or where you were supposed to aim.. One time it may work, but not the next.I'm not a big fan of climbing around. The early A.C. games were fun because it was innovative, but once it became manditory and forced, I didn't enjoy it anymore. This game has just the right amount of forcing you to climb and ""platform"" around. Enough variety that it is different, but not annoying. Also not annoying is the respawns. Once you go through an area, it is pretty safe. Although there is freeclimbing to pretty easily avoid the zeds, once you clear an area it is pretty safe for the remainder of the game. Some stragglers but you really feel like to accomplished something after a big fight.The weapons have some variety, and you can build a bit towards how you'd like to play with your weapons. I find the elemental additions to be a little more desired. 90% of the fighting is vs zombies, so some elements are pointless, and when you kill them you have to wait for the element to run its course before looting the body, or you will take damage. After the 1000th zombie, that's annoying. It has a bit of Farcry, mixed with a bit of Fallout, and Dead Island (from this studio). I love the ""Survivor Sense"". It's a small area radar that shows you things to interact with. Really nice mechanic so you aren't running around trying to loot things you already looted, or trying to find the right spot to open the trunk. It's one of those elements that makes the game run more efficient. Not hold your hand, but cut down on time wasting.Overall, I love the game. I honestly can't think of anything that I really DISLIKE about the game, but I do have some improvements that I'd like to see.1) The main characters have very unique faces. However everyone else in the game is very generic. I've seen this one character's face about 10 times (he looks like my friend so I notice). Also the zed models are the same way. Maybe 5 unique models for the most common zeds, and then 1 model for each specialty zed. All in all you're killing less than 10 models of zombie the entire game.2) Sometimes the zombies feel hard to distract. It's like only 10 can focus on something at a time, and the rest just stand there. When using a firecracker, I'd expect every zombie from sidewalk to sidewalk to come to it. 3) The ""runner"" zombies can get annoying. These are the ones that can climb and chase you, and come when there is a loud noise. I like them to keep you on your toes, but sometimes they just keep coming, one by one by one seemingly forever. I just fought a pack, and I want to grab the loot and move on, but the runners keep on coming.4) I spent the last 8 hours doing side quests. Although I got some skills from levels, the money/weapons seems to just scale. So it's all relative. Theoretically you could beat the game with the same ease at lvl 5 as lvl 30. I guess the point is just seeing the content. 5) I wish it wasn't such a linear story. I had hoped there would be at least 1 decision to make that would make a difference. It also wouldn't hurt to maybe have some factions or relations of some sort. No decisions, no factions, and just freerunning around doing random stuff is not as fun as other ""open world/sandbox"" games. 6) Multiplayer... Coop is okay.. But the ""hunter"" thing, just a huge annoyance. My first night in the game, someone dropped in and we did the Vs. thing. He was actually a kind player and told me how to fight him. It was a decent fight, but I wanted to get back to my game. Before I could turn it off, ANOTHER player jumped in. Fought again. Then ANOTHER.. By that time I said screw it and just left the game. That's just insane.. The reward is minimal and the annoyance is through the roof.. Probably the only truely BAD thing I can say about the game. In conclusion, I'd like to say that this game has the polish of a real quality 2nd game of a franchise. Most times I see the first installment of a series and the best I can say is ""it has a bright future"", but this game is great RIGHT NOW AS IS. The next installment can just expand on this game, not worry about going back and fixing things.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: TechlandPublishers: TechlandInitial release: Jan 2016Genre: Action, Zombies, Open World#Worth/NotWorth: #TotesWorthBSERC - (Borderline Sardonic and Extremely Reductive Comparison): What even is Dead Island? Condemned + Far Cry + Splinter Cell Double Agent + The Walking DeadExposition, Concurrence and SummationDying Light is an open world zombie game wherein the balance between smashing faces with pipes and becoming a trapeze artist are equally important.What took me by surprise initially was how much time I spent avoiding zombies entirely. I truly was expecting to smash every face I saw. This dichotomy is extremely well balanced; jumping around and climbing goes into a skill tree. Attacking and fighting nets you points for a separate skill tree. Now, you aren't building a character by any stretch. You essentially are only selecting the order in which you earn new abilities.  The sound design is excellent; from environmental screams to meaty bone crunching face smashing with crowbars everything feels very visceral and eerily tense. Even the air drops and planes flying overhead sound extremely close and create a sort of event in the environment. A sort of race for supplies. nods to the hunger gamesNow, like all zombie themed things. Rarely is the narrative about the zombies themselves. It's far more intriguing to see how relationships develop between those that survive. One of the unique things about Harran (the city the game takes place in) is money still has value and this through me for a loop until I discovered that indeed the virus had been successfully quarantined and that this was all self contained. I mentioned it was interesting to see how relationships develop. Well, as you might expect there are some folks that are less than decent; lets call it cordial. In the early game it's basically all melee but guns do indeed exist and once you start dealing with thugs from other groups of survivors guns become much more of a feasible option. Also, after you level your agility up, you gain the ability to use a grappling hook which is very nice as there is no fast travel whatsoever. This has the hidden ability to basically “Just Cause” yourself into the ground removing fall damage completely. As an example, fighting some thugs in a, lets say 4v1 fight is definitely a white knuckle experience. Especially in close quarters. So much so that after that fight is over, traversing around the normal “biters” as the traditional slow basically lobotomized zombie has been deemed almost feels relaxing. There are random events and side quests rampant throughout the city. There is almost too much content. The enhanced edition has even more and is almost a bit overwhelming. THE GISTIt's from Techland, of course you could say it's Dead Island with better traversal. But I think it is far better made than those games. Dead Island never grabbed me; I don't even like Zombies really. But Dying Light strikes a balance between survival and stroking your hero complex perfectly.Follow my curation for more "

Dying Light is like an enhanced version of Dead Island with parkour and a better overall gameplay.Story and gameplayThe campaign was pretty much a typical zombie movie plot where your, thugs' and military's different standpoint meet which is not necessarily a bad thing. It was executed quite nicely due to good build-up, pacing and voice acting. Additionally, even if most characters were easily forgettable, it had some interesting ones like an insane dude thinking that a scarecrow is his mom, a guy with alien logos on his shirt believing the Illuminati and collecting meteor pieces, or a pair of nerdy twins mocking Americans for not knowing the metric system. Harran is divided into two areas: slums and the old town. They're full of random interactions, challenges, side quests, traps, loot, places which you can turn into safe zones, quarantine areas and, of course, zombies! There are several types of infected: common biters (the slow test dummies), fast and agile virals, exploding ISIS members, spitters (are quitters), tough gym freaks wielding concrete blocks, L4Ds tank with cop uniforms, screaming zombie toddlers, night hunters (volatiles) and more.The parkour is so on point in this game that even the lack of fast traveling wasn't a problem for me, especially after unlocking the grappling hook. Same goes for the combat - it's so satisfying to fight hordes of zombies, cut off their limbs, frizzle or just bait them into groups and blow them up. You can get creative on that.Weapons/equipment/craftingDying Light has a really great and simple crafting system which turns looting into enjoyable process instead of a chore. Some of the blueprints consist of weapon upgrades (like adding electricity, fire or bleeding effects), potions, lockpicks, medkits, other utility stuff such as the grappling hook, throwable items: DIY explosions, flaming shurikens, molotovs, flares, firecrackers, etc. Melee weapons are enjoyable to use and can be modified, they also have a repair limit, hence, after reaching it you can only drop or sell them. Firearms, however, are kinda dull in this game. They perform their job quite nicely, though they're not that fun to use. I had the best time with a bow, which is an opposite of other guns - it's fun but weak as f*ck even with exploding/burning or electric arrows.Levels and skillsBy default, dying light has 3 skill trees: survivor (buffs, item blueprints, survival skills), agility (speed and stamina buffs, agile combat skills) and power (combat skills). The variety in skills is pretty big and having multiple levels makes the game more interesting.""The Following""An expansion which offers more than most sequels do these days:  ♦ Great main story continuation with amazing final boss battle  ♦ Huge country map filled with new content: new interactions, volatile hives, etc.  ♦ A modifiable buggy with great handling mechanics, fuel consumption, neat upgrade/repair system requiring car parts and. You can also mount other stuff such as a flamethrower, an electric cage, a mine dispenser, UV headlights, etc. There's also a new skill tree dedicated for vehicles which grants more assets and upgrades for your buggy.  ♦ New melee weapons and firearms (crossbow, SMG, semi-auto shotgun, etc.)  ♦ New zombies (Freaks of Nature)  ♦ Legendary skill tree  ♦ Many other small detailsOverall, this game is visually stunning, runs well, has a great storyline and gameplay, co-op and a mode where you can play as a zombie against other players. It may be a bit pricey but getting this on sale is a must.9/10 "

												The most challenging, competitive game in the world, which makes everyone go insane, lose their minds, become furious, agressive and arrogant. Best COOP in which you're ready to tear to shreds for your partner. Berserk PVP. Difficult, rough, no mercy BTZ mode which demands godlike skills from you, wild intuition and insane luck due to many broken things in game including lag, which make PVP look like russian roulette in many situations! Great story mode. Huge open world maps. Amazing DLC. Many charismatic characters. Tons of stunning weapons. Modders, cheaters, laggers, haters, sh*ttalkers, sick people and a lot more! DL is a small community where players praise the best ones, watch their streams for 24 hours, trying to play like them and at the same time talk sh*t behind their backs. DL is a community where players copy each other and steal tactics, hate each other, betray each other, by stealth use mods, cheats and game bugs, deceive each other and at the same time support each other and gather together in powerful team to kick somebody's *ss (who they hate the most) to make victory screenshots after and upload videos of battles on youtube for mocking and to show off. We are competitive, we are bold, we are creative, we are great, we are brave, we are cowards, we are big, we are small, we are stuck up, we are modest, we are friendly, we are hostile, we are skillful, we are vile, we are honorable, we are pathetic, we are cheaters, we are legit, we are winners, we are losers. We are lone wolves, we are teamers, we are hunters... we have lives and we don't. We love to say ""I'm just having fun!""F*cking welcome to join us!			"

												Your name is Crane and you are working for some people at a place called the Tower and they have given you orders to reboot the electric grid while the sun is setting....now for most that doesnt mean much but for you it means everything.  You need to reboot the grid before a select group of superhuman zombies who can only be described as nightmare fuel emerge from their hidey holes and rip off your ♥♥♥♥ing face like a swarm of zombie locusts.  You flip the switch and the screen completely locks up but the sound keeps going....whats going on? you hear a loud bursting of a door or a wall and what sounds like a boss monster.  You dont see any of that though because the screen is still fixated on the electric box.  Suddenly the game jumps to life and you see a zombie with a Rebar sledgehammer much like in Fallout swinging wildly towards you,  You have to kill this giant grizzly beast of a man on a time limit with the added benefit of him slamming down his sledge to attract more zombies. The only thing is that the game will periodically freeze frame while the game will play in the background.  Thats right folks you will be in the middle of fighting a horde of zombies, be near a environmental hazard you dont want to stand in or jumping from rooftop to rooftop like a ghetto Batman and the game will say ""This looks like far too much fun for you to handle, let me just go ahead and kill you"" and lock up.  This is a debilitating, crippling, game killing bug that needs to be sorted out immediately for the game to even be playable.Besides that fact the game is incredibly fun to play and makes a effort to build the world and make it halfway believable and not weighing you down or forcing you through the story like Call of Dookie or the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game adaption of the movie Red Dawn, Homefront.  A lot of the models, textures, and game mechanics from Dead Island are copy pasted into the game but it doesnt take away from Dying Lights right to have its own name.  Aside from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t bug this game can stand on its own and not pay any mind to the people who say its just Dead Island 1.5.I would put this game as a must buy for anybody who is a loot ♥♥♥♥♥, people who like sandbox games, or light RPG / combat mechanics.  I would sugguest that you just wait for the patch to get rid of the terrible awful frame rate drops before you pick it up so you wont rage quit after the game decides to freeze beside a soon-to-be exploding vehicle.  Good luck out there in Zombieland!			"

												With a great scenery and beautiful graphics, Dying Light is easily the best looking zombie game out there. The story of Dying Light is really generic, but the characters and the protagonist make up for that. Dying Light has a decent sized city to play in and gives you a new city to play in further into the game. Free running over the roofs and many obstacles in the city of Harran feels awesome and really smooth. Combat could use a bit more depth but has some really smooth dodging mechanics to keep it fun, and make it challenging at times. There's also a nice upgrading/crafting system for your weapons and creating fun gadgets like Throwing stars and Fireworks. Leveling is really fun aswell, you have 3 different skill tree's which you level up at the same time and some really nice skills to unlock. Looting and lockpicking is fun but in the end not really worth it most of the time.The A.I. of the zombies is decent and the game has good cinematics and voice acting. However the mainstory is a bit short and the ending is kinda dissapointing, i'm not going to spoil anything but first of all the last mision can't be played co-op. This is big let down for someone who played through the whole game with a friend. Also the final boss is a quick time event, which makes it even more dissapointing.Even though the game has some downsides, overall this game is alot of fun. And it succeeds at what it tries to do,  Being one of the best zombie games out there. I would definitely recommend Dying Light to anyone that loves free roaming zombie games.			"

												Patch Update: Minor gains for AMD systems, however still can't recommend. Yes, the game can now be considered playable, however, AMD systems are not fully optimized yet, and will have trouble staying above 30 FPS while in the most demanding situations.Short video showcasing the minor gains from the patch:

			Hey guys. Techland released a patch for Dying Light earlier today. So, I decided to hop onto the game and see if it helped. Did it? Yes..		

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Can't recommend this game for people on AMD systems. Running an FX-8350, 8gb Ram, Sapphire R9 290 (4bg VRam). Can't get the game to maintain higher than 25 FPS even with every setting turned off/low.  Through the tutorial the FPS was fine, but as soon as I went into the open world, it just fell apart. Just looking through some of the posts on reddit/other reviews, it seems to be mostly working fine with NVidia cards.Video contains a few minutes footage of the FPS tanking during relatively quiet gameplay.

												The plot is fairly bland and generic, but the game itself has an interesting setting with some decent characters. Where it really shines, though, is the gameplay. The parkour system is really fun, crafting weapons is great, and the way that gameplay changes (fairly dramatically) between day and night is fantastic. Even several hours into the game, nights feel oppressive and terrifying. The addition of coop also gave it more legs for me.			"

												One of the best open world co-op games out there. This game is from the devs that made Dead Island. That game seemed to me comparable to a weaker, more action oriented version of a Bethesda Fallout game with Zombies, but was still fun with friends. Dying Light takes that foundation and ups it x10. Less bugs, and smoother more enjoyable gamesplay and environment (not to mention parkour). Story is meh but it keeps the world engaging. Playing single player can be fun but might get stale to some folks after awhile. In my opinion the chicken and waffles here is playing with friends. F*** playin in game nights tho (even with friends).			"

												Was only suppose to play half an hour or so and then go watch a movie before bed, ended up playing 5 hours straight and ruining my next day at work.The game itself certainly is impressive, the main narrative is interesting and the side missions are surprisingly rich compared to other games. With surprising plots and twists that really keeps it interesting. This could however could also be down to random encounters (such as airdrops) that can turn a lazy stroll down the street to a gazelle race through the city or hide and seek that will have you scurrying around on all fours while waiting for whatever is hunting you to turn their backs.The main Zombies “biters” are little better then a nuisance if you are paying attention, the only time I have had real issues is when I ran smack into a hoard while being chased by “virals” which are infected living that can give you a run for your money, very 28 days later like. That and there are a lot spoiler zombies that will have you worried (Volatile) when the sun goes down.Had a very “Fun” moment where 2 people had joined my game just as it was getting Dark, we were pretty much playing Sandbox. Running around and bullying the “biters” laughing and comparing different ways of killing them and the few “virals” that interrupted us. (Coop makes it a lot easier as you can gang up on more powerful zombies and watch each other’s backs)This changed big-time however as the sun went down, we went from hunting to being hunted real fast. Trying to keep it together as a group when a hoard of virals are hot on your heals is both terrifying and hilarious at the same time, we ended up chased into an apartment complex which turned out to be a dead end. But thanks to great teamwork we actually held out till morning by holding a small apartment with one entrance, one person would heal and repair his weapons while lending an occasional kick while the two others held the Volatiles at bay with UV lights and everything from leg furniture to screwdrivers and wrenches.Most heart racing experience I have had in gaming for a very long-time, our elation at surviving however went south when we realised the battered and retreating Volatiles had been replaced by a hoard of zombies “biters” that swarmed the building we were in. Seeing your team being dragged down one at the time by a wall of dead flesh, before being pulled out of your corner and devoured was surprisingly enjoyable.Only real thing I can put my finger on is optimization, the game doesn’t seem to be 100% optimized and if you have AMD graphic card you might encounter some FPS drops that shouldn’t happen. Hopefully this will be addressed in patches.If not a 10/10 then defiantly a 9/10			"

												As much as I enjoyed playing Dying Light, I don't think I would recommend this game if you plan on playing it alone. It is infinitely more fun to play with at least one (up to three) friend(s). Having said that, Dying Light is a fun, exciting and thrilling zombie-parkour-survival(-ish) game. Positive:- The parkour mechanic is fun, refreshing and usually works as expected.- Night time is scary, but the risk to reward ratio is good (once you've levelled up a bit).- Night time is scary. Even when you've progressed further in the game.- It becomes easier to kill standard zombies, but the mutated ones are always challenging.- You will be punished for poor decisions.- You should play with others because your teammates can revive you, as opposed to playing alone where you die instantly. - Grappling hook is soooooo much fun.- Two fairly large maps to explore with plenty of side quests, collectables, easter eggs and challenges.- Scenery is quite nice. - Interesting interactions with some crazy NPCs.- This game teaches you how to treat your mother.Negative:- Killing zombies and thugs is extremely difficult in the beginning (especially on hard). Get the head stomp as soon as possible. It made zombie killing much easier and fun. - Ranged weapons change everything, especially the bow and arrow.- It's a shame that you can't infinitely repair weapons unless you exploit a NPC.- It's very difficult to get a decent weapon in the beginning of the game, but later in the game you are showered with melee weapons and guns.- Day time can get boring and repetitive, but night time is always exciting.Conclusion: Dying Light is definitely a fun game. The parkour mechanics and running at night is what makes this game for me. However, I must stress that I would not have enjoyed this game as much if I had played it alone. It is still quite expensive at the moment, but consider picking it up when it goes on sale.  "

												I thought Zombie games were losing their cool, nothing new or impressive, franchises dying or becoming bad, lots of titles with the same logic. But this one has something that makes it addictive.10/10Positive aspects:-It runs great. The mobility system works really well, I remember playing it so much that I was walking on the street and felt like climbing a wall, the parkour gives you a sense of freedom rarely found in games, not as responsive as Mirror's Edge, but not buggy or glitchy. -Great scenarios and graphics. It has two different zones, slums and a richer part of city, It almost looks better than real life.-Short loading times. -Progression makes you wanna play more and more, the game is hard at times, and it takes some grinding to evolve by learning new skills and abilities, which you appreciate you when get and start using it more oftenly.-Many sidequests.Negative aspects:-Story isn't exactly original (but how could it be with zombies?), but characters, specially the protagonist is very well developed.-Zombies aren't original and there aren't many different kinds. However, during nigh they get really badass. "

												OK First off, I really liked almost all of this game. Ill get back to that later but lets talk about what I liked cause the dislikes are very few, but also very strong. Pros1: The combat is fun for me. it was like they took dead island and revamped the combat in a way where the zombies are really dangerous in a crowd, human opponents are able to block and dodge fairly well, the special infefected need to be aproached carefully at first. the combat has weight, it feels like you are doing the damage proportial to you swing......later. at first you are a wimp, but you feel a little over powered by the end but i was still having fun chopping up zambies in crazy ways.2:The parkour kicks♥♥♥♥♥ oh man, i love running around in this game and just seeig how far i could push it. when you get the grappling hook and roll ability, it feels like you can just jump from anything and never stop moving add this with the previously mentioned combat and its just fantastic.3: the night gamestyle was alot different from the day for me (obviously). the day night mechanic is pretty cool, and they pace the change between the two well. struggling to get a mission done before the night hits is alwayas tense from me and trying to navigate through the night for certain missions was also pretty scurry at times.4:multiplayer is just fun, but then again almost any game can be fun with friends.5:Fun upgrades- it seems like the upgrades really made you feel like you werent grinding for them, they came often and brought with them a slew of new abilities that realy spice up gameplay as well.ConsCertain missionsWhat do i mean? well lets start with somethign i HATE in games where you can level up and earn new abilities: Forced  downgrades for missions. I was just praising the grappling hook earlier cause it is a fun and cool item. so why would you take it away in some missions. I understand you wanna make it harder, but making a game harder by not also considering the upgrades in the added difficulty (cause if it was designed right the hook wouldnt matter) is lame. why would you give me some cool stuff to be like ""Oh you cant use it here cause youre tired. but not so tired that you cant pull yourself up multiple times with your upper body and core body strength, cause thats not more tiring that firing a retractable hook."" just saying guys. dont make me spider man then gimp me when it matters  second: QTE. what the hell man? I loved the combat in this game so why ruin it by making the last boss a qte event? there was no other qte event in the whole game that i can remember correct me if im wrong  and not to hop on the ubisoft hatewagon, but why would you follow that lazy method? especially when you had a great little combat system already set up?  it boggles my mind.all in all the game is fun, double so when you have some friends together. despite my hate, and its a deep deep hate, for those two things, the game itself is really enjoyable. I recommend it with its flaws and all			"

												Here's a too long list of some stuff:+Very fun gameplay in general+Detailed parkour mechanics+Great maps with memorable locations+Fun combat with a lot of moves+Pretty grayfix+A lot of love went into the level designs+Early on, the game is fairly tense, especially at night+Nice variety in zombies+Human enemies (try to) act intelligently and avoid, parry and counter your attacks, and gets scared by guns if they don't have any+Fun and plentiful sidequests, which aren't just fetch quests+Guns feel like guns (except when 'you' get shot)+Good flashlight, unlike most games with horror elements (almost too good)+Fun gadgets, mostly+Disturbing things (like the crying zombie child, or huge piles of gore & bones)+Satisfying enviromental murderings (throwing zombies into spikes, triggering traps, kicking enemies off cliffs, etc)-Horrible weapon scaling (way, waay too powerful once you get to Old Town)-Pointless weapon modification effects (since they die in one hit by the time you get any decent mods anyways)-Over-the-top skills, such as dropping 20 meters, doing a roll and taking zero damage,drop kicking zombies 10 meters into the air, infinite stamina, among many more.-God-awful boss battles (most bosses can be pulverized in 20 seconds or less by just mashing M1)-Puke-inducingly horrendous final boss battle (QTE's in 2015? WHY?!)-Boring grappling hook that just takes you directly from A to B with absolutely zero physics involved (shouldn't exist)-Cars and trash count as soft landings (what the f0ck even??)-Poor optimization, 'especially' for AMD rigs-Nowhere near eerie enough to be scary-A lot of cliche story elements-Unbalanced zombie vs human gamemode (also, why can't we invade as runner zombies??)-Nobody can see your flashlight, not even humans-Overpowered guns, especially the shotgun (too much ammo reserves as well)-Medkits are too easy to procure-Wonky multiplayer with no difficulty scaling-Bleed literally does nothing against zombies, and elec & poison are functionally the same-Everything explodes and dismembers too easily (should be a rare occurace from power attacks only IMO)That's all I can think of atm.Possible GOTY contender for me personally, regardless of my nitpicking.TL:DRIt's an extremely fun game with a lot of flaws that weighs it down after a while,but definately worth to get, especially if you like PARKUUUUURR.

												I think it's finally time I share my opinion about this game with the world, since I just reached the 300 mark and the game is on a big sale.People can hate all they want on my PERSONAL OPINION, but here we go.I'm going to start off by saying ""Dying Light"" is my favorite game of all time. It takes my favorite elements of ANY game (Zombies, Parkour, Open-World) and combines them into an original piece of art.So, the base game by itself offers two huge maps, which you can easily traverse with this game's delightful parkour system (I say screw Assassin's Creed, THIS is freedom). The story will be taking you through every street of ""The Slums"" and ""The Old Town"", and the side-quests will be taking you into people's personal lives. Doing each of these things, along with smashing Zombies to bits, will reward you with points towards unlocking new Skills which MAKE THE GAME MORE FUN! Along with that, you will be rewarded with unique weapons and sometimes even things like ziplines connecting parts of the city making the travelling, again, more fun. People overlook this part of the game, thus avoiding more than half the fun of it, stick to the main storyline, and then get disappointed by the ending. Oh, and about the ending, you will be using your Parkour and Zombie-fighting Skills all the way until the very end of the last mission, and then instead of doing all sorts of cool combinations with the game they created, the Devs decided to fill it with talking and Quick-Time Events.And oh, the Devs. After seeing how they react to the Community's feedback on this game, I started loving Techland. They encourage the Community to send them messages saying what they liked about the game, how it could be improved and take it all into consideration. Their customer support for this game is amazing, with sometimes even giving away their PERSONAL E-mail address just to help people with problems they have in the game.They ensured the game is equally supported on all platforms, while most of the community is on PS4, a bit less on Xbox One, and the least on PC (the numbers are probably changing very often, last time I checked, actually quite a while ago, it was like this.), they included the Developer Tools for this game on PC, allowing the community to make maps that have every enjoyable aspect from the actual game. However, they STILL kept it balanced, with porting the best community maps to consoles. And that was it for ""Dying Light"". But wait, we're here to talk about ""Dying Light: The Following - Enhanced Edition"". This package is completely worth the price even without a sale, including the game and the Season Pass, as well as improved graphics and optimization. Going back to the topic of the great support this game has, even the physical copy owners, like me, today have access to the ""Enhancements"" for free, and have the chance to upgrade to only the Season Pass. However, if you're looking to buy the game, you'll get all you need in DL: TF -EE.The contents of the Season Pass are:- MASSIVE The Following DLC (which I have covered in a seperate review, it's still worth knowing it offers a map bigger than both from the base game combined and introduces driving)- INTENSE The Bozak Horde DLC, making your heart pump insanely fast while you race with time in an attempt to win the ""Bozak Bow"", a great stealth weapon- Ultimate Survor Bundle, I consider it more like bonus content for the Season Pass, offering 3 Outfits and 4 kick♥♥♥♥♥weapon Blueprints- Cuisine & Cargo, along with USB I consider it just 2 bonus Quarantine Zones that give you a chance to get some epic loot.You do not, however, get the most recent 4 personalization bundles, each one offering an Outfit, weapon Blueprint(s) and a Buggy Paintjob in this package. I was not happy about this at first, but I realized people should just consider it as an opportunity to support the Devs even more.Oh, but with the base game comes another great feature, the ""Be The Zombie"" mode. Starting off as a pre-order bonus, making it's way to a DLC, and then becoming a part of the game itself, BTZ lets you play as a super-powerful Night Hunter, on a quest to kill all humans. From the Survivor's point of view, the Night Hunter's invasions are a terrifying experience. You won't know what I'm talking about until you try it, but trust me, the feeling of a deadly creature watching you from the dark and coming for you, while the only way to defend yourself is a UV Flashlight and flares that burn out way too fast, both of them being an easy target for your enemy's disgusting spit is scary AF.So, this review's targets are the people who are looking for a good game in the crowded-with-unfinished-unsupported-abandoned-by-developers-junk Zombie genre as it is today.This game's Demo says that the full game offers 50 hours of gameplay, while it has offered me 6 times the amount!For all of you considering buying this game, it is very well optimized, supported, finished, smooth and worth every penny.

												Review from 3 hours in.Mirror's Edge meets and improves Dead Island and marries Just Cause.  And for those complaining about AMD video chips... you can reduce the settings without any real visible effect.  I had problems with stuttering and such... but reduced the graphics settings, and they went away.-----UPDATE 1: The missions are appropriately tough... and make use of the parkour in not just an obligatory manner.  I feel really free to find my way on my own, and do the objectives that I really want to do, even if there is a main story.  As you get used to moving around the city, it's actually really fun just doing that!  Very intuitive, and very freeing... just like in Mirror's Edge.------UPDATE 2: So, it took me a bit, but I made it to the point that the people are in Walking Dead, i.e. the zombies, while dangerous, aren't really scary.... then it turned night.WHAT.THE.****			"

												Got it during the Summer 2016 sale, best game i've bought in a while. If you love killing zombies with practically whatever you want in an open world enviroment you'll love this. And the following, I find it a lot like The Walking Dead tbh. But night time, awwww mate, real intense even with the good weapons. Best to find a safehouse, coz night time is practially I Am Legend. Just a fantasic game. Co-op is great as well. Makes it a lot easier and real good fun. And to top it all off you can get old western style weapons. I just love having my revolvor. So if you can get it on sale definitely buy it, though its worth the full price.			"

												This is one of the best games I've played hands down.  I'm not generally into zombie games, but this one is fantastic!  Graphics are great, gameplay is awesome.  The parkour/free running is very well done, and meshes well with the 1st person view (I say this because I wasn't sure it would based off of my past experience with Assassin's Creed).  The story is also great, I remember my first time getting stuck out at night with the night-forms, I was terrified!  Great variety of weapons, though the vast majority of combat is melee, it's very well done.  I give this a solid 5/7! ;)			"

												Of all the hyped up games over the past 12 months, Dying Light is the only one that has delivered. With zombies and parkour being 2 of my favourite things this game is a dream come true and excedes any previous zombie game ive played.-Amazing graphic detail-Solid parkour mechanics, very smooth movement-Zombies that are actually threatening and often risky to take on in a fight-In depth skill trees/abilities.-Huge crafting system with heaps of weapons, mods and upgrades-Night time gameplay is a rush of excitement and horror. The only thing i can really pick at for now is a couple performance bumps every now and then. After a bit of tweaking its hardly noticeable and still runs smoothly.Awesome game. 13/12 "

												If I where a psychologist and I had clients with anger management issues I would definitely suggest playing Dying Light as there is no better feeling then kicking the krap out of zombies with your right foot. But since I'm not, I can only suggest you should play Dying Light as there is no better feeling then kicking the krap out of zombies with your right foot.It can be pretty challenging and it can be somewhat frustrating at times too but since my psychologist suggested to me I should play this as there is no better feeling then kicking the krap out of zombies with my right foot, I'll keep up with it. One of the best things I guess is that the game (somewhat) scales up with you, so not like Failout 4 where after few hours you, your skills and weapons are OP and there are barely any real challenges ahead, this game keeps pushing your limit(s). Which is really nice for a change. You get better (equipped) the game trows more difficulty at you.There actually is just one giant big problem with 'Dying Light' you cannot, not at all, nada, nuka, njet, not, niet, nicht, change or influence the narrative.  Would that have been the case I would have rated this a massive AAA++++++, now its only a massive AAA+++++.Oh, just one thing, you really, really should be aware off that once you start playing this, there is no better feeling then kicking the krap out of zombies with your right foot.

												Understand that I played the singleplayer senario only.The story is top notch and the graphics are also.The game runs flawlessly(didn't crash once)and flows very well throughout.The sounds are amazing and the AI is really challenging.I think this game will always be compared to the Dead island series and that being said it holds up really well.The weapons and crafting system are easy enough for ppl like me to learn and the resources are scattered all over the maps.The parkour element is a fresh take on the genre and is done to perfection(after you upgrade the skill a little).The zombies get tougher at an alarming rate when you start upgrading.The night senario's are genuinely scary if you stand around too long.They also make the game very attractive to masochists because you will die......a LOT!Above average splatter fest.9\10			"

												So I'm gonna try to do a non-biased review here.Stay away from the forums - cause they're full of pirates and people who throws a lot of money after their rigs - but don't know how they function.I have a very mid-range pc myself, and if you tweak the options in the game - you'll get rid of any performance issues there should be.Some people are experiencing voice and sound issues as well - don't know about that, ANYWAY.--------------------------------------------So in regards to this game, should you buy it, is it worth it? Hell yeah... There's absolutely No reason to not buy it, if you enjoy parkour, ragdolls, crafting and absolute zombie mayhem. This game features the best atmosphere I've felt in a long LONG time... night time is ♥♥♥♥ing terrifying and the story is so-so... In terms of how many hours of play - if you're a completionist, I can't put my finger on it... personally I've played some 6 - 8 hours already and I'm not even past the starting area by far... There's 4 maps and I'm still in the first one.Buy or pass? Definitely buy.			"

												This is going to be my full, honest opinion on this game.I love it. The gameplay, story, visuals and characters are, in my opinion, great. However, I was disappointed when a lot of gameplay elements weren't added into the final game. In the E3 2014 gameplay, they show the player along a wall horizontally before smashing in a zombies head. There is no horizontal wall running in this game, I guess the devs decided to scrap that feature :(The only other disappointing thing for me is the lack of side quests. There are 44 side quests in total, however, they make up for their lack of quantity with their quality. The majority of the side quests actually have significant stories with new characters and interesting events, rather than just being ""Give Taheer 10 insulin""-style missions. I'm not that good at making in-depth reviews so this is pretty much the end, should you buy this game? Absolutely.Oh and sometimes it's hard as hell to find a game to invade in the ""Be The Zombie"" lobby, that's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥but yeah, great game.9.5/10			"

												Dying light is the combined love child of everything you wanted Dead Island to be and the Farcry series. It has free running and parkour similar to Mirror's Edge but with an actual game built around it. The combat and free running mechanics though are probably the most interesting part of the game, and have good progression along the skill tree, unlocking many new abilities, increasing your characters stamina and power.The story has you play Kyle Crane, a freelance agent working for the GRE sent into the quarantine zone to identify a target and retrieve some intel but things go wrong and you become infected. Inevitably things begin to spiral out of control from that point and even though you try to play the hero everyone around you dies. The story is somewhat cliche and bland to a point, but the atmosphere and some of the side missions and characters you meet will more than make up for it. Overall the game has around 40 hours of content including random encounters, side missions, the campaign and hidden zones and areas.Dying Light also plays host to many different types of enemies of which the truly tough and scary enemies only make an appearance at night and they will initially be far too much for you to handle but gradually as you level venturing out at night will become less of a harrowing experience.I definitely recommend checking this game out when you get the chance.

												From the start you will find the progression of the game absolutley mesmerizing.  The amount of survival and how the beginning of the story progresses, will keep you begging for more.  The problem arrises with the game when the player becomes just too overpowered.  When you stop fearing anything and start acting like spiderman with a grap hook, the appeal wanes heavily.  The continuity of the game suffers a lot near the end.  The multiplayer aspect is very tight but has a few loose screws when it comes to Be The Zombie.  Overall I give this game a thumbs up but with some caution as playability and lack of good DLC content hold this game back a lot.			"

												I've been playing survival horror since before Resident Evil and have played everything from that to Killing Floor, to Left 4 Dead, to Outlast, and more.  That said, there's rarely a game that is unique and fresh enough to really catch my interest for more than a few hours at a time.  This game fortunately is one of them!I am about 78% through my first play through and this game is amazing.  It comes as no surprise that there's some heavy Dead Island influence here which is easily explained away by reading that some of the devs from it helped produce this title.  In a nutshell it's Dead Island mixed with Mirror's Edge.  Parkour fighting in a fairly large open world.  I say that because it's not extensive like games like Stalker or other free roaming games, but the indivudual worlds and sub maps inside the city of Harran are big enough that the game doesn't get stale.  And yet the map is small enough that treking through it isn't tedious without some sort of fast travel system (which is not present in this game).  Edit there is one fast travel station but it only takes you back and forth from the first main map to the second.  You basically progress through the missions and side missions which are tied to an excellent story and decent character acting.As you go along the way you can find or buy weapons which have a limited life but can be repaired a few times.  You can craft new weapons and upgrade existing weapons making them stronger, more durable, and easier to handle/swing as well as applying elemental effects that do even more bonus damage.  The weapon upgrade system seems like it progresses in good timing with the story as your progress.  You also gain the ability to use the items you find and upgrade and craft even newer more powerful and useful items.  This game relies heavily on scavenging as building upgrades for your weapons as well as crafting items are needed to perform the said crafting.   You use ""survivor sense"" to detect when you're near items you can acquire.  And the sense is color coded to the items as well.  So it's important especially in the beginning to search everything your survivor sense finds.  Oh and just like in Borderlands weapons are also color coded by damage/level and once again, Gold seems to be the top level weapon with White/Gray at the bottom with Green, Blue, and Violet levels in ascending order.  Naturally as you progress you'll find weapons in a higher color class do less damage so those of you who enjoyed the 2K weapon system in Borderlands will feel right at home.You have 3 main skill trees each with their own experience points which is a nice change from one XP tree.  These will be your tools for survival and make you better at staying alive and more effective at killing zombies.SURVIVOR - A skill tree that you use to unlock abilities to craft new items, get an edge on traders for better deals, improve your abilities of searching and detecting items, as well as tricks for staying alive like camouflaging in zombie guts to avoid detection.  The final ability in the tree allows you to use all you've learner more effectively at level 25.AGILITY - A skill tree based on speed and well... agility.  Unlocking items in this skill tree will give you new abilities and techniques to run, jump, scale building, and improve your hand to hand fighting technique against zombies, as well as give you escape tactics when cornered.  This is all the Parkour aspect of the game where you basically learn to leap and bound from building to building effortlessly stepping on the heads of zombies, and grappling them and throwing them aside.  The final ability in the tree for level 24 is that you won't get tired from running or jumping.POWER - This is the tree I focused on first.  while still gaining points on the other skill trees.  Unlocking items in this skill tree gives you the ability to kill more effectively and efficiently by giving you stronger attacks and unlocking new attack and kill methods.  One of the most critical skills here is the ability to kill a zombie when it's down.  In the beginning this was a life saver so I didn't ruin all my weapons.  After a while though you do get strong enough that you'll be able to take down clusters of zombies with a strong weapon.  The final ability in the power tree gives you the ability to swing your weapon and fight without getting tired.  This was the biggest deal for me so I can swing my weapon over and over when surrounded.I've put almost 60 hours into this game and it's a tremendously good amount of fun.  And even moreso if you do a couple missions or play the whole game in Co-Op mode with 2-3 freinds.  If the game seems a bit easy once you get leveled up there's a hard mode.  The DLC challenges are fun for a pass or two but not necessary to enjoy the game.  I loved the go anywhere and climb anything aspect of the game but have to say although the power challenges weren't too bad, I didn't enjoy the Parkour challenges as much as I do love freerunning in other games (because in real life I would just end up hurting myself LOL).I believe this game is one of those titles that earns the full pricetag, but if you can get a deal all the more reason to pick it up and enjoy!

												Can be an enjoyable game, but not worth 60$ with all these problems.Parkour control is inconsistent to the point of insanity:-You can grab one ledge but not another identical ledge in a different location.-You can catch yourself from a 3 story fall on a ledge with your arms, but you can't walk up a tiny slope on certain natural terrain, rooftops, or tents.-No way to hang down from a ledge, which would be extremely useful for getting into many entrances, windows, and porches that have overhangs.-Climbing down has unacceptably horrendous control. You must hit back ('S' by default) to initiate dropping down to a ledge below you - BUT you have a tiny window of opportunity to hit forward ('W' by default) to grab the hand-hold you are trying to drop down to. If you hold the forward key just a little too long, you'll grab the ledge then immediately climb back up. If you hit it too late, you'll fall to your death. It's hard to explain how profoundly stupid the controls are for climbing down - and you will need to climb down from deadly heights many times throughout the game. Get ready to plummet to your death thanks to♥♥♥♥♥♥poor controls.-Parkour interactions with the environment in general are extremely hit or miss. Vaulting over low objects frequently plays the vault animation, but you don't actually vault over the obstacle. Sometimes you grab onto things, sometimes you don't. Just about the only thing that is consistent is leaping up to grab the top of level high walls.-Despite being an inconsistent, frustrating cluster♥♥♥♥, parkour is required throughout the entire game.Invisible walls with areas beyond that look like you should be able to reach them.Interactable locked doors everywhere! Who doesn't enjoy a good un-cancel-able animation where you character pushes futilely against a stuck door! They even have an indicator on them when you scan the environment with 'survivor sense' for interactable objects.Tons of film grain, visual blur, stuff that gets on your face and obscures your view with no way to shake or wipe it off - I mean these things hurt my eyes, AND THERE IS NO WAY TO TURN THEM OFF. Why developers? WHY! Why would you do this!?THE FINAL BOSS IS A QUICKTIME EVENT.""You are arbitrarily too exhausted to use that Grappling Hook skill you invested so much time in getting"" claims the screen as you sprint through a stage leaping, vauling, and leaping up hand-holds. Developers - that's laziest, most arbitrary, stupid thing I've seen in a while. I spent a long time to unlock that awesome skill and you just arbitrarily lock it in a situation where it would have been extremely useful to get around a tedious situation.Hit a zombie 20 times, your sword is broken. Oops, you can only repair this sword 2 times - hope you find something else you like to replace this one you lovingly crafted with the modifier you gathered materials for. I'm not even joking here. I get that the developers wanted you to keep on scavenging and I don't have a problem with that - but this is the most arbitrary, stupid way anyone could have come up with to create survival gameplay.All vendors sell everything for stratospheric prices, but stuff you sell nets a tiny pittance of is actual value. Like, selling something worth 20k might get you 2k - IF YOU HAVE THE PERK THAT IMPROVES YOUR SELL VALUE. Rediculous. Combine this with the fact that weapons wear out at a completely unreasonable rate and you are constantly playing inventory Jenga.You can carry infinity + 2 wires, alchohol bottles, tin cans, nails, weapon mods, plants... but you can carry 4 ANYTHING ELSE at the start of the game. Even with all the capacity perks unlocked, it's not nearly enough space for weapons and equipment. Pretty typical for the extreme inconsistency on display here.No map markers for the posters used to fast travel between the two maps. If you didn't play Dead Island, read a wiki, or just plain got lucky enough to notice this feature, you'd have no idea it even existed.Exact same enemies as Dead Island.There's a particular zipline over by the bridge that the devs put too low near some rocks, so you will be knocked off and probably fall to your death if you try to use that zipline.All the human enemies have superhuman reflexes and will deflect 99% of any weapons thrown at them with their tiny pocket knife or whatever they happen to be wielding. I really am not kidding or being dramatic here. Don't even try to use throwing weapons against human enemies, it really is pointless! Note that you have to CRAFT these throwing weapons, and there is no way to recover them once you throw them. What the hell devs?Human enemies are immune to damage while playing their 'duck to the side' animation. It doesn't matter if you are pounding your sledgehammer visibly into their nutsack - nothing happens because they are 'dodging'.Human enemies are inexplicably TOUGHER THAN ZOMBIES. LIVING HUMAN ENEMIES CAN TAKE MORE AXES TO THE FACE THAN A ZOMBIE.Human enemies are inexplicably immune to stun, and the descriptions on skills that are supposed to stun things don't make any mention of this at all.Decide you don't actually want to throw that item? Too bad, there's no way to cancel once you've wound up for the throw.Grappling sounds like a really cool perk, but activating it without taking damage is extremely inconsistent - like pretty much every other mechanic in this game. Sometimes you'll take damage, sometimes you won't, sometimes they'll just grab you anyways. Oh and by the way, you can't just grapple an enemy whenever you want, they have to be charging at you, attacking you (you may or may not take damage trying to grapple mid-attack - who knows!), or whenever the hell else the game randomly decides its going to allow you to grapple something. You have extremely poor control over where you fling zombies with a grapple, so it is often difficult to hurl them into environmental hazards like spikes - which is the only point of Grappling in the first place.All guns have this bizarre 1-2 second pause before you can fire again anytime you get hit or after you reload. Hey guess what? There are extremely time-limited events where you have to use a gun - and all those un-cancelable 'pauses' add up fast.For a main character that can manage such superhuman feats as scaling the side of a 10 story building by grabbing windowsills and literally throwing himself up to the next hand-hold or hanging for eternity from a ledge without ever tiring out - your character inexplicably gets out of breath by swinging a lead pipe a few times. You run out of combat stamina rediculously fast in this game. Two-handed weapons are practically unusable for this reason until you get very, very far into the combat skill tree.Lots of unskippable cutscenes, dialog, segments where your character is having seizures and moves at a snail's pace (think gears of war radio conversations).Immediately after vaulting off an enemy, your view is locked to horizon-level, so you can't look down to see where you are going to land. This is extremely annoying, as one of the more useful features of vaulting is that you can land on enemies to knock them down, and the 2-handed weapon mid-air smash requires a certain amount of fall time so you need to not be over an enemy as you're trying to activate them or you won't fall far enough to activate the skill.There are multiple areas that infinitely spawn zombies all around you out of thin air, right in front of your eyes. You literally see them pop into existence.The visual effect of 'Survivor Sense' is pretty annoying + there's no way to turn it off + you will be using it A LOT.Lots of cutscenes where the big villain is right in front of you, you have a weapon (possibly a gun) right in your hands...and you are forced to stand there like a stump in a cutscene while he monologues at you.Lots more, but I'm out of characters.

												PARKOUR ! Dying Light in The Office (2005) well minus the zombies :DOn a serious note: what happens when you give H1Z1 a story and add elements of Mirror's Edge ?Dying light.I havent found a game in a long time that allowed me to get a full immersion in it. Everything is done just right, from the open world , to the great sound effects, and the story is rich and fill with twists and turns to always keep you on the edge!There is PLENTY to do in this game ( even after you finish it ), go back do sidequests, challenges, shoot (get it?) a movie, or just explore!I'll repeat myself the immersion you get while playing this game is just breathtaking , sometimes hours pass by and I didnt even notice, and I love it !I can't reccomend this game enough! 10/10There is a demo so if you're into above said games, give it a try!

												BEST ZOMBIE GAME I have played.. I was not so sure at first as it starts a little slow but the game got better and better as I progressed through the storyline.The leveling system is descent and allows for customization which is nice. Clothing options are fun and weapon mods are great additions to the game..I really enjoyed dead isalnd as a Zombie game before this and played L4D but never had this much fun especially in multiplayer which this game has done very well on.Single Player is fun especially if you like following storylines but multiplayer is AWESOME as you can just mess around and have plenty of fun too.I got my copy of this for a really good deal and helped my brothers both get the game too but probably would not have paid the retail price for it. I do think many people would find it worth the $60 and if you can get it any cheaper like $40-50 it is definetly worth the money if you even slightly enjoy zombie games.			"

												You never forget the first night. Me and my friend was playing this game at 2am during a school night (♥♥♥♥ing yolo mate), and we were having fun screwing these slow♥♥♥♥♥zombies... the sun started setting and the npcs warned us to get back (now we hadnt seen videos or anything about this game so we were completly blind) but what was the worse that could happen? The zombies got stronger and scarier... and those volatile, they can parkour and runt twice as fast as a player... we were ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ our pants and running for the nearest safe zone barely avoiding the volatile zombies. I can remember us first running into that safe zone and looking back seeing the volatile zombie a millimeter behind be almost grabbing me just as i entered the safe zone... You never forget the first night.			"

												Dying Light is in many aspects similar to the Dead_Island-Series. But it adds a few very interesting aspekts (Just thinking about the free-running-aspekt or the Differences between Day and Night). In addition to that it offers a fresh, new lokation which offers you many different ways to kill zombies. Also the grafics have been removed and the Dev-Team worked on the Fighting-tecnincs. For my taste the weapons still get too fast damage and get destroyed. Dying Light is a really fast and fresh Zombie-Shooter which includes a few really interesting aspekts.8,5/10			"

 Its like Mirrors edge and Dead island combined. I had a blast playing this Title: Dying lightGenre: Zombies, survival, FPSDeveloper: TechlandPublisher: WB gamesFirst things first. this game is made by the same developers what made the dead island games.Those games compared to this game. This is basically a improved dead island but with a better and improved combat system and mirrors edge free running.Dont get me wrong, its not a bad thing because the combat in dead island was clunky. Its still a little clunky but way better now. Story You play as Kyle Crane. A GRA operative who is being dropped in the quarentine zone to get certain files back from a badguy. Later you find out its Rais. Just as I expected the game has its zombie cliches like everybody you start caring about around you sacrificing themselves to save you or so that you can get away. Which I personally hated. As for Rais. He is basically a wannabe Vaas character but way more depressing and kinda boring to be honest. but if you look around those cliches the story is still quite enjoyable as it takes you from the sewers to the highest towers and you can roam around in the open world city of harran filled with zombies. Also the voiceacting is well done. the only thing that I asked myself is why everybody you meet in the game has some kind of accent which annoyed me a little bit. Gameplay The gamplay has basically 2 mechanics. Combat and freerunning. these feel both smooth and I enjoyed just loading up the game to slash and crash trough the zombie hordes. As for the freerunning its pretty well made, smooth, fast, dynamic and fun :)as we are talking about dynamic anyway, there is a day and night cycle present in the game. At day the zombies are slower and not much of a treath except when they are in large groups. But at night it all changes. Now you are the hunted instead of the hunter. which is scary but also pretty exciting as you ran across rooftops to escape the volatiles (stronger ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ zombies who are fast as hell). This makes you think twice about fighting them because they are pretty strong.overall you have a lot of different weapons you can find by looting or killing enemies. The weapons range from Basic baseball bats to Rifles and shotguns. The shooting mechanic is decent enough. The game stands out with its melee combat though. Co-op and multiplayer: You should already know this but there is a multiplayermode where one of the players can invade another players game at night to stalk him and kill him. This is called  be the zombie. Its a fun mode but it gets boring fast if you dont play with your friends.The more fun part is the co-op greatly integrated in the singleplayer mode. Your friends can just jump in and out of the game, you can play the entire campaign together or just have fun doing running and fighting challanges together.There are up to 4 slots for the co-op gameplay. Conclusion & final verdict I really enjoyed this game and am excited for the content they are going to give us in the future. Although the story isnt the best part the gameplay makes up for it. And its fun as hell to play with friends. I really recommend this if you like a good zombie survival game. ( or if you actually liked dead island).  Its like Dead island without the bugs and with better gameplay overall! The story isn't anything special and the voiceacting is decent. Even with a flat and generic protagonist the game is still quite enjoyable once you get to the parkour and zombie action. My final verdict for Dying light is a 8.7/10. A great experience for every zombie fan out there Want more recommendations? Come see our reviews on our favorite upcoming games! Follow UltraShock Gaming's group curators here! PS: there are some bugs in the game but nothing major or gamebreaking. most being connectivity problems with co-op.  "

												This is one of the decent zombie games out there.You take part as of a soldier from the secret force to get intel about the disease.All quickly will you find out you mision is more complicated than that.I don't like to give spoilers away so i keep it at that for the story line.All do i gotta say it has a good story in it, but gets repetive on some points quickly.The game itself works whit a lvling system, higher lvl means more damage whit better higher tier weapons.While this does work out verry good at the pve part, in PvP it gets f*ckt up.You are forced to use the best weapon whit the best enchants etc etc to in fact 1 shot kill the demon in pvp mode.Although do they fix things like this, it is all because they went whit the lvling systeem!It is not needed, and not even missed when they would take it out.Also are there sleeping bags in the game that make you be able to skip 12 hours.While this is a good thing, a sleeping bag beside a shop means u can keep buying everything you need.Few sleeping bags used and you are stocked up whit first aid and prob found the best weapon to.Whereby scavanging for supplys weapons and such isn't needed any longer.The game itself is a uncut gem.The mele weapons work perfect and the way they limit guns is to mine opinion amazing.In a real apocalypse you will safe those bullets to for when they really matter.As said the story is ""decent"", a 7.5 out of 10 to mine opinion.Would have been a lot higher if it was not that repetitive...The graphics look awesome, and the map makes you really feel you are in a apocalypse.Short: The game is absolute worth checking out...If you are into zombie nuking 24/7 this is the game for you.Just keep in mind, repetitive is the core of the game...

												Amazing game. Feels like I'm in the middle of a Walking Dead movie. Like I'm running in the landscape real time. It's incredible, parkour fun. I've never played anything like it. The realism, the fear. Rushing through to get to the end is not suggested. Take your time, take it slow.  Enjoy the scenery, loot, craft, set traps, search for collectables. Show off your moves. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.			"

												I didn't go into this one expecting much, regardless of my time put into Dead Island, I could never bring myself to finish it, it just felt.. well, wrong. Dying Light soon changed that expectation as I was jumping from rooftop to rooftop, electric shiv in hand, being chased by a group of particularly nasty Virals.Gameplay wise, the addition of Parkour to what is fast becoming a stale theme adds a whole new dynamic, and against some of the nasties you come up against you're going to need it. It's entirely possible to stealth past hordes of the undead, only picking off the odd one or two who are blocking your goal, or even luring them away using the ingame crafting system. The skill system adds a good amount of character progression and customization, offering three different trees which all level up individually.The melee combat has a nice flow to it, transitioning from swipes and swings to crushing downwards blows, and each weapon has it's own handling style. Whether a sturdy length of pipe or a chunk of concrete and rebar pried from one of Harran's larger undead beasties, the results are satisfying, with all the right gruesome in all the right places.Graphically, everything set to high is netting me a Frame Rate of around 55 FPS, which, reading some of the other views is not as common as everyone would like, hopefully this will be rectified in a future patch. I generally expect a lower quality in open world games due to the amount going on at once, but I was truely surprised by what I was met with. Highly detailed environments and some great character design, though finding 5/7 zombies in a small pack all wearing the same shirt is a little strange, we'll just pin it down to a local football match and carry on shall we?If I had any major gripes so far, they'd probably be focused around the co-op aspects. It's mentioned there are 7 runners left, so why do we all play as the main character from the Single Player campaign?I've had some noticable issues around the cutscenes while playing with friends too, occasionally one of them will jump a few lines ahead of the dialogue from the NPC, causing the cutscene to end early and leave others wondering what happened. Hopefully things like this could be straightened out in the future, they're certainly not game breaking, but can detract from the experience.Overall, I've been pleasantly surprised by Techland's latest entry to their zombie stab-em-up, and look forward to playing it more when I don't have to be in work in a few hours. With a few patches and a tidy up here and there, it looks like we could be off to an amazing start to 2015. "

												SPOILER FREE REVIEWAs a huge fan I am of zombie games and survival games, this one definetly takes my top 1. This one will give you the shivers Introduction to the gameDying Light is a survival/horror game based on Crane, the main character and a GRE operative whose mission is to retrieve a document containing valuable info about an epidemic disease which converts humans into something, that was supposed to be recovered by a agent known as Rais, leader of one of the two factions in the city.Pros and Cons+ I expected the game to be another Dead Island, turns out I was wrong. The combat system variety depends on skills that you gather by fighting through zombies, which is important depending on a players style when dealing with a enemy.+ Massive arsenal of weapons, from knifes to machetes, from machetes to axes, from axes to swords, from swords to King Arthur's meme sword.- During my runs through the Slums, I have encountered some texture bugs where I could see through the building. It wasn't much of a deal but still deserves to be pointed out.+ Developers have updated the game with free content during the year.- Some DLC's are either weird or to much of a challenge for the community.+ Expansion pack is coming out in case you think the game needs more.+ A pretty big map, fully lootable, including lockpicking, hidden caches, and puzzles.- Overpowered enemies at some stages.+ Easy crafting system, not much materials like in Dead Island. You get a blueprint and there's a chance you alredy have everything to craft it.+ Great fun in co-op after the ""Be the Zombie"" expansion.+Really good story- FPS drops at some points, but doesn't affect gameplay much.- Toxic communityOverall:Dying Light is a very good horror/survival game with a enormous size which promises a great succes for the developers to keep bringing new content to such a terrific game.Final rating:Despite the FPS drops and some other not quite game breaking points I would rate DL 9.25/10			"

												Reaching 100% in all game aspects this is my final review of Dying lightA TL:DR at the end of this reviewSetup NotesMy setup isnt high-end but i can still play this game without any problems if i set my graphics to the best performance mode and even on that the game looks really good and beautiful.My setup is:Intel Core i5 CPU 750 @ 2.67GHzXFX Radeon HD 5770 HDMI 1GB 4 Gb RAM The StoryThe story is interesting and the main characters are not easily forgotten which means the one who did the storywriting did a good job. With various problematic scenarios such as encounters with Rais as the antagonist. The more you get into the story the more you get to dwell deeper into the challenges he always throws at you (as the bad guy he is) but doing the side-missions you get more information about how Rais was before the epidemic which is some cases you feel a bit of sympathi about him but yet hate him for the psychopatic ♥♥♥♥er he is.The story is also interesting as they made it pretty good with showing several scenarios which would probably happen if this was for real too, there is much twists with people you will get attached too and which will meet horrible fate's where you are the witness for it. The protagonist (Kyle Crane) also responds almost in sync with how i would feel and respond especially how the mains story started and how it progresses when the truth is starting to surface. GameplayThe gameplay is really fun. its a nice balance between fighting and running as different scenarios requires different tactics. sometimes there is a fight you cant win(you could try go YOLO on some of them) so you need to run past them and there is time when you cant run from a fight and need to battle it out to get past them (Example: Inside of a barricaded house searching for supplies and some walkers is coming in from the only entry to the house). The quests are pretty decent, some character are easily forgotten (im talking about side quests) and some arent and a few of the sidequests you complete will reveal some additional story and it could be of anything like the outside world's current state and view of this epidemic, your enemies backstory which could question if they really are a bad guy (Rais will always be a psycho♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but the one's working for him) and even story of your own escape from that place.Although after i have played this game all through then i want to add that the feeling against zombies being scary and dangerous at first quickly disappears as for getting somewhere about lvl 5-10 in agility and power makes you a bit overpowered and at the end game you can almost one-shot everything that moves. Combat and levelsThe combat system is pretty balanced, adds to the difficulty with the stamina system that drains pretty fast. and also that your weapon have durability that also drains and in a tight situation where you're out of stamina and your weapon is broken (and you need to fix it) can be your first death.Combating other survivors(Rais men) are also a challenge. When you get to higher levels in power then you can kill almost without a problem but it's countered by more enemies will be present as more deadlier zombies will show up (Runners, Frogs, Hazmat's, Bombers, Demolishers etc.)The leveling system is quite fair too as you dont progress Too Fast  and you also level up in 3 areas and at a different speed depending of how you playAgility - You get experience by running and doing more parkour moves, Skillpoints in these area generally decreases the limit to your parkour and will make you run,climb and regain run-stamina faster as well as unlocks new active moves such as, vaulting over your enemies, sliding as well as adding combat mechanics for those moves (slide --> LegBreaker)Power - Fight zombies to become better,Tankier and stronger. Also unlocks new attack moves for you to use, also after some levels it will increase your damage and give you more stamina to work with in combat.Survivor - Typical all around skilltree where points improves generally your survival outside and gives you new possibilities to craft new items which will help you out. also gives you some skills like better prices at store's, craft boosters (which are op imo) etc etc. The night gameplayThe nights in dying light also changes the gameplay style you have to adapt for survival. ""nightmares"" comes out at the time and you must play with more caution else everything is coming at you. Hell several when i managed to avoid them and stumble across a normal zombie is just beg for my life and hope the ♥♥♥♥er doesnt make to much noise so the nightmares notice me.But after a while when you get used to the ""game rules"" of the night it doesnt get very scary, you just have to be more careful when running around as you unlock more safehouses which means you can easily escape the nightmares and get rid of the pursuit. You can still easily die due to minor mistakesand nightmares are still something you want to avoid but as you know how they act and how you should counter-act it then you can run around almost freely and only to notice that if you screw up once then that will be the end of you if not you figured out something real fast Zombie Mode Zombie mode is fun and entertaining, it's quite balanced as the zombie you play as is fragile as hell (1 or 2 hits and you're dead) and if you're caught from a UV flashlight of a human player then you are pretty much screwed if you dont manage to fall back (Some active abilities helps you with that).This means the player who plays the zombie must adapt to an assassin type of gameplay and try to isolate or catch a human player who has let his guard down. Some abilities such as the spit is just what it sounds like, you spit then it explodes after a short delay and the effects of being caught with the spit is like from  left 4 dead zombie The boomer and hoping the little chaos you create will open up an opportunity to catch one in the chaos.You have your own set of a skill tree as a zombie which gives you new active abilities as well as upgrades to them.To find a game as the zombie is quite hard as people have set up internet lobbies but leaves the session as soon as one joins, which i dont really get as if you dont want to get invaded you can still turn it off while still having a co-op game publicTL:DR+ playable with the lower requirments (still good graphics)+ Combat system is fair,fun and satisfying for each kill+ Parkour bruh+ Good balance with running and fighting for survival (depending on the situation)+ The night forces you to a different playstyle (if not you're going YOLO-Mode)+ Leveling system doesnt progress to fast but not too slow+ Good and interesting story as it progresses + Levels are well made and polished+ Side-Quests are interesting and some of them adds insights to the Storymode+ Finally Difficulty is here (Hard Mode)- Getting a game as the zombie is hard- After some hours in the game the night gameplay doesnt get very ""scary""- Survivor's Sense is a bit overpowered but yet extremly helpfull (not accounting Hard mode)- cant say there's much replayability (hopefully the season pass will add more good content)- Gets pretty easy after some levels in both agility and powerThis is the final version of the review and will not be further updated until more content has been implemented.

It was also creepy enough to get me freaked out in the night gameplay so co-op was really nice to have someone else to get scared with. I played through most of the game in co-op unfortunately did not finish the game completely from losing progress from a reinstall but 10/10 would play this game again.			"

												Dying Light is like having Dead Island as the main ingredient combine with Far Cry 3 and 2013 Tomb Raider as the supporting ingredients.. If you love those games then this one definitely worth to try.Old fashioned zombie killing, with modified melee weapons, fight against undead, next level undead, or fellow living human like in dead island? You got it.Jump around building, Lara Croft style, and find things around you with your survival instinct like in tomb raider (2013)? You got it too.Collecting ingredients for crafting, various side quests and challenges, unique killing moves like in Far Cry 3? It's right here.All that plus the two different types of time, day and night, will make your zombie slashing experience more challenging.			"

												Worst game ever, its destroyed my social life. LOLNo seriously, fantastic game. So glad to have a big named zombie game out there again. None of this early access stuff.A game which works, a game with evolution. A game which makes you say ""No im not going to socialise with you guys this weekend, id rather kill zombies.""Okay the story line isnt exactly the longest thing iv ever seen, but there are plenty of side quests. And the fact that the zombies get harder and faster is great. To be honest iv completed the story line, but still find enjoyment going back from the beginning and smashing zombies. I think it will be a long time before i get bored of this game! Great work!			"

												From the Developers of the ""Dead Island"" franchise, here comes Dying Light, one the best zombie games ever made!This game is amazing overall! The gameplay and mechanics work very well, the parkour aspect of it makes it really unique and it's the best parkour mechaninc made till now, the Multiplayer/Co-Op is pretty much amazing, the art and graphics are astonishing, the feeling of the world is one of a real breathing one. You can really have the feeling of the humanity slowly dying, amazing ambient and stuff, and it's really optimised aswell.Pretty much, a masterpiece, plus, the DLC's are really worth it, they bring new content to the table, even to an incredible extent such as a new whole map and capaign including buggies and stuff.Just like GTAV, this game has an amazing price/content rate!This is game is awesome!

												Just finished the game in 76 hours. with a friend. Full co-op run on nightmare. We both think main game was better, but The Following is solid too. It is rare to see a ""content patch"" that is not a DLC, but actually a full addon/expansion pack. Last time i was that pleased with an expansion it was Warcraft 3: TFT. The Following becomes pretty dull quick and it has a lot of more obvious flaws like enemy spawning system, volatiles being complete idiots in the field even on nightmare, but if they notice you its almost a certain death if you are not a swift hand. Many obviously repetitive quests without narration following.    Not sure if we were supposed to go into The Following with all main skills at max, but we were not and we ended up unlocking Legend skills mid game, only reached level 15.    We finished almost, if not all, side quests, but we had something like 10 hours of downtimes where we randomly screwed around gathering herbs or having fun with gameplay or waiting for each other.    Meanwhile main quests isn't that long or great if you not going to mix it with sidequests. I am fairly certain that you simply can not do it on nightmare because at some point your level will stop you from progressing. On easier difficulty tho you should be able to beat both main game and The Following in 10-15 hours if you are not going for detours whatsoever.    From deep bottom of my heart i thank all the developers for creating one of the better co-op expiriences out there. Last time we had such smooth co-op it was in Borderlands 2 and Dying Light is slightly behind it just because BL2 flows better in co-op without restricting players to just force-play single campaign together, where every npc only sees one Kyle Crane. Boderlands, on ther other hand has a lot of flaws as a game, but its another topic. I can only hope to see next game in this setting, i think it can be great to play as Kyle again with his new powers.    Sory for my broken english.			"

												Excellent game. It has replay value and will take some time to finish.The story and protagonist can be a little cheesy and predictable at times, but it's certainly not bad overall. The game is lots of fun and is visually pleasing. 8/10 and worth it. The developers put a lot of effort into this game. Below is a more detailed review of the pros and cons.Pros:- Zombies: Lots of zombies that get tougher as you get stronger. Until later levels, you will always be wary of the threat a horde of zombies can pose.- Story: there's a story here. Yay! It's not the deepest, but it will keep you motivated to keep going.- Characters: there are a variety of characters with their own quirks in the game.- Missions: lots of side missions encouraging you to explore the map of Harran. The map is vast and while it can take time to get from A to B, you will find it's actually fun to take a detour to get to the airdrop before the bad guys can.- Gameplay: parkour to the core. There is a grappling hook that can help you get around, but leaping from rooftop to rooftop, kicking zombies off high places (THIS IS HARRAN!!!!) and dodging attacks is quite satisfying. You always have to be aware of your surroundings so you can escape or use it to your advantage.- Level up!: You have three main skills: Agility, Strength and Survivor. There is a fourth one (Legend...wait for it...dary!) that unlocks when you max one of the others out. They help you slay zombies faster, dodge attacks, run longer, climb faster, regen health and generally be a better parkour badass. You can even be more stealthy by using zombie guts to camouflage yourself and take the zombies out one-by-one without alerting the horde.- Crafting: Yes, you get to make your own melee weapons and augment them with different elemental effects. Who knew a battery and some power cables could electrocute zombies to death...Cons:- Optimisation: The original game wasn't as bad, but after the Enhanced Edition update, my GTX970 and core i7 2600 seem to be taking strain. When there are lots of zombies on the screen, even with everything set to its lowest, I expect the FPS to drop below 60, and it does. The game performs poorly on linux, so I had to install it on windows to be able to play it.- Some glitches. The zombies sometimes stay stuck in a mannequin-like pose and don't attack for a bit. They're easy to kill, so I shouldn't complain, but stationary zombies are not undead. They're just dead.- Skills: even though you can max out the skills, you'll find your strength skill shooting up quickly while agility is lagging a bit. Expect to be able to carve through hordes while running short of breath when trying to beat Rais's men to the air drop. Secondly, not all skills are valuable and you have no choice but to invest in a skill under a specific tree when you level up. There is no levelling up a skill, such as camouflage, to level 5 so you have to invest the next point in something you may never use. This creates characters that are all the same when all levels are maxed out.- Being bitten: pretty early on in the game, you're bitten by a zombie which means you need Antizin to stop from turning. Problem is, your character never actually ""needs"" Antizin until crucial, scripted moments when he gets seizures. For some reason he never thinks to bring any antizin along while he is swinging around the city. You go from being Spiderman's zombie slaying clone, swinging from building to building, carving zombies in two to suddenly unable to effectively swing your weapon because ""plot"". It is frustrating investing in all those skills but never being able to use them when the story main storyline demands it.- The Following: Enhanced Edition is a little pricey.Cons aside, it's definitely a decent game. Grab it on sale, if possible.			"

												Cant believe i forgot to recommend this game till now. One of the best i've played in years IMO.10/10: Absolutely amazing game. its a co-op zombie survival, free roam in which you complete quests and explore / collect items & collectables, all whilst battling an undead horde for survival or simply for fun.the game is exactly the same as ""Dead Island"" without the numerous bugs and with a new 'Parkour' movement system that adds an excellent & fun way of avoiding and fleeing zombies.Pros: 4 player Coop, Great graphics, great gameplay, good levels of violence and gore, dynamic day and night cycle (time based) which at night makes zombies more aggressive and work in a horde mode instead of being independant. Active developers still producing new free content months after release.Cons: Shorter story line than Dead Island 1 (similar or maybe more than DI: Riptide though). fair percentage of people had hardware / FPS issues when game was first released but due to new patchs this should not be an issue anymore unless your hardware doesnt meet minimum/recommend specs in the first place. Versus mode (night hunter) is very average and becomes repedative fast, but this isn't a real issue as it can be turned off.			"

												Short status about Dyling Light. After 20 hours in the game I have to say I am very happy that I bought it, even for the full price.I feel like the money was very good invested. The game truly plays like a sort of new generation games. Great graphics, a lot to do with story and side quests, excellent controls and perfect upgrade system. This game is very bloody and might not be for everyone. Especially people from Germany might think it is too hard for them or at least their Governement thinks it - just kidding, guys ;).The game is totally motivating: I do not only want to finish the main quests but also explore all those side quests. My motivation feels similar like in Skyrim. I feel like I am going to have some more hours fun in the Single Player, after which I will try the MP and hope that it is at least similar exciting.As the tip on the iceberg the most amazing 3D vision community developped an excellent fix (DHR - many thanks, a lot of Kudos), so that you can now fully immersive in  Zombie cutting. If you like zombies, parcours games, FPS, nice graphics and a lot of core and thrilling moments, you will love this game.At the moment I do not see any negatif about this game. Even the jumping gets more precise and easier after a while.I rate this game after my 20 hours playtime with 8,5/10.			"

												Definitely one of the better zombie games out right now. However, the people who are praising this game saying how amazing it is obviously have a much longer honey-moon phase with games than I do. Either that or the ones who think it's so amazing are 10-15 years old. Let's be real -  This game is good, but it's defnitely not one of those games you start to play and it gives you chills because you have had not had such a great experience in such a long time or ever; to me that's what would justifying something ""amazing"" and if that is not what would justify amazing to you, maybe you have lower standards, but it's far from ""amazing"" no matter what your standards are, trust me. It's a GOOD game, nothing more, nothing less. Depending on how much you♥♥♥♥♥♥around or don't♥♥♥♥♥♥around and run through the game there is a good 20-40 hours worth of play time. Once you beat it, there isn't much to do besides try to max out the skill tree. You can finish the side quests, challeneges and that's about it. If you are thinking about buying it I would wait until it has more dlc or hits a sale.			"

												 Nothing more to add, the game is good. Solo, coop or PvP, the game is good for who play fair.The games narrative is merely a device to get you into the real gameplay, not much context, but enough to get you going This is where it shines, Dying Light provides immense opportunities to forge grand weapons and claim ultimate power over the zombies. The early game of running away with sparse combat later turns into a ""revenge"" upon them for all of those med kits the used up earlier. Additionally the parkour is fun, while also being a bit nauseating at first, becomes a pleasure later.			"

												Dying Light: The Following - Enhanced EditionThis game combine a few elements to make an unique and awesome result:FPS + Survival + Open world + Zombies + Parkour + a very well made storyTo survive, you'll have to explore the city (it's a big one) and find everything you can;) Zombies are everywhere ! You'll have to collect tools and weapons here and there, upgrading them to enhance damages.And the best way to avoid zombies' bites is.. To climb everywhere :D Running, jumping, climbing on houses and walls. This makes the game pretty amazing with a great sensation of freedom.You'll have to help other survivors in various quests and.. Your choice if you want to do play during day or night =)But once it's dark, the more dangerous it is; survive is not an option, you may find a safehouse to sleep and wait for the next morning if you're not a night bird.To conclude: one of the best zombie game (and playable in cooperation !)A must have !I recommand this game ;)			"

LOTS of them! + Be a zombie mod - invasions into other people worlds as zombie + Great dubbing! + Kinda good story + There are buggy's (car)! with upgrades! + Challenging night gameplay (also rewarding) + The Following have WTF ending + More then one map + good co-op systemand what cons? you might ask. Well.... - few bugs that wont ruin your gameplay but makes you mad sometimes - swimming speed ;) - sometimes its overwhelming (too many enemies at once can make you crazy) - nothing else if i can remember now.I can only recommend it !For achievement hunters : This game requires lots of hours to get 100% ;)			"

												Dying light is a damn good game. There, I gave you my final verdict. It has a good plot, decent characters and an amazing environment. (Lots of play time too, so you get a good return on your investment)  However, the Following DLC is a bit... ''ehh''It sorta throws most of the gameplay out the window, and replaces it with new features (well made ones though). The DLC's story is all right but isn't nearly as capturing as the main one, partially because of how slow the story in The Following is. While the main storyline is a joy to play through, the second feels like a chore at times.Overall: 8.5/10 for Dying Light7/10 for the Following			"

												An absolute blast of fun on Linux! Dying Light really brings out the fear factor of the zombies, unlike the previous Dead Island games. Not only at night, but in the day. You start going rambo into a crowd of zombies? You're going to notice your character being unable to tackle all of them soon enough. The fear of dying becomes very real very quickly.Night has to be the worst though. If I'm not in co-op, I don't dare leave the safe zone for fear of being chased to my inevitable death.The gameplay is one of the best zombie games I've played in a long time. Performance is quite low at release, and safe zones can't be unlocked for the most part, but everything else has been awesome. I look forward to Techland's dedicated focus to patching this game into perfection. Thank you for bringing it to Linux!			"

												If you're buying a game for the story don't expect anything here, as it's nothing new in gaming before. Basically it's like this: World falls apart, crazy bad guys tries to convince everyone chaos is the way the world should work, there's the beta female character, bad guy captures you, leaves you instead of killing you, yells your name at the top of his lungs as you escape and kill his guys, and the ending is nothing but an action pressing sequence. Now if you're buying the game for the fun gameplay, this game doesn't hold back at all. Hard mode is recommended (or Nightmare if you're that insane) since normal feels to easy in this game. You'll find yourself struggling to kill any zombies at all with the poor weapons you have at the start of the game and will have to repair them over and over, but eventually that fades out and you realize that's how the game SHOULD work with such weapons until you get crazy, lighting rod swords and the such that mow through zombies a ton easier (but your weapons will still break a lot, as they should and all you'll have to do is repair them or make another one) until, of course, you fight the much harder, more difficult zombies. There's the giant ones that might as well be walking tanks, the runners that can swarm you if you're not careful, etc. and my favorite - the scary ♥♥♥♥ing ones at night time. The nighttime mode is what truly makes this a new zombie experience (as well as the parkour but we'll save that for later) giving you a sense of hopelessness the first many hours of the game. At night many of the zombies will transform into these terrifying, powerful, faster creatures that will hunt you down no matter what if they find you, forcing you to sneak around the best you can until you get to a safe zone to escape the horror. I wasn't expecting this game to scare me so much since dead island was no where near like that for me. So if they find you, or you get into a mess with tons of zombies surrounding you on the streets, what do you do? Parkour. Running is your best thing to do in this game in nearly all of these situations, and being able to jump onto the building and run along the roof tops will save you from the slow, day time ones besides a few runners. At night however, it'll be more than just climb a building and run a tad bit. The evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at night will chase you everywhere until you get away, so using the environment to get around is all you can do until you escape into one of the said safe zones and you'll have to be quick minded as well to make the perfect movements during these runs. One wrong move and you're dead. One thing I have to say though - I haven't touched the DLC at all yet, so the story might have a huge improvement in The Following DLC, I don't know. I also don't know if the gameplay is still as good, or even better, or sadly worse. I'll update this when I've played the DLC.			"

												The first thing I did before even starting to write this review was to give the ""thumbs up"".Before I started this amazing adventure, I had little to no experience with ""zombie"" games, and to be quite frankly, I am now a zombie killing machine. I am a zombie grinder, I am the zombie terminator. I am Legend.All of that said, and despite all the QQ around the AMD systems (which is my case), I've had absolutely no problem whatsoever with FPS, quite the opposite. The graphics are close to the best I've seen.The soundtrack will keep you wondering if death is upon you, or just around the corner.The gameplay is incredibly good, as you can ""visit"" most of the buildings, and you can parkour your way around Harran.Obviously, not everything is perfect, and to me, the biggest disappointment is the story itself. It's amazing until near the end, where it just feels it's being wrapped up quickly, leaving some loose ends, and wondering you what the heck just happened.Unless their plan is to continue the story with Dying Light 2 or some DLC, the ending is quite meh, whereas the rest of the story is quite good, making you shed a tear once or twice. Them feelings...The crafting part of the game is quite regular, and you've plenty of options to make your killing weapon of choice even more deadly, and prettier. From bats, to axes, to hammers, you can use anything to kill a zombie. The combat system is nice, and the guns feel a bit awkward, which just leaves you more excited to melee everything down, and feel the blood and guts hitting you as you hack and slash your way to the top. Top of something, that is.If you are looking for a ""survival"" game, there's not much survival to do here, as you can pretty much skip sleeping the entire game, eating only helps regening some health, and there's no drinking or anything similar. It's, however, a scavenger heaven, since you can find loot pretty much anywhere. loot cave ftwI'd easily recommend this game to anyone, as it's quickly climbing to the top of my all time favourite games.Graphics: 9/10Gameplay: 9/10Soundtrack: 9.5/10AI: 8/10Story: 8/10Overall: 9/10			"

												I was extremely excited when I saw the previews coming out for Dying Light and having just beaten the main storyline I felt the need to share that the game lived up to even more than I had expected.  The story overall was enjoyable and far more in-depth than your standard zombie game.  It had its twists and turns and, as a huge zombie fan, I can say that it definitely brought some new elements to the genre.The combination of the open world and the parkour results in a very fun traveling experience especially after you've leveled up your Agility path and gained some special techniques to go along with it (like leap frogging over zombies, using a long-range grappling gun, and being able to run up a flat surface for a short distance).  I don't recall having played a game where I enjoyed traveling from Point A to Point B so much.In addition to the Agility path, you are able to level up your Survivor and Power paths.  Survivor gives you the ability to make chemical boosts and grenades, cover yourself in zombie guts to sneak by other zombies, and craft shields out of materials that you've scavenged along the way, among plenty of other unique passive and active skills.  Power is the fighting-based path which gives you additional abilities to use with your weapons. as well as enhacing their effects overall.As for the most memorable aspects of the gameplay, the day and night cycle plays a massive role in Dying Light.  I found myself literally afraid to be out at night as the areas outside of safe zones were FAR more dangerous than they had been during the day.  Also of note is the crafting system which is basically an improved version of what was found in Dead Island - scavenge materials and craft grenades, medicine, tools, etc. and use those same materials to MacGyver your own unique weapons, like a baseball bat with nails (simple) to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sword that carries a strong electrical current and light enemies on fire (insane).This is the Skyrim for zombie fans.  I highly recommend this to fans of zombies, RPGs, open worlds packed full of side quests, and parkour!			"

But those mistakes will make you alerted and prevent you from failing again.I'm looking forward to the forthcoming updates and DLC's.My favourite game of 2015.			"

												I've anticipated this game for a long time but elected not to purchase it on release due to a lot of triple A games not being so good lately. (*cough* AC: Unity, Evolve and Lords of the Fallen *cough*) Of course, the moment I decide to do that the game I wait for turns out to be good. There will be no spoilers in this review but I may accidentally mention something that would give away late game content so if you are wanting your experience completely unspoiled, take my word for it that the game is good and leave this review now. Otherwise, hello.Okay so let me start off by saying; this game is effing excellent. I must admit, from the gameplay I'd seen and the reviews I'd read, I was expecting a semi-decent FPS survival that would take maybe 10 hours to complete with some repetitive hack and slash combat that had been over-hyped and blown out of proportion like most other triple-A games these days. I admit it, I was dead wrong. Let me get the only two negative things I can say about this game out of the way. The multiplayer is pretty unbalanced, (although having someone join your game is a blast,) and the performance is sometimes lacking (fixed with Dying Light Manager 0.10a, google it for more info. It may have been updated to a newer version by now.)The graphics in this game are so, so beautiful. During the day the shadows are gorgeous and at night the game has such intense and terrifying shadows that even though it is really difficult playing at night time, I still end up doing it just to enjoy the game's wonderful aesthetics.I'm not huge on ""horror"" games, but this is the perfect mix of terror and action for me to enjoy without freaking out and quitting. (I'm looking at you Dead Space.) I hate slow paced horror games but since this game is always moving forwards, I could actually enjoy the scary areas a bit more than I can in other games.The movement system in this game is fantastic, every time you jump onto a ledge or platform you immediately have 3 other options to jump to, which in turn have 3 more and so on. Freedom is the word when it comes to parkour in Dying Light and there is nothing more satisfying than jumping 150 meters down into a pile of garbage only to take no damage.Dying Light was built on Chrome Engine 6. I have to say, I love this engine. Zombies have amazing ragdoll physics and being able to cut a zombies head, leg and arm off on one swing, then kick each individual part around just adds to the immersion. To this moment, if I see a zombie at a ledge of a building I will run up to it and kick it off just to watch it fall to the ground; no exceptions. It is glorious.10 hours into the game and I still hadn't even found a gun yet I was enjoying the game immensely, guns are just a bonus late game. The progression in this game is absolutely perfect, you start off using sticks and wrenches to attack things and you mainly avoid zombies, but by the end of the game you are an absolute zombie murdering monster complete with a grapple, guns, super powerful melee weapons that slice zombies into two pieces with a single swing and the ability to go all the way across the city without stopping or touching the ground. (Still scary going out at night time although the monsters are a bit more manageable.)The skill trees in this game are really well thought out with almost every skillpoint you get changing the way you play the game. No more of that, ""5% damage increase while wielding 2h weapons"" etc. You always get something meaningful, like a new ability, increased jump distance or a new finisher. I also like that there are 3 skill trees rather than just 1 and they are all leveled separately. So you have to go and do parkour to level up your agility tree and you have to engage in combat to level up your power tree. The trees are pretty damn big too. At 22 hours into the game and I was only 14-18/25 and it gets slower as you level, but like I said, almost every single level up adds something useful to your arsenal. Not to mention that the final perks on each tree are extremely useful so that adds incentive to level all your skill trees.The story itself in the game was pretty good, but the real depth I got out of the game was the side missions. That being said, the actual campaign goes for around 17 hours so there's that. There are so many side missions all with interesting rewards and interesting storylines. You can also find survivors around the world and just sit and listen to them talk, they give insight into how the outbreak happened and a lot of them have clever things to say that will get you thinking. Clearly someone put a lot of effort into the dialogue for this game.Overall I'd give this game an 9/10 and if the performance was a bit more optimised I'd be giving it easily a 9.5/10. I highly recommend you get this game if you are at all interested in survival FPS games. It's worth it.TL;DR: This game is fun and has zombie babies in it.			"

												I see a lot of the reviews for ""Dying Light"" on Steam praising the multitudes of monsters, or the fluidity and realism of the parkour or even the graphics but honestly? These aren't all that great. They're good, don't get me wrong. Just not great,For the monsters there's maybe about nine different things to kill. There's your run-of-the-mill zombies, slightly faster run-of-the-mill zombies, exploding things that can kill you in one hit, spitting things (because we can't have a zombie game without something spitting some noxious green goop at us), big guys with concrete clubs, bigger guys that like to throw rocks at you, screaming children (zombified of course) and faster, stronger run-of-the-mill zombies that only appear during the night time. On top of that there's also desperate survivors that you're supposed to feel bad about carving up (but I didn't) and about an entire national army's worth of armed thugs for you to kill. Maybe with my lack of remorse when carving up other humans I'm supposed to feel like I'm the monster? I dunno.The parkour is what most people were looking forward to this game for and honestly? It's good. You're able to make your way across the city any way you want to. On foot of course as Crane seems to be the only person in the city that doesn't hold a valid driver's licence. I did have a few minor problems where I couldn't grab a ledge similar to others I had grabbed hundreds of times because I was looking a millimetre more downwards than what was considered by the game to be acceptable. Then the game suffers from a virus (Haha, get it?) that I like to call Assassin's Creed Virus (I'm not great with names) where I can leap off as tall a building as I like so long as I land in something considered to be soft. In♥♥♥♥♥Creed this would be the wagons of hay, in this it would be a pile of trash bags that could be full of dirty, hepatitis-infested needles for all I know. These things are rather minor I admit, but it does break the flow of the game a bit I feel.Graphically the game is sound... At bits. I've seen a few things in game that would have been embarresed to be seen in even a PlayStation 2 game (Take a look at the crate of... onions? I guess? When you're in The Tower.) It seems designed for consoles too I feel. The menus have a nasty habit of returning to the very top after you press enter or click on something which caused me to craft the wrong thing a few times and it also seems to be poorly optimised for PC. I bought my computer back in September 2014 and it was top of the line at the time and I had to lower the graphics and view distance just to play the game.Night Time was hyped up to be some sort of terrifying ordeal that you'd be extremely lucky to be able to survive if you decided to ignore the screaming voices of protest in your head and venture outside in the dark but from the moment you get the grappling hook night time just isn't scary. It's like when you were afraid of the monsters under your bed as a child but when you finally get brave enough to look you find that it's just an old T-shirt, a dinosaur toy and your mum's old vibrator that had been left on the ""on"" position. Okay, that metaphor wasn't clear. Night starts off as being genuinely scary, not as terrifying as other reviews say or as terrifying as it was hyped up to be, but that was only because these scary old T-shirt, dinosaur, mum's old vibrator monsters seemed to have no weakness. By about mid-game night is no scarier than day time. You can have strong weapons to fight if you need to and the grappling hook lets you escape from most chases with ease.That's another part where the game breaks down a bit. When you unlock the grappling hook. Most of the enjoyment in the game is deciding which route you should take to get from point A, through point B, up point C and to point D. But with the grappling hook you pretty much just zip from A to B with no real thought or sense of danger and as said before it lets you break pursuit with ease. The grappling hook also takes away from the satisfaction of solving a climbing puzzle by yourself because you can just skip most of them. (Puzzle is used very loosely there!)Combat seems to be another huge sticking point in other reviews. People keep mentioning how most fights are better avoided or how it's dangerous to fight your way through to a different area but to be honest it's really not. There's this massive bridge swarming with infected and I was able to clear the entire thing using a few molotoves, a handful of home-made exploding shuriken and a couple of machetes, and then there was enough loot left lying around afterwards for me to enjoy being king of the dirty survivors for a few weeks.My review does seem to be very negative, and that's because it is mostly. The developers really let themselves down in certain aspects but at the same time I can't help but enjoy myself while playing. Despite the flow sometimes being broken, the sense of real freedom you get while running from A to D is something that I've never experienced before in any other video game. The combat is fun at times and honestly pretty funny at others. The graphical issues were sorted by just changing my settings a bit and night time was genuinely scary. But only for the first few nights.""Dying Light"" is a fun enough game to play on your own but I feel that the game really comes into it's own when you play co-operatively with some friends. My friends and I were able to pull off some amazing team-work that just wouldn't be possible during single player. Everyone you play with has a slightly different play style, you might be working with someone who likes to stealthily sneak past all of the infected, or you could be playing with a gung-ho gun-nut who shoots everything that moves and then some things that don't move just for good measure. One of the coolest parts of the multiplayer is just watching your friends get from point A to point D. While running you could see one of your friends on the streets below you sliding into an impossibly small gap to evade a fast zombie while at the same time you could say a black rope appear just above you and see another friend use it to grapple their way to the next building.I've given the game a lot of flack and deservedly so, it is the game we all expected it to be, just not as good as we had hoped. Given time I hope they update the game to iron out some of the more minor inconveniences.Maybe I've been overly harsh? Maybe not. Overall I'd give it 7/10. 7.5 at a push. It's a really fun game, just don't go into it thinking that it's going to be the best game you've ever played. THIS LAST PART DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS ABOUT THE LAST MISSION OF THE GAME!  My last gripe is put at the end, and appropriately so. The last mission has an exhilirating, genuinely fun chase followed by tedious climbing rigged with lots of insta-death scenarios which I was able to get over. The last fight however is something I am not able to get over! A quick time event is not something that should replace a last boss battle! You've spent the entire game building up hatred between these two characters and genuinely making the player feel like he/she should hate the villain, but you don't let us kill him ourselves! Quick time events do not count as boss battles! The ending itself was kinda lazy too in my opinion.  "

												I've never been much into zombie games but I feel like this one finally got it right!First the graphics are amazing and the lightning is particularly remarkable. The parkour system is fantastic and the only thing better might be the new buggy introduced in The Following [which is an impressive expansion on its own]. It's a total blast to drive around in the countryside through hordes of monsters.There are a lot of various weapons and the crafting is pretty cool. All in all it's a really nice survival / horror / action sandbox game that I highly recommend, especially for it's campaign coop mode which is uniquely entertaining. It features some quite decent acting and much more content than most similar titles.This is a purchase you won't regret, Dying Light is the ultimate zombie game!+ You can also play the whole game as a Ninja! 11/10			"

												Fantastic, and this is coming from someone who doesn't particulary like zombie games or films.Having also played Techland's earlier open world zombie slash/hack/stab/<insert killing adjective here>-em-up 'Dead Island', it's clear to see where the basic building blocks of Dying Light came from. Yet where Dead Island shambled and stumbled, faults chiefly lying with a clunky feeling combat and not much of a feel of progression, Dying Light is a fast zombie. Combat feels lithe and fluid, and you never feel out of options when you suddenly find yourself in a pickle. Jump over the zombies. Do a sliding kick through the zombies. Become unto a whirlwind of bladed death (well... death v2.0 I guess) to the zombies. And then make your escape while cackling with sheer glee as you bound over cars, scramble up walls and sprint across rooftops.The controls are spot on in this game, and I'd go so far to argue that using a keyboard and mouse actually feels better than a gamepad; a rarity in a market so centred on consoles (for a game of this type at least). The city of Harran looks brilliant also, the first time you see the dawn sun filtering in between buildings, revealing corpses strewn about is a sight to behold.The character skill progression in this game is a wonderfull thing, and perfectly balanced. Your first tentative steps outside the safety of the tower block, you really do feel threatened, and combat leaves you breathless. But as you improve skills, you do start to feel very confident in piling into a mass of zombies that would have left you gibbering with panic at the start of the game, and coming out alive at the other side. While certain skills and abilities may feel powerful, there's still just enough vunerability remaining to not make it feel like the game is holding your hand.I adore this game. It takes the absolutely fantastic feeling of parkour from Mirror's Edge, introduces zombies and a well thought out combat system (and I haven't even mentioned the weapon crafting/improvement yet), and melds it all into a nice tight, cohesive package.Maybe you're like me, not a massive zombies fan, and you're sat on the fence because of it. Put the zombies to one side of your mind, and get it for everything else. Imagine that they're clowns or something. Ok, that might not have helped.I'm guessing now is not a good time to also say there's Bad Things lurking about at night time also? What's that? You've already bought it?Oh.Well. Good night. Good luck.			"

												So far with the couple of hours put into this game, I am liking this game a lot. I know it's starting to become more of a generic zombie killing game, but the idea of adding parkour (similar to Mirror's Edge) makes this game a little more interesting. Dying Light has put a lot of good time and effort to make a very solid game, and for it just coming out, the performance was a lot better than I expected. Pros:+ The variety of weapons that are in the game can take bashing zombies over the head a fun time for you.+ Smash, shoot, burn, or drop kick zombies to get out of situations or if you're in the mood to kill a bunch of them, there are many ways to do so.+ The parkour aspect in this game is great for getting out of sticky situations.+ Upgrades to your weapon can increase greatly and can help kill zombies much quicker.+ Crafting weapons and equipment is definitely useful when it comes to being out on your own.+ 3 separate skill points give you a variety of level ups to become a better runner.+ Night time in this game is very difficult, but exciting at the same time.+ Characters, textures, and distant buildings look amazing at which this definitely shows a 2015 game!Cons:- Side missions are kind of annoying.- Climbing over walls or vehicles leaves you vulnerable to attacks.- Sometimes bashing their skulls more than 10 times just isn't enough and that wastes your weapon's durability.- FPS dropping once I left tutorial (fixed it by lowering quality which stinks! :(  ).- A lot of features in this game isn't original and seems like a bunch of games mixed into one.I'll throw this in here hopefully someone has experienced this issue, but throughout the game, my audio starts distorting when either I'm talking or randomly in the middle of combat. It happens frequently and it just sounds like the voices turn robotic for just a little bit.  "

tl;dr It's just Dead Island 1.75. With parkour, drop kicks, and a slightly better story.Is fun, but littered with many problems. Not quite a 60USD investment, but worth checking out.**Warning: This game has very bad optimization for AMD cards and chipsets. The game can run fine on medium settings, but setting your View Distance to a higher amount or even setting Textures to High can destroy your frame rate if you are not using a Nivida GPU with an Intel CPU. But even then, the game may lag.If you liked Dead Island but hated how ""co-op"" it felt because your character had little input in the story and it was just ""the group"", you might enjoy this more. Crane is a lot more engaged than the protagonists of Dead Island, which is pretty nice. However, his personality is lacking and all over. Oddly enough, he starts getting interesting during a story mission half way through the game, but the following mission has him making wise-cracks the entire time.Even though the story is better than Dead Island, it is still very predictable, incredibly cliched, and hilarious most of the time. I mean, the game craps its self in the most glorious ways for no reason. If you think something is going to happen, you probably already know what is going to happen. Also, Rais is a good villain in the sense you hate him and just want to kill him so you can make him shut up. But he's really a terrible villain with no real logic behind his motives and he's probably Russian just so we could have that Cold War grudge against him as well. There's a side quest where you have to track down a serial killer in the Old Town that has a more interesting antagonist than Rais because you can believe he's actually crazy.The urban exploration is really the highlight of this game; getting around can be very fun when you start upgrading your agility and especially after you get the grappling hook. Many of the towers you can climb really are fun to scale and even feel like you are there with both how good the game looks and how well it handles ambient noise. For instance, while climbing a radio tower, you can hear the steel beams creak and sway in the wind. Also how Crane constantly adjusts himself while on thin ledges really add to the feel that you are a human doing these things, unlike most games where you feel like you are playing as a box. I say this game would have been perfect if it had no zombies or story and focused purely on the parkour.However, the parkour is not without fault. Sometimes, Crane refuses to grab onto ledges while scaling and that can result into accidentally falling to your death (which also is your number one cause of death). Also Crane is just so slow when you start the game. Yeah, he's just a guy; but he is also a special agent and he doesn't really feel like he has had any physical training besides ""Above Average Strength and Stamina"". I suggest not sleeping at night and just let the Volatiles chase you around while you get double XP and get to a safe zone for the agility bonus until you get the first intermediate upgrade. Even then, just play at night anyway because the game becomes more fun.The combat is simultaniously one of the worst but best part of the game. It's either frustrating because the big enemies have incredibly big AoE attacks that you have to dodge 2-3 times in one direction to maybe dodge (even though you may still get hit), or too easy because the same big guys can be killed in two or three well placed hits with an upgraded mid-game weapon or a vanilla late game weapon. For how realistic the game looks, it's crazy how cartoony the fighting is. You should be disgusted that you just kicked the hipbones out of a zombie's body, but holy crap you just kicked the hipbones out of a zombie. The combat skills you get are hilarious and are very effective; you can dropkick a zombie and send him flying like he got shot out of a cannon, or you can kill a zombie by grabbing his head and gently turning him to the right, or you can kill a zombie by jumping off a roof and slamming an axe through its body with enough force to create a shockwave that sends every zombie in a 3m radius flying.Even then, the game put a lot of focus on the melee combat but forces you into firefights frequently in the main story. There are only five guns to pick from (two handguns, two rifles, and one shotgun), and they never scale in stats. That rifle you found at level 11 is the exact same at level 25 although it now costs more because it is orange. Also you'd imagine that since you can find the same guns all game, you can find the same melee weapons too, but apparently there's weapon extinction. I have a blueprint I never used because it needs a baseball bat and I never found a baseball bat all game and now I can't ever find one because they are ""Low Level"" weapons. I can fill all 18 inventory slots with Katanas and Khopeshes though!I feel like the game blows its load on ""Visually Interesting"" very early then doesn't pick its self back up again until much later for how muddy and brown almost the entire game is, and then Old Town just feels like Italy which felt out of nowhere, because apparently the Harran World Games were to put it ""on the map"", but Harran was a global trade center for hundreds of years and a huge oil export with a rich cultural history.This is the most well off apocalypse I have ever seen. You will get an abundance of cash and supplies only a few hours into the game. Just by playing as a kleptomaniac, you will never run out of anything you need besides String (at least in my experience, I only found about 20 pieces my entire time playing the main story, but started finding it all over after I beat the game). I'll even go so far to say that if you need ANY supplies right now, you could just add me and I could throw 20 of something at you and still have too much crap. You can even cross the bridge to get to a medical outpost and get about 25 medkits and gauze (as well as several police vans and ambulances to lockpick) inbetween missions and always have enough supplies.I do find it very funny that the game tries to set up that the supply drops are a massive point of the game and the focus of survival, even though they stopped after two hours of playtime for me. Then they become far too common in the Old Town district (I found enough supply drops to get over 205,000 survival experience just by running around for an hour-- Not counting the XP you get from liberating the drops as well).I also find it hilarious how often Crane gets his cover blown for how he is supposed to blend in and be a secret agent. I will say the impression I got from early videos of the game was that you were just in the quarantine zone already and had to fight other survivors to get to the supply drops to survive, which I thought would be very interesting; seeing how people would act when supplies are low and there are zombies everywhere. But we barely get that and the game is just littered with random neutral survivors you have to save from time to time. I won't go so far to say that Techland again didn't deliver what they promised, but... They didn't exactly deliver what they promised, again.Edit: This is what max level feels like. "

												What can feel like a spin off of Dead Island, definitely doesn't mimic it's style when it comes to being complete. The edges around this game are smooth in the sense that there are no ""lucky jumps"". If Dead Island had the parkour movement Dying Light did, that game would be better. If Dying Light incorporated more vehicles, this would definitely blow Dead Island out of the water. Dying Light follows a story about a fellow named Crane who was dropped into an infested zone. He is under cover for an agency for their espionage work. They are attempting to gather intelligence regarding what is happening. Crane finds himself saved by two characters and eventually is offered to join in with their crowd of survivors known as ""The Tower"". Besides being able to do main story line quests, side quests are also available to enrich the experience. Moreover, side quests do not feel redundant or cheap. They feel like they actually give you a purpose and boost in stats.The game's controls are phenomenal and can be somewhat comparable to Mirror's Edge control scheme. Parkour is highly hailed in this game and it is rightly so. Jumping from a lower ledge to a higher ledge may seem impossible at times as you may find yourself directly underneath the area you would like to go. Upon looking at the edge (even from underneath or any normal ledge), the camera and your cross hairs sort of shift to indicate this ledge can be grabbed onto. Referring to my earlier remark of being found underneath a ledge you'd like to climb, the camera still can fixate onto a ledge (even from underneath) and the character even leans slightly to add realism. The parkour scheme was done excellently and doesn't feel cheap what so ever. The only thing is you can't really drop down from ledge to ledge. Going up is not a problem but going down is a different story. The player needs to look for garbage piles or wooden roofs to jump on to break the fall. This is a neat addition, but can be a bit annoying for some gamers as that control to go down isn't there. The player may however take one hand off the ledge to look around. Besides a good running/jumping scheme, Dying Light features a multitude of weapons. Weapons can be upgraded and even modified with certain items that are picked up. A pipe can be turned into an electric pipe which stuns an enemy (or two) upon impact. Weapons can also be deconstructed to recycle for more material. Weapons can be from giant hammers, motlov cocktails, to even fire crackers to distract zombies. The fighting scheme is pretty neat and is somewhat immersive. I feel that they could have done a better job introducing a bit more control to the player rather than swinging wildly while pressing RT. None the less, wherever the cross hair points is where the player will land the shot. Some head shots also show an x-ray of the zombies skull and spine and temporarily slow the game a bit. Kicking is also featured in the game (which doesn't require stamina to use). When I was fighting on a rooftop I was attempting to kick enemies down it. The kicking motion itself is okay, but how the zombies react is slightly questionable. It takes a few kicks sometimes to get a zombie on the ground (which is ok), but if I nailed a zombie in the head with a kick I expect them to go flying back and certainly off the roof. This wasn't exactly the case as small curbs would inhibit entire momentum of certain zombies flying over the edge. It is possible though after a few solid kicks to send someone flying. The inventory/map menu is extremely simplistic and extremely UI friendly. I absolutely love every detail except for one small thing, I'd like to be able to equip my weapon from this menu too! Yes I know I can do it in game, but when you have a horde of zombies running after you, time doesn't stop while selecting another weapon. This in a sense adds a bit of security for the player when under stress. Again, not a big deal but I'd figure to point it out. There are three main skill sets to upgrade which add an RPG element to the game, survival, agility and power. Survival offers the player more when roaming around freely to look for objects or to craft better objects. Agility provides for quicker movement and improved climbing skills. Power has to do with direct engagement with zombies and can improve abilities and add new abilities such as being able to drop kick. Each skill set gains EXP as you directly use either of the three while playing. Spread out throughout the map are safe zones. These zones can be unlocked by killing all the zombies within the area as well as securing the zone (closing the door, turning on power etc...). Also spread out are UV traps, where the player can activate them when nearby. Multiplayer is a great addition to already a big game. It can be annoying for a few as when you are going through a campaign quest, you may be interrupted by a game. I really like the fact they allow you to be the survivor on top of being able to be the zombie.Graphics are on par and feel next gen. There is quite a bit of detail put into the game but some graphics or tiles look bland. Recycling bins never seem to change as I'm guessing everyone threw out the exact same stuff in the trash. Either than that though, the game can offer some awesome views from exceptional heights. Sounds are good, especially when making a solid impact with a metal pipe against a zombie. They have also added day and night into the game, where at night ""crawlers"" or zombies with significant power come out to play. Day game play is quite different from night, as at night you'll try to creep around more and make less noise whereas day, you don't really care how loud you are.I like this game, and the fact they incorporated co-op and multiplayer is a definite notable feature. Local co-op would have been nice too but who knows, they can't make everything always amazing.For future Dying Light games, please add a method to get down buildings once you scale them! It's a cool feature to be able to jump from a crazy height onto a pile of garbage, but maybe some of us just want to drop down a floor. The melee fighting scheme is awesome, however there needs to be more control and responsibility given to the player. I want to feel like I'm in charge of where the character is swinging their arm. They did a good job in impacts overall, but it doesn't exactly feel right sometimes when knocking enemies back with a blow. Adding a ""light"" melee hit and a ""hard"" melee hit would also give the player a bit more to choose from. Weapons do this as is as some are bigger than the others but I'd like to have control over this. State of Decay also took a unique step when it allowed players to build up their home bases. Maybe this isn't quite the issue here, but some sort of introduction towards that would enrich the gaming and RPG experience.It would have a higher rating if it was more open in allowing the player to use the environment as shown in Dead Island. I do miss driving a truck, and I wouldn't mind trying a motorcycle. Rating : 7.45/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability C+ Overall  B-ScreenShots : Visual  Getting a boot off the edge  Seems impossible but you can jump up to get to the next floor... check the following screenshot I made it up. You can also peek around as your hanging off the ledge "

Posted: February 8, 2015
												I Finished Dying Light today and while I loved it for the first few days of playing, I can honestly say I was biterly disappointed by the end. And I dont just mean the end of the game, I mean the end of my time with it, lets say from about 50% onwards. Following is a long and I hope thorough review of the game. I could go on for many more pages than I will here because there is much to talk about but I will try and focus on major points as much as I can..Please remember, this is my opinion, some folks will agree with me, some won't, but dont flame for flames sake. Try and keep it decent, I like a good reply as much as this review  So whats right with it? Well, in the beginning you feel part of something, you have a direction and a reason for being. You make some friends, and while the storyline is not the greatest, the acting and general pacing are good, engaging and you feel like you actually want to help, to succeed. Finding out about the games many mechanics is immensely fun, from your first parkour lessons, to learning to electricute  zombies with fallen powr lines and puddles is all very satisfying. Killing the zombies themselves is satisfying, and I can honestly say that for the first 3 or 4 days (around 4-6 hours each) I rated Dying Light as one of the very best zombie killing experiences.The skill system is clever, varied, and most of the skills are actually fun to learn, allowing you to develop a 'style' of play.One of my absolute favourite things about Dying Light is how much havoc it lets you cause by giving you as many materials as you could possibly need to craft the games many different zombie killing utilities. You are never short of anything, and I really believe that more open world games shoudl be this way. Sure, make a player search for these things but dont make them rare as rocking horse♥♥♥♥♥♥.. The more you allow a player to make molotovs, the more he will use them and have infinite fun doing so!! Well done on this devs of Dying Lght, a great great choice!Your first time at night is VERY memorable, (as are many of the other times, but that first is the charm) and doing every side quest feels fun and somehow non repetitive. The miriad of ways you learn to kill a zombie keeps the game fresh for a long while.Around 50% however the game for me began to sour... (spoilers from here - if your undecided and dont want to read the rest of the review because of the spoilers know that I do recommend the game, if only for the first 30 hours or so, its well worth the asking price. if you like killin zombies enmasse ten buy yourself a copy!) Ok so for those that stuck around. At first it wasn't very noticeable because the variety was still there but as you progress in the game you begin to notice just how much the zombies seem to take the same amount of killing no matter what weapons you use... This 'leveled creature' way of making games always leaves me scratching my head. I simply cant understand why developers make games that level with you? All this does is make 'upgrading' utterly pointless. (well other than you will die horrendously if you dont!)I had weapons in my inventory that did 200 damage, 300 damage and 400 damage. Each of these weapons (if aimed right) took 1 or 2 hits to kill each zombie. So whats the point of finding and making 'better' weapons if you never see any real improvement in them because the zombies level with you?? For god sake devs of today.. Learn this does not make a game fun! Whats FUN, is when you can return to an earlier place in the game and wipe everything out with a single swing! Thats the feeling of 'progression' which simply dies with leveled creatures! Ok, ok, so open world has to deal with this ability to go anywhere at anytime somehow.. Is leveling the creatures the way to do it? NO!! Put tougher creatures in in other areas.. Make it impossible for  new player to traverse certain areas until they 'progress' the reason we all play - progression.Anyway, you get my point, this game is bad for it! This game is also bad for changing the rules on you. At first you are very scared of the virals, these are newly turned zombies who still have all their motor skills intact. They can run, they can climb, they are not stupid and mindless... They are scary!At first.The rules change around the 50% mark again, and rather than 'noise' bringing them, they just seem to be everywhere, and come whenever they want to. Curiously around this time the other zombies seem to now explode after dying, sending toxic goo all around that hurts you if you get caught in it. This 'explosion' is the catalyst for bringing more virals! Sorry, but his is DUMB! Why change the rules!? If they player makes noise, expect company, this is a great mechanic, fun to think 'oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ I made loads of noise! But creating excuses for them to be there is poor, and a seemingly lazy way to make the game harder.Then comes the introduction of the harder zombies, the ones with big heafty weapons they smash on the floor creating shockwaves that send you flying! These guys are slow, but tough! Early on, its virtually impossible to take them out without a lot of running in and getting a hit here and there. Later they become utterly ridiculous in difficulty and just there to make the game harder. Not 'tactical', just harder for the sake of it. Again this feels like a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attept at making the game harder... Dont even get me started on the exploders!! They hide around corners, and even lightning reflexes wont turn you quick enough to get out of their explosion range. I wonder sometimes what Playtesters do all day.. because they obviously dont provide decent feedback.Now before someone starts flaming me here about wanting the game made easier.. NO I DONT. This is not about making anything easier, its about being more clever in the first place with what your creatures can and cant do. Make them scary by all means, make them tough as nails, but dont make it frustrating, like the fights are here in dying light.It feels i'm getting on a bit of a downer with the game here and please understad that I did enjoy it, I just get tired with the same old same old type of development. Keep games fun, fair, and exciting... Dont set out to♥♥♥♥♥♥off your player base.So what did I not like... The halucination sequence with Jade.. Honestly!! Who thought that was a good idea!! It was CRAP!The tower climbing... Kinda on the fence about this because the controls worked well, and it was satisfying but death was often just annoying, and  paths were blocked often just for the sake of it.Leading on from that, even the games hero starts to shout phrases such as 'Oh you gotta be ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me!!' because even HE is fed up with the way the game just seems to want to '♥♥♥♥ with you' The cable snapping in the radio tower?? Why did it snap? Whats the reasoning behind this??As the story developed I felt it got more and more ridiculous, there were times I wished for the feel of the beginning of the game, where things had passion, and made you feel something. But when you find yourself at the finale running through sewers being chased by everything the game has, where one slip-up (which was often as simpe as a 'clip' by a creature) would send you plumiting to your death, you feel less and less attached to the game, and more that it IS a game, one you want over... The restarting of this sequence with every death by the way was a hideous development choice! Then the last fight with our buddy Rise... timed key pressing, Really?? This is a developers idea of a good ending? Simply horrendous. One of the worst endings I have ever played I am sad to say.So, here we are.. TL:DRIt has enough greatness to make it a fantastic experience. It is however marred by some horrendous development choices and a story that by half way you no longer care about. (which is a shame)8/10 for me..			"

Luckily, multiplayer is available which is really awesome!! and checkpoints automatically save your progress and the best thing is you can kill zombies using different ways.

												Most reviews describe this game as Dead Island meets Mirror's Edge, however I find a more apt comparison is Farcry 4. This is basically FarCry 4 with parcour and zombies. The story and missions are handled in a similar manner and many of the games mechanics are borrowed from the latest installments of this franchise.			"

												Absolutely amazing. From the creators of the Dead Island franchise, Techland parts ways with Deep Silver and team up with Warner Bros. The end result is truly the best zombie survivor game I have ever played. Fans of the original Dead Island and Riptide will notice similarities with some of the crafting, weapons and looting, but this is by no means a remaster of the original title.The game boasts the best movement I have experienced in any modern day FPS. (I use the term FPS very loosely, firing weapons in the game draws unwanted attention). The parkour element brings an exilarating angle on exploration and evasion, and is incorporated into the game seamlessly. For me this was a huge selling point, the fact that it also contains multitudes of psycotic zombies is just a bonus!The game itself is stunningly beautiful, the city just begs to be explored extensively. City design and layout is done well, so you can take full advantage of a fun playground to test your parkour skills on. You are also rewarded for creative thinking, in terms of combat and movement. Okay, now a quick word on the zombies! With a plethora of titles on a very tired and clichéd genre, zombie games can find it hard to stand out from the mundane and mediocre. This title stands shoulders above the rest. In most zombie games, I am never really scared of dying, and just go about business as usual...hacking, slashing and shooting. Not so with Dying Light.This was the only zombie game that was terrifying for me. Yes, you still get the slow, mindless shamblers in large numbers, plus a variety of other undead denizens. But the game transforms like some horrid nightmare, showing you it's true form, as soon as that sun sinks below the horizon. That is when the zombies show their unabated strength, speed and cunning as they run, jump and climb whilst alerting others to your presence. I advise doing as much as you can during the day when they are weakened by the sun. Going out at night does have its rewards, but at great risk.It is also best to play this game solo for the first play-through for a solid horror experience. Then team up with friends, as the terror level significatly drops when you have a buddy or two watching your back. The great thing is you not only get the blood racing from zombie encounters, you also have numerous heart-in-throat moments with the climbs and jumps you perform. I highly recommend this game for any zombie or parkour lover. So let the heads and limbs fly, may your hands always find that precarious ledge...and venture forth into the night if you dare!			"

												A sleeper hit, one of the more underrated game in the past years. Definitely worth buying if you enjoy good combat, GREAT tense atmosphere of an actual zombie invasion (in the nights), and the overall repetitive content of open world games.It looks great, the story is passable, the voice acting is actually pretty good, the combat is great, the sounds and music are pretty good. A solid 8.5/10.			"

												The playable area is truly gigantic and with far less buildings to climb on, moving from one side of the map to the other would have been a nightmare if it wasn’t for the buggy, Dying Light: The Following’s main addition.As soon as you start using the buggy, you’ll begin to level up another perk tree: Driver. This will give you access to important upgrades such as installing UV headlights, a Nitro boost, several kinds of weapons (flamethrower, spikes and more).Melee combat is simply great, with slow-motion decapitations/mutilations and a great sense of weight carried with every move, while ranged weapons (including the new crossbow) are less satisfying to handle.As for the story of Dying Light: The Following, just like in the base game it’s interesting enough to keep the player hooked without being really deep. The real deal of this expansion comes from The Following’s array of quality quests that follow Kyle Crane seeking gain of trust of the locals to get close to a creepy cult.THE GOOD- Upgradable buggy- Diverse side quests- Great ending- Lovely visuals- Cheap and addictiveTHE BAD- Can be grindy and repetitive- Harsh difficulty levelDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE "

												A stereotypical zombie survival - Think again.This game is fantastic, a odd mix of parkour and zombies that goes especially well together. It's not only zombies there are gangs, mutant running things and huge tough ones. The gear in the game is really brilliant, there's just so many different items, craft parts and other upgrades. You want a katana that electrocutes, poisons and burns zombies? you got one! There are plenty of ranged weapons too, from crossbows to a revelver the choice is yours. The story is quite good, not just hero saves the day, plenty of dark scenes too. This really helps the game in becoming very atmospheric, with a constant spooky feel you never feel safe, even when you're in a safe zone. The game is also very well balanced, to start off it;s hard and as you move along it's also hard: only at the end of the following do the zombies seem to get easier. The game runs perfectly, I'm on a GTX 960 and an i5 at the moment, running at a constant 60+ FPS. The game has never crashed once and I've experianced literally no bugs. The only problem is when things get cluttered up with hordes of zombies, although this is VERY infrequent. In conclusion this game is amazing, fast paced and fluid action combined with the huge amounts of variety in weapons makes for a very sucessful game, which is a must for any survival, parkour or zombie fans!

												Short version: BUY THIS GAME NOW!UPDATE: After playing hours and hours of this game I have realized that this game is truely an experience like none other, it is one of the darkest and most unique games I have ever played; the open world is larger and more detailed than anything you've ever played and the story is just awesome, a truely engaging an emotionally draining experience. In my review below I make lots of reference to Dead Island and while I hate to say it, those comments are now irrelevant, Dead Island has nothing on this game. This isn't just an evolution in gaming, it's an evolution in story telling.Long version:Nothing can describe this game other than perfect. It takes everything that was amazing about Dead Island; the ambience, the exploration, the story and the crafting and adds more to it. The only thing Dead Island lacked was flawless gameplay, it was buggy and filled with graphics glitches, but Techland have really learnt from that experience and they've taken everything that worked and fixed everything that didn't! This game is like a slap in the face for the Cryengine, the graphics are OUT OF THIS WORLD. I can also forgive Techland for delaying this game to work on the free-running because it was definitely worth it; the exploration in this game is unlike any other because literally, if it looks like you can climb it, YOU CAN.Another impressive apsect to Techlands work is the emphasis they put on the zombie; in Dead Island they really made zombie's a threat again, unlike other zombie games where they are basically harmless obstacles that you need to knock over. But in Dying Light they've upped the ante again, you REALLY don't want to confront a zombie and that's just during the day, don't even talk to me about night-time! Which brings me to the day and night cycle; this is the first game where it really affects the game. Taking your character out during the day is completely different to taking him out at night. The game brilliantly conditions you to fear the night and believe me, YOU DO. It's easy to lose track of time when you're working a mission and when you suddenly hear the warning over the radio that it's almost night time, it like a kick in the guts, and then you gun it for the nearest safe zone.There are only two issues I have with the game; the first is that the Be The Zombie mode is slightly unbalanced and consequently no-one who is playing a human takes the challenge against a hunter, but this is merely a matter balancing the hunter a bit and as soon as its sorted out, it will be amazing. My second problem isn't actually a problem with the game but more of a grievance; I loved Dead Island and this game should've been Dead Island, I can't imagine how amazing this game would be if it were set Bonoi, but that takes nothing away from this game and it's not Techland's fault; Deep Silver are just morons.Ultimately, this game has all the amazing intrigue and charisma that Dead Island had, but adds to that some of the best graphics I've ever seen, an amazing parkour system and a truely dark, disturbing and terrifying experience.Techland are becoming the masters of zombie games.

Like now.So Dying Light is a first-person, parkour, zombie, survival game with three basic skill trees, a fourth you unlock later, and a fifth in The Following DLC. This game has a great story, where you play as a conflicted protagonist named Kyle Crane. He works for an organization named ""The GRE."" He is told to jump into the city of Harran, a city taken over by the zombie virus, and quarantined by the rest of the world. You dive in, and within two minutes, you are bitten. There is still hope, however, when you are given antizin. Antizin is like a cure, but it fades away over time, and you have to take another shot, therefore it is only a suppressant. The reason you jump in is to find a rogue GRE agent who has files that supposedly lead to the cure of the virus. They have you betray your friends, almost killing innocent people, to find these files, just to find out the GRE Is corrupt. Hence, being the ""conflicted"" protagonist.The gameplay is really amazing as well. The graphics are smooth, but require a NASA computer to run without lag. My computer is absolutely amazing, and I even have a lag spike from time to time. Almost everyone does so it might be a glitch, but who knows? There is a twenty four hour day cycle, but luckily, not in real time. From six in the morning to ten at night is the time you would want to get things done when you just start playing. From ten at night to six in the morning however, that's for the suicidal, and the veterans (Explained later in the review). You have to parkour across the map to survive, and find weapons from people you kill, or places across the map. The best way to get weapons, however is obviously the traders you can frequently find. The weapons have a durability and a certain amount of times it can be repaired with metal parts before becoming permanently useless.The level system is very unique. Like all level systems, you have to do certain things to level it up. What's unique about it, is there are three different skills to level up, and all three are leveled up differently. The exp gained for each skill tree is simply classified by ""[Name of the tree] Points"". Survivor points are gained by completing story, or side missions. You can also save survivors from enemies, or turn in airdrops you can grab from random places at random times, or the quarantine zone missions scattered around the map. Agility points are gained by doing parkour. Even climbing a simple ledge will give you agility points. Power points are gained by attacking enemies. Hitting them will give a few, killing them will give a couple hundred, depending on your levels. When you get high levels with each tree, you will be amazed with what you can achieve. Each level will give you a point to spend for that specific tree you just leveled up. The survivor tree will give you general abilities, and every survivor level you go up by, will allow you to find better weapons automatically. No perk needed. The agility tree will give you more parkour moves and running stamina, and the power tree will give you more attacks and attacking stamina. The last tree, outside of the DLC, is called the Legend tree. The legend tree can only be unlocked when you max out at least one of the first three. Then, every point you gain that would've gone to the tree you maxed, will go to your legend. This tree upgrades your character, increasing general stamina, all damage with certain weapons, maximum health, etc. When you become high level in each tree, you will be amazed what you can achieve and what your weapons can do. For example, I am a max level Survivor, Agility and Power, and I am a level 101 legend. My best melee weapon does 5000 damage, and my favorite shotgun does 9000. To compare, the weapons you start with do 30. Night time takes away the annoying zombies called Virals, but adds in the vicious zombie called Volatiles. Volatiles are faster than the player, meaning you need to make the chase as complex as possible to survive them if they see you. They are powerful and have a large amount of health, as well as not being able to be knocked back by anything other than explosions. Don't dropkick them, I've tried and it doesn't work.The Following DLC gives a new story, and a nep map with it. You play as Kyle Crane again, and it takes place after the end of the original storyline. You venture out of Harran city, to the outskirts, which is still quarantined off. You go out to find a cure because the antizin supply is running low, and in the process, you gain a buggy to travel across this maps large, and flat terrain. The fifth skill tree, is the driving skill. Leveled up by destroying things with your buggy, killing enemies, and traveling at high speeds. New kinds of missions and weapons are unlocked, such as the SMG and revolver for weapons, and Volatile Hives for new missions. I definitely recommend this DLC, especially if you have a friend who has it too. The co-op can be so much fun.This is my favorite game of all time, I recommend it 42/10			"

												This is the best zombie game I have ever played, and I would definitely say that this was well worth the price. Sure, a couple of bugs have been encountered: stuck in the ground a couple of times, and falling through the map too, but even then, the situation generally ended up being quite humorous. Much of my playtime has been co-operative, where my friends are more dangerous than our enemies, but that's possibly just the playstyle of me and my friends, laughing all the time.What I most love about this game in comparison to other zombie games, is the actual emphasis on survival. You do not start with a half a dozen guns and unlimited ammo. Resources, especially guns, ammo, and med kits are very rare, and you must be careful with your decision making. And even melee weapons eventually get worn out and cannot be used any further, with a limited number of repairs as well. This all contributes to making this game quite difficult, with a huge emphasis on survival. The difficulties you encounter in facing enemies, be they zombies or humans, especially early on, make this a standout game - you cannot stand and deliver, and just slaughter hordes of enemies. And thus, the focus is on running, and escaping, and using the terrain. Crafting is fun, with a huge variety of mods and other things that you can create - experiment! Everything has its uses... if your backpack can fit it all.And the movement is where the game particularly shines. Much has been said of the parkour, and it is everything I expected, and much more. From jumping over walls, from roof to roof, along ledges, and climbing and sliding all over the place, the movement is fluid, fun, and incredibly rewarding. There is also an incredible impressive use of momentum here, too, where to slow or to stop could be very costly. Very responsive controls, the free-running is extremely exhilarating, especially if you are trying to escape at night. The survival element of this game is emphasised by the day/night cycle, where the night is actually quite a scary and dangerous place to be - you really do not want to be caught out at night. The graphics and audio, combined with the scary night-only Infected, make the night a very dangerous, yet potentially rewarding place to be - this is because of the extra skill points available during the night.There is a large variety of enemies within the city of Harran, both human and zombie, which leads to a need to be careful in what you do, and how you do it, in order to deal with them, while also being careful not to draw too much attention to yourself. There are some quite intriguing special zombies, although it is getting always getting harder to design original zombies as the years pass. Even when you do find a gun and ammo, you may not want to use it and stick with melee weapons - gunshots draw the Infected like moths to a flame, so there is a huge trade-off - unless you're willing to take on all comers - are you brave enough? Do you have enough ammo? Have you got a back-up plan? And there are other environmental hazards which may draw enemies to you by letting off far-reaching sounds, be it a car alarm or exploding gas bottle, or something else.The graphics look fantastic, and the city, characters, and models of the weapons and mods all look brilliant. The open world nature of the map is also very attractive, with a charming appearance accompanied by plenty to explore and do. But it is the audio, including the voice acting, which really stands out for me. Dying Light contains some nice though not award-winning performances, though some people had amusingly odd accents for the game's European setting. The score was fitting and atmospheric, particularly when at night, or otherwise occupied in conflict, or at some potentially climatic point in the campaign. The sound effects are also very well done too, from the sounds of zombies, to the impact of melee weapons.While the plot was quite cliche and somewhat predictable, the fun elements are all there, ably supported by an intriguing cast of characters, who all perform their roles admirably. The game also offers an interesting insight into the anarchy which could descend given the absence of law and order. There is also a very wide variety of interesting side quests to complete, should you wish to. The game's finale, however, is Bittersweet. Without spoilers, the game's end feels lackluster in comparison to the heights reached by the rest of the game.I would also like to give a special mention to the RPG-elements of the game. I really, really like the leveling system implemented in Dying Light. Unlike traditional leveling systems, where everything you do gives you some exp, which you then arbitrarily decide to put points into various Skill Trees, in Dying Light, there are three separate skill trees, and you unlock more options in these Skill Trees by doing thing related to those skill trees. For example, completing quests or rescuing survivors will contribute towards raising your Survival Level, while your Agility skill tree is improved by parkour and Power by combat.With a load of content, and genuinely incredible gameplay, alongside a host of other great features, this is definitely a very highly recommended game, especially if you like zombie games.

												Edit: After more than 100 hours here comes the DLC 'The Following'. Mindblowing. Not more of the same. Nope. 2 extra skills you can work on and one of them is 'Driving'. The scenery has changed to farmlands and the map is BIG! So you realy need your car (Buggy) and you can upgrade it when you climb your driving skill. You'll damage your car driving over zombie's and you'll burn fuel. So you'll need to repair once in a while and you'll have to search for fuel and gear in abandoned cars. Lots to do in this DLC. O...new weapon. Crossbow. It's great! From best zombie game ever to best zombie game ever+. No way another team is ever going to beat this one in the near future. Edit: After 47 hours of taking my time and enjoying this game I'm getting a second stage...there's more...o joy!  Didn't saw that comming. I didn't mention that this game is pretty scarry at times in the review I wrote a couple of months ago. So, it's scarry at times. At night you're just game for the hungry mob out there. It's great. I played some hours with other people and they were all very nice, patient and helpfull. This game is good in all the right places. Best zombie game out there. In a review someone said that it reminded him of Farcry with zombies. I agree.Dead Island kind of game but with climbing and 'Free Running'. Part of the team that made this game is also responsible for the Dead Island games. This one is better though because you can climb all the buildings and do some free running. The three skill trees are a bit better too. The punnishing system when you die is also well thought of.  Points are being deducted from one of the skill trees when you die so you'll be carefull. It's a little bit tough to get into but when you get going there's lots of fun and thrills here. I suggest that you buy the 'Ultimate survivor bundle' with the main game when you start. There are some blue prints for weapons in there that realy helps you on your way. Very good zombie game this is. If you want to spend time in a nice zombie game and you don't know wich one to buy with Dead Island I and II also in the Steam shop.....they are all very good games. But buy this one. Less buggs and more freedom of movement.			"

												I am loving thia game so far! It certainly isn't perfect, but it gets enough right for me to enjoy my experiences and want to keep playing. Dying Light is certainly more polished than the previous Dead Island games have been, and the parkour adds a while new element to the game.I also appreciated the game making you think before attacking zombies, at least at the beginning.

												First of all, I would recommend this game to everybody who like Zombies or Parkour or both.Graphics are nice to look at and the gameplay feels refreshing, even though the Zombie genre is kind of overrun these days. The Parkour mechanics are a really fresh and exciting new take on the whole genre and it doesn't feel forced for the most part. It just becomes second nature to scale walls like spiderman.The Co-Op mode is worth it's weight in gold, the next best thing to Dead Space Three Co-Op. Here is my only beef with the game tho, the end felt forced and the safe points are too far apart. This could have been betterOverall tho 9/10 would play again "

												Dying Light was pretty much exactly what I hoped it would be. It’s an effective free running survival horror game. The story is absolute crap, but the music, sound design & creature animation is outstanding. It’s fairly well paced too, as it gave me new areas to explore just as the first map was starting to feel old. The first hour or so of the game isn’t too exciting, but the further you get into the game, the better it gets. It doesn't show everything it has going on right off the bat like some games do.I found the second half of the game more scary than the first. With new types of monsters, and an excellent second area to explore, the tone they were going for was executed with great effect. If only the story was better! It commits the worst offense, which is to be boring. I could feel myself nodding off during cutscenes, wishing they’d just get it over with. The story mission designs weren’t too bad, and I loved the music. It just had the least interesting villain in history. He even looked generic, with a face so devoid of interesting features I was struggling to take in his looks even while staring directly at him. Same could be said of the rest of the cast. Even Ubisoft at their worst do better than this. But I guess it’s still a step up from the story in Dead Island. That had a story so bad I remember staring at cutscenes, mouth agape at the incomprehensible♥♥♥♥♥♥that someone had written, and then animated.What was missing from the story is characterization. You have no idea who the main character is, who the employers are, who your friends are, or who the enemy is. You know their names and what they look like, but that’s about it. It’s as thin as it gets. The protagonist is forced by his employer to do morally questionable acts “for the greater good”. But because you have no idea where he’s coming from, it’s hard to care. What’s at stake for him? This story and setting needed much more work. It leans heavily on cliché, which has a sleep inducing effect on the audience, without any meat to the story. When exploring, the music, sound and visual design creates a deliberate tone. You can “feel” what the developers were aiming for with this game. But they seem to have underestimated just how much work you need to put in on the story and cutscenes to not make them horrible. The reason this game isn’t a complete disaster is because of just how much stuff is in this game, and because of how strong the other elements are. The music is like Hotline Miami and Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon, evoking the feel of 80s movies. And the sound has all the subtleties you expect from AAA games, like how the world seems to have layers of sound based on how far you’re elevated from the ground, giving you different types of wind sounds.During the first half of Dying Light I felt I could only recommend the game with several caveats. But as I got further into the game I felt myself becoming more enthusiastic about it! It’s quite an “emergent” game, ie it’s a bit chaotic in a way that’s rare in newer AAA games. At one point I wanted to get into a building, and luckily a hostile human had spawned nearby. He was attacking zombies, and as he made noise the hordes kept wandering away from the building towards him, clearing the path for me to run inside. An entirely unscripted event, and just one of a ton that I saw during the game. This element of chaos, coupled with the free running system kept it fresh all the way to the end. It never felt like a slog, or that it overstayed its welcome, which is relatively rare in big AAA titles. If you like the idea of free running in a zombie infested city, with escape sequences like those in the late parts of Mirror's Edge, then you'll probably have a good time here.			"

												It's a shame that Dying Light's marketing went dark after Dead Island 2 was announced but if you're a fan of Dead Island (I thoroughly enjoyed Riptide, despite its shortcomings) you'll have a blast here. The sound effects are fantastic. I feel connected and empathetic to the protagonist, and the verticality in the game keeps things tense. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an action game.

												This is a major improvement over Dead Island, is the only way to explain it... With a good fun multiplayer mode.Graphics: The graphics are pretty much an updated Dead Island version with a little more colour.  Not very impressive but still pretty good to look at and it gives the game a sort of appeal to it. Audio: Simple audio sounds for zombies, running, jumping, sliding, beating, swining... What do you expect, there are some cool audio features like the bigger monsters making more of a noise and when a multiplayer zombie enters the game.Controls:  The controls are pretty easy to get used too, once you done the tutorial.. You can leave hints on and it helps you through the game.. For a parkour game, this is surprisinly simple to get ahold and play.The features: The game itself is a mixture of Dead Island and Mirrors Edge... It is the only way to explain it with the best of both in one.  Giving the game a sort of nice appeal, there are tons of things to do in the game, plenty to explore and plenty of game time... The multiplayer is where all the fun is I found and I find playing the zombie is so much more fun than the humans, but you can get a grappling hook which is FUN.Playing this game with friends is amazing, the night time has zombies being smart, hard, fast and very aware so you run and you run fast or you avoid and hide... Up to you.I enjoyed Dead Island but then I did get bored of the game, but that was due to the slow responces of the game and the clunky feeling... This however improves on that and offers a much more enjoyable experience.They have upped the price of the Season Pass because they think it is worth it... When you look at what you actually get, it is nothing worth the money they want.  The only things in the Season Pass that are good is The Following and maybe some Bozak Hoard.. That is it! The rest is pretty much things ingame which are usless, so in a way the Dev's are kinda ripping us off with it.Overal this game has the best of two very good games and without a doubt I would recommend for people to play... Only with friends because alone it is boring.			"

												I love this game. It's by far the most fun I've had playing a zombie game since I was playing the first Left 4 Dead on Xbox Live. It's not perfect, it falls into the trap that too many modern games seem to fall into these days, in that it borrows too many unimportant game mechanics from other games. Climbing from Assassins Creed, lockpicking from Elder Scrolls, etc, and none of them seem to be as well done as the game that they're borrowing from. That being said, I enjoyed the story lines, the graphics are great, and the melee combat is spot-on perfect. This game has been one of the best pc game experiences I've ever had, especially with The Following and Be the Zombie dlcs. It's action packed, scary, immersive, beautiful, and bloody. 8/10 definitely a buy.			"

												Great graphics and interesting gameplay, probably one of the better zombie games visual-wise. Parkour is great but some slight clipping bugs on rare occasions. Not much else needs to be said, you kill zombies of different types without prejudice ala Left 4 Dead, fat obese zombies with explosive digestive systems, spitting zombies (presumably were french when they were alive), night prowling naked zombies and other colourful zombie characters.Slaying zombies is timeless and therapeutic, it's like sipping a cup of tea and having crackers in the afternoon.Storyline's  interesting but expect the typical hollywood cliches(as with other games) when you have a protagonist with an American accent.On a side note, the non-important NPCs all come from the same family. They all look alike and share the same wardrobe.			"

												Short version:This is the best zombie themed game I've ever played. If you are looking for a good zombie game, stop now and buy this game. Enemy variety, tons of weapons, fantastic platforming, solid combat, great horror elements, at least 50+ hours of content. 9.5/10. Buy this game!Long Version:I have to give credit to the developers of Dying Light. In today's era of everyone complaining about nothing being original and developers mainly trying to fulfill these complaints, the developers of DL knew what we REALLY wanted. A solid game that takes the best of many other games and fuses them into one.The core gameplay is a FPS platformer much like Mirror's Edge, but with a refined system allowing you to climb on basically anything. As a general rule in this game, if you can see it, you can go to it. This alone makes the otherwise normal-sized map MUCH larger than it appears, adding lots of depth to exploration. Later into the game, a grappling hook mechanic is introduced, which will make you feel like Spiderman, zipping around the map with ease.The combat is extremely solid and mainly revolves around melee. I feel this is a much more accurate representation of a zombie outbreak when compared to titles like Left 4 Dead (no running around with machine guns with near-infinite ammo). Guns are rare but powerful, and handle well in combat. In this sense, the combat resembles Dead Island a lot, but feels more refined to me.The item system is based off a color-coded rarity mechanic similiar to that found in games like Borderlands, which allows you to know if a weapon/item is worth picking up at a glance. On top of this, weapons can be upgraded and modified, adding an extra layer of depth and customizability. Most weapons fit into 3 groups: One handed, two handed, and guns (guns cannot be modified).This game also involves heavy RPG elements reminiscent of Tomb Raider, with 3 seperate skill trees devoted to parkour, combat, and quests. Characters won't necessarily be unique, as at the higher levels, all skills can be purchased, but this definitely adds more depth to an already massively deep game. The story is fairly generic, with nothing really shocking or surprising. This is to be expected though, as the zombie outbreak story can only be done so many ways without becoming ridiculous (looking at you, resident evil). As referenced by the title of the game, the story involves the now-familiar 'zombies are more aggressive at night' idea. In addition, special 'volatile' zombies appear, which are extremely deadly and will chase the player around, adding an element of horror to this. The player is encouraged to brave the night with special bonuses to XP occurring only at night, and certain missions only completable at night.It goes without saying that the graphics are georgous, as this is definitely a next-gen game in that sense. The visuals are solid and consistant, with a full day/night cycle, weather effects, fancy-but-not-intrusive film and blur effects, etc. The sound is fantastic, adding to the overall theme of the game, and definitely contributing to the horror at night.The 4-player co-op works great, little to no lag, and is very fun. Only issues I've had are some microphone issues, but are relatively minor. The multiplayer PvP is a little odd but not bad. I don't have much experience with this mode so can't comment much on that.I was extremely surprised at the level of polish and depth in this game, with only tiny little nitpicks here and there. It is very apparent that the developers looked at successful mechanics in popular games (Mirror's Edge, Borderlands, Tomb Raider, Dead Island, etc) and integrated similiar mechanics into their design, resulting in a game that feels completely rounded. This game flew under my radar when it first released, and I received it as a gift for christmas 2015 and started playing it with no prior knowledge. This game really deserves all the praise I could pour on it, and more people should check this out.If you like zombie games, you will love this game. 9.5/10			"

												Brains...So it's an open world sandbox that has zombies in it. I guess that's interesting. Apparently this game is basically a better version of Dead Island, but I never played that so I don't have any reference there.Standard-ish zombie plot: Zombie plague, lots of people die, survivors among the undead who are even worse, government assistance that's really shady and unhelpful, etc. The main character you play as is kind of interesting in the sense that he starts out as a hidden agent just doing a job and ends up getting much more invested in what happens thanks to plot events. Also I'm soo glad there wasn't a romance, because it sure looked like that's where things might be heading.Gameplay? You kill zombies (and people) as well as do alot of first person platforming. Ok. My dislike of platforming (due to my lack of skill at it) is well-established in past reviews, but those were THIRD PERSON platformers. This is much worse. Some of the climbing parts of this game really annoyed me. The combat is a bit middling too in the sense that your weapons break constantly and your character seems to run out of stamina far too easily. It was only when I gained access to some decent weaponry and a competent amount of supplies that things started to tilt in my favor. I do like how guns have the trade-off of being good but also being a lure for zombies, even if it did mean that most cases where I used guns in the open world ended with me having to flee after generating a literal mountain of zombie corpses. XDThere's also this day/night cycle where you get more XP at night, but it is considerably more dangerous. I rather liked it, even if your only real options are to either run as fast/stealthily as you can or funnel the zombies into a buiding with only one entrance and use that as a killzone until dawn. The latter pretty much ate through all my ammo. XDSo how is the game? It's decent. Platforming can go to hell, the main villain who is doing a bad Joker impersonation should have died in a fire instead of how he ended up dying (Spoiler: the bad guy dies), and there never was enough alcohol for my Molotovs... but it was fun. Or rather it became fun once I had leveled enough that I could buy ammo from merchants and therefore use guns regularly despite them attracting zombies. Maybe I just like violence more than running around a city scavenging for string and other parts to craft things. I'd rather use those things!As for all the online stuff, I have no clue. My internet is being a horrific pest lately and keeps dropping connection. It's really depressing. :(I think i'll play it some more, but not to do all those damned side-quests. Rather... because roaming around a city filled with the dead has it's fun moments. Woohoo violence!			"

												Excellent Game! Great story line with some good side quests. Some of the side quests are a bit tedious but nothing major. Loads of weapons you can customize to fit your needs. The coop play is fun but but some things in coop could've been done a bit better. The Be a Zombie mode is a very nice idea.Definitely worth getting with loads of hours worth of fun!!Good Night, and Good Luck!!			"

												If you enjoy Zombie, survival  and Parkour games then you'll definately enjoy Dyling Light. It's a bit of a reminder of the Left for Dead series since you can play a mode that allows you to be one of those Night time terrors that I myself prefer to stay away from unless I'm really feeling froggy. You can hack, slash, shoot, trap zombies. Heck you can kill them in so many different ways that It takes a ton of gamesplay to get bored and the Parkour abilities I think, are exhilerating. However, One downside that I found made the game not so much less enjoyable but more of a chore if you want to complete everything Is the mechanics for shooting weapons. I couldn't put my finger on it exactly but when using guns, it really didn't feel like any FPS of shooting game I've played so I had to get used to the shooting mechanics. It would prob help If you could fire guns in true FPS mode with iron sights or sights. All In all. I would give this game a 4 out 5 I would definately recommend this game. A must play!			"

												It's rammed full of issues, poor performance, crashes to the desktop a lot, the ending is terrible, but I still sunk many hours into it and fully enjoyed the main campaign when it worked without crashing.While I'm giving it a thumbs up, this is mainly in the hopes that performance will get sorted, and that a decent story DLC will make me forget the main campaigns poor ending.Full review here: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/dying-light-reviewed-on-linux-what-i-really-think.5231/ "

												You can read the full written review I did with TechRaptor here: http://techraptor.net/content/dying-light-review-dead-island-plusAn Improvement on the Dead Island formula thanks to additions of parkour and organic moments, but won't reinvent the open world zombie genre. It was a fun time but lost traction towards the end of the game, but the Improvements made with the parkour system are critical and made the game that much more enjoyable throughout the experience. With mods available now, it can only go further. It's a game to pick up at half off most definitely, but not entirely necessary to drop everything you're doing to get it. Great, but flawed.			"

												What I was hoping for from Dead Island, one of 2015's nice surprises. Wasn't expecting much but the creepy atmosphere mixed with the awesome parkour really come together nicely in this game. The graphics are also very nice, it controls well and the amount of loot around is huge to.If you want a zombie game with some nice frights, coop and wonderful parkour, check this out. Mirrors Edge mixed with a much improved Dead Island pretty much. The story could be better, along with the dialogue, but there is some interesting characters here. Far from perfect but alot better than Dead Island was.			"

The game itself was great, but these fast paced running games will always be a pain in my♥♥♥♥♥  I died more than I probably should have and cursed up a storm because if it, but in the end it was worth the playthrough.  Still worth a pickup, but not at full price for someone like me who struggles with some of the parkour style games.

												When I first got Dying Light earlier this year, I only played for a 30-60 minutes and left the game to  be played no more. But then one summer I got so bored I decided to play it again and give it a chance.To be honest, I thought playing Dying Light would be boring, and that the storyline would be quick. But i was wrong. Give itself time and you will start to love playing it. I would say boring because I thought the game would only take place in the same map, but after progressing well into the game, there's a transition where you would battle yourself with infected and human beings alike until you get into the affluent part of Harran. That got me by surprise and made me love Dyling Light even more. If not for sleep, I would be playing 24/7. Also, there are so much sidequests, I think you will have plenty of ways to enjoy and not get sick of playing this game. 5/7			"

												Upon my first steps in Dying Light I am impressed. The storyline is a bit dull and generic but I think most of us expected that if it was anything like Dead Island. The game runs silky smooth but thats not to say you will not need decent hardware to run it, this game is a graphical powerhouse and you will need a good setup but assuming you have the hardware you shouldn't run into many gameplay issues. The city is beautiful, the layout is great for parkour and has a really wonderful sense of chaos and beauty. The quests are entertaining but from what I've seen so far there are not many memorable characters. Overall I feel the game is worth it, if you were a fan of Dead Island you will most likely enjoy this.8/10			"

Dead CoolWhether their Romero “shamblers” or Dawn of the Dead (2004) “sprinters”, there’s just something cool about zombies which elevates them above all other B-Movie monsters. They’re human, they used to be us and that thought is as scary as hell.An Outbreak starts with just one infected but their numbers continue to grow as ours diminish, if we get bitten, we’ll turn ourselves.It’s such a perfect apocalyptic scenario and one which is happily experiencing a renaissance at the moment.The Rise of the ZombiesFrom reality TV shows to block buster movies, Video games to survival manuals, zombie pop culture is everywhere these days and I love it.I’ve seen all the movies, I’ve watched all the TV shows, I’ve played most of the games, I’m a consumer of all things zombie (although, should the opportunity arise, don’t actually consume a zombie, it’ll only end badly for you.)Morning has BrokenI’ve also put a lot of thought into what actions I would take should I open my curtains one morning to find the zombie apocalypse taking place on my front lawn.Amongst all my plans of stockpiling Pot Noodles and keeping a bucket in the attic to poo in, I’ve never considered that being skilled in the art of parkour might be a useful survival trait; at least I hadn’t considered it until very recently when I stumbled upon my latest piece of zombie content to consume.Apocalypse All Over AgainYou remember the first Dead Island game? It was pretty good right? Well the fine folks at Techland have released another tasty undead treat into the world, a stealthy, action, parkour, survival zombie treat in the form of Dying Light.City of the DeadIn Dying Light the undead plague has emerged, but the powers that be have responded quickly and contained it to a small area, the fictional city of Harran.Quarantined off from the rest of the world and relying on vital air drops courtesy of the Global Relief Effort, the situation inside the city continues to deteriorate, and if HBO’s The Walking Dead has taught us anything, it’s that you don’t just need to worry about the undead, other groups of survivors can be for more deadly.This rings true in Dying Light as a gang mentality has gripped the crumbling city of Harran where two prominent groups are vying for supplies whilst struggling to survive the undead, but all is not lost...Keep Taking the PillsWhilst there isn’t a cure, there is a medicine (Antizen) that the infected can take which delays the turning, as long as they keep taking Antizen they’ll be ok, however the only source of this medication comes from the supply planes flying relief missions over the city.Going DownThe game opens with your character preparing to parachute into Harran whilst receiving instructions from his employer over a radio; it seems that there is a survivor in the city that holds some very sensitive information, information which cannot be made public and it’s your job to retrieve it.You’ll then find yourself falling through the sky towards the infested city, but things don’t start off well at all!A hard landing and an encounter with the locals (both the alive and dead varieties) later and you’ll be bitten, infected and dragged to the first safe zone of the game. This is where you man hunt truly begins.Running ManFrom this point you’ll be meeting new characters and trying to earn their trust by running missions for them, and I literally mean running, the big thing that sets Dying Light apart from the Dead Island titles is the “Free Running” game mechanic.You’ll be tearing across roof tops, leaping alleyways and scaling the sides of buildings.The safest way to stay alive in Harran is to stay off the ground; a casual walk down the street will see you surrounded and overwhelmed by zombies quicker than you can say “Assassins Creed of the Dead”.Long JumpIn the increasingly crowded zombie gaming genre this parkour style of play is hugely refreshing and better still it is exceptionally well implemented.With a gamepad in hand, you’ll find the controls are really dialled in, look where you want to go, hit the jump button and there’s a good chance you’ll make it, it’s not only intuitive, it makes you feel like a free running bad♥♥♥♥♥Do me a Favour?The missions themselves are the usual mix of “go there”, “kill that” and “fetch this” quests that we know and love, completion of which will give you the experience you’ll need to level up your various abilities enabling you to hit a little harder and jump a little further, you might even learn some new skills along the way.Be CraftyDying Light also boasts a pretty deep crafting system. You’ll be rummaging through bins and patting down corpses like a perverted Womble looking for the things that every day folk leave behind.There are plenty of crafting recipes to learn, from Med Kits to Molotov’s there’s a plethora of useful items and weapons just waiting for your crafty hands to bring them into existence.I can’t overstate how useful a well placed Molotov is when you’re in a tight spot.Zombie FarmAll zombies are not born equal in Dying Light, the recently infected will move a hell of lot quicker than the common stale variety of zombie you’ll see shambling around.You’ll discover zombies that spit, zombies that explode, radioactive zombies in hazmat suits, and plenty of others, Hazmat is a dangerous place to explore at any time of day.The Dead of NightBut at night, that’s when things really become scary. The whole atmosphere of the game changes when night falls, it’s much tenser and you really want to stay out of site, stealthily moving from one secluded spot to another. You really don’t want to attract any attention at night.There are super fast zombies lurking in the darkness and you’re going to have trouble outrunning them. The pitch dark makes your parkour aerobatics much more difficult to pull off as you rush through the streets, the feeble pool of light from your torch dancing along the landscape in front of you.Sleep It OffBeing outside at night is a serious business, but you do have the option to sleep through the night in a safe zone if it all becomes a little too much, although some missions will require you to go out at night, there’s no avoiding it completelyDead PrettyIn addition to the daytime being slightly less stressful, being out in the sunlight gives you a chance to drink in the scenery, the city of Harran can be a visually stunning place to explore.From the sun bleached rooftops to the ominous darkness of the underpasses, everything about Harran exudes atmosphere, the whole city feels alive, which is no easy feat for a city full of the dead!Dead EndIf the Dead Island games were the warm up act then Dying Light is the main event.With  glossy visuals, satisfying combat mechanics and an outstanding parkour system, Dying Light is a fantastic game and the city of Harran is a beautifully realised setting begging to be explored. You should take the time to visit, just don't go for the night life, it's dead.For the full review and others please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/ "

Posted: February 6, 2015
												Well I just finished the game and it was quite a ride.  One of my biggest complaints about most zombie based games is that the stories are usually pretty weak, and a lot of this has to do to the necessity for co-op experiences. Dying Light has one of the best single player campaigns (although you can certainly play co-op) I have ever played and much of that is you become Kyle Crane, a GRE operative tasked with recovering a stolen file regarding the viral outbreak in Harran.  The main missions guide you through quite a few individual missions, each one advancing the story. The story is quite good as you keep wanting to see more but you also have a plethora of side missions helping other survivors in many different ways. The mission design for both main and side missions is so varied that I don't think any really felt the same.  And best yet, you really feel like you are helping the survivors when you complete these missions, as many of them sound like realistic requests during a fragile fight for survival.The comparisons of a cross between Dead Island and Mirror's Edge is not far off.  The parkour elements really shine in this game, and as you level up your agility you get access to more and more abilities that make you even better. It's quite a rush to run full flight jumping from rooftop to rooftop, executing quick climb and jump moves, and sliding under low hanging obstacles.  The combat feels very much like Dead Island with a crafting system and modification system very similar. You must collect blueprints to expand your crafting and modification options; many become available as you spend survival points (which is mostly gained by completing missions or returning supply drops), or by finding blueprints in the world or by completing side missions or protection missions.  Your combat ability is handled via power points, which are gained by hitting infected and killing them in a myriad of ways. Spending power points gives you access to different combat abilities like power swing, whirlwind with two-handed weapons, and death from above which impales an enemy when you are above them.  During daytime the game can be challenging as there are a lot of different special infected much like Dead Island. Come nighttime though, and all bets are off.  The game becomes more of a stealth game as you try to avoid volatiles, the most powerful infected in the game.  Early on you have no chance of killing one of these but as you reach higher levels and get access to better weapons with super modifications you can end up killing them in one power swing. The problem is, attacking a volatile or being seen by one immediately alerts every other volatile in the immediate vicinity. The speed that these volatiles close in on you and pummel you to death is astonishing. You may wonder why bother playing during the night as you can just sleep at any safehouse until the morning. Some missions require you to do them at night like the early one where you have to restore the full power grid at three substations. The other reason is all power and agility xp is doubled at night, which really makes a difference as I found agility to be lagging behind survivor and power xp.  Also, the longer you survive at night the more bonus survivor points you will get once morning comes. I found I rarely ended up sleeping until morning, preferring to maneuver myself to specific locations by jumping between safehouses, trying to stay unnoticed by the volatiles but occasionally alerting them and booking it while throwing UV flares to slow the pursuit down.Overall, this was a fantastic game that was so fun it was hard to put down.  There are a few framerate issues where the FPS would drop to the single digits for 10-15 seconds until eventually clearing up. The graphics are gorgeous, the animations fluid, and the gameplay top-notch.  The game works well with both keyboard/mouse and gamepad. I played with a gamepad mostly because 90% of the time you are fighting with melee weapons and I like the feel of the gamepad in that manner. If you like action/adventure games with good stories, a plethora of gameplay options, and the freedom to do what you want in the order you want, then I highly recommend this game. It's worth it at full price.			"

Basically everything Dead Island wanted to be, with parkour, more impactful melee, and guns that actually feel like guns. With an incredibly fun and tense PvP gamemode that puts you on the edge of your seat, with the chance of you dying due to a simple mistake rising with every breath you take. The final boss is a bit lackluster, but Im guessing that they only made it the way it is so you wont ♥♥♥♥ing destroy him with late-game weapons and skills. This game is the first in a long time to truly impress me, and I hope the incoming DLC keeps the fun going!			"

												This was a great survival-horror experience.  I have completed the story to its fullest; here's my opinion.The graphics were a marvel if you have the system to run it at higher settings but the optimization quality here is sadly subpar as the ""View Distance"" slider was the only true catalyst for a better or worse framerate.  Even with the view distance set at just below the halfway mark, there would be a rare occurence of HORRENDOUS frame drops.  I have no idea why these occured as I have been in rooms with about 40 zombies in this game without an issue and has about 4 occasions where the game dipped to about 10fps during a grapple sequence.  Yes, 10fps.  Really took me out of the experience.  Besides these issues, the city is gorgeous.  The world is littered with cars, debris, gore, the undead, and still manages to look beautiful (especially in ""Old Town,"" unlocked about halfway through the story) with its tall buildings  and the sense that this was once a thriving, elegant city.  The voice acting was pretty good all around but it had its weak moments with a couple of side characters.  And the sound.  The sound in this game is sure to immerse you as the undead growl from a distance, each melee connects with a satisfying crunch, the slight sound of wind as you parkour your way up rooftops and through safe zones, and quite frankly I enjoyed the sound immensely.  This is all backed up with a pretty good story.  I actually had a motivation to continue with the story and did very few side quests throughout my time with it.  I only really developed a slight connection with one character besides the protagonist but I wasn't fond of the villian.  There are a couple of boss fights.  They give you a good arena to battle and offer a good challenge, but one of them feels unfair when the enemy is able to throw axes THROUGH walls.  Luckily, it wasnt enough to kill me, but it was mildly infuriating that he was able to defy the laws of physics to damage me.  The conclusion to the game was more or less satisfying, as what you expected to be an epic boss battle turned out to be a quick time event.  As to avoid spoilers, thats all I have to say about that.  Now the gameplay.  This game has extremely addicting melee combat.  It does start off slow with the weak weapons and the whole take-8-hits-to-take-out-a-single-zombie-for-the-first-4-hours bit, but once you get going the game gives you a great sense of progression.  You'll start seeing zombies being dispatched more quickly, an abundance of arms flying to your left and right, and finish each fight off with a well-placed swing to the neck and watch the heads roll.  There's a variety of weapons, whether your busting heads into pieces with pipes or sledgehammers or simply decapitating the undead with a sickle or a machete.  The ragdoll physics are quite entertaining, too.  I found myself dropkicking a LOT of zombies off of rooftops because its just so enjoyable to watch them spin and distort themselves before inevitably landing headfirst into the concrete 50 feet below, leaving chunks of brain spewing all around them.  Another core element of gameplay is the parkour.  People have referred to this game as Mirror's Edge+ Dead Island, and for good reason.  Navigating the rooftops is a breeze and I've only had a few moments where I couldn't climb a wall I previously thought was possible to scale.  You can jump quite far, too.  I kept asking ""Can I actually make that jump?""  Yes, I could make that jump.  The last major element to the gameplay is the day and night cycle.  During the day, the zombies are really just wandering the streets with no real goal in mind until you confront them.  Still, they can overwhelm you in numbers, especially when a viral is among their ranks.  A viral is just a fresh infected-you'll hear a human voice go ""Please"" or ""Stop"" as you bash their heads in.  It adds a layer of humanity to the game, and you almost feel bad for having to put them down.  It is a necessity to as virals run at a faster speed than even you and can climb buildings.  They also appear during the night.  The night is absolutely terrifying in my opinion.  I have the sense that every zombie is looking for me and only me.  The elite zombies, or Volatiles, are a higher mutation of the normal zombies and essentially cant be killed unless you have an ultraviolet flashlight on hand, which really only stuns them.  The night almost completely switches all of your gears to stealth.  You do not want to be caught in the line of sight of a Volatile or a Viral, and even a normal zombie is tougher during these hours.  Unless you have a mission, your best bet is to flip on that flashlight and navigate your way to the nearest safezone; most of which have to be liberated, so make sure you are close to one or you'll have an experience like me where I cleared a safe zone as the night began.  What a terror-ensuing experience.  This game is quite punishing, also.  This is a good thing as most modern games are an actual walk in the park.  I enjoyed its difficulty, but I do wish there was a slider.  The game takes away experience points for dying, which I felt was a little much especially when I died from those Exploders.  Almost every single exploder I've come across, undead with inflated guts that explode when they're close enough, has killed me.  I'll just be doing a story mission and open up a door and OH GOD ITS ONE OF THOSE RUN AWA-...You are Dead.  I felt they could have limited its power as it doesn't even take out zombies as often as they take me out.  Overall, this game is a great experience because of its great visuals, though with its problems, amazing sound design, and fluid, tense, and satisfying gameplay, though unfair at times.  Smaller breakdown -Graphics - 8/10  (+Beautiful,-Frame Drops)Story - 7/10 (+Pretty Interesting,-Not much connection with cast)Sound - 10/10 (+Immersive)Gameplay - 8.5/10 (+Satisfying and Brutal and Tense,-Unfair at times)In my opinion, Dying Light is an 8/10.Really Enjoyed it.

												In my opinion it's totally worth this 50% sale if you like opwn world zombie slashing, just be sure to have a beefy enough PC to see the eye candy cause it's worth it.  In early(?) 2016 we are getting story dlc that should be massive, and combined with the main game is a great amount of content.  Skip all the rest of the dlc, trust me on that one.Note, if you're American keep an eye on indie gala.com, they often have this on sale better, but may not have the ultimate edition which at 40% is an even better deal right now.

												For those who say ""This game sucks. Not fun bla bla bla"". Jusrt play this game on coop. Play with your buddies. Then come and say something. The parkour system of this game is unbeatable.  If you are playing alone the game might not impress you to it's max level. You might play 30 hours solo at max. But when you play coop its real fun. Join the community. Meet some fellas to hook up with. Trust me it's worth it. I don't think I can play any zombie game after DL. Coz it might not get up to my satisfaction. SUPERB GAME. gg			"

												There is one word that best descibes Dying Light:  density.  Dying Light takes everything great from Dead Island and massively improves on it.At first glance, upon being let loose in the sandbox that is Dying Light, you may think the map is small.  I know that was my first impression.  As you explore the city and further the story, you find out just how large the map truly is.  About halfway through the main story line, you will open up another large city area.  The word density truly takes on meaning when you begin exploring this location.  The game opens up more and more locations, including challenge areas (sort of like dungeons in Skyrim) as the game progresses.  Interior locations are numerous, almost mind boggling at times, especially in Old Town.  There are sewers to explore as well.  Transition areas and hidden caverns also help to increase exploration time.  Old Town is really 3 maps stacked on top of each other as there are layers and layers of places to explore.  The Following expansion provides another area to explore, even larger than the main game.And explore you shall.  If you played Dead Island you remember how many times you had to loot that hard shell suitcase, which came in different colors to ""spice things up."" This became incredibly stale as your eyes became used to scanning for that same container, among just a few others.  With Dying Light, looting shouldn't get too stale as the game presents more and more ""containers"" for you to loot, such as cupboards, trash cans, crates, locked boxes, medicine cabinets, dressers, and of course the bodies of those you slay.  The game will despawn bodies after a while but will drop a ""loot package"" on the ground for you to loot when you feel safe enough to do so.Loot is numerous and the amount of melee weapons you can wield is staggering.  Just like Dead Island you can modify your weapons by attaching enhancements which increase power, stability, and or durability, as well as, elemental effects.  Speaking of durability, at first you will be annoyed with this.  I know I was.  But after a while, as you find a greater variety of weapons such as rifles and pistols, you won't have to repair nearly as many times as you did at first as your arsenal will grow.  Each melee weapon has a limited amount of durability, then it breaks.  But again, you won't grow too attached to weapons as you'll have an infinite supply of them waiting to be looted or crafted.  Yes, you can craft weapons and some of the best ones are hidden throughout the world as blueprints.  Dying Light has quite a few easter eggs and hidden locations for you to find, adding even more density to an already deep game.Gunplay is also great in Dying Light, a big improvement over Dead Island.  The rifles sound ""meaty."" I highly recommend completing Bozak's Horde though.  It's a challenge where, once completed, you receive blueprints to Bozak's Bow.  This bow is great and is better than the ones added in The Following expansion.   You can craft or buy arrows for it and you can retrieve your arrows most of the time after firing them.  Any game with bows as a weapon has my interest right off.The best way to describe what you can do in Dying Light is to compare it to GTA V.  There are so many things to do you will often get distracted and forget what you started out for.  Air drops add another layer of fun as they seem to entice you to put on hold your current task to get to them first.  I remember that at one point I was trying to sneak into an area at night, attempting to avoid nightstalkers, and an air drop was initiated not too far from me.  But in Dying Light, nights are dark, and I kept arguing with myself over whether or not going for the air drop was smart.  I decided to take off running for it and alerted the nightstalkers around me by accident.  I was almost there, I could see the airdrop.  Almost there...I popped flairs around the air drop and the nightstalkers paused for a moment, screaming and clawing at the air.  I hastily popped open the drop and looted it.  The flair went out and the nightstalkers closed in and ripped me to shreds.  Ah well.  Maybe next time.  These are the kinds of moments Dying Light can provide.  Tense, rewarding, and at times dangerous.I won't spend much time discussing the parkour element of the game as that's well known to everyone thinking about buying it.  Let's just say that the parkour/player movement in this game is leaps and bounds (pun intended) better than ANY game in its genre.  Movement is fluid once you get used to it.  Add a grappling hook, which you get later on, and I'm sold...the movement and freedom in this game is liberating and will make it hard to go back to any open world game that restricts your movement.I found the characters to be as interesting as they could be, considering the ""zombie apocolypse character archetype"" has been used to death (pun intended) with the vast amount of zombie games out there.  But, I remember all the main characters as they are engaging and sometimes funny enough to be remembered.  Many other reviwers have commented that the characters and story are boring.  I haven't found them to be so at all.  The voice acting is well done and varied enough to keep you engaged.  As you explore the city, you'll encounter survivors that are there saveable but some that are just waiting to tell you their story, adding to the lore of the game.  It's touches like this that make a world feel as engaging as this one does.I have yet to finish the story as I am having so much fun playing in this sandbox.  Perhaps I never will finish the story.  If that becomes the case, I won't feel cheated at all because it will have been my choice to just roam, kill zeds, loot, and explore to my heart's content.Zombies are not difficult by themeselves.  But, Dying Light's dense environments provide so many spots for zombies to hide that you can't ever get too comfortable.  Loot that extra box at your peril.  Killing zeds is extremely satisfying.  Sometimes I find myself snapping out of a 30 minute 'kill fest"" where I swear I was in a Kill Bill scene.  Speaking of Kill Bill, you can use a katana in Dying Light!Overall, I can truthfully say that Dying Light, plus its recent expansion called The Following, has and will continue to provide more return for my money than the last 5 games I've bought on Steam.  The possibilities with this game are endless and when you add seamless multiplayer/coop to this discussion, you can see why Dying Light is worth the asking price if you like zombie or open world, ""do whatever you want"" type games.  If you're a gamer that likes to take your time, explore, loot, get distracted, etc. then I wouldn't be surprised if it provides you with 500+ hours of play time.  I highly recommend this game and the season pass which includes all DLC.10/10			"

												I am almost in 50 hours so now I think can write a honest review and share my experienceFirst of all if you like zombie genre and are on the fence about Dying Light just BUY IT right now without any hesitation.Dying Light is a great game and one of the best games if you consider it only along zombie genre.1)The Atmosphere is totally nailed on this game. Totally feels like a post apocalypse zombie from the moment you enter the game.2)Graphics are top notch and totally next gen3)Melee combat is frustrating at the start but as you progress further and craft better weapons it becomes the best thing to play with4)Parkour System has been introduced first time in a zombie game and it gives this game a totally a new dimension and makes it unique5)Day and night Cycle provides its own fun.In the morning you would run to complete challenges,kill zombies, but in night you will be hiding scared,dreading to come in night zombies contact which leads to some very intense chases and moments6)MAIN Protagonist is a likable character and has a dope voice(lol)The only con I can think of in this game is Its Main story is a bit cheesy and uninteresting.The side characters dont help the cause as they are totally one dimensional with no emotional value(well in a zombie game most people wont give a f##k about that)If you are not interested or bored in the zombie genre and are thinking about this game. Let me tell you will be disappointed not cause its not a good game Its a ""Great game"" but it does not revolutionise or brings new features or  breathes a new lease of life in overpopulated zombie genre. Its just Dead Island done right To all casual gamers surely buy this game and ask your buddy to do the same cause its most enjoyable in COOP Overall Rating 9/10Good Night Good Luck  😎			"

												After 100+ hours on this game, I feel I have played enough to write a solid review. I preordered this game about 3 months prior to release and was able to play the game on day 1. After watching trailers and gameplay I was super hyped for this game (I am a huge zombies fan in general).  On day 1 as you can probably imagine the game had some optimization issues and ran very poorly for all the people using AMD hardware. These issues were resolved about 3 weeks later and as of right now this game runs very smoothly and consistently if you have a GTX 960 or higher. Visually this game looks amazing and the developers did a fantastic job with the graphics (the Chrome Engine 6 is stunningly beautiful if your hardware can drive it), something I always appreciate being a graphics fanatic. I played around 60 hours in the month of January, finished the game, and absolutley loved it. Not every game keeps me interested from start to finish the way this game did. Now for those of you wanting a comparison between this game and Dead Island. This game is a HUGE improvement. The 4 player co-op is perfectly done and actually allows you to play through every mission (INCLUDING THE MAIN STORY), together with your friends. Another awesome addition is the Terrifying Day/Night cycle where the deadly volatiles come out and make even the best weapons seem like plastic. At some point you will find yourself outside as the sun goes down and the city becomes completely dark. then all you are left with is your flashlight and however far you have to run to get to a safehouse. The thrill of getting chased by Volatiles in the dark while running for your life is quite exhilarating. If you are looking for the best co-op zombie game to play with your friends, this is it, Period. Although the storyline is quite predictable and ends with a somewhat displeasing boss fight at the end; it is pretty irrelevant in the grand scheme of this game, the game has Tons of other side quests for you to complete, most are rewarding and enable you to get some kick *** weapon upgrade or blueprint. The game is extrememely fun to just mess around in and have fun with your friends and there are many easter eggs and craftable items which enable you to keep making your character more and more OP and awesome. After 60 hours in January I have recently Racked up another 40 in the past 2 weeks after I found out about all the blueprints and easter eggs there are to complete (all 40 hours spent playing with friends and people I met playing Dying Light). I must take a quick moment to mention how gratifying it is for me to kill a zombie in this game. Not even Dead Island has as good animations as this game does for executing zombies. I can literally drop kick a zombie to the ground, run at it, cut its arms off, throw a knife in its head, cut its head off, knock it to the ground again, cut its arms and legs off, kick the body away leaving the body parts scattered 10 feet from each other, and then burn the remains. Now that might have sounded gory to some of you...but for those of you sick of playing COD zombies and only being able to shoot a zombie in the head...well..you can probably guess why killing zombies in this game is Nothing short of amazing.Lastly I have to mention the Parkour and open world of this game. I have never played a game with such a fun parkour system as this. I can literally entertain myself for hours just having races from one side of the city to the other with friends; Jumping over rooftops and getting creeped by those moments when your ""Not sure if your gonna be able to make the jump to the other building"". The parkour system in this game is designed perfectly and surprisingly I can say that I have never encountered any glitches when jumping around and climbing walls where I fall unexpectedly.Bottom line, it's the best zombie game out there and the best game of the year for me. It will be interesting to see how Dead Island 2 compares to this game when its released.			"

												This game is really what we should expect from a AAA title these days. Very addicting and fun gameplay. A lot of cool mechanics involved and as far as I can tell, there are no major bugs/crashes apparent. Neat story as well. One thing I might add is the game is a bit unoptimized in its current state so if you have a lower end system, you may want to hold out until further patches or just play it on a console. Great fun though, definitely recommend this :)EDIT - Optimization update came out so since then it's been running like a dime. Max settings and 60fps<			"

												Dying Light is a first rate, first person game in an apocalyptic city overrun with zombies. The variety of melee weapons and monsters, along with some genuinely creepy settings (repeatable quests are spooky!), make this one a real winner. The distinctive of DL, besides it's quality of production, is the addition of massive quantities of parkour. As a rule, I don't like jumping games, and I never got totally great at it in DL, but there are some acrophobic thrills in this game that'll make your blood run cold. I don't know if any other game has tempted my fear of heights like this one. Your capacity to climb and leap is superhuman, but not fantastically so. The only place parjour really annoyed me was on the cliffs. I realize the developers may have wanted to create some limits and bottlenecks, but it is frustrating to have your parkour, and grapple, simply not work sometimes because you're not supposed to go over this particular cliff rock here...More serious than the Dead Rising series, DL does have crafting, but you won't find any electrified rakes here. You also, although heroic and epic often, you will not be plowing down hundreds of zeds at a time. Taking on a stack of 10 will require maneuver and savvy, even with a good weapon. In a standard of the genre, one on one they are weak -- but in packs, can be dangerous. (Not to mention the really big ones.) The story is deep, more serious than many other zombie first person games, and you may find yourself caring about some of your NPC colleagues, although -- for an open world situation -- you are limited in how you can engage them. The dialogs are story driven, so you won't be getting married, bringing allies with you into battle, etc. This is not zombie Skyrim. The difficulty curve is somewhat steep as you get started, with the early weapons lame enough you'll find yourself tapping on a single zed many times before they fall over. If you've got friends who are able to give you some good weapons early, it will change the difficulty dramatically. Get a weapon that does several hundred damage, you'll see slo-mo swaths as you cleave a zed, or multiple zeds, in every stroke with pieces flying in multiple directions. In DL, as your survivor score goes up, the (melee) weapons you find do also. One of the really nice features is when someone opens a box or vehicle in this game, every member of the party gets to draw something out. The boss fights in DL are not great, but there aren't a bunch of them -- by far the majority of the action is within the normal systems of the game, which are excellent. But, as off tactic as some of the boss fights are, I did find myself caring about what happened in them. That shows the effectiveness of the story, the dialogs, the characterizations, and the settings. In summary, if you like zombies, this is a can't miss. I'm still waiting for the day I can play a PC zombie game where you can recruit friends and allies, build realistic forts, and build resources for a community. But, DL does the low intensity thing very well, and the parkour thing was an unexpected add-on for this genre. This game will have you holding your breath sometimes, as when you face a Demolisher, or get caught out at night, or run out of med kits, or scale the side of the bridge. Those thrills are authentic and a credit to the game and the genre. DL also allows you to mow down a lot of zeds and feel proud of yourself. Enjoy!			"

												Dying Light plus The Following (expansion) are what Dead Island and its expansion promised to be but weren't. Techland managed to keep what little good features Dead Island had and improve them by bringing them over to the spiritual successor. Before I go into the endless bashing of Dead Island (the premise is nice but the execution was awful), lets stick to what makes Dying Light a great zombie game.Unlike your run of the mill zombie games, Dying Light regular zombies are not your average slow-moving-arm-flailing-brain-hungry humanoids, wanting nothing more than to land on your bullets or melee weapons. They are scary, they are numerous and they will try to kill you. Their most important quality is numbers however. They'll plentiful and since melee weapons degrade and guns create noise which will attract the improved Virals (think of 28 days later fast zombies) , going into a square with 100 of them is not the best course of action.Dying Light creates a very good atmosphere where you're not just a guns blazing supersoldier going on a bloody rampage against anyone who stands in your way. You're a survivor and you need to survive. That means getting resources, spending them wisely, sleeping the night off or even fight through the night for some extra XP. The game manages to convey the feeling of helplessness into the player in a beautiful tone.There's a variety of special enemies, the most formidable being the so called Volatiles, disfigured monsters of the night who will chase you relentlessly throughout Harran (the city in which the vanilla game takes place).The game's strongpoint is the parkour mechanics. Future games will most likely begin to incorporate this 'new' feature and nothing would be better than game developers taking notes on how Dying Light manages to do freerunning justice. It's super easy to learn, to control, very responsive to your actions, and adds a brilliant way to make perfect use of your environment. I've played game with freerunning mechanics before and nothing comes close to Dying Light's system. Admittedly the grappling hook is a little buggy sometimes, but it's a small price to pay for an otherwise excellent system. Every rooftop, every lamp-post, even corner of a building can be your haven, your battlefield or your grave. Absolutely astounding and it carries over into the Following as well although in a much less degree due to the addition of the buggy.The game features an XP system, in 3 categories (5 with the Enhanced Edition/The Following), which include your fighting skill, your survival and your agility (running&climbing). XP is earned by doing quests (the game features a lot of sidequests with their own mini arcs and characters, ranging from being a little bit on the funny side, to some being just depressing), killing enemies, running and climbing buildings and collecting resources from airdrops. The day/night feature of the game, allows you to get double XP during night, however during night the Volatiles will appears to make your life a living hell. There's a smooth transition between day and night and you will adapt your strategy accordingly.However Dying Light is not without its faults. Guns feel pretty weak and are very limited (vanilla game) however in The Following they were improved dramatically, doing more damage and having more guns to choose from. If you plan on playing Multiplayer co-op with friends, be adviced that the final mission of the game can only be played solo. Why was that a thing? Completely pointless, I mean I can sort of understand due to the reason that the ending of the game falls unfortunately into the dreadful category of QTE(quick time events). Why oh why did you ruin an otherwise good story, with a QTE near the end I'll never understand. And of course, if you're playing with friends, you better disconnect and finish the game on your own, cause the game won't allow you to do it in coop. Big disappointment.The Following is the sequel of the story of the original game. You play in the outskirt farmlands of Harran, where you meet a different set characters. The most important feature is the addition of a the buggy.The buggy feels like a foreign element in the Dying Light world. You do less parkour and use it for transportation since The Following takes place in open rural area with few buildings. There's still plenty of freerunning in The Following, but less than the original game.The Following adds two more extra trees to gain XP in, driving and Legend levels. Driving can be maxed very easily and very quickly just by running enemies over and the Legend levels include passive bonuses on your characters.Don't get me wrong, the Following a pretty solid addition to the game, adds around 20-30 hours of gameplay and it's definitely worth its money.At the same time however, some of the characters feel more shallow than the ones in the vanilla game but the worst offender is the story of the game and its absurd ending. No spoilers but the ending was bad. Like really bad. Mass Effect 3 bad. And of course you cannot finish it in a Multiplayer session with friends. You gotta do it solo. Again...There's no real villain in the Following. The story feels kinda rushed, some things are unexplained or just make no sense within the story of the game and the ending features a deus ex machina which has no real connection to anything you'll encounter in the vanilla game and the expansion.Long story short: Dying Light: The Following - Enhanced Edition is well worth its money and its a definite recommendation for people who feel a little bit of ""zombie-game fatigue"". It's mechanics are great, it has a pretty decent story (up until the ending of the Following), it looks pretty good, it sounds pretty good, it's very immersive in its atmosphere and you can play it with friends! (up until the final mission). Not without its flaws but the gameplay outshines almost everything.			"

												(This review is for both the game and The Following DLC)Personally I had a blast playing this game with my friends and it provided me with many hours of entertainment. While the story isn't bad by any means it did feel a bit lacking at certain points, but for me personally the very smooth and fluid gameplay, open world, and visuals definitely made up for it.I'd also advise that you pick up The Following Expansion if you plan to buy this game. It expands upon the story of the base game and offers an entire new map, new zombie types, and even a vehicle which can be fully upgraded.Overall I'd reccomend this to anyone who enjoys open world games.

												EDIT: I have played this game on PS4 for 20+ hours prior to this review. Dying Light is a breath of fresh air, in this landfill of games that copy one another. If you enjoyed the likes of Dead Island, or similar games, you will be right at home with this game, but be wary, there are major differences between the two. The parkour mechanics are very reminiscent of EA's 2008 cult classic, Mirror's Edge. The combat system can be clunky at times, and it is easy to get flustered especially in the early hours of the game; Upgrading weapons is highly recomended if you plan to survive in the late game. Now to talk about what makes this game special. The day and night cycle. During the day, the zombies are your adverage infected that you have seen before, plus a few special infected types.Night time is when things get interesting. A new, fast, and very powerful infected type come out during the dark. Best bet is to always have flares and firecrackers.In conclusion, this game does have a few bugs, but they aren't substantial enough to cause a drop in score. Final verdict: 9/10.   It has been a while since a game has exceeded my expectations on launch day.			"

												Why. The hell. Do games insist. In QTE. Final boss fights?The combat was great, the movement was great, the weapons felt great.Final confrontation? Everything taken away, the gameplay, the movement, the weapons, the cover, the terrain.The damn QTE prompts didn't change and were so damn sudden and expired so quick that it turned into a freaking SIMON emulator.Story? Rather predictable, even for a zombie apocalypse.Now, all that aside, everything between the tutorial and the final boss was thoroughly enjoyable, save for the clever invader that was just too damn hard to kill.--Side note. I will never understand who thought it would be a good idea to give someone a one-hit-kill attack and an invulnerability shield...Final word.I challenge you to find a zombie on a cliff and not laugh as you dropkick it down the side.

												Cool game. Highly recommended.It's a fast game, you are pushed by time so no time looking for all secret places you have a duty.Anyway if you do that you have to do it by highly 'Parkour' skills unless you will die. That makes game extremely crazy. It's not like hit and run. It's - always run ;)Graphics is very rich so it makes game reality look unlimited. We'll see how much I can get from it. Good luck - sleep well.			"

												Decided to change my review to a more serious one, because why not.Pros:-The resilience of the zombies: I distinctly remember setting a zombie on fire with a fire weapon. It was still walking around so I decided to cut it's head off. (It was technically dead by this point) It was still walking around after that so I decided to cut it in half. The torso was still on fire and walking around so I decided to cut the legs off. It wiggled around for a few more seconds and then finally died. So much for putting things out of their misery.-The side quests: They can be very fun to play, but they actually have some good  twists in their own story, and they sometimes foreshadow what is going to happen next in the main story quests-The atmosphere: Harran feels very much like a dead city. Flaming cars, occasional screams, hordes of zombies everywhere, and even dead silence-Mods: One of the few AAA games I can think of that actively encourages modding of the game. There's already a lot of custom maps for the game in the Steam Workshop, including a couple that parallel Techland's work in terms of quality, and there's the possibility for other kinds of mods further down the line (ex. new weapons, blueprints)-Night time: Techland isn't♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥around when they say ""Good night, good luck"". The game changes from a zombie slasher to full-on horror once the lights go out. Predators called Volatiles come out only at night, they are nearly impossible to kill, are very fast, and can often kill you with a single hit.-Hard mode: Some people complain that the game becomes too easy towards the ending half, this fixes that. ""Survivor sense"" is limited to seeing Volatiles through walls at night, normal zombies become much more damaging (killing in just 2-3 hits), medikits do not regen your health instantly, and certain items become harder to find. This mode addresses most of the issues I list in the ""contriversial"" section-Game looks pretty good graphically: Very good textures, amazing foliage, and nicely detailed weapons. Apparently the lighting is based on physics, I don't know what that means but it looks beautiful-Pack mentality of the zombies: If you kill one zombie, there will probably be two or three more that come around a corner and try to eat you-Uniquely balanced firearms: Sure, you can use a pistol to kill that zombie, but there will be a group of Virals (fast zombies) that will come for you almost immediately-Surprisingly tactical melee combat especially when facing other survivors: The enemy survivors are very, very smart. They can block your hits, dodge them, kick you, dodge your kicks, throw knives at you, and knock the knives you throw at them out of the air (but you can do all of that, too). This requires you to time your attacks well since they can beat you to death very easily if you only try to attack-The physics in the game are amazing: For some reason Techland decided to add actual weight and momentum to your player. This means you can jump from the roof of a van, land on a zombie, and you will crush it under your own weight, leaving it's head vulnerable so you can beat it in with a gas pipe. Also, you can dropkick a zombie into a car, and if it hits headfirst, it will die.-The map design: Techland has designed certain subtle paths for parkour you can take, which flow very naturallyControversial (aka some people hate it, some like it):-The way the weapons hit enemies: It seems like Techland decided to treat the weapon in your hand as an actual physical object with weight and force. This means that all weapons in the game feel REALLY, REALLY GOOD. A blunt weapon will likely stop in it's place when it hits an enemy, which feels realistic and pretty brutal when you're trying to bash a zombie's head in when it's laying on the ground. If the game triggers slow motion, you can sweep the camera around, and hit other zombies in that sweep without touching the mouse button. However, this has a bad side effect - if you have a weak weapon like a pipe and there's an enemy standing to the right of an enemy you want to hit, the weapon will likely bounce off of the enemy on the right and will not touch the enemy you want to hit, which can be very frustrating.-The parkour system: People have praised the parkour system as the best of the new generation so far. However, I feel like there are some problems with it very similar to the problems that most parkour systems have, like things you should be able to grab onto, but can't. Trying to grab onto something below you is a HUGE pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ usually it ends up with you flying off, then mashing the spacebar trying to grab on again. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Usually you don't end up where you wanted to go. However, in just about every other movement, it feels pretty natural and flows nicely.-The damage the weapons do towards the end of the game: You start the game off with a pipe for a weapon. It does 24 damage. You will likely end the game with a katana/machete/longsword/shotgun. These things do upwards of 1000 damage. The enemies' health do not scale to the weapons you have, so, you can just slice through hundreds of infected with no problem, and can even kill Volatiles with just a few hits. However, this doesn't compromise the way the weapons feel. Somehow, the weapons still stay incredibly satisfying throughout the entire game.-The plot: The antagonist is pretty cliche, he's someone from the Middle East who is terrorizing the people of Harran during the infection. The guy you play is pretty cliche as well, he's an American who just happens to be really good at parkour as well as killing zombies, even though he's never done either of those things before. However, outside the rivalry, the plot does take some interesting twists and turns, questioning the morality of the ""greater good"" and whether or not Rais (the antagonist) is really your enemy.Cons:-The motion blur is overused: It looks like Techland decided to put motion blur on literally everything. This makes it very hard to appreciate the graphical beauty of the game with it on.-Some enemies are almost impossible to kill without taking damage: There's a strong enemy with a giant piece of rebar in the game. His main attack is hitting the rebar on the ground, which creates a shockwave that takes away most of your health. 30% of the way through the game, the size of that shockwave doubles. Before, you could easily dodge out of the way, now, it is close to impossible.-The controls for throwing/grappling an enemy are very awkward: Alt & W/A/S/D at the same time. I'll let you try that one.			"

												A nice decent story with plenty of sidequest and a lot of content that make for a lengthy playthrough.  A big world with plenty to explore with lots of shenanigans to engage in. Exploration is rewarded with unique craftable blueprints you wont find if you ignore searching every nook and cranny and just complete the main game. A nice dificulty curve, that actually makes you fear going out at night, at least until you level up a good amount. Great attention to detail in the world despite being a bland setting. Melee system and Parkour mechanics works perfectly. Animations are nice and smooth. One of the few games today that justify its price point. Totally satisfied with the game and thats more than I can say for most games today. Great game.			"

												Sans être parfait, Dying Light remplit indéniablement ses objectifs. Mêlant de manière naturelle du Dead Island, du Mirror's Edge et du Far Cry, il propose crafting, exploration, parkour et action avec beaucoup d'adresse. Et de sensations fortes, dont une peur qui s'installe implacablement une fois la nuit tombée. Le tout se révélant jouable à plusieurs, il est taillé pour satisfaire un public très large, quand bien même quelques erreurs de jeunesse l'empêchent d'atteindre son plein potentiel.

The parkour is really smooth, the violence is fun, and the horror bits are mostly successful. The plot is absolute garbage, and the parts where the game are completely plot-driven are as boring as they are poorly written, but those parts are short.Point is, it's got multiplayer.			"

												Graphics, visual design and possibility of cooperative playthrough make this game AAA coop blockbuster. If you want to play this game alone - it is far from such a perfection so better play with someone.Gameplay, combat and parkour are pretty repetitive. Interesting for first few days but then you will get tired of it. Even after you adapt and learn perks: regular jams in textures, grabs for 'wrong' obstacles, inability to make jumps at certain angles in proximity to objects will occur. I really miss something in every aspect of the game: running is worse than in ""Mirror's Edge"", combat feedback worse than in ""Condemned"", script... well... 'obviously simple', tons of similar boring quests and placeholder-music. Call your friends, take a bow or a shotgun and enjoyment will happen. But remember this game is very far from masterpiece, you'll need a lot of patience to make it to the final.			"

												StoryLine: 9\10The story line is wonderful, Most of the missons are almost repetitive in the beginning ""run over here, run over there, Climb this, Get this"" But those were the missions to get you used to the controls and overall feel for the game, Don't let this beginning critique change your mind on buying cause this came continues to amaze me with its vast explorationand can keep me playing for hours, And once the story actually started developing it grew into something im looking forward to playing and keeps me wondering whats going to happen next in the story, It has me on a emotional rollercoaster throughout the time that i've played.Co-op: 10/10The Co-op is absolutely amazing! I had expected it to be almost like L4D2 With checkpoints and bland zombie killing But it suprised me with it being completely open world with side quests and missions available, It's exactly like single player but with 4 people, Very well Done. Overall Experience: 10/10ABSOLUTELY visually pleasing in Day and night cycles, They hit the nail on the head when it comes to the dark and eerie side when exploring in the night, it actually has me on the edge of my seat screaming at my montor when the volatile zombies come after you and it's just an escape for your life.11\10 MUST buy.

												I got this gift as a gift on May 22. So far, as of typing this out, I have enjoyed myself well beyond what one could. The atmosphere is enjoyable. The game presents a challenge that most games do not provide. The storyline has been nothing short of immersive.The game is essentially if Dead Rising and Borderlands had a child and somehow Mirror's Edge was romantically involved. My ratings so far?Graphics: 8.5/10Reason for rating: There are a few graphical glitches that could be easily remedied with a bit of investigative coding and some of the options are much too overpowering that could be toned down a pinch or be given an option for a lower setting. But for this, the natural bloom and shading makes the game much more menacing when playing, especially during the night in-game, which is -exactly- what I'd expect from something with a dramatic, eerie toned game like this.Storyline: 7/10Reason for rating: To start, the negatives are far outweighed by the positives. The storyline was engaging, however short it was, though my gripes with certain parts could be very notable, further dragging down my potential rating for this section. Subtlety felt lacking in certain parts of the game, especially during the end. Though the aspect was expected, perhaps different approaches could have been made to meet the main points in the story. With that being said, the storyline kept me hooked until one of the end missions.Gameplay: 8.75/10Reason for rating: So far, the enjoyment out of searching for secrets, better gear, and beyond, is what makes the game for me. I absolutely adore open worlds and a good questing system, as it allows for the ability to immerse yourself further by forcing you to explore and see the city of Harran as it is now and get ideas of what it was prior. The crafting system feels familiar yet different in how it's approached. My only bother with crafting like this is that I cannot set macros or access some form of GUI to craft on the fly naturally.My major gripe about this game isn't about the single player aspect, but the multiplayer. When poking and prodding at the ""Be The Zombie"" game mode, the biggest issue I noticed was the ease of absolutely demolishing the zombie player. While, yes, a good player will not be killed too easily as the Night Hunter, the ability to play ""well"" is based on what abilities you have at your disposal in comparison to your [up-to-four] human rival[/s]. This makes leveling up extremely hard as the Hunter if you're up against any more than one human player unless the players are foolish enough to split up or you're abusing the system with friends.Balance is a -must- in any game, no matter the mode. Without allowing more health to the Hunter with more players in a server and allowing any level of player into a server, the mode leaves much to be desired and makes it painful to play.Overall, this game, as it stands, despite my biggest spit towards it, is definitely up there in my biggest recommendations.EDIT: Made amendments to my Storyline rating.ADDENDUM: Will add much more when I can buy more DLC to give my view on the game as it stands.

												Have had this game on my library since it was released (got as a gift) but we never really got into it as it seemed badly optimized at the time. Year and a half later we get back into it and it is in a great state. Played the whole thing coop and it was enjoyable. The parkour system is actually cool, just wish there would have been a little more focus on guns. I can see why they focused on melee but at least more effort into guns. I expected more from the ending but it was ok, cool to see Chris Redfield's voice actor do the main character's voice.			"

												I love Dead Island. Played it on PS3 and a good 300 hours on Steam.I disliked Dead Island Riptide, 3 playthroughs in 50 hours.This is not a bad game, it's just not a great game. I would consider it good for 20 euro.Aside from graphic problems (wich would be logical with my current rig, but it magicly performs as well as a i7-SLI rig if I compare my monitoring with posts from the forums). Now I did some tweaking but reading high end machines having FPS of 20-40 outside...Chronic Abrretion or how ever you write it. It sucks as much as my spelling. But at least I apoligize for it^^Oke, so the game is running. It's not bad. Parkour does what it needs to do. Remember chasing the thief in AC? sprinting and then your hanging on a plant? this doesn't / hardly happens in Dying Light. BIG PLUS. The zombies. Well, they are good. you got the slow majority, recently turned virals (running) and a few nice specials. At night normal zombies can turn and there is the Violate (Blade III vampire). The pyshics are good, you can really bang those ragdolls up, throw them of roofs / stairs. I was afk-isch and suddely a zombie dropped from a roof, broke it legs and still crouched to try to take a chump out of me. The ragdollphysics are sometimes hillariliously  well done.It goes wrong after level 15. You get better wapons, but the zombies don't get scaled. I have a 2.5K Katana able to 1 kill the biggest badass zombie special. (spoiler alert: he is big and fast and doesn't has a hammer).I'm replaying now, simple because I want 100% completion. Now that's a bad motivation. I doubt if I will replay after this. It's a good game, but it's not worth it's price at 40 euro. It look great, but there is little to no challenge in anything. It's not open worl, it's a lineair storyline on 2 big (great) maps. Exploring isn't really encouraged, you get by most sidequests by following the main story anyway. don't think I'm gonna buy DLC for this either. Unless the scaling gets adressed and the DLC contains a new campaignlike content. So far it seems  wapons (you dont need) and challenges, wich you actually don't want to do.But, buy it for 20, you will have a good game.Returned to this game because a friend bought it during the sale. It's quite good now actually. Runs an awful lot smoother, dipped a bit into the Following, wich looked gorgeous. Went back to Haran because my mate just started a new game.Looking forward to play the Following with himI was disgrunted about previous content, but from what I've seen the Following so far, it does justify the cost with it. Hell, im at  130 hours so I consider it all good "

												Imagine if a developer took some concepts from Far Cry, Assassin's Creed and Mirror's Edge and kind of threw them on the top of the gameplay from Dead Island. Well, Techland has done just that, it's just that none of the concepts really work that well and all the issues from Dead Island are still prevalent.You kill fast zombies, slow zombies, strong zombies and exploding zombies. You make molotovs, grenades, medkits from items you find in the game world. There's quicktime events and unlockable skills and you've seen them all of this stuff before in some form or another, in any game you've probably played in the last decade.I can't think of a good reason to recommend this game to anyone. At release it is horribly optimized and runs like crap, I've seen all manner of glitches and been victim to countless, cheap deaths. Killing zombies is about as unoriginal as it comes these days and the only time this game is worth picking up is if you see it in a bargain bin and even then, that's a stretch.Full video review:

												A joyously fun game with a lot of glaring issues holding it back from true greatness.It brings to the table an exceptionally enjoyable combat system which feels like what Dead Island's combat should have been in the first place, while adding the wonderous addition of parkour elements to the combat and in turn making everything feel much more dynamic, though combat slowly becomes easier over time against normal zombies, but it gets balanced out by ne, stronger special infected. The infected slowly get introduced throughout the story and become part of the open world thereafter. Though combat can become repetitive and frustrating at times, with some enemies taking more hits than they really should.The storyline is very predictable and fairly poorly written, though at the same time oddly charming and engaging in a Resident Evil kinda way. Where while the story is♥♥♥♥♥♥ you still wanna see it through just to find out what horrible line or event will be demonstrated next. Not much else to say here.Quests are decently varied though sometimes a bit repetitive in nature. There are a lot of basic fetch quests, but there's also quite a few scripted story based quests with an interesting layout and areas exclusive to the mission. Side quests feel like other story quests instead of basic small side things. They can become fairly engaging and enjoyable, though yet again may become repetitive. The parkour system is implemnted quite flawlessly and is one of the best elements of the game, it feels silky smooth gliding from building to building, or from zombie to a roof of a far. Some of the most enjoyable parkour elements I've experienced within a game to date.My absolute favorite element of the game is the nighttime though. It turns it into one of the most threatening and intereting experiences within open world games, an experience usually only seen within scripted linear experiences. There's nothing more exhillerating than quietly sneaking past the large infected to get to an air drop, before being seen and having to run like all hell to a safe house from a horde before being taken down and killed. Absolutely wonderous.Visually the game is absolutely gorgeous. Wonderful lighting, wonderful shading, wonderful models, wonderful animations. Sometimes shoddy texture work does not detract from the beautiful world Techland has crafted. Performance wise the game runs alright currently. Though pre-patch it ran like complete♥♥♥♥♥on hardware that should be able to run it perfectly fine. THough even post-patch it still has issues utilising all CPU cores and using SLI properly. There's also the fact that AMD/ATI users are basically ♥♥♥♥ed by Techland's optimisation for their hardware.  WHich is a major issue.The game sadly lacks its own charm and personality. Instead feeling like another new AAA game. There's nothing truly memorable about it. Dead Island had some ridiculous memorable stuff such as Sam B, the wonderous jumping animation and the silly yet unique style. This game has Crane unsure of what to do before proceeding to be silent during actual gameplay. While Dead Island had the characters doing their own ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yet hilarious one-liners, screams and moans.It just feels oddly generic. Overall it's a game full of ideas, some which it fulfills and some which it stumbles with. It takes a lot of elements from a lot of games, and does some well and some poorly. There's a lot of technical issues and the game can become fairly repetitive. Though ultimately, what is here is a very entertaining and ambitous, though not memorable, game from Techland. I give it a 7.5/10			"

The parkour movement is fluid but isn't flushed out. The movement feels abit restrictive and in some parts...unrealistic. But you won't notice this unless you are capable of parkouring Offline. The combat feels similar to skyrim, but not entirely the same, you cannot do magic here and you are limited to holding 1 item in our hand at a time. The scare aspect to this...it's just meh. There is weapon detoriation in this game, but unlike most other games..you weapon only has a certain number of repairs it can do until it is worthless. The death mechanic in this game is a joke, you only lose points, which by the way are easily earned back. The story is sum'ed up to ""bad-guy vs good-guy"" cliche. The online is great for Co-op campaigns but it sucks for zombie invading. Co-op campaigns get a average of 1-3 peps joining you. Trying to invade someone's gets a average of 1-2 games to invade per 10 refreshes. The difficulty is none existant. The maps are clearly designed give you that feeling of ""I'm in a city"" but I didn't feel that, I just felt like I was running through a maze most of the time. But the rooftops makes travel alot faster, too fast in my book...Oh and the slums map seems like it gotten the most attention, old town and such just seem like they were rushed. the lack of attire and character choices just bothers me. I like being able to play other characters and have many costumes, not be restricted to just 1 character and like only 10 or so costumes to pick from. The crafting is shares similarities to The Last of Us.  The game only autosaves...there is no ""save button"" here. The game will save whenever you either sleep or get a loading screen or unlock a safe house or when you complete a task. The game also has no fast-travel, so most of your game will consist of running/ jumping. Lastly, the client. The client is stable. During my playtime I never had the game crash once. But, the game does refuse to start in fullscreen mode for me...Oh and the game only works properly for Nvidia Graphics cards, Amd is outta luck here. Tl:drit's a good zombie hunting game with parkour. just not a good story driven game.			"

												This game is not just your casual zombie or surivival game, this is the real stuff. There is no possibility to choose between easy/medium/hard mode. Might wanna get a friend to play with, sometimes its real boring when you are alone. Get a friend and play co-op together. Endless fun.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROS+ Astonishing graphics and sun+ AMAZING and unique parkour mechanics+ Crazy and real look alike cinematics+ Beautiful huge urban area to explore+ Able to spend skill points on useful abilities.+ Awesome night time gameplay, real challenging.+ Huge range of weapons+ Crafting system (weapons included)+ Zombies have a different look compared to other Zombie games, makes it original.+ Hundreds of sub-missions+ Active developers team to fix bugs, optimization problems, addition of new graphics, etc.+ Well made story+ Perfect soundtrack that applies to parkour and zombie killing situations.+ Ability to enter almost every house in order to scavenge+ Picklock system+ Co-op with 4 players+ Multiplayer, with the ability to play as the night hunterCONS- Horrible optimization. I couldnt play if it wasnt for that Nvidia driver for Dying Light. But I'm still struggling due to my AMD processor. (Although they are working on fixing it, lets see what they make out of it)- Weapons break faster than they are supposed to. There are even some weapons that can't actually even break in real life.- No suppressors to craft/use on guns.- Stealth is really, but REALLY poor in this game. When you sneak up behind someone you can't snap his neck or even kill him with 1 slash in the head. They are supposed to die right on the impact because they are not aware of it.- Low presence and finding rate of firearms in the game. You simply can't make a zombie game without firearms. Guns are rare in the game and they said that snipers would be available. I couldn't find a single sniper throughout the whole game. Its more a hack and slash game. It gets pretty repetetive slashing zombies all day. I already heard rumors about a DLC weapon pack, if its true I just have one thing to say. Please, no.- Theres no primitive way to survive, like making bows by using a hatch to get wood from trees. Its all about scavenging.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I recommend this game, but it still needs a lot of improvement. This game has a lot to prove due to its active developement team that works on the complaints of players and future additions to the game.			"

												Final Review:As I stated in my previous update, this game has some issues with AI and NPC voice acting but these are just little issues in what is an excellent game. Considering this is Techlands first big project, the little issues that do exist are excusable. I'm very much looking forward to their future projects.My overall marks are:Graphics - 9/10Gameplay - 9/10 (would have been 10 if it wasn't for AI issues)Story - 8/10Overall, this is a great game that has enjoable combat mechanics and a decent story. My one other issue is under spoiler alert, which is to do with the end game.****Spoiler Alert****Somewhat disappointed that the final fight amounted to hitting certain buttons when told to in an interactive cut scene. It would not have been hard to design the final fight to be a full on melee battle or gun fight. However, the lead up to that fight was intense and exciting.Update 28/1/15: Still no patch but have managed to get the game to run with an acceptable 30 to 45 fps while out in the open world. Did this by dropping the view distance down to nothing and turning off HBAO. Enjoying the game now, just wish I didn't have to compromise on the graphics.In terms of the game, it is pretty good. I have some gripe with the AI of human NPC's, when going for an air drop I just throw molotovs at them; the NPC's that don't get hit by the molotov just stand there and watch their buddies burn to death. Also, some of the zombie AI is iffy, I have seen human NPCs stand next to zombies, side by side, neither of them attacking the other. The only other negative is that most of the male characters look the same and some of the voices do not fit the faces, so much so that it is comical on occasions.But the game is enjoyable, killing zombies feels good although human AI is predictable. The parkour element is well put together. It may seem that I have more negative to say about the game than I do positive but at the time of writing this I have only played for a few hours. The purpose of this update to my review is to give some feedback on the game itself as my original review was about its poor optimisation. At this stage, even with all its flaws I do recommend this game. I will extend my review at a later date.Beware AMD GPU users, the game may not run very well with your GPU, even if you have a high quality one like I do.Original Review:Right now the game is unplayable as when I am outside my FPS drops below 25. Running with an AMD FX8350 and Radeon R9 270x. Seems to me from looking at the rest of the reviews, this game has been poorly optimized for AMD systems, regardless of what all the Nvidia fanboys are saying.All those having the same issue, go to this link:http://en.support.techland.pl/support/solutions/articles/4000042573-creating-dxdiag-fileSend them a dxdiag file to help them fix these problems more quickly.

												Zombie FarCry . . . which is a good thing! 8.5/10, read on for more detail.This game plays in an incredibly similar way to FC3 (and FC4 I'm assuming, although I've yet to play). The graphics are of a similar nature, the handling is similar, the crafting and skills aquisition is similar, the open world environment is similar, the quest system is similar, etc. It really feels familiar if you've played FarCry.That being said, it's obviously got unique elements, such as the parkour movement around the city and the general atmosphere. A+ on graphics (which I run fully maxed out on my i7 4770k, GTX 770 4gb, 16gb rig). Controls are easy enough once you practice. Parkour elements pretty smoothly integrated and intuitive. Combat thus far feels pretty smooth and realistic, although precision hitting with a pipe is proving difficult. Sound is absolutely top notch (hearing things all around me, things sound hellish at night, very immersive).Gameplay is tense and you definitely are presented with a nice balance of feeling like a badass, but also terrified out of your wits at times. Only complaint is sheer amount of cutscenes and times when you sit back and watch, rather than play. I'm OK with these, as I think they add cinematic drama to most games, but it does feel a bit over the top here.No technical issues, install was a breeze, no crashes or bugs yet. So nice to play a AAA title after so many early access games in the last year or two. Overall, great game that I'm looking forward to playing through, then again in co-op.			"

												Definitely a worthy purchase. So far I have barely played into 15% of the story as the sidequests have be going without it feeling like a chore. Day/Night cycle works very subtly and works well. Personally, night does scare me. Even knowing the Volatiles position as they're marked on your minimap you will constantly check your back and when you get chased it becomes very tense. I find the night to be quite balanced, as the volatiles run faster than you but climb slower so you have to take advantage of the mirrors-edge style parkour that the game perfectly placed in, making it a much more interesting version of Dead Island with the free roaming aspect of it - quite unique to input a parkour system into a zombie game, but it was definitely a good mashup. I myself am not even a horror fan and I enjoy this game - it doesn't try to be scary, and usually isn't - fans of Action/RPG games will definitely enjoy this, even if you found Dead Island to be dull.

												This is a good game that I recommend to anyone into open world questline based games. It is easy to get into and is a great game to play with up to 3 of your friends. There are a few things that bother me with this game such as the climbing mechanics, sometimes they don't cooperate and can be a pain until you unlock the grapple hook then you can grapple your way around making it 100x easier. Another thing that bugs me is the gunplay it is very bland but the melee gameplay is so satisfying I can overlook that. Is it perfect? No not at all but it's well done.Overall the graphics are stunning, the story is okay, the content is good and will keep you busy, gameplay is solid for the most part, & the game is very well optimized. I would definitly give this game a shot.			"

												An excellent game that can be described as a blend of Assassin's Creed, Mirror's Edge, and of course Dead Island.  The freerunning is done exceptionally well, and the combat is especially satisfying once you start to level up.  The main story is pretty standard but interesting enough to want to play through, however, the side quests can often provide you with great experiences you'll want to share with others.  On top of all of this the soundtrack is top notch with a very 80s horror movie vibe.			"

													Dying Light is a mostly fun zombie-slaying game that utilizes parkour. It's brought to you by the creators of the first Dead Island and Dead Island: Riptide, Techland. Dying Light outshines Dead Island greatly, even with its launch issues. It features better writing, a greater sense of verticality that works well with the parkour and grappling hook, skill trees that make progression feel more significant, graphic and enjoyable combat, a fearsome night, some bugs, and questionable design decisions that did not sit well with me.	The story has one main protagonist instead of a cast of four a la Dead Island. You play as Kyle Crane, an undercover GRE (Global Relief Effort) agent sent to recover a file lost within the city of Harran. As Crane, you bear witness to the insane brutality and sadness that affect the survivors of the devastated city. Dying Light managed to present an okay, passable story that did not make my eyes glaze over as if I were one of the undead. The main antagonist was crafted to be obviously evil and fond of diabolical plans which came off as cheesy or cliché at times. The writing lacked the finesse to not be predictable. However, some of the side-quests were very well done with how they portrayed loss and grief. On the other hand, the game definitely could have done without the useless find x number of item side quests that served no purpose or told any stories.	Dying Light's world is generally fun to navigate due to the winning mixture of parkour and well used vertical space. Although, sometimes you will find yourself falling down and taking damage due to learning what can and cannot be grabbed, a feeling that's amplified with the use of the grappling hook. You will need to learn how to use its lock-on on ledges before channeling Just Cause's Rico Rodriguez since you can grapple onto most surfaces, including the ground. Unfortunately, Kyle Crane cannot use the grappling hook on zombies. The parkour keeps on improving as you level up the Agility tree and chain maneuvers. Do you want to vault off a zombie and dropkick another zombie into spikes or vault off a railing to drop two stories below, avoid damage by rolling, and then continue to run about? It feels like Mirror's Edge's lite with its own style, but no wall running.	The world of Dying Light uses height well. The first major area in the game is in a poorer part of Harran filled with shops, abandoned vehicles, cheap housing, incomplete skyscrapers, a large highway, a sweet bridge, radio towers, a coast, and open areas to run across. The second major area is dense with buildings which plays very well with the grappling hook and jumping around in general. I greatly enjoyed hopping between two story lampposts to cross a plaza or scrambling up buildings to avoid Volatiles during night. Yes, there are radio towers, but during those sequences I thought the game produced a nice sense of height as wind sounds and camera tilting worked to make me nervous. I think only three of them are part of the critical path for the story, so do not worry.	They did a good job with making the points in the skill trees feel significant. There are very few skills that have mundane percentage increases and focus more on adding more to the gameplay via new techniques or recipes. You can end up with throwing stars that can freeze zombies, a spinning attack, an upgraded slide to break knees, or the ability to squash the heads of enemies frolicking on the ground. Skill points greatly affect the way you move, fight, and items you can craft.	The combat has a slow start, but turns into a slaughterfest as strikes start cleaving enemies into two, horizontally and vertically. They could have balanced it better to make the beginning more impactful and prevent the p. I found a great amount of joy in using advanced abilities to destroy hordes of zombies and pesky humans. The humans tend to be much more dangerous when engaging them in melee, especially early in the game. However, you can easily dispatch them with molotovs or grenades if you do not have a firearm handy. I popped heads like watermelons, drop kicked zombies into various environmental hazards, lured enemies into traps, and much more. There should be enough gore in Dying Light for the zombie enthusiast. The zombies come with a bit of variety too. You have normal zombies (Biters), Virals (the runners), Goons, Volatiles (the scary ones), Toads, Bombers, Demolishers, Screamers, hazmat Biters with explosive gas tanks on their back, and Night Hunters if you allow pvp. You will not be killing Volatiles in the beginning. They have multiple attacks and need to be weakened before attacking them. Co-op makes them less scary once your group has decent weapons and support items available, but carelessness will still result death. Co-op is a fun and silly experience with occasional desync hiccups that result in weird physics on bodies.	The night in Dying Light creates an unfriendly environment filled with tension. The night makes zombies more aggressive, allows Volatiles to come out of their nests, and introduces a four level alert system. The more trouble you cause, the higher the alert level becomes causing many angry zombies to converge on your position. I would recommend carefully killing some regular zombies during the night because experience for both Agility and Power are doubled with a bonus to Survivor level as night ends. Co-op tends to trivialize the night experience if everyone is packing flares unless it is a level four alert. The grappling hook also makes night easier until you miss the ledge of a three story building during a chase. God help you if that happens.	This game had some issues upon release with many of them resolved. They are still working on additional issues. You can read through this thread to see a comprehensive list of different bugs: http://steamcommunity.com/app/239140/discussions/0/604941528488544773/ I personally experienced four bugs: a waypoint that wouldn't disappear from the map, a ledge on an optional radio tower that sent me out of bounds (I could swim back in), being unable to interact after killing enemies with a gun and then switching weapons (patched), and the inability to reach max Survivor level. Not bad with a system that did not meet minimum specs except for RAM.	There were some design choices that did not do the game justice here. The sound design for the guns felt flaccid because they fired as if they all had suppressors. Then the game had a few, annoying deaths that made me bitter. They tend to happen in this manner: you go into a room and a Bomber bursts through a door and kills you instantly or you open a door and are greeted by a Bomber or two. At one point in the game, they change the behavior of a hazmat zombie so that it runs toward you and detonates. That kind of design adds nothing to the gameplay or enjoyment of the game. Co-op can help mitigate those situations, but not always. Thankfully, the number of those incidents remains below ten. The game make use of too many camera effects with the long lasting water effect that blurs your screen for far too long irking me the most. There are no options available to turn those effects off. At this time, you will need to mod them out and a good place to start is http://www.nexusmods.com/dyinglight/ I know some people do not like those obnoxious effects or film grain. Weapon variety suffers from blunt weapons leaving the weapon pool at higher Survivor levels. Finally, the ending was mechanically disappointing and completely out of place.	Dying Light is not a perfect game. It has its flaws, but it is much, much better than Dead Island and is much closer to achieving that wonderful zombie slaying game I have always wanted. The improved movement adds so much to the game when it comes to combat and navigation. The drop kicks are fantastic.			"

												Man, I really can't formulate my thoughts right now -- this was *exactly* the game I was waiting for a really, really long time.Okay, first of all -- so much props to Techland for stepping up and making everything they have planned, and so much more.Dying Light is easily the best sandbox zombie FPS out there, and the best AAA game of 2015 (already, yeah). Techland outdid themselves with this one -- you can consider Dying Light a perfected version of Dead Island (the first sandbox zombie FPS, I think). Graphics, sounds, music, atmosphere, script -- everything was perfected, and released with practically no delays (something for Ubisoft to learn here).If you don't know what to expect from the game, watch the E3 trailer -- the game is *exactly* like the trailer. Which is so hard to believe, actually, isn't it? Well, trust me: I've tried everything they were doing in the trailer -- and it works perfectly: throwing zombies, setting traps, jump-kicking, throwing weapons, running through your course of traps from infected, looking back at them, setting off your traps...And by all means, try the co-op mode, AND the ""Be The Zombie"" mode -- both are absolutely amazing. Co-op in this game is a lot better than in Dead Island (it was meaningless there) -- I can tell you this much.This game deserves the highest rating, this easily can be the game of the year, I honestly mean that. I'd rate it 10.0 out of 10.0, a most certain ""must buy"".			"

												""Why should I bother reading your review?"" (Skip this if you want)I've had video gaming as a hobby for 20 years, crossing all genres with a big appetite for survival, horror and RPGs. Hence why I decided to review dying light. I try to stay objective and neutral. Give credit where its due and use the stick where the game deserves to be criticized. Note that I'm a Non-Native English speaker.The GoodThe game has great graphics and the gameplay is fun. Despite the gameplay being repetative, the fun is not severely diminished  - because at its core - it is a very enjoyable ""grinder"" / sandbox all the way through. The crafting system is very basic, but better to have a basic crafting system than none. The upgrade trees was something I found alarming because though I do love RPG elements, I was afraid the game would become too easy with all these upgrades. However, the game managed to keep the challenge at a rate that always kept me at my toes even with a ton of upgrades. As for sidequests, they are actually kind of interesting in this game. Even a fetch quest can become fun through dialogue or challenge.The Bad (VERY MINOR story spoilers)The variety of opponents in this game is too low imo. But that becomes nitpicking. Because the biggest flaw this game has - is actually the personality of the main character. Though the story isn't that great or imaginative, I would consider it kinda good for what you'd expect from a Zombie game. The main character however, is a nightmare.Your character is a whiny, unprofessional moron who gets emotionally attached to the doomed people of this ruined city. He cries when a story character dies, as if he cares. I had to roleplay that I was faking it. The main character is introduced as an agent whom sole purpose is to retrive a file. Then he starts crying and caring for the people in the city instead of doing his job. The white knight in shining armor of your main character becomes tiresome and obnoxious as he spews out ultra-moralistic crap as if he was the human embodiment of self-rightiousness. The main villain is also uninteresting and cliche and suffers the opposite, by being completely void of humanity and just ""evil for the sake of evil"". TO SUM UP:Though I personally never cared about graphics (i still consider Fallout 2, Morrowind and ff7 the best games out there) the graphics in this game is really good. But you need a decent rig.The gameplay itself is great. It is fun despite being repetative.Crafting system and upgrade system is good.The challenge is not so hard that it becomes overly frustrating, but neither as easy that you risk to become bored.Enemies are varied enough, but just barely, there should have been 1-3 more types of enemies.The story itself is average, but better than I expected for a zombie survival. Side quests are surprisingly satisfying!What really pulls the score down imo is the lack of some things in the story, like joining factions or faction vs faction assault/defense in the storyline, NPCs you genuinely care about etc. BIGGEST OFFENDER is the main character and the main villain, they are both horribly written and it is impossible to symphatize with either. Your character is too ""good"" on the morality scale, at the point of it almost becoming repulsive. The main villain is unimaginatively written and is the standard one dimensional ""evil for the sake of evil"" boring archetype. Near the end of the game I hated the main character more than the villain. All in all, 7.8/10 - I recommend this game.If you like sandbox games, zombie apocalypse scenarios, survival games, horror and RPG elements and have a good PC, you will probably find this game worth the money. Do not however - expect the story, the main character or the main villain to provide any intellectual or emotional satisfaction on any level unless you are younger than 16 years old. "

												A fantastic, visually appealing game. The atmosphere and surroundings make this game feel so realistic that you just don't want to stop playing it. It's like a better, stronger, updated version of Dead Island. If you're good at parkouring then you rarely need any weapons. But if you suck at it like I do, I suggest keeping a few on hand lol.I ran into a bit of jolting in the start with the video graphics, but once I set it to ""best performance"" I've had no further trouble.

												I'd appreciate it if you checked out my blog, where I do reviews, giveaways, and more: https://gandhigaming.wordpress.com/I think we can all agree, 2014 was definitely not the best year for gaming by a long shot. And even though it gave us gems like Alien: Isolation or Shadow of Mordor, it was arguably one of the worst years of gaming ever. Dying Light is the first ""major"" release of 2015, and I was worried for this game because I thought the 2014 curse would still linger on and affect this game. Luckily, I was wrong. Very, very wrong.Now, although I enjoy Dying Light, it has various flaws to the game that doesn't make it the ultimate zombie experience we were all looking for. But that being said, Dying Light is a great game and an awesome way to start 2015, and it makes me think that this year will be much better than 2014.GraphicsProbably one of the best things to Dying Light, the graphics look absolutely stunning on PC. Every little bit to the game is detailed. Don't believe me? Check out some of these screenshots I took:http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/541896836997986793/D10F15E8921F2BD6BFF6FB7E2191E84224205244/http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/541895566612870024/11FFA702F3E89B9735B1A77FC8647D96F91D5BD2/This game continues to wow me with how beautiful the game is and even rivals modded Skyrim. The atmosphere, which may seem to make the game look like a generic 90000000 zombies vs. 1 man is actually a bit dark and depressing. No, it's not anywhere near as bad as say The Last of Us, but it isn't cheery. And when night comes, things get intense quick. You can barely see, which means you'll have to use your flashlight, but then in the shadows a Volatile (a superzombie of sorts) will be watching you and trying to strike you. On my very first night, I was running back to my home base, which was somewhat far away, and my heart was racing when I heard one of those things scream. I didn't bother looking back and I had an adrenaline rush. Luckily, I made it back. But this proves that the nights are hectic, intense, and heart-racing. The graphics and atmosphere to Dying Light are some of the best I've seen in a while, and it was done right.GameplayDying Light is a bit different from zombie games in the fact that it uses parkour to get around. And this part I was very worried about, because all the parkour games I've played had god awful parkour, not to name any names. And for the first 5-6 hours or so, I thought my fears came true. However, I got adjusted to the controls and it turns out that all of it is silky smooth. The parkour is great, and jumping from one building to another never felt so nerve-racking and exhilarating. The combat is also good in this game. Instead of going in guns blazing, you have to plan your way to get through a horde of zombies. You can sneak past them with firecrackers or some other distraction, take them out from a distance and use molotovs, or maybe you are just that crazy and you want to go in and kill them all (although you probably won't survive to kill three). The game is over the top in some ways, but it still keeps a sense of realism and doesn't ruin the fun. For example, you have combat stamina and your character can get worn out, giving the zombies an edge. Also, guns are extremely rare to find, and I didn't get one until at least 9hrs into the game, and bullets are even rarer. Weapons can break, you can upgrade them, etc. As for the night mode, it is only scripted to change in the earlier missions, but then the time is free and night can come at any moment. The game is difficult to an extent, the other zombie types make the game much more interesting at night, and the list could go on and on and on. My one issue, however, is that once you get your hands on more powerful items, the late game becomes very easy and the experience can be ruined, killing the atmosphere and immersion. But besides that, overall, the gameplay is smooth and it was executed well.StoryIt's pretty obvious that this would be the game's low point. I figured this would have a cheap story, and I was right. A one-dimensional protagonist I can't seem to become interested in, and one-dimensional characters everywhere actually. Jade is the stereotypical heroine, with her ""I'm 1000% more badass than you"" style, Dr. Zere is all about ""saving the world"" and doesn't get any further than that, Rais is a brutal leader (you don't say?), must I continue? It's a generic save-the-world plot that I can't get into. However, I will give credit to the story for being depressing, because many people (won't name anyone specific) die left and right. Few zombie games seem to understand that it's no easy feat, and so kudos to the writers for keeping that in mind. I don't want to elaborate any further because I'm sure you know where I'm going with this. Generic story, one dimensional characters, boring protagonist...AudioThe audio is good but nothing to write home about. The zombies actually sound somewhat scary and not silly, so that's something worth noting. The voice actors aren't bad either, but the characters are still one dimensional. I also like the fact that the soundtrack doesn't use guitars to make it seem depressing or heavy metal/electronic mix to make me mistaken this game for Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. Yes, it has a mostly electronic soundtrack, but it isn't upbeat. It's slow, somewhat soothing, and fits the mood. Not only that, but because the game takes place in Turkey, it adds a few personal touches to make the soundtrack even better. ReplayabilityThe replayability seems somewhat good. Co-Op is a blast to play and can bring hours and hours of fun, plus finding all the clever easter eggs can be quite enjoyable. You can also try and get all the god-tier weapons and then kill the most deadly zombies in 1-2 hits with no problem. At this point, this is where the replayability begins to fade. As I stated earlier, once you get all the good stuff, the game becomes too easy and kills any atmosphere or suspense. Not only that, but Be the Zombie mode was one of the key reasons I bought this game and it turned out to be very boring and unbalanced. Playing as the zombie is fun, but the survivors with Survivor Sense already won pretty much and it ruins the stealth and suspense buildup the game mode attempts to offer. The replayability though isn't that bad and I may play a few hours postgame to do a few things.VerdictDying Light is not the best game I've played in 2015 so far. However, it's still a blast to play and worth the money if you're fine with a few flaws with the game. In the end, I recommend Dying Light to any big zombie gamers out there, and I'd be more than happy to buy this game again and replay it through.Graphics- 10/10Gameplay- 8.5/10Story- 4.0/10Audio- 7.0/10Replayability- 6.0/10.:7.9/10:.+Smooth parkour+Stunning graphics+Fun co-op+Intense night mode+Keeps a sense of realism-Be the Zombie mode is boring and unbalanced-Generic story with one-dimensional characters and boring protagonist-Late game becomes very easy and ruins all suspense			"

												I'm sorry if this review is not that great, I just want to jump right back in and play more.I've finished the game and I'm now playing the Newgame+. There are more DLC planned including a new huge area bigger than all of harran, and dune buggies and a whole crapload of other awesome stuff, but until then, here's my review of the vanilla game. Graphics: 7/10	The game looks very good, but for many of us PC gamers, the texture pop-ins and the medium res textures can be of annoyance. However, this is one of those games where graphics are secondary to the gameplay. Not to say the graphics are bad at all, they aren't, but it leaves allot of Titan cards bored. The graphics and overall aesthetic of the game is atmospheric and does work, but leaves me wanting higher resolution textures and a MUCH better option menu. Sound: 10/10	I am a huge audiophile, I only accept the very best sound, no distortion, no jaggy treble, and this game is definitely to my satisfaction. The sound is all there, the footsteps, the grass, the sound of your weapon swinging and the soft sound of the rain is all jaw dropping in how well recorded/generated it is. Sound is not too important for allot of gamers, but if you're like me and you want the best of the best in your ears, pick this game up. Sounds great on my Sennheiser HD518's. Gameplay: 9/10	The gameplay is a huge strong point of the game. The combat flows extremely well, the parkour flows even better, and chaining them both together will give you a bloody amazing gameplay experience. The gameplay takes the very best parts from Dead Island, and Assassins Creed/Mirrors Edge and slams those games and shows them how it's done. This game does the tower climbing better than Far Cry 3, Combat better than Dead Island, and Parkour better than Assassins Creed. I can't even begin to explain how satisfying the combat is, but just imagine running up a wall, jumping off, and in mid-air, dropkicking a zombie into a pit of spikes, or throwing a gas tank next to a big zombie and watch it smash the tank and explode. Completed this game, and I am not done at all. Story: 5/10	Meh. Nothing new here. The story was alright in the first half of the game, but the drug sequence, and the ""CRAAAAAAAANE"" literally made me cringe. They also gave us very few oppurtunities to connect with the characters that died, and the emotional way Crane bursts out just seems ridiculous given how he barely knew the people who just died, whilst he shoots looters in the face.Little things:Replayable? YesIs it scary at night? Yes, when you start off.Does it run well? Not even on my GTX 970, but that doesnt make the game less enjoyable.Are the devs still active? Yes, they seem to be very active and they engage with their fans very frequently.Eh. There's your review. I'm just gonna submit this and play more. More stuff is coming, the game is fun, it's on sale at the time of writing this review, and it's probably my GOTY.			"

												Imagine Dead Island that's actually a well-made video game without most of the annoying/stupid stuff. Featuring a great parkour system and a meaningful day/night cycle. And Arabs (or whatever imaginary people they are)... for some reason.Looks very polished and is a technically impressive good looker overall with the aesthetic that sets just the right mood (acceptable texture artworks; great lightning effects and shadows: the nights are dark and full of terrors; one of the best drawing distances ever coupled with the possibility of cranking level of detail to insane levels even on the furthest objects, which require very powerful machine). The game feels well-paced in terms of story and activities and balanced in every gameplay aspect. Skill progression is mostly enjoyable and worthwhile along with the functional crafting system.It is true, however, that the game is an ultimate hodgepodge of gameplay mechanics burrowed from dozens of predecessors with not that many new ideas, but the end result is worth it.Also the game fully supports Dualshock 4 (Playstation 4 controller) with the correct button prompts without any additional software requirements (no need to emulate Xbox controller, for instance).

												Dying Light. + Graphics look nice. + Fun combat. + Solid freerunning. + Diverse tactics. + Good day/night cycle. + Fun pvp mode. + Fun coop mode + challenges. + Challenging early on. + Decent upgrade system. + Interesting sidequests, some even tearjerking. + Nice backstory/lore. // Average story - Quite typicall, predictable. // Halfbad lipsync. // Abit buggy here and there. (No AC-Unity don't worry).// Lack of player choice. - Male characters look the same, this is a bigg issue. 50%-70% of the male characters look like the NPC Gazi with different facial hair, even important quest npcs etc.   - Nothing to really do after maxlevel. After maxing all skills, you feel like nothing is worth doing since you only get minimal to no reward for doing things (sideobjectives, airdrops, save survivor etc.), would have been nice to see some kind of system in place to counter this. - All  your friends look the same in Co-op except if you have unlocked different costumes, feels quite silly. - Lack of player customization (bad design), they decided to use clothing for different slots (example: Hats gloves, shooes etc.) but you can only equip them as a full coustume instead of combining it for your self.

												This is the long-lost prodigy if Mirror's Edge had a perfect offspring with Telltale's The Walking Dead. It's grim, it's engaging, it's embracing your betrayed inner hunger for zombie themed FPS again.Didn't expect the world to be so vivid.Didn't expect the gameplay to be so fluid.Didn't expect the story to be this unforgiving.Running and jumping around with Bozak Bow to shoot zombies that are about to devour some poor fellow survivors by the heads you encounter randomly, is so satisfying that the feeling & experience will never be topped the satisfaction you get from any other similar game, by the next 4-5 years at least.Recommended, will sprint and shoot arrows and pretending as Legolas again.

												Dying Light is basically what Dead Island games should've been: fast, fun and solid zombie survival game with pretty large open world.Most of the time you are going to be doing parkour. And it's pretty well made - closest implementation to the fantastic movement system of Mirror's Edge I'd seen by the date.Fighting zombies is, of course, also an option - if not for loot, then for survival. And the combat system although somewhat similar to Dead Island is quite much more fast paced and visceral. Oh, and throwable weapons actually are useful here.All of that is wrapped up into nice leveling system with three talent trees - survival (general skills), agility (moving skills) and power (fighting skills). Some of the skills are unique and pretty interesting (e.g. grappling hook), while most of them are disappointingly plain upgrades (e.g. weapons durability degrades slower).And then you have to balance between day and night, because those times feel like two completely different games. At day most of zombies are dumb, slow and, well, boring. At night unless you act carefully (or sleep in a safehouse), you'll get you♥♥♥♥♥bitten off pretty quickly.Throw in couple of competing factions, very good voice acting, pretty large world, random events, challenges and all those other open world things - and you'll get a pretty solid game. There's nothing new in it, really. But it's so well made that it's a joy to roam around.On the downsides:- Engine is still not very well optimized, FPS tends to randomly sink for no apparent reason- Some NPCs faces are reused a bit too much (although the voice acting is unique, which feels even stranger)- Night zombies are not too much of a threat once you'd figured out how they think and moveBut if you do enjoy some first-person zombie survival - then this game is definitely one to take a look at.A bit more in-depth look in the video:

												you shouldn't let these mindless automatons mislead you into believing that Techland just gave away the season pass or ""the following dlc"" to the people who bought the original game. these people who are telling you this, possibly may have not played the game enough to know what content they do or do not have in their library or they are just part of Steam's shill team. no one could really be so stupid as to not know what they paid for. could they?Techland have simply changed the name of the game to ""Dying Light: The Following - Enhanced Edition"" (which is a bit disingenuous to customers who purchased the product within the first year of it's release) and they threw in ""the following dlc"" as part of the initial game for new customers, only.the so-called ""enhanced edition"" is the ""plain-vanilla"" version of the game now, it just has a new name and a new (but possibly meaningless) branch on the skill tree. as of now, there is no other version of this game to be had. so the only thing that previous customers get out of this deal is the new branch on the skill tree and possibly one or two short missions (not clear on that) but no actual new content.what Techland are really attempting to do here is to keep the initial entry price of their two-year-old game set at sixty dollars by including ""the following dlc"" as part of the standard package to current customers.you won't be receiving anything extra if you bought the game before ""the following dlc"" was released. got it? i hope so.i'd like to help make this clear because so many of these so-called ""helpful"" reviews that have risen to the top, contain incorrect and misleading information. Techland are not giving anything away for free. this game has a new name, the new name of this game is ""Dying Light: The Following - Enhanced Edition"".customers who bought the game before the name change will NOT receive the ""the following dlc"" without paying for it. ""the following dlc"" is included only for customers who bought the game after the name change took place.besides that bit of marketing BS, it's a pretty good game. if you enjoyed Dead Island, most likely you will like this game too because it is the same developer and this game is identical to Dead Island except for the parkour bs which is essentially like having a vehicle that you can drive up walls to get away from the mobs of zoms with because you can outrun all but the fastest zombies and only special zombies can climb buildings. this game would certainly have been named Dead Island 2 if Deep Silver hadn't parted ways with Techland.to tell the truth, i could have done without most of the parkour crap. and the grappling hook is op as hell, it's just like the one in Just Cause but with a long cool-down time to make it more of a pain in the behind to use. once you get that grappling hook, you really start to discover the boundaries of the map, all the places that Techland doesn't allow you to go, mostly blocked by invisible walls and surfaces that you can't grasp onto. i hate invisible walls, always have, slippery surfaces are no better.i wouldn't count on more than a hundred hours of play, i've got just seventy-something and i'm pretty much tired of it. mostly because you have to do insanely difficult special missions to keep your cool, expensive-as-hell weapons from falling to pieces. come to think of it, that's why i quit playing, because i think it's total bs that you have to keep working constantly on these survivor defense missions where they raise the difficulty to impossible just to keep your weapons from becoming virtual paper-weights. so you have this super-badass sword that will one-hit-kill just about any creature and you want to keep it from disintegrating because you've only got one repair left on it, so you accept a ""survivor mission"" and suddenly your uber-weapon turns into this styrofoam sword that requires you to work all day to kill one normal zombie and of course within seconds the survivor dies leaving you with nothing but a worn out uber-weapon that you've invested tons of time in to get it to that level and you can't do anything with it but throw it away. BS like that gets old very quickly for me when i just want to walk around and kill zombies. for that reason i offer a shaky thumbs-up on this one, very shaky. i would have prefered a game i could put about five hundred hours into. but that's not this game, sorry.oh, i remember now, the thing that really burns me the most about this game, the reason i finally gave up on it. you aren't going to believe this, i know i couldn't believe it, even as i was doing it.THE FINAL BOSS IN THE CAMPAIGN IS A QUICKTIME EVENT.there you have it, i guess i'm going to go with a thumbs-down on this one after all. i knew there was something that gave me a knot in the pit of my stomach for paying sixty bucks for this game.they make you spend all that time creating and maintaining weapons and building your skill tree only to hawk a lougie in your face at the end with a quicktime event.and now they are rolling out even more dlc that even the season pass owners are not going to receive.so even if you did buy the season pass for this nearly dead game, they are still going to withhold content from you. great job, Techland. season pass used to mean that you'd get access to everything and you wouldn't have to worry about what new dlc would come along because you already paid out the a_ss and would automatically receive it. so what is the point of buying the season pass when Techland are only going to f_uck you up the a_ss again later with an additional money-milking scheme because you don't have the complete package?; as you were lead to believe that you would.F_uck you too, Techland, you'll never get another dime out of me.

												This is an very very good zombie apocalypse game!I love it, love every moment of it. I can't play it because i have too many games but i love it. Game is not optimized well but with those new patches on Steam will work very well even on lower PCs (i mean with r7 260x GPUs).Game is awesome, MP is awesome and have replay value, but Single player story isnt that good and isnt that bad, its ok and i enjoy it and ofc side quests and competition with friends.If you love, Far Cry, Assassins Creed, Dead Island, Mirrors Edge and MK (X ray system included in Dying Light), you will love this game because its mix of those games!!Also Workshop FREE mods is here and maps, what are you waiting, buy this game and enjoy it (especially with friends and CO-OP)..9/10			"

												Firstly, some people say the story is crappy, alright it has quite a lot of cliches but it can be hard to avoid it, and imo i think the cliches didn't make the game worse and less enjoyable.The graphics are great and the gameplay mechanics make this a must-play zombie parkour game. This game contains gore to beautiful sights over Harran (the city the game is based in). Pretty addictive and fun to play with up to 3 other people or 4 in be the zombie mode. Night time is a whole new game, terrifying at first and intense :dVoice acting is great with Troy Baker as Crane (I think) and for me the story and game is very engaging. Cool skills and inventive ways to kill innocent people looking for suppliesWorth the money. Refund button does not work well xD			"

												Finally a first person Zombie game done correctly, Two fairly large environs to play in giving plenty space for exploration and some madcap zombie killing set pieces, The graphics if you have the hardware are very nice and the game seems to be well optimized unlike most open world adventures that are multi-platform.The only real downsides to the game as far as I have experienced so far is the generic story with cartoonish central villain whose motivations for what he has done and what he enacts during the game are pretty weak to say the least but the gameplay is more than strong enough to over come the short comings in the generic story. If you have a decent computer to run this at high settings and above then this game is a very good game and I would reccomend it to any fans of open world games or who still have the stomach for yet more zombie fun.

Ramingo's Review for Dying LightDISCLAIMER: I'VE ONLY PLAYED THE NORMAL DYING LIGHT SO FAR, NOT THE FOLLOWING, SO MY REVIEW IS COMPLETELY FOCUSSED ON THE FIRST GAME!StoryI'm not sure about the story. I kinda lacks logic in my opinion. How the hell did it go from, you have to get those files, to let's bomb the city, in a heartbeat? Might have missed something because I've mostly played co-op, but I still think it's lacking a few things to make the story great. Not saying it's bad, because I like it, but I'm just not sure about the logic in it sometimes.6.5/10GameplayI love the gameplay, since I love the Walking Dead and zombies in general. I really like the fact that you can modify simple things as a gas pipe or baseball bat into something awesome, as well as those exploding throwing stars. At first you're like ""Where are all the guns"", but the fact that you can modify your weapons in a wide range, totally doesn't need those guns (although they come in handy sometimes). Of course, it's weird to see those Volatile and other weird zombies next to the usual biters that roam Harran, but it's giving that cool change of pace you need to keep remembering in what kind of hell you dropped yourself. 8/10Free Running/ParcourMost of you will hate me for saying this, but as a big fan of Mirror's Edge: Catalyst, the free running in this game is not finished at all. The grappling to buildings or other things you can grab, is weird sometimes and it's not that diverse as ME, but of course that has its reasons. ME is a game focussed on free running, Dying Light is, in a certain way, NOT. Also sometimes Crane just fails to grab simple things while jumping towards it, so you fall to your death. 6.2/10CharactersJade is ♥♥♥♥ing hot.10/10OverallI really like to play this game. The co-op is great and gives another dimension to the game, although I think it's too bad you can't edit your face and stuff in co-op, but that has its reasons because of the story you're in. Free running could be done better, but it's enough for the game. Story is likeable, but a lacks a little bit of logic. Overall I would recommend the game to anyone who's interested in zombies. And the graphics are awesome!SCORE7.3 / 10 "

It has never been so fun to chop zombies heads off.You can shoot them with a bow with exploding arrow, you can drop kick them on the wall full of spikes.

You can make all sorts of weapons, upgrade them , salvage them, trade etc. This game is like a perfect mixture of parkour, fighting, looting and exploring.CO-OP is excellent , the game feels fresh when you play with someone else and there are some hilarious moments when you play with friends			"

												After completing the story and The Following DLC (2 times each), and still playing the story at nightmare difficulty with a friend, I must say that this game is the best zombie game with very nice mechanics. There are a lot of side quests, which some of them are like a mini story which is very nice (and I still have not completed every ""The Following DLC"" side quest). Hundreds of weapons and thousands of ways to kill zombies (or humans) make the game non-repeatable. 3 (or 4 if you have The Following DLC) skill trees with 24 skills each and a HUGE secondary skill tree with over 250 skills add to the game playable for A LOT of hours of grinding and playing.10/10  BEST ZOMBIE GAME  "

												I had my doubts about this game but since my friend suggested it and it was on sale for -66% I went for it. While downloading it I was pretty sure I was going to ask for a refund, since I didn't think my PC would run it.So yes the first surprise for me was how well this game runs even on my rather outdated system:AMD FX-4100 (OC'D to 4.1GHz)GTX 750 Ti12GB RAMOn medium settings this runs 30 - 50 fps which is totally fine for me.The gameplay is extremely fun and I haven't even unlocked all the possible mechanics for freerunning or combat! Extremely fun to run around and bash in zombie skulls. Also it's a neat feature to cover yourself in zombie guts and blend in Rick Grimes style xD.Solid gameplay nice graphics even on lower settings and fun to play!Haven't been too immersed in the story yet since I've been sidequesting most of the time. Totally worth 17€!  "

												I have been playing this game for 39.8 hours.I must say I'm loving each minute of it :)It's a very refreshing change from Dead Island, in the sense that it offers ALLOT more freedom of movement.I absolutely love the cycling weather system.Graphics: 9.Very nice graphics, really love the day and night cycle (wish it was longer).I would like to see a more variety of weather (complete fog, more rain, heavy storms) & not just sunny days.There are issues with NPC voice and animation synchronization (minor stuff).Multiplayer: 9.The Zombie vs Player is a very exciting concept, very fun teamgame.Joining another game is very easy.I do find it irritating that everybody has the be at a location in order to accept a mission.Story: 7.5-8.The story is standard zombie.The main story is a bit boring, side missions are interesting at times.The ending was kind of boring and easy (expected a much more tougher fight).I do find it very irritating that I can't play the final part with friends :(.Replay: 7.5-8.If you finished all achievements than there isn't that much to do.But playing with friends is very fun.Overall: 8-9.There are not many special zombies :(, so it's not that scary (Need mor creapy kids running around).Overall its a very fun game, the Parkour style is a very refreshing change from other games.Has allot of potential and would love to see mods DLC, maps etc being available.The game is graphically heavy, so a high end system is required.I really enjoy running around during the night.It gives a higher adrenaline kick :PUpdate:The new Hardcore mode is much more intense and for me makes it a much more realistic experience.The latest patch have made the game run much much smoother.Absolutely no lag with all the settings to there maximum (Very happy about that) :D.My system:CPU: i7-4770K.RAM: 8GB DDR3GPU: R9 290X.

												Dying light is an open world zombie survival game set in the city of Harran, the source of a deadly outbreak. This game is often credited as being a clone of other recent titles, such as Dead Island, and is also often thought to have copied mechanics from other games, such as Mirror's Edge, Evolve, and basically every free roam looting game in existace. In reality, Dying Light is a unique masterpiece that could easily shape out to be one of the best releases of 2015. It features aa parkour system, similar to that in Mirror's Edge, which is used to navigate seamlesly throughout the game's vast map. It also gives a very vertical feel to the game. The combat is also very satisfying, due to the vast amount of weapons at your fingertips that can be used to smash, slice, and stab your way through the hoardes of infected that you are sure to encounter. All this and more are accessable in both Singleplayer modes, and 4 player co-op modes. The game also features a 4v1 gamemode, which is a masterpiece in itself.. when you can find a match to join, that is. Singleplayer, familiar, yet unique. The game's main story has you following an agent known as Crane who is working to cure the virus, but ends up stranded in the city. He then proceeds to help out the remaining survivors, fetching loot, running supplies, and working to bring down the local crime lord. There are also a wide variety of side quests, very similar to games in The Elder Scrolls series as well as those in the Dead Island series. They often start off as simple ""go get this"" or ""tell this guy something"" kind of missions.. we alll know them. However, they often evolve into their own side story, with interesting, sometimes comical dialogue and events. The great (but predictable) main story, along with tons of side quests and zombies to bludgeon should satisfy your thirst to beat the heads of countless undead mutants in for a long time. Multiplayer, a masterpiece in itself. In most games, the multiplayer is where the real treasure is. Dying light is no exception. In this game, you and up to 3 other friends can hop along Harran's rooftops and complete missions together. The game also features various challanges and competitions that the team can partake in, such as ""kill the most zombies"", ""loot the most value worth of items"" and even races. Hopping along the rooftops and slaughtering hundreads of undeaed beasts in this game is more satisfying than it ever was in CoD, L4D, and other zombie titles. The 4v1 mode is downright amazing. You and your team are put up against a player controlled super-zombie-beast-demon (too amazing to explain). The beast has to get 10 kills before the survivors destroy 5 nests scattered across the whole map. Yes, the whole map. This mode has you and your friends back to back, fending off a beast that is faster than you, stronger than you, and that's out for blood. It's one of a kind, and it's just something you have to expierece for yourself The verdict. Just get the game. It's worth every penny, especially if you have friends to play it with.10/10 would bang. Er.. play again. Yeah.			"

												From strangling zombie babies to dropkicking people from rooftops, Dying Light likes to approach the ever growing Zombie genre with a serious tone. If you've ever thought, ""This Zombie film/game doesn't have enough Spiderman"" then the Dying Light grappling hook is for you. The only downside to the game is the lack of waste disposal. Every high building or tower has a conveniant rubbish pile beside it, providing a soft landing if one were to jump. It can't be a coincidence that the only city to have a zombie virus outbreak also has such terrible hygiene. Play with friends if you can, try not to be scared of the dark, try to ignore the Left 4 Dead replica special zombies and recall your Skyrim lockpicking days. 9.6/10 Treat your bin men kindly.			"

You can make all sorts of weapons, upgrade them , salvage them, trade etc. This game is like a perfect mixture of parkour, fighting, looting and exploring.CO-OP is excellent , the game feels fresh when you play with someone else and there are some hilarious moments when you play with friends			"

Ramingo's Review for Dying LightDISCLAIMER: I'VE ONLY PLAYED THE NORMAL DYING LIGHT SO FAR, NOT THE FOLLOWING, SO MY REVIEW IS COMPLETELY FOCUSSED ON THE FIRST GAME!StoryI'm not sure about the story. I kinda lacks logic in my opinion. How the hell did it go from, you have to get those files, to let's bomb the city, in a heartbeat? Might have missed something because I've mostly played co-op, but I still think it's lacking a few things to make the story great. Not saying it's bad, because I like it, but I'm just not sure about the logic in it sometimes.6.5/10GameplayI love the gameplay, since I love the Walking Dead and zombies in general. I really like the fact that you can modify simple things as a gas pipe or baseball bat into something awesome, as well as those exploding throwing stars. At first you're like ""Where are all the guns"", but the fact that you can modify your weapons in a wide range, totally doesn't need those guns (although they come in handy sometimes). Of course, it's weird to see those Volatile and other weird zombies next to the usual biters that roam Harran, but it's giving that cool change of pace you need to keep remembering in what kind of hell you dropped yourself. 8/10Free Running/ParcourMost of you will hate me for saying this, but as a big fan of Mirror's Edge: Catalyst, the free running in this game is not finished at all. The grappling to buildings or other things you can grab, is weird sometimes and it's not that diverse as ME, but of course that has its reasons. ME is a game focussed on free running, Dying Light is, in a certain way, NOT. Also sometimes Crane just fails to grab simple things while jumping towards it, so you fall to your death. 6.2/10CharactersJade is ♥♥♥♥ing hot.10/10OverallI really like to play this game. The co-op is great and gives another dimension to the game, although I think it's too bad you can't edit your face and stuff in co-op, but that has its reasons because of the story you're in. Free running could be done better, but it's enough for the game. Story is likeable, but a lacks a little bit of logic. Overall I would recommend the game to anyone who's interested in zombies. And the graphics are awesome!SCORE7.3 / 10 "

												Dying light is an open world zombie survival game set in the city of Harran, the source of a deadly outbreak. This game is often credited as being a clone of other recent titles, such as Dead Island, and is also often thought to have copied mechanics from other games, such as Mirror's Edge, Evolve, and basically every free roam looting game in existace. In reality, Dying Light is a unique masterpiece that could easily shape out to be one of the best releases of 2015. It features aa parkour system, similar to that in Mirror's Edge, which is used to navigate seamlesly throughout the game's vast map. It also gives a very vertical feel to the game. The combat is also very satisfying, due to the vast amount of weapons at your fingertips that can be used to smash, slice, and stab your way through the hoardes of infected that you are sure to encounter. All this and more are accessable in both Singleplayer modes, and 4 player co-op modes. The game also features a 4v1 gamemode, which is a masterpiece in itself.. when you can find a match to join, that is. Singleplayer, familiar, yet unique. The game's main story has you following an agent known as Crane who is working to cure the virus, but ends up stranded in the city. He then proceeds to help out the remaining survivors, fetching loot, running supplies, and working to bring down the local crime lord. There are also a wide variety of side quests, very similar to games in The Elder Scrolls series as well as those in the Dead Island series. They often start off as simple ""go get this"" or ""tell this guy something"" kind of missions.. we alll know them. However, they often evolve into their own side story, with interesting, sometimes comical dialogue and events. The great (but predictable) main story, along with tons of side quests and zombies to bludgeon should satisfy your thirst to beat the heads of countless undead mutants in for a long time. Multiplayer, a masterpiece in itself. In most games, the multiplayer is where the real treasure is. Dying light is no exception. In this game, you and up to 3 other friends can hop along Harran's rooftops and complete missions together. The game also features various challanges and competitions that the team can partake in, such as ""kill the most zombies"", ""loot the most value worth of items"" and even races. Hopping along the rooftops and slaughtering hundreads of undeaed beasts in this game is more satisfying than it ever was in CoD, L4D, and other zombie titles. The 4v1 mode is downright amazing. You and your team are put up against a player controlled super-zombie-beast-demon (too amazing to explain). The beast has to get 10 kills before the survivors destroy 5 nests scattered across the whole map. Yes, the whole map. This mode has you and your friends back to back, fending off a beast that is faster than you, stronger than you, and that's out for blood. It's one of a kind, and it's just something you have to expierece for yourself The verdict. Just get the game. It's worth every penny, especially if you have friends to play it with.10/10 would bang. Er.. play again. Yeah.			"

												Firstly, some people say the story is crappy, alright it has quite a lot of cliches but it can be hard to avoid it, and imo i think the cliches didn't make the game worse and less enjoyable.The graphics are great and the gameplay mechanics make this a must-play zombie parkour game. This game contains gore to beautiful sights over Harran (the city the game is based in). Pretty addictive and fun to play with up to 3 other people or 4 in be the zombie mode. Night time is a whole new game, terrifying at first and intense :dVoice acting is great with Troy Baker as Crane (I think) and for me the story and game is very engaging. Cool skills and inventive ways to kill innocent people looking for suppliesWorth the money. Refund button does not work well xD			"

												From strangling zombie babies to dropkicking people from rooftops, Dying Light likes to approach the ever growing Zombie genre with a serious tone. If you've ever thought, ""This Zombie film/game doesn't have enough Spiderman"" then the Dying Light grappling hook is for you. The only downside to the game is the lack of waste disposal. Every high building or tower has a conveniant rubbish pile beside it, providing a soft landing if one were to jump. It can't be a coincidence that the only city to have a zombie virus outbreak also has such terrible hygiene. Play with friends if you can, try not to be scared of the dark, try to ignore the Left 4 Dead replica special zombies and recall your Skyrim lockpicking days. 9.6/10 Treat your bin men kindly.			"

												Dying Light. Assassin's Creed, Dead Island, Far Cry, and Mirror's Edge met together for a magnificent overnight romp and there are no regrets or mistakes in the combination.No fast travel, but you don't need that when you can parkour almost everywhere or run through the streets bouncing off of zombie heads like you're a horror story version of Mario Bros.Combat is decent. Prefered Dead Island's manual mode to where you could control the direction of your swings, but combat still flows.Predictable story, yet still gripping.In the beginning, night time is friggin' horrifying. Still can't look these zombies in the eyes when I try to say that I hate them. Many laughs to be had when you're drop kicking zombies off of roofs and into traps. Bring a friend or three to this zombie infested game of ""The Floor Is Lava"".9.5/10 Would shift into MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE while sprinting through zombie infested streets.			"

												If you loved the two Dead Island game, in spite of their flaws and many rough edges, then you will utterly adore Dying Light, which takes that familiar first-person zombie setting with mostly melee combat and adds a surprisingly enjoyable parkour mechanic to the mix which makes for a more fun game when you can avoid the ground. It is a far more polished game that Techland's previous Dead Island titles and, in the 48 hours I have been playing so far, I have not encountered many bugs or glitches and certainly no crashes.Some of the optional side quests are a bit repetitive and unoriginal but the main story missions are varied enough to keep me hooked if the plot itself is as generic as they come. The game is stupidly addictive to play and it is very easy to find that what was intended as quick ten minute session turns in a two hour one without you realising. Graphically the game is solid rather than impressive (that ghastly chromatic aberration effect absolutely needs a toggle setting though...) and the audio and voice-acting are good overall. The story and writing is not great but who cares when there's a city to explore and lots of undead to kill?Highly recommended.			"

												One playthrough, just finished.OK, this is a solid First-Person Errand Boy Simulator. With a zombie theme. The general gameplay is of a well-known type: Run across town, get things done, don't get killed and don't kill yourself by accident. The story is pretty good, especially so for the zombie-themed game, the atmosphere, especially in the beginning, is fantastic - later you'll become a sort of Conan the Barbarian in the Zombieland, so the appeal of the grim and agressive zombie-infested environment will move from appealing to tedious. As usual, I'd say. Still, quite enjoyable, solidly build and exciting game.Good things:+Mostly nice and compelling story with a good pace. The protagonist, Crane, is, simply put, a nice guy to have around when you play. He is quite vocal, to the point that his attitude sometimes happen to mirror the player's emotions - oh, the frustration of moving through the zombie hordes to get one stupid keycard... it almost brings down the forth wall, in a good way. Also, he is not entirely stupid, which is a grace - you won't feel that ""Oh snap, why my character's idiotic perosnality is forcing me to do all those dumb things?!"" feeling all that often, only episodically, and those can be forgiven, perhaps. The antagonist is a wink to the Far Cry 3 ""madness and chaos philosopy"" with a bit of a refreshing twist.+Crafting is not too sophisticated, it doesn't stand in your way, just look at your blueprints page from time to time to get better weapons, as you accumulate necessery resources. You may indulge yourself in a hunt for specific crafting parts, but they'll all come to you in time, all the same.+Parkour mechanics really shine here. Almost every horizontal surface that's not electrified or covered with wire is good for climbing. Just jump and grab whatever you reach - there's almost always something. No focus-breaking ""oooh, grab me!"" highlits, no cumbersome controls - less frustrating dumb missteps. Personally, I tend to be wary of parkour in games, but here it's actually enjoyable! The addition of the grappling hook helps mitigate the tediousness at the later stages.+Night/Day change. Night is scary, especially at the early stages. Not only there are super-deadly Volatiles out to hunt at night, but the darkness also makes is much harder to navigate, do freerunning and deal with zombies of general variety.+Character progression. You get points for different kinds of general gameplay activities and level up often enogh, just as you go around doing things. The extra abilites you earn are useful and evern add some fun to the repetitive action of zombie-hacking/evasion.+Just big enough map.+Nice visuals.+There are different types of zombies. Some of them can even do parkour, so don't expect just to walk above their heads!+Pretty solid ending.+Challenges are entirely optional, for those who are into that sort of thing.A bit of ranting about not so good things:-The general failures of zombie theme are here, although masked masterfully. The number of zombies doesn't really add up with any estimate you can make regarding the number of city residents, at least if you count the houses in the areas you can access.  Zombie design gets repetitive despite all the efforts of dressing them differently. And yes, judging from what can be seen of the zombies in the game, heavy military vechicles and gradual refortification of the city districts would deal with them... all in all, the whole zombie theme is not all that believable, as usual. But we still love the genre!)-Towards the end, the story starts to drag a little bit, although it does get good for the final moments.-As already noted above, your protagonist will become the heroic zombie trasher, hacking them with wickedly modified blades and stomping their heads with mighty army boots. Ah, also, you'll be Batman with that grappling hook of yours.So, for the special story missions, which are supposed to be hard, the game will awkwardly strip you of your power by suddenly forcing you to deal with infection-caused exhaustion. Just ten minutes ago you kicked any♥♥♥♥♥in town, and now you are a shambling wreck, just in time for the story twist.  Yeah, and no grappling hook, make do with jumps! Oh, come on!In summary, surpisingly good game, definitely worth a try! "

												TL;DR: A great open world survival game with tons of stuff and zombie smashing to do with developers listening and patching accordingly. CO-OP works fine now and it's better optimized so to all the people having read the bad reviews take THIS into account. If you're into this kind of game, I highly recommend it. It's GREAT!Now my review:I never actually intended to buy this game, until my friends suggested it. And here I am 50 hours later I've been playing one of the few games that have hooked me in a LONG time.It has a bit of Far Cry and Mirrors edge with a dash of Fallout in it. The parkour and freerunning system is so smooth you never want to use roads/stairs/streets etc.When night falls and you decide to stay outside safezones, you often find your self in FIGHT or FLIGHT situations.Pros:- You can bash a zombies skull in until your weapon breaks- Great combat system with a lot of different meleeweapons (in the end game there are fewer though)- Night time is extremely fun and exhilarating, and offers various challenges. (It has day and night cycle, which if you choose you can skip by staying in a safezone and sleep until the morning).- Good weapon customization and crafting. You want a kitchen knife which electrifies zombies? Slap on a powercable some batteries and a conductor, tighten it with ductape and you're good to go. Real McGyver stuff right there. You want an old fashioned double-barrel shotgun to split zombies in half with? You get that too.- A lot of sidequests, varying from interesting to down right awesome!- Supersmooth parkour/freerunning system which makes escaping and/or exploring really fun- At night stealth is really a good option, which makes it exciting- You can bash a zombies skull in until your weapon breaks.And much more!Cons:- Story was OK but nothing special, the ending was kind of dissapointing.- When you're at max level you have a smaller selection of weapons which are viable.- You can't just kill a zombie, you have to make sure it's dead by bashing it with your hammer until there's just a pulp left, or maybe that's just me.... (Not really a con, it's awesome).I really do recommend this game, and I think you should buy it. If you like open world games with deep survival elements you will not be dissapointed. You can bash a zombies skull in until your weapon breaks. The main reason I bought the game, but hey.. I now know that it's one of the best I've played in a long time!Thank you for reading. Good night, and GOOD LUCK!			"

												A fun game that merges parkour aspect with zombie killing. Overall I find the game to be quite solid. Free running is quite intuitive and enjoyable, I've never encoutered any bigger glitches. Zombies are more durable than in most other zombie games, but for the most part you just run past them and avoid them. The fact that your character can do parkour really gives you an advantage. It's a nice experience. Combat is quite easy to learn and skill trees make for a nice addition. The story and acting are a lot batter than in Dead Island (previous game from this developer). There are side quests in this game, and although some are fun and interesting, majority of them are simply boring. Being out of the safe zone at night is really dangerous. Not only it's hard to see stuff, but there are dangerous kinds of zombies that go after you. Some quests actually require you to go out at night. After some hours Dying Light starts to feel a bit repetitive though... Another fault is that the map we get to explore could be a bit bigger... And while it isn't ""huge"", it doesn't have a fast travel option. I find running from one end of the map to the other a bit tiresome sometimes. But all things considered, it's a good game.			"

												Don't go into the game expecting a Zombie Murder Simulator (like Dead Island). Dying Light is a survival game at heart with a bit of optional stealth. You'll spend time scavenging for materials and equipment and the game generally rewards exploration. You'll never be quite so happy to find string and bits of metal as you will be when playing Dying Light.The parkour elements are pretty damned good, although there are a few jumps that are hard to guage. Overall, it's basically like Mirror's Edge in this regard, without the visual queues though.No weapon is permanent, everything will break down or run out of ammo. This forces you to keep scavenging for new stuff, to keep upgrading your equipment. Also, there's still an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ designer who likes to put exploding zombies behind doors.			"

												Great wonderful game. I sat down to play this game at 6:00 PM (18:00) and it is now 4:00 AM (this one's the same). I have spent more hours in my first playsession of this game than in other games I own in multiple playsessions. I did run into a few bugs and it took me an hour to find the chocolates, (it makes sense if you play the game) I still felt compelled to keep playing. Great game overall wonderful new ip.P.S. Be warned you will never look at the night the same again.			"

												Wow this was a nice suprice, a great storyline that has both humor and sad parts that will keep you gripped, add some pretty awesome graphics, and it all roles to make this a great open world sandbox for you to explore. Once you've mastered the controls and get some decent weapons then zombie killing becomes so much fun, but dont get cockey as you will get bitten.okay peeps stay safe, and dont get caught outside after dark..... PEACE!			"

												Dying light is a deffinitive step up from the Dead Island games, works great, looks good and has the feel of leaving last gen behind. Good open world feel, with good freerunning and looting.  9/10, only minus is at times i died alot just from failing that hook xD			"

												Attention to detail. I am a sucker for detail, and this game really has it, you can really feel how much polishing and effort went into this game, the physics based combat provides plenty of fun ways to kill zombies, mostly consisting of kicking and drop kicking, the character movement feels smooth and is genuinely fun. The skills and leveling feel very rewarding, running around at night is scary but it's made worth it in XP gains. This game is a 10/10 when it comes to gameplay, not many games provide the level of satisfaction that this game does. Performance is this games weakest point and what initially kept me from buying this game. On a R9 270x my fps gets pretty bad fluctuations, the good thing is that it's only in the beggining where it's unbearable, after you get away from the towers then gameplay becomes smooth.The story, quests, and dialog feels 'realistic' and interesting although being a little predictable. My only real complaint is that I recieved a quest to collect 3 100lb bus batteries, the giver made specials notes about it being heavy and requiring ape like strength, but when collecting the batteries they went into my inventory just like any other item. Most people would have a difficult time scaling walls and fences with 300 pounds of batteries shoved up their♥♥♥♥♥			"

Build on a foundation of Dead Island merged with Mirror's Edge & Far Cry 4 it includes many of my favorite elements from other favorite zombie survival games all in one package. The controls feel solid, your body has wieght, the skill trees are excellent, and night time is TERRIFYING! Seriously my favorite Co-Op & Zombie Survival game in a long time if not ever. 11/10 worth every penny, would buy again!			"

												It took me a while to really get into the game because in the beginning you're slow and it takes forever to whack a zombie to death with your stupid little stick with a nail in it or whatever. But after a while when you level upp and learn to dropkick and get some better weapons it becomes a lot of fun. The story is pretty corny though.			"

												This is the first review of a game I've done on Steam. These days due to personal time constraints and other interests, it seems as though I finish very few games - especially open world ones like Dying Light. In open world games, I always get distracted by side missions and over time I lose interest in the story and move on to some other game. However, Dying Light kept my interest the entire time! I cannot place my finger on it, but this game was unique and absolutely engrossing for me. I'll probably go back in and finish the side missions I didn't complete before finishing the main story.I RARELY went out at night unless a mission required it. I'm so glad a fast travel system was not included. It was interesting to see myself react when I knew night was coming and I was a distance from a safe house. The game is not full of jump scares like Alien: Isolation (a game I wanted to love but hated - the problem was me...not the game).I have not played multiplayer or done any of the challenges so I cannot comment on that. I simply did the story and many side missions.I cannot recommend this game enough!			"

												As a Dead Island fan I can honestly say that this game is the best actual zombie game (fps). Play it at the game's night time and get ready to crap yourself.

												Great zombie survival game to play with your friends. If you like parkouring/scavenging/exploring and anything else that I didn't mention, buy this game. But the price of this game would not really satisfy some users, I recommend to wait for steam sales.Only thing bothers me that once you complete the game then you have a chance to play a second walkthrough the new game plus, which means you can keep your skills/equipment, but enemies are tougher. I personally didn't notice any difficulty changes. Rather than that just seek out for some great mods that will change the gameplay for your own desire.Edit: After DLC release The Following and Enhanced Edition. Game has been improved very well. They added this Nightmare mode which rocks hard so far, very challanging, especially if you are soloing. Totally recommending for those who are hardcore players and looking for a real challange.More Edit: Well after progressing with legendary ranks you will get stronger and finding better weapons.. game comes quite back to normal difficulties to fight off the zombies.. still not the same like having infinite stamina. Nightlife is still dangerous, not like sandwich in one hand and controller in another hand.			"

												This is the best open world zombie game until now... parkour is so smooth and it's atmosphere is so dark. It is like playing AC, FarCry, Mirrors Edge and Dead Island at the same time. Story is short and not so original in my opinion and some missions are boring. Too much go there open that, go there grab that... missions. Coop offers so much fun. But in Night Hunter Mod there are some people that who uses exploits, cheats etc. They sit in UV Zone and they force you to leave. If you like parkour and zombies JUST BUY IT!8/10			"

And the decisions you make affect your whole journey.I have already played Dead Island, but this game is a complete whole experience. If you are in doubt in buying it, you should really do, it is expensive but try to catch on a promotion, it really worth you money.Do you recommend this game?No, I do not my ""Frend"" (russian accent please).I love this game right now, it makes me think which game is my favourite one.

												Let me start off by saying this is one of my favorite games and in my opionion is definatly worth the purchase.  However if you are looking through reviews thinking about buying this game here is my 2 cents about the pros and cons of this game.Story (Main game)+ Easy to follow+ Can really build a nice atmosphere in some of the dark rooms/sewer tunnels- Story can be a little bit predicatble- Characters are a litlle bit dull, none of them really shine- You have your sterotypical bad guy, which anybody that has played a game with an antagonist has seen before+/- All story missions can be played with a friend! ...except the final mission* The story is a weak part of the game, not going to lie, however it more than makes up for this with its gameplay.Gameplay (Main Game)+ Has a beautiful free movement system that will have you running, climbing and jumping from one obstacle to the next one with fluid yet effective movements+ Optimizes the slow motion really well to show off those hard hitting kills+ Interactive enviroment that can help you rack up multiple kills effortlessly without having to use resources+ You SERIOUSLY didn't skip leg day, the proof is in the drop kick+ If you find the game too easy/too hard change the difficulty+ Lots of gore for you and the whole family to enjoy+ Wide open map to explore+ Night time is INTENSE with a dark room and headphones- After you reach max level and all missions are completed, killing lots of zombies does get dull- If you have a very slow compueter some of the speed challanges are unfortunalty impossible, due to the lag causing your computer to make you run slower, while the timer is working at normal speed+/- Singleplayer gets boring quite quickly if your not grinding missions, playing with a friend gives the experience a whole new dimension of fun+/- The game will start off with it being a chore to kill a single zombie, however when you reach the end-game you can kill dozens easily with all the perks and stronger weapons you find (i've labelled this a +/- due considering some players like the challange of survival, where others like mowing down hordes of the undead)* This is what makes the game essentialy what you want it to be, have competions on who has the most stylish kills, most kills in general or who can make it the fastest up a giant building, its up to you!Multiplayer (Be the Zombie)+ At the beginning you truley feel powerful as the zombie, latching on to a target and ripping them apart grusomely is one of the most satisfying things you can do as the zombie+ (This is my personal experience, some of you guys might not be as much of a ♥♥♥♥♥ as i am). When i was first the human, I was seriously shaking in my chair, knowing there was an ultra powerful super zombie stalking me ready to pounce at the first oppurtunity he/she/(it?) got. Your character really sounds scared and the sound track helps with that... a lot.+ The slow motion used in this is beautiful, it really brings out the power in the human's and the zombie's  attacks.- There is no tutorial from the human side, if you don't have zombie invasions disabled and you haven't seen this before... your gonna have a bad time- The game looses it's hunt or be hunted theme and becomes more of a game of chess where you know exactly where the opposition is when you become more experienced at the game- Early game: Wow the hunter is so OP. Late game: Wow the human is so OP.- I have seen A LOT of cheaters more or less all of them from the human side* I fell in love with the multiplayer at first, however after 7+ hours of it, it just lost it's charm and didn't feel as enjoyable in my opinionBozak's Horde (DLC)+ Fast paced challanges that will keep you on your toes+ The Bozak's Bow is the end reward for completing and only bow worth using, the normal bow is a waste of inventory space- Very repetative, challanges are not randomly generated and so when done enough you know the exact challanges in the exact order* Quite a nice challange to add, however nothing too big other than the only way to obtain the best bow in the gameThe Following (DLC)+ You get to drive a buggy, rigged with flamethrowers, an electric cage and NITRO BOOST so you can run over zombies instead of cutting them to tiny pieces+ The new gun; the SMG is a nice alternative to use, the most fun weapon in my opinion+ The new map; ""The Countryside"" is HUGE+ Freaks of nature are very fun boss fights, especially with friends+ Volitile nests are a very nice challange and for the insane you can do them during the day- There is a lot less free running due to the maps flat nature+/- The story and nature of how you play is quite different, whether that is good or not is up to you* The DLC is PACKED with new content and an alternative way to play, definatly worth it in my opinionI would definatly recommend this. But don't buy it without your parent permission, cause if mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.			"

												The game is fun to play but I cannot help feeling a little bit disappointed for the price I paid. I bought it when it first came out so it was pricey. If you play the game and follow the main plot, you can finish the game quite quickly. I suppose the game play design is quite good as I find myself playing the plus level, then hard, then hard plus. And my next plan is to play the game without any weapon, Not sure if anyone has done this from the very start. There are already videos on youtube with player using bare hand but he or she is max out already.The co op side of the game is fun if you play with friends. Playing with someone you don't know can be frustrating but then again, it can be fun if you don't mind roaming around. In the game, there is an invasion mode where other player can play as zombie and ""invade"" your game. I have to say, I was bored with that mode after being invaded for the third time.  I don't know. I found myself just hacking away something that don't move... OK, if you are playing invasion mode on your own, it may be a challenge but in coop mode, I find it a little boring.By now, most bugs are fixed which is good as you cannot duplicate your best weapon or upgrades. So, you will have to keep an eye on your weapon. I started playing the game when some bugs were there to allow me to duplicate stuff. That actually shortened the playtime. All in all, the game is fun to play. I really like the parkour bit. This makes this game stands out from other zombie game. I played Dead Island but I never played it a second time. I played this game over seven time because of the parkouring bit.Edit: Now with the update of Enhanced Edition, NOW we are talking. This is what the game should be from the beginning. With the nightmare mode, it becomes one of the best games I have played since I joined Steam. Some may complain that it is ridiculously hard due to some of the new features of the game but I call it a real challenge. Almost all exploit glitches have been rid of, apart from the dupl glitch in PS4. Well, there bound to be someone who will look for a way to beat any system or shortcuts, however you call it. Well done, Techland.			"

From the graphics, to the controls, the mechanics,to the audio, and even the voice acting is top notch.The terrain is delightful and deverse, and the monsters are truly fun to kill. An oponet with equal powers and access to the same weapons and skills as everyone else would make this game a game to beat all other games. If they could just make it so we could kill each other in this game, human against human.... WOW.			"

												Exceeded my expectations for the game. Overall it's a great game to play and finish the story mode with a friend or just on your own. Personally, few hours in game I can't do everything by myself being with a friend or group of people would make the missions easier and at ease. During night time, them volatiles see/hear you they run up to you like you opened a pack of gum in school LOL. I don't regret buying this game during sale. I've met a few great people in-game who were joining my public lobby and shared some great tips and tricks. They even donated high leveled weapons for me to be able to survive = D All in all, enjoy the game and keep grindin' = )			"

												The game is fun to play but I cannot help feeling a little bit disappointed for the price I paid. I bought it when it first came out so it was pricey. If you play the game and follow the main plot, you can finish the game quite quickly. I suppose the game play design is quite good as I find myself playing the plus level, then hard, then hard plus. And my next plan is to play the game without any weapon, Not sure if anyone has done this from the very start. There are already videos on youtube with player using bare hand but he or she is max out already.The co op side of the game is fun if you play with friends. Playing with someone you don't know can be frustrating but then again, it can be fun if you don't mind roaming around. In the game, there is an invasion mode where other player can play as zombie and ""invade"" your game. I have to say, I was bored with that mode after being invaded for the third time.  I don't know. I found myself just hacking away something that don't move... OK, if you are playing invasion mode on your own, it may be a challenge but in coop mode, I find it a little boring.By now, most bugs are fixed which is good as you cannot duplicate your best weapon or upgrades. So, you will have to keep an eye on your weapon. I started playing the game when some bugs were there to allow me to duplicate stuff. That actually shortened the playtime. All in all, the game is fun to play. I really like the parkour bit. This makes this game stands out from other zombie game. I played Dead Island but I never played it a second time. I played this game over seven time because of the parkouring bit.Edit: Now with the update of Enhanced Edition, NOW we are talking. This is what the game should be from the beginning. With the nightmare mode, it becomes one of the best games I have played since I joined Steam. Some may complain that it is ridiculously hard due to some of the new features of the game but I call it a real challenge. Almost all exploit glitches have been rid of, apart from the dupl glitch in PS4. Well, there bound to be someone who will look for a way to beat any system or shortcuts, however you call it. Well done, Techland.			"

												Exceeded my expectations for the game. Overall it's a great game to play and finish the story mode with a friend or just on your own. Personally, few hours in game I can't do everything by myself being with a friend or group of people would make the missions easier and at ease. During night time, them volatiles see/hear you they run up to you like you opened a pack of gum in school LOL. I don't regret buying this game during sale. I've met a few great people in-game who were joining my public lobby and shared some great tips and tricks. They even donated high leveled weapons for me to be able to survive = D All in all, enjoy the game and keep grindin' = )			"

												This game is absolutely amazing. It does everything right.- It barely has glitches, and the ones it does have aren't game-breaking.- The story isn't exactly the best ever, but it does a good job at keeping you interested.- The freerunning is smooth and epic.- Night-time can be really scary.-  Both the crafting and skill trees are well made, and require active input to get right.- There are hilarious jokes scattered everywhere.Overall, you should totally buy this game, as Techland did an AMAZING job at it.

												Dying Light is a great open-world zombie game by Techland. Let me start by saying that the main story is not good. It had its moments but overall, it's a bad story. Lots of cliches and silly actions made by characters. Approach it with humor and it will be less of a pain. The characters aren't that interesting.  Open world/sandbox gameplay  is fun, 2 Huge towns to explore plus, a dozen or so, smaller areas. This isn't Dead Island, there are no cars as of yet but why would you need cars when the game has a great parkour system, similar to Mirror's Edge but with enhancements. It's really easy to get use to it and the areas are well designed. All this makes exploration quite enjoyable. Oh, right - Exploration!  There's tons of easter eggs, loot and fun things to see in Haran (the fictional city in which the action takes place)      The  combat   is really good too, similar to Skyrim and Far Cry 3. There's tons of weapons and weapon types and a great and easy to use upgrade system, allows for a great variety of customisation. You can add various elemental type damages to the weapons, use scavenged materials to create tons of things like throwing knives, consumables etc. Leveling up is also similar to Skyrim.      There are three categories: Agility, Power and Survivor. The more you do a certain action like running and climbing, the more exp you get. Tons of skills to choose from with fun abilities like heads climbing, ""flying kick"", ram attacks, drop attacks and many more, make murdering hordes of zombies very fun.      I've completed the main story and 90% of side quests, all of which were much more fun and interesting than the main story. It took me over 50 hours and I don't regret anything. I haven't encountered many bugs except one where it caused me to fall through the floor but it was before all the patches so I'm sure it's fixed. Overall, money well spent. I'd give this  9/10 , it's one of my favourite games in 2015 so far. I can't wait for the DLCs (hopefully we'll get some fun things, like racing as shown in the upcoming/possible DLCs teaser).			"

												Dying light scared the crap out of me at times while at other times it made my stomach feel queasy.I loved it.I am not a big first person shooter fan these days, yet Dying Light had something to it that kept me interested. I had almost no interest in this game since I first heard of its announcement but its launch trailer triggered something in me that made me instantly buy it and play it that evening. I am certainly glad I did.-The parkour/free running, while at times a bit janky, was overall a joy to utilize. -The crafting systems I found to be very mediocre and basic but I still used it and made some rather unusual devices that I had fun playing around with. (explosive throwing stars)-The guns were balanced well, making them useless against zombies but effective against humans. While melee was the opposite I found.-The day / night cycle was great. Worked wonderfully, especially the first half of the game where nightime made me feel completely helpless, it was terrifying at times and even scared people watching over my shoulder.-The story was decent, a variety of unusual characters to come across and confront in interesting ways.I recommend this game if you're looking for a fun, fast paced, survival horror, shooter game. It's like dead island meets skyrim. :)Of course these are all very basic points explaining a very detailed game and I am not exactly a wordsmith, so here is a video of some of my favorite moments from the game to give you a better idea if you're still on the fence. (no story spoilers)

												( I think everyone should include these before their review)System specs:MOBO: ASRock Z97 Pro3CPU: Intel Core i5 4670K @ 3.40GHzRAM: 8.00GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 798MHz (9-9-9-24)Vid card: NS-40D510NA15 (1920x1080@60Hz) 4096MB ATI AMD Radeon R9 200 SeriesGameplay:- The mechanics are awesome but they take a little time to get good at even more to master, jumping, grabbing ledges, using your moves effectively without messing everything up and getting into a bad situation will take you a little while.- The enemy A.I. is decent enough ( I wish more zombies would come after you at a time but whatever). Humans are hard as hell to deal with I'm struggling with them, they parry and dodge way too much since Crane (main character) is such a ♥♥♥♥♥ and gets tired after roughly 5-6 swings of his weapon in the beginning.- The story is alright there are parts that you just have to watch and get no choice in (this really pisses me off but in the games defense the story couldn't progress otherwise. I would have liked more choice but what can you do.)I'll leave this up and edit it once I'm farther in it is a decent game maybe priced a little high I would like to see some more of you in the co-op portion but at 50-80 dollars I don't blame you.All and all I'm glad I picked it up.

												Dying Light is a zombie fighting survival game. PRO:-The Day/Night cycle is very well done and help build the atmosphere of the game as zombies scale to your level, so unless you join a friend who is just starting out, fighting is always a challenge no matter what time of the day.-There's always a place to explore and scavenge, seriously like holy cow there's so much to find and look for I don't think you understand how much was put into the maps.-Graphics aren't mindblowingly awesome but are gritty enough to really make you feel you are in a war-torn zombieland.-The game doesn't shove crafting in your face. Like really all you need to craft early on is about 20 med packs, and you really don't need to do anything else. As a guy who really despises games who throw in crafting just to make it a selling point, it was reasuring to see that it wasn't a main focous of the development. -Bashing heads dead or alive is so satisfying, really just seeing these litte buggers collapse to a well placed dome swing is just so rewarding in of itself.-Mod suport!-Night time is absolutely horrifying. During my time in the game I've never wanted to land once on the ground due to fear of what lurks below.CON:-Horrendously unoptimized. I've got a decent machine that can at least run these current gen types of games at high graphic levels, but all graphical features are either off or set on low. -Freerunning isn't 100% ready, so you'll either be making jumps you didn't want or fall to your death multiple times.-The game itself feels like it needed another month to squash out these bugs, though to their credit the dev team has been patching the game every 3 or so days, so at least they've been taking care of their baby (unlike most AAA games released these days). -The main story really isn't something to sing praises, plot holes galore, uninteresting, tries to force emotion by taking lives of characters that aren't really estableshed, and the main villain acts like he's so deep and understands that humans are scum bla bla bla. All in all it takes maybe 4 hours if you power through missions like crazy. TL;DR7.5/10 if you like the number system. All in all just straight up fun zombie survival game that feels like it had lots of love put into it, something that you don't see in games of this caliber these days. Has bugs, but the developers have been patching this game to bring it to the high standards they've set themselves since release. "

Nice story, amazing picture, amazing atmosphere, tons of secrets and funny things. Gameplay is very challengeable, especially in coop. There is no time to be bored: you always able to find what to do even if the game is 100% completed. I bought this game right after release and still playing.

												A lot of people doubted this game on forehand, including myself. But now that I've just finished the campaign, I can say no less than that this is the best Zombie-survival game I have ever played so far!Not only is there a great combination of combat and parkour that mix up with each-other in a very awesome way, it also has a very good story that really dragged me in and almost made me demand myself to finish it.The graphics look absolutely amazing and the movement is very smooth but still challenging at some times (so not always too easy).Especially in the beginning parkour is not gonna be easy, but you earn skillpoints as you make progress to unlock better stamina, parkour skills, weapons and combat techniques and even a freaking grappling hook! Parkour isn't just there because 'it's cool', but you're actually gonna need it to survive as the street are sometimes literally crowded up by zombie-hordes!Lot's of very cool and modifiable weapons, from standard pipes and wrenches to machine rifles and fire-hatches.Also, this is the first game that actually gave me a bit of 'the chills' at night.It's not just like the lights go off and it's just a bit darker. No, it can get really flipping dark.. Sometimes you really aren't able to see a damn thing without your flashlight!But that's just a small detail considering that at night, the zombies get more aggressive, start to hunt you down and lots of stronger, faster and smarter zombies get out of their holes.All in all i'd say that if you're in to survival, zombies, a bit of horror, a good story and/or parkour, really don't hesitate to buy this game! And the best part is; I may have finished the campaign the other day, but i'm still able to play co-op with my friends and just have some fun or do the actual campaign with them!Only thing that could've made this game even better are a bow and arrow and maybe a bit less loot as it's really easy to find certain things. And they maybe could've developed some characters a bit more in the story.All in all, i'd say 9,2/10! "

It feels very much like Mirror's Edge/Dead Island.The parkour is fun, along with the game. I cannot wait to progress further into the story.			"

												Hi all.First I wanted to warn you that this is one of my first reviews :). All what I write here is MY feels on the game. By the way sorry for my english, I'm from Poland :D.Important note:I haven't completed the whole game yet because it's so fun and I don't want to complete it so fast :).Introduction:Dying Light is an open world zombie survival horror FPS game with great parkour elements. Game is like a mix of Mirror's Edge parkour style with Dead Island slashing zombies gameplay style. Game feautures 4 player Co-op and you can complete whole campaign with your buddies or random players. There is also 4vs1 Be the zombie mode which lets play as the night hunter :).Story:I don't want to spoil anything, so I will tell you only first minutes of the game but just in case SPOILER ALERT!!!You are Kyle Crane, GRE agent with special classified mission which you will see on yourself ;). You are dropped to Harran city but the situation got little complicated. I won't tell you the rest because story is interesting and you need to see it on yourself ;).I don't want to get you bored so quickly so I will go straight to Pros and Cons :).Pros:+ Amazing and satisfying gameplay that gives a lot of fun.+ Parkour is AWESOME and it's better than in Mirror's Edge :D.+ Interesting story( at least for me :) ).+ Very good optimization.+ Nice graphics and sound effects.+ Good soundtrack.+ Co-op and Be the zombie mode.+ Atmosphere.+ Good voice acting.+ Lots of secrets and Easter Eggs.+ Many little side stories.+ Main and side quests.+ Day and night cycle which completely changes the gameplay.+ Weapons wear out.+ EXP system and character skill tree.and more :DCons:- Lip sync is  sometimes weird :D.I can't remember more. Maybe some little bugs that are hard to find ;).Finally I wanted to say to all that have doubts about Dying Light . BUY this game, it's so EPIC, you won't regret this decision :). Thank you for getting to this point of my review :).P.S. If you don't need cards from Dying Light I will be honored to take care of them :).			"

												(EDIT: Post-game realizations: The survivor level determines the quality of the leveled weapons you get. The reason why early game zombies last longer than your weapons do is because the leveled loot goes from 20 dmg to 700 dmg. There is no way to balance that and DL doesn't even try. Post game, you are one shotting everything.The hammer bosses have terribly broken hit boxes. Their swings hit at least three feet beyond their actual point of impact in every direction.Explosions still instakil you and they never become not stupid. DL loves loves LOVES throwing exploding zombies just behind doors.In the end, the ragdoll zombies are IMMENSE fun. Caving zombies heads in, cutting their heads off and kicking their corpses over the edge, drop kicking them with all the force of a wrecking ball, this NEVER gets old. It's just that Techland still loves all the same utterly stupid stat-heavy crap they threw in Dead Island.)Dying Light is a game you play to have something to play. Don't get me wrong, the parkour and climbing is better than Mirror's Edge, which a lot of crazy leaps and bounds. The zombie open world is like nothing you've seen and does an excellent job of keeping you off the ground and looting houses. The night time where you are sneaking around super powered mutants is always a joy, especially on hard where their vision cones are gone.The downside is... for every one of these mechanics where the feel is just right, the game fumbles something else twice as bad. Zombies have too much HP early game until the weapons start arbitrarily leveling up. The Dead Island loot treadmill is thankfully gone but there still is a completely unnecessary leveling system. Weapons don't last long enough to bother crafting mods for them and that is 90% of your crafting and gathering game. You can have a zombie down on the ground and bash its head against the pavement a dozen times and it will get back up while you are catching your breath.Human combat is even worse. Humans take forever to kill and cannot be knocked down or stunned with ease so the game just comes to a total stop when you have to fight some. The hammer bosses are so easy but take even LONGER to kill and are forced kills for a lot of quests.Exploding zombies are instant kills at any level of HP and have stupid range. Travelling at night? Open the wrong door? Back to the respawn. A random shooting human will do the same thing to you too and he's part of the quest.There is no death penalty to speak of. Same as Dead Island. Just a slight loss of XP. The game apparently tacitly understand that there is no ""skillful"" play of Dying Light so it decides not to punish mistakes.There are no interesting quests, which is not so bad as the game is really in ""get around zombies, loot buildings, climb things"" That gameplay loop is pretty satisfying.In the end, it's a solid, workmanlike game. Fumbled pretty much all the little things so Dying Light will never be a great game, merely a good one, but what it does do it does well. Give it a shot. There's not much else that has tried what it has.			"

												Played this before Dead Island, as a result, I can't play Dead Island because being unable to jump over 2 foot tall bush hedges ruins the experience entirely.This game has it all and multiplayer is not required for a good time, infact, I would suggest that the real experience is the single-player. Although, I always abuse the frozen time mechanic in the first few missions and activate the safe houses before continuing with the story, because ya, the night is dark and full of terrors.			"

												This is defenetly one of the most entertaining games I have ever played, the story is great, the character movement feels so right and really fits the whole parkour theme. I cannot get enough of this game. The matchmaking/co-op mode is perfectly stable and I have made a lot of friends through random matchmaking. I can't remember the last game that had me hooked like this.			"

Story line is awesome, co-op is amazing, got allot of things to do like just go out in the open world and slay zombies or hop from roof to roof.And also 9/10 for slaying kebab eaters (Just joking pls no haterino)I would recommend every gamer to get this game and atleast try it out.

												dying light was a fantastic game from start to finish. while i feel the story itself wasn't that long in either the main game or the following dlc, there was plenty of side missions and activities to keep me interested/distracted. 81 hours in and even though i've beaten the story, most of the side missions, and the following dlc (i don't have the bozak horde or ultimate survival bundle) i still find myself coming back to dying light for a number of reasons. the parkour system is the best i've ever seen. while the grappling hook detracts from the realsim of running around a city or across a countryside, it's quite an enjoyable addition and invaluable when it comes to quickly crossing the city of harran or getting back to your car to chase down the latest medical drop (SO happy they brought that back for the dlc) or rush off to help some random survivor from zombies or Rais's thugs. scattered around the city and countryside are plenty of challenges or races to keep you coming back. i wish there was a way to go from the city to the countryside without quitting to the main menu and starting up the dlc, but it's not much of an issue. i cannot stress enough how much fun it is to hop in your buggy and plow through a field of zombies and pop out the other side of the field to see yet another field of zombies to plow through. they really stepped up the carnage in the following dlc. i love it. and they don't make the car overpowered, either. if you smash into too much stuff and break different parts, the performance of the buggy noticably starts to suffer. ruined tires make you spin out, a busted accelerator means you're not gonna reach top speed fast enough. run out of gas and you're screwed until you find more. by the end of the main game, i wasn't that scared of volatiles or the night time anymore-the following changed all that. volatiles not only feel more dangerous, they're more numerous. and fast. so freaking fast. oh yeah! and the bolter liver repeatable side quest. hunting down bolters in your buggy to run them over and snatch their livers. all in all, if you like zombie games or parkour games or open world games, dying light is not a game you would wanna pass up			"

												Very amazing game. Was actually pleasantly surprised. The gameplay is brilliant and keeps you on your toes. The free-running mechanics are excellent, and you will not run out of things to do quickly. The story is amazing, as well. Some performance issues here and there, but they are SLOWLY releasing patches to fix most of the stuttering/FPS drops that occur, although I didn't have a huge problem with it. Not super high replay value, but to finish up lose quests, there is a free roam at the end of the game, for anyone that is wondering. Most all games have a free roam at the end, now. And don't take this as a spoiler. This is all spoiler free. All in all, I'd say this game is definitely worth the price.			"

												Like Dead Island but good. Pros - Combat feels satisfying. lots of weapon customisation. Cons - too much customisation. There's an amendment for every weapon type when it'd be cleaner just to have one type of amendment (ie low acid, medium acid, high acid / fire / shock etc) and make it universal to all weapon types. I dunno about anyone else, but I honestly just used swords the entire game except a brief period near the start where I was rocking an acidic baseball bat. Cons - Story. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥Rais is the most irritating villain ever, too much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t blah blah blah philosophy, and then to make the final battle a QTE when that hasn't been a thing the entire game was some straight up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Also the ""twist"" that your employers are the bad guys was immediately apparent from the first minute of the game. Tl;DR - fun game, worth playing, but don't buy it for the story.			"

												Parkour + Zombies = win.Seriously though, I found Dead Island uninspired and boring, so this was not on my radar, however on some pretty high recommendations from a few steam friends, I ended up snagging it. Now I could safely say this game was the very embodiement of pure unadultared fun. (And I haven't even tried co op, only the multiplayer)At 100% story completion, I could say this game tells a serviceable tale, with some genuinely interesting characters. This game elicited far more emotion than games like bioshock infinite and I actually gave a crap about the main characters. All in all, the story got the job done. The parkour itself, was dreamlike, Techland my hat is off to you, this was pulled off perfectly. So fluid, so natural, I could tell you guys poured your heart and soul into this title and you have my utmost respect. The combat however, was a little hit and miss with fighting zombies, and felt too simiar to dead island, however the combat with humans was pretty satisfying. Also wasn't a fan of the gunplay sections, those felt tacked on.Another thing I didn't enjoy was the massive amount of side missions, I spent at least 20 hours on these, with a ton more left over at 100% story completion, some of them didn't weave into the main narrative and felt like more of a boring distraction. Granted some were entertaining, and the payoff was worth it, in terms of items and side story information. All in all I highly recommend this game. Traversal in games for some reason is a big deal for me,(Dragon Age i'm looking at you) and simply running, jumping, climbing,flipping,ground pounding, ziplining and jumpkicking around the map was immensely satisying. Looking foward to a sequel.			"

												Warning this review will change over time till the game has all dlc's!!!300hrs......still fun............Dying light is an amazing game given everything promised by the developers.  The game has gone on and became instant classic to the gaming community been playing the game for a while and I can never get bored except for just killings the infected up.  Been looking into the new download content the developers are promising more stuff to do and is they keep this up this game will never die hinting that they are still the number one in the zombie killing and parkor gaming business.  I've really been impressed with all the work in this game it has really gone a long way since it was announced and now everyone knows techland and will keep the promises to all gaming.  For those who waited I feel bad because you would never feel the experience of playing the best game released this year for the first time with everyone across the world when it was released because it was just awesome.Almost 50 hours beat it once doing another playthrough got to say i'm still dig this game really crunchy melee some gunplay and lots easter eggs plus humor. In all this was my favorite pre-order every it was all worth the hype behind tthey allowing modder to toy and make better with the game i'm still recommend play and getting a friend to join in all the zombie fun!!!!!!!!Game playReally simple kills of these build weapons survive all goes together but even worse at night the zombies are really fun to fight and runaway from also the missions that you can play will keep you busy for a while lots of game play hours plus lots of Easter eggs.  AtmosphereThe feeling of being chased by infected individuals is terrified but also trying to fight the living to is really more frightening the game really goes into the depths of how the apocalypse could be as the world gets infected that music really suits the game.Also feel free to leave a comment so i know what i could work on my reviews			"

												Dying Light is a delightful and fresh game. The sneak and run system is similiar to that of Dishonered while the rest of the game is closely related to dead island and far cry. The zombie and crafting system is taken straight from dead island while the open world with random events is taken from the far cry series. Conclusion: A new take on the zombie genre with some new interesting concepts and ideas. 9/10Update: The game developers has initiated changes to the game early on concerning bugs and mod support. This proves that the developers care for the game and the community. BIG plus if you're interested in a bug free and frequently updated game.			"

												This is a great game. How often have I not decided to go do this quest a few hours before sundown thinking ""plenty of time"" only on the way to the objective I stumble on some other stuff to do, like this dude that wants help retrieving his fishing rod or something. *Looks at sun* ""sure I can do that, plenty of time still"". Then only 5 minutes before night, I complete the mission and reallize how close to evil night I am. Frantically begin sprinting and parkouring for the nearest safehouse. On the way I find a police van practically unguarded! Knowing how good the loot can get in these police vans I just gotta open it and get the goodies. After all it could be rifle ammo, or a new shiny weapon! Im usually not more than a minute or so picking the lock. Done looting, but oh ♥♥♥♥! it's almost 20:00, my watch is beeping, night is coming now! A few hundred yeards from the safehouse still it's too late, monsters emerges and I need to slow down and try to stealth my way back. Jumping over a fence I dump down practically in front of a dreaded volatile. Knowing it can rip me to shreds in seconds I flash my ultra violet lamp in it's general direction and decide to beeline straight for the safehouse. Several horrible grows tearing the silence behind me and action music fills my veins with adrenaline as I sprint for my life. From the growls I gather that several volatiles have joined in the hunt. Jumping down into a shallow wide crevice with a cracked concret pipe running in the middle I quickly slip into the pipe and crouch down in the corner hoping no one saw me go in. The monsters are shambling around on the outside with the distinct sound of them breathing. Sounds like air being sucked through shredded meat. But I think they don't know where I am. Then glorious ""pursuit evaded"" message appears. Phew. I now pay attention to the search cones on the minimap and successfully sneaks back to the tower.			"

												I'll simply start by saying that Dying Light is -- hands down -- the best open world game I've played in my entire gaming career. In fact, it's fast becoming one of my favorite all-time games (and I've been gaming since the '80s).As opposed to others in its genre (Assassin's Creed, Sleeping Dogs, Red Dead Redemption, Skyrim, ...), this game does not propel you from one mission to the other, having you grab for fast travel at every opportunity. No, you'll be crawling through the streets or jumping across roofs to try to get to your next mission alive! The in-between is just as much fun -- if not more so -- than the actual missions.Which is not to say that the story is bad, far from it. You'll find yourself engrossed in the unraveling story line, meeting interesting and colorful (and every now and then comical) characters, with voice acting well done ... finally!Add on top of that a seamless parcour gameplay, four completely different parallel RPG-style skill trees, a crafting system that finds the perfect balance between having to search for new material and using awesome weaponry -- until they are broken and you either repair it or build something new --, fantastic mo-capped animations for monsters, a tense and exciting day-night cycle, and to top it all off -- the lush cherry on the delicious whipped cream -- an unbelievably stunning graphics engine.Oh, and the zombies are sufficiently creepy and so very believable! This game has my heart pumping with fear, excitement, and relief dashing for the nearest safe zone while a viral or hunter is chasing me down. Something that hasn't happened ever since I played Thief in '98.Another thing I need to mention: every other game I've played like this is only really exciting for the first couple of hours. After that, I rely on save games to get away with recklessness and, given enough tries, complete whatever task I'm undertaking. Not so with Dying Light. Death is not permanent and you'll respawn in the nearest safe zone, but you will lose plenty of survival skill points, making you fall behind on that skill tree. That's incentive enough to be careful and make for a continuously tense and exciting game.Just one piece of advice, though: turn of the minimap and take your time to try to learn the layout of the city by heart. There are plenty of landmarks that help you find your way. This greatly improves on the immersion and gameplay.Pro:Beautifully hand-crafted open world. Not a single thing looks like a repeated pattern.Perfect open world gameplay. The game is playable without a minimap (and much more exciting for it) and because of the danger around every corner, you don't constantly feel like you want to fast travel.Stunningly beautiful graphics. Make sure you have a high-end machine for this.Great story and characters. You feel empathic and enthralled within the first five minutes.Intense zombie horror atmosphere. It's as close to the real thing as you can get.Realistic skill point system. Gain skill points in Agility, Power and Survival, by jumping/running/climbing, fighting, and completing quests, respectively.Diverse skill trees. Each skill tree has many interesting and useful skills, both passive and active. Choose your preferred style of play.Engaging item crafting system. Unlike most other games where crafting is fun for the first few hours and then gets way too easy and overpowered, Dying Light continuously forces you to make new weapons and gear, because the more you use them, the more you wear them out.Diverse weapons. Pimp your melee weapons by making them stronger, easier to handle, or more durable. Add electric, fire, poison or bleeding effects. Or use the very powerful firearms that kill your enemies with one shot (hopefully), but will attract many more with the noise it produces.Con: ... I'll let you know when (if?) I see one. "

												A really fun experience.Dying Light could be described as ""Yet another zombie game, with improved elements..."" in a short sentence. Yes it is a zombie game with a simple story line and simple objectives through the game. The main story is very simple, the company that created the game will use the well known elements of other zombie apocaliptic games and recycle them in the main story. As a matter of fact the side quests are also running from point A to point B.The graphics and the animations are great, and although you may experience some random lag now and then when playing on ultra settings it is a gorgeous trip through slums and a detailed city areas. The map is about 3 times bigger than that of the original Dead Island. One of the new elements introduced in Dying Light is the addition of free running. You will hop through roofs and obstacles while gaining ability points to level up your character in the 3 different skill trees. The leveling of your character depends on: mission objectives getting complete, slauthering the infected (or human enemies), or free running. There are again many different weapons you can combine and craft through the game and yet again the weapons will break relativly fast so the game forces you to change them or repair ofthen. Then there is the night gameplay, which makes the game hard and you will need to sneak around to prevent being chased by mutated infected cratures that will kill you in about four hits. The night is very dangerous and totaly different from the day cicle. Yes there is a constant day/night cicle in the game, which changes every houer. In conclusion Dying Light is an upgreated version of Dead Island with some fresh elements and dull mission objectives, however if you like sandbox games this is a fun game to mess around and an addition of night survival elements.The game is also very long with tons of sidequests and challanges to do!Good:- Graphics and overall presentation of the menus.- Many fun ways to slauther the enemies- Day/night cicles change the gameplay- Tons of quests and challanges to doBad:- Human AI can be aweful and gets stuck in corners- Mission objectives are dull (but the stories of survivals are cool to hear)- Some performance issues and some strange animations (fixed in patch ----)83/100Update:The game performance on PC have been improved and many glitches where fixed add another .4 to the score now.

Dying Light Co-op ReviewFirst and foremost, this review will be concentrating on the co-op side of Dying Light. A Quick note about solo playAs a single player game Dying Lights atmospheric tension and challenges are just what you would want from a survival horror game. The squalid and zombie infested environment of Dying Lights Harran somehow manages to retain a certain beauty and the  wonderfully crafted world draws you in making you want to explore every inch. The combat, weapon systems and movement are  beautifully balanced to offer players a challenge without being too tricky to master with a little practice. The night and day cycles require different approaches as night sees a clear advantage swing to the zombies. This game is more about being a  savvy player rather than all out hack and slash or bravely running away as both elements will be required equally, along with a healthy dose of stealth and cunning depending on the situation. There is plenty to keep you busy too with over 50 hours of game play. For the best experience set your gamma up correctly and play in the dark with headphones, it really ramps up the  tension and immerses you deeper into the game.As with most games these days you get a bevy of unlockable skills which you will soon come to rely as you progress and wish you had from the start. However the best tool by far is the grappling hook as it makes moving across the map and escaping the undead really flow. Unfortunately, you will need to put in at least 10 hours of game play before you unlock it.Coop - My Take on itThis is my review proper, the coop play of Dying Light and where my opinion seems to differ widely from everyone else. I will  say it now, I am not a fan of the co-op in this game. While some elements work others don't and at times it is more multiplayer PVP than it is coop. I increasingly found co-op annoying and more of a hindrance and an intrusion rather than a help. It's far from bad and it has its place, but, for the most part it is not what I would call true co-op play. Dying Light supports drop-in/ drop-out co-op for up to four players. The entire campaign is playable in co-op, and there are special co-op challenges.CombatOkay so you got me on this, (with the exception of ""Be The Zombie"" element which I will come to shortly) co-op combat is actually that as you can't fight each other and can work together killing zombies. However, this brings me to my main problem in co-op combat, it's too easy. Enemies do not scale with the amount of players and it rapidly changes the game of survival horror to hack and slash zombie clearance. Be the ZombieThe introduction of ""Be the Zombie"" is great if what you want a PVP multi-player combat element. It can be hilarious if you are playing with a few friends. However, the intrusion of random players in your game can be frustrating, even when they are not being the zombie and on your side there are some real idiots out there. Go afk for a second or start playing with your menus, etc., and before you know it your dead. I found this element novel at first, but it soon gets old and you find yourself in the menu system opting out of this. ""Be the Zombie"" is  definitely not a co-op element, but is a multiplayer PVP element.Story QuestsDying Light was built with co-op in mind and Mission progress is saved across all players’ games, which can cause problems  when joining a session which has progressed further down the story. This is most notable if you have a group of friends who regularly play and some of you play more often than others. Some of you can lose out on blocks of Story mode and associated  achievements. ChallengesAgain, these can be fun, especially when playing with a group of close friends, however, they have absolutely nothing to do with co-op play and are purely PVP and yet bizarrely are only available in co-op play. It makes no sense and they break the flow and tension of the game and soon get very annoying. For me co-op play is all about working together and helping each other and these challenges force you into PVP events that I do not want in my co-op experience.Random Events and LootAnytime a dynamic drop hits the map all players get to raid the cache of medicine and supplies. True to its co-op claim,  friends can help a downed ally and all the loot you find is unique to each player so there is no squabbling over drops so this works well. Character customizationCharacter customization options are poor, so don’t expect to be able to play specific roles or even tell each other apart during the early stages of the game. No Local Co-OpThe lack of a local co-op option is a real surprise as this game would be well suited to a local co-op play between people in the same room playing on split screen. Ideal for keeping the older kids busy or killing some time with your partner etc. But alas, no such option exists.OverviewTechland, the makers of Dying Light vociferously shouted about it's co-op play as being one of its big selling points, but  for me, actual co-op experience is severely lacking. Now I love a good PVP game when I am in the mood, but when I am not ""I do not want PVP shoved down my throat"". If you want some competitive PVP while playing Dying Light then it should work well for you. However, if like me, you want a proper co-op game, either look elsewhere or ensure that you lock down the menu settings to allow friends only and agree beforehand to stay away from challenges. Caution, co-op is switched on by default.However, if you want a great single player survival horror game, this just might be the one for you. Just remember to disable those co-op options and enjoy Dying Light how it plays best:Gamma set low, playing in the dark with your headphones turned up. A great solo game. "

												This is short and to the point.  This is the only game in which I can apply fire and electricty to a khkuri knife and then upgrade it to slash and stab and kill zombies over and over again untill it breaks, and then take out my shortsword as i panic my way out of the mess I landed in.Only negative is my old dell can't take it THAT well so I have bursts of low fps every lil while, but its ok.Also, I really wish the ""Ultimate Survivor Pack"" would come out on March 1st instead of March 10th.

												After Dead Island I was incredibly dubious about this game. Same developer, another zombie game, ugh. I had no interest in buying it. Then the game released, more and more people were praising it over the internet, people like myself who were expecting another lackluster Dead Island-y thing. Eventually I caved and bought the thing, curious as to how ""another zombie game"" could be rated so highly by people who were sick of zombie games.Simply put, the game looks gorgeous, and is a hell of a lot of fun. The story's nothing to shout about, and is rather cliché, but the acting mainly on the part of the main character is good enough for me to actually feel some things coming from him at certain moments. I still haven't completed the game, but I highly recommend everyone complete as many side quests as they can before doing any main quests, just to help increase the longevity of the game. The majority of side quests aren't bad either, and make you explore the map more. In summary, highly unexpectedly great game, even if you're sick of the zombie survival genre of games, give this one a try, you'll have a lot of fun regardless.			"

												A very fun and solid game. It's a wombo combo of Dead Island, Mirror's Edge, and the wooping Far Cry: an open world set with tons of things to do, parkour around the rooftops or whatever the hell you can find and climb, and find creative ways to kill your enemies. Of course, right off the bat the game is gorgeous looking, especially the detail on the zombies and what not. It's also worth mentioning what the mods will be capable of for this game.Although I do recommend this game by a lot, I do not recommend going out at nightime if you do plan on playing.I also recommend picking up small gas tanks. You'll know why.CO-OP is also quite fun, and if you feel like tearing some zombies together, it works quite well.Story had much more potential, especially if decision-making was implemented into the game.

												This game surprised me.  The melee combat of Skyrim, with the freerunning of MIrror's Edge.  Fantastic shooting and weapons.  A Borderlands efficiency of loot and drop-in co-op.  My personal favorite out of a list of pleasant surprises, was a slow-burn progression system, that flushes out naturally.  Gameplay mechanics are layered in so well through the 3 different skill trees.  Every skill is fun and unique.  My only knock I have against this game, is that the co-op takes it to a level that rivals Left 4 Dead to me.  If you gotta play single-player you're missing out.  Fortunetly, drop-in co-op is in effect (again, like Borderlands). To sum it up, I think it was worth the $60.00 and I did NOT expect that.  A rare treat.			"

												At the end of the day, as much as one is inclined to, it is difficult to find fault with a game like Dying Light. Aesthetically, the game is a pleaser. In terms of performance on the PC platform, save for the fps related issues on release week, Dying Light performs respectably even on a mediocre rig. On a high-end rig, Dying Light chugs along at the highest settings with nary a hiccup. As for its gameplay, the action in Dying Light is fast and fluid. Combat is flashy as well as impactful, and killing zombies has never felt more brutally satisfying. The parkour mechanic, which is your character’s main form of locomotion in Dying Light, is also somewhat intuitive, save for a few logical inconsistencies. If your gut tells you that a bridge’s truss is traversable to reach its top, you are unlikely to be wrong. Scaleable aspects of a building are very well-differentiated from those that you can’t interact with. Thus whether it is crisscrossing Harran’s rooftops, or climbing to the top of a clock tower to catch the setting sun, Dying Light’s parkour mechanic makes it both hassle-free and a pleasure to explore its vast and interesting setting. There is no mistake about it, Techland has done an admirable job here: Dying Light is one hell of a game to play, whether alone or in a group. Unfortunately, Dying Light has about as much of a heart or soul as the cold and ruthless GRE boss that your character works for.  I could blame the game’s lack of spirit on its poor storyline, as many other critics have done. I could also blame it on the half-arsed supporting characters that the game seemingly throws at you by the dozen, only to then either arbitrarily kill them off or to leave their relationship with your character hanging by a thread and incomplete. Rather I am going to attribute it to Techland’s failure to make any of the interesting features, that it implements in a seemingly laundry-list like manner, into a mainstream component that properly defines Dying Light and what it stands for. Take the game’s setting in Harran for example. Yes, Harran is a vast and spacious open-world in which players can explore to their hearts’ content. Yes Harran is both beautiful, in a morbid kind of way, and immersive. Yet Techland barely utilizes it to further engage and immerse Dying Light’s players. There is a wafer-thin amount of dynamic events in Harran, which usually exists in the form of survivors fending off zombies, or Rais’ goons sitting idly on top of one of the air-supply crates which the game sporadically generates. Harran also remains the same dreary and worn out place that it was when your character first stumbled into it like the ‘experienced’ secret operative that he is, until the moment you dispose of your main nemesis and complete the game’s main storyline. Converting one of its zone into a safehouse may result in you visually pushing or toppling a couple of shelves or cupboards over, as a form of barricading, but there is otherwise no obvious visual cues that suggest Harran is changing or evolving as a result of your character’s actions. Neither does its inhabitants become better off as you fulfil the usually tedious tasks that they set you out to do. An extreme example is the game’s escort missions, where completing one of them merely returns the relevant NPC that you successfully protected back to his or her starting spot, ready to offer you the same mission again. As a result, playing in Harran can occasionally provide a disconnected experience, one where you realize that nothing your character does ever truly matters. On the other hand, do I think that Dying Light is a game worthy of your money, even at full-price? Yes it is. The game is extremely well-polished and has a good amount of content for you to sink your teeth into. Parkouring your way through the game’s numerous side missions is also an addictive experience. I can’t count the number of occasions where I had originally set out to spend 15 minutes on one of the game’s side mission, only to have those minutes turn into hours as I explore, craft, and decapitate or bash zombie heads in. It’s most unfortunate that Dying Light’s absence of a heart and soul, as a result of Techland’s relative lack of ambition, means that it will remain a game that is a distance aways from being a truly great one. This in itself does not detract from the fact that Dying Light is through and through an entertaining game to play. And entertain you it most certainly will.			"

												The game is amazing, and that is an understatement. The ending itself was one of those that you just have to see to know what all really going on. There is one slight ""con"" that does not kill the game, but it kind of did catch me off guard, which would be that around the end (at some point not giving spoilers) there is an extra mechanic that was added to the game which I had previously not encountered. They kind of just threw it in there, but it is possible it was on a mission I had missed at one point.All in all 10/10, and will love to see what more they do it within future DLCs!			"

												TL;DRHIGHLY RECCOMENDED!One of the few games worth 60$ right now + 20$ for the expansion!Dying Light is one of those games I bought expecting the worse and ended up loving every single minute.+ Grade A devs. Constant updates and they upgraded the base game to enhanced for free. FREE! FREEEE!+ Fluid as butter movement. The game plays beautifully with KB/M .+ Amazing parkour and combat system. It starts slow and uncomfortable, but as you slowly get more powerful, you feel like you earned that gorgeous slow-mo kills!+ Fantastic performance , very good optimization.+ Day = hahah! Kill all them zombies! + Night = oh God please help meeeee!+ No, seriously, nighttime is pure panic inducing. One of the most intense games of the 2015.+ Weapon mods are great.+ THE FOLLOWING ROCKS.+ COOP is so much fun!+ Workshop support, very well made level editor.+ Kyle is a very amusing protagonist who reacts very sarcastic towards anything. Love'd some of his line delivery.-/+ Meh story as a whole. Ok characters tho.-/+ Slow progression.-/+ Nobody seems to play ""Be the zombie"" :(-/+ Wonky mod support.-/+ Level desing is great some places and bland in some other.- Raas is such a shity villan, even the protagonist says it with no irony.- The ending is a bit crap. Also the Following has another bad ending.Basically every zombie game but actually fun.			"

												A very good game from Techland. Although there are some strong elements taken straight from the Dead Island franchise (played both of those, not completed), the parkour element really adds something fresh to the zombie-survival genre, not to mention the day-night cycle that changes how you interact with the zombies. I also like the difficulty curve, which makes you a dumb survivor with barebone weapons and pathetic stamina at the start of the game. It may be weird to some people, but I feel this makes you really feel like a newbie survivor trying to learn how to survive. It will only take you a few hours to get useful skills and strong weapons, but it has enough things to do to make the game still interesting for a long while. Weirdly, for me some of the side missions' story are better than the main storyline. Another thing for me to praise is the atmosphere and the environment of the game. Compared to Dead Island, this game have some areas that really gave me chills (a personal issue, definitely). Even when you have a ton of powerful weapons and skills, you are never 100% invulnerable to the zombies. Overall, I love this game, a lot. It will be very interesting to see what Techland have in mind for the future of the franchise. I definitely hope they won't do another ""riptide"".			"

												If you liked the game play of Dead Island (questing, crafting, and zombie killing) and were OK with the movement in Mirror's Edge (jumping here to there), then you will like this game.(See my ""UPDATE"" below.)I will note that the jumping mechanic can be frustrating at times and has some issues that you have to learn, but it's pretty solid. I also tried out the ""Be The Zombie"" mode, and found it to be interesting but not very impressive. It felt very much like playing the alien in Aliens VS Predator (minus the wall crawling mechanics of course).Overall, I'm sure I'll sink a few dozen hours into the game as I did with the Dead Island series.UPDATE:I have been enjoying this game, but have two painful issues to report...1.) When you play ""Be The Zombie"" you can not invade a friend's game the same way you can co-op. They did not use the same friends awareness menu. That REALLY Kills the feature. Now, you can see games near you (low ping) that you can jump into, but not being able to play with friends easily really, really sucks.2.) During cut scenes, I very often hear the speech, but the animation time slows down or continues for a few seconds after the audio is done. So it really saps the immersion when this occurs....still, I am enjoying the core game. But am VERY disappointed about the Be The Zombie mode not being readily available through the same CO-OP menu.			"

												Dying Light, the second big title made by Techland after Dead Island, and it's a first person shooter, that has parkour going on with it, with zombies, in an open world setting, and it's good. I'd describe the game where it has Dead Island's zombies and nice combat, the open worldness and perspective of Far Cry, and the map design level and parkour of Assassin's Creed.Starting with the graphics, they look really great, especially noticeable after the second half of the game. The animations and the lip-sync in cut-scenes or character interactions are noticeably not that good, and the graphical effects like blurry fog/water-drops are an inconvenience, and an annoyance that you have to put up with throughout the game.The parkour controls are good and simple, and the melee combat controls are great and 'meaty', with the fire-arm controls being decent. The inventory management system isn't that great to interface with, at least not at first, which certainly could have been better.The open world is fun and varied to play and parkour around in, with buildings to go through, and rooftops to hop on to. Filled with good amount of zombies, loot, and side missions to play with, and it's not cluttered with it, for example like Ubisoft games. The open world is also split into two big sandbox areas, the first one is nice and all, but the second one is where the beauty of the game is. A lot more nice to look at and to play around in, with how it is designed, more traversal and parkouring routes to have fun in, and just overall a better feeling to it.The story isn't anything new, but at least they're trying to progress it in a way. Also, the main character you play as, he can kill, parkour and whatnot, and you'd expect him to have the ability to do those things because of who he is and how he is presented in the story, not just a random dude who got caught up in the mess, knowing how to do everything and be the best at it with no past experience. So what I'm saying is, Techland knows how to present a character, that makes sense, better than how Ubisoft presents them in their games.The game is lengthy, with decently long campaign, and there being a lot of side quests that's, that's not that bad, you can do and finish. There's only one quick-time battle event in the game, it's short but still an annoyance to have it happen, made me think ""Really? Now you want to add a QTE?"".The coop is fun, having another person, two, or three with you, jumping, exploring, and killing zombies and other enemy humans in the open world that it has for us to mess around with is really fun, kind of makes you feel like you own the city and have a really powerful group. Be The Zombie mode is really fun, it's like a toxic version of spider man, basically you can keep yourself afloat all the time, which is fun, but going against people is really hard though. Haven't dug deep into it so I'm not sure if it's a bad or a good thing that it's hard.Techland really made a huge leap in quality from their first game, Dead Island, making Dying Light a nice surprise of fun and excitement, and the reason why I mention Ubisoft a couple of times is because they are doing a lot of stuff better then them, so much so that it's worth a mention.

												Now thats what we are talking about and thats what we want  to  see from Survival Zombie GAME. Immersive and atmospheric with a nice parkour movement touch and well designed map with full accessibility.Quests,Challanges,Co-op comps,fighting for air drops and be the zombie option, smells the air of joy and death. Adrenaline rush all the way as soon as you go out of the safe zone and the night you are  the prey my friend as they say ""Good Night, Good Luck"" could never be said better.Graphics and Sounds ,wind effects are top notch , your body reacts to them as animations are pretty well made as well.Combat skills ,skill system,crafting ,collectibles are well explained as the game itself and story with great ""tutorials and user friendly UI"".For the story , i can't say much as i haven't finished but entering scene and prologue were well made and pulls you into the story.  Found the characters pretty spot on as well so far.For PC gamers thankfully there are enough options to tweak and FOV slider is deffinetly spot on.Only thing, i would like to have MMO type of Dying light, but ""hey!"" hope it will come and will stick to the main cores of Dying Light.Final words,Gentlemen and ladies, Well done Techland !  9/10			"

												After Putting in about 50+ hours into the game, I lIke it! It was worth my money. They have Improved a lot about the bad aspects of Dead Island. Me playing on PC I have only come across a couple bugs, a few of them being on my end, using Fake Fullscreen, but the game is still better than Dead Island. The story is so-so, forcing character deaths about characters you probably don't even care about, but the game is good. It's really fun playing with other people too. I really recommend this game. It was worth the 2 year wait for me. 9/10			"

												This game is fun pretty much identicle to Dead island but better. Its very laggy for anyone without a good computer so I recoomend you get this to expand your options and get the most FPS: ( http://www.nexusmods.com/dyinglight/mods/18/? ) Its anoying how broken and glitchy some parts are though. For example, if you have low FPS then its impossible for you to 100% the game because of how broken challanges are (Not like they are any fun or lead up to anything special, just a time waster) Anyway, if you have low FPS then your game will run slower, however all challanges have a timer and my god is this stupid but the timer counts down faster then it would if you had 30+ FPS. If you dont belive me try an agility challange ranked ""medium"" with less then 10 FPS and see if its even possible to reach the second to last checkpoints of ANY challange. I kid you not there is only 2 ways of fixing problems like these: Get that graphical mod in the link above and set everything to TF2 graphics just to do the challanges or use Cheat Engin. Last bit of rant is that I sometimes (often) start up the game hearing distorted sound and audio with clicking in the background. I cant find any fix or update for any hardware/software for this and its only random it appears in the game but not many people have this. The grappler is also buggy, sometimes it doesnt want to work and sometimes it wont let you grab onto anything after it pulls you in (Which is suicide). Finally, this isnt really much of a survival game because med kits are so easy to make that you wont ever run out of them later on, same for orange/legendary/unique weapons, you can just buy one and keep using it until you need an upgrade.Sooo, if you have a crappy computer then maybe consider passing on it unless you dont mind TF2 graphics, if you have a great computer then I highly recommend it.

Posted: February 1, 2015
												Heads up, game fans! It's time to review the new zombie apocalypse game that so many people are playing and talking about: Dying Light. I've had a taste, and I want more, but will you? Read along and hopefully find out. I'm not going to tell you everything, and I'm trying to avoid any serious spoilers, but I will give you just a taste so that you can judge for yourself. Please keep in mind that this review is current as of the date of publication, but I have no idea what features may change, improve or get nerfed after this point. I am not including in this review aspects of the DLC, but I may review that later. Or not.If I had to give just a brief idea of what this game is like, take a little bit of Fallout 3, just the tiniest taste of Crysis, a dash of Skyrim, a sprinkling of Far Cry 2, a little more FC2, toss in some inspiration from L4D2, and then top it all off with some Mirror's Edge, and you might get an idea of what this game is like. Maybe. Also throw in some optional asymmetrical fps with some rather unfortunate choices on the part of the developer to get even closer to the full experience. You start off parachuting into a situation in a quarantined city somewhere seemingly in the Middle East. You have to find that one guy that your organization needs you to find; you know the one. You get infected, and you need medicine. That's how you're compromised, and that's how you begin working your way into the local sitch. You make yourself at home and begin doing odd jobs to improve your standing, gather intel, and make reports back to the peeps in charge in the rear. You can probably guess where this is going, so that's all I'm going to say about the back story. If you don't get medicine regularly, you get sicker and could possibly turn. So far it hasn't affected my gameplay as much as the same mechanic that was used in Far Cry 2, but I haven't gone very far in the main story line either. In the relatively brief time I've played this game, I've only had convulsions the one time. You spend all your time climbing, running, jumping, ducking, dodging, and generally trying to outmaneuver, overpower, or out-think your opponents. You constantly have to think about where you're going next and how. The game has freedom, but with it also comes a terrible price. Sometimes you choose wrong, and it hurts so bad when you do. Conversely, when you choose well, and it works, it feels really good, too.You get three skill trees, each with a different focus--one for gear, one for agility, and one for power. The things you do build your skills in the respective area, and if you want to get better at something, try doing it repeatedly or things closely related to it. Craft items and you'll be able to craft more items. Take on zombies one on one in melee, and you'll get better at it. Try extreme stunts, and you'll become a world-class parkour... -er (actually, the proper term is ""traceur"" if you didn't know... I didn't). Your opponents are a blend of frightening zeds with some specials mixed in who will not always stand out at a distance the way they will in L4D2. Once you know what you're looking for they will be all too apparent in most cases, but there is a slight learning curve involved. Yes, the big guy with the insane hammer is easily spotted in any crowd, but the little screechy ones not so much. There is a level of unpredictability to every encounter. One guy goes down with a single blow, another saps your weapon of its remaining strength. Be wary of that. Weapons can only be repaired a few times. Also, if you upgrade a basic weapon, apparently you cannot then use it as part of crafting an advanced weapon. And when you can no longer repair a weapon, don't forget to dismantle it for the spare bits.You can find a lot of loot everywhere you turn, but most of it (especially the better stuff) is behind locks that you can pick. If you've played Skyrim, you shouldn't have any issues doing this. I've heard Thief players should also know what's what. If you've played neither of those, watch a video before playing your first time to get a sense of how it's done. If somebody says you need tons of picks everytime you go looting, don't listen to them. You only need tons of picks to practice with until you're good. Skyrim players who've already cut their teeth on these locks should have no issue even with the toughest locks in this game.During the day it's a parkour rpg with FPS elements, but at night, if you're out, it's totally stealth. At least until you know what you're doing. Bold precision pays off in this game. The developers have relied on player fear to a good extent, but how can you know the limits until you have tested them. Climb to the top of that communications tower. You never know what you might find. Plan your exit strategy and then hit that guy with the tank on his back. After he explodes, if you survive the swarm that will descend upon you, you will come out the other side stronger for it. Stronger or more agile, or both. Make your painful mistakes early on, because if you wait until later, you will feel the pain as you lose tons more points as a higher level character dies for the mistake of not being bold early on. Clear all your safe zones straight out from the prologue before you complete any quests. I did it my first day after the prologue, with the exception of the last one which was too well defended.  I think the daylight cycle might be tied to story progression and perhaps even side quests. Also, another pro-tip, if you're stuck, consider leaving the game and coming back because there are still glitches and bugs to be worked out. Can't reach a certain post from the roof of that one building? Maybe you're not supposed to. Trust me and see.If you want to know what awaits you in the dark, play the Be a Zombie mode. You get to play as the Hunter, which feels like a cross between a vampire or werewolf and Venom. You get to play as one, that is, if you can find a match where people don't automatically leave as soon as you join. In my experience almost every one of the matches where I was actually able to stay and play, the human players knew what to do. If you decide to play this mode, expect some frustrations as a result, from the learning curve or from the game mechanics or from the matchmaking system. Being the Hunter is fun, but frustrating--until you get better at it. And you will get better if you stick with it. I feel the system is kind of limiting and almost misleading, because you aren't playing as any of the other zombies, only the Hunter.One of the poor choices I feel the developer has made is seen in the multiplayer part of the game. You have extremely limited options in controlling online game play, and the game doesn't distinguish between sides. Say you go into Be a Zombie mode and open your game to public games online, when you go back into your solo campaign, it's not solo anymore. You have to go back into online settings and set it to solo once more. I wonder if this isn't part of the reason behind the large number of players who quit when a Hunter joins their game. Also, apparently, though I have yet to play with friends on co-op, I can tell you the voice communications in multiplayer are set to be strictly always on or always off. No push-to-talk. Perhaps they will fix this in the next patch. We can hope. Until then, better consider your third party options for game chat. Headphones, people. Wear. Your. Headphones. And play in a quiet area or turn off your mic please, for the love of all that is good and true.There are ugly sores on the backside of this game. The repetition of certain dialogue branches when you walk past certain NPC's is irritating. The feeling that I've played this game before, especially when it feels a lot like those other games I listed at the beginning of this review, is a little disappointing. But where the game shines, it shines. I'm out of characters... See ya next t "

												Dying Light is more than just your average zombie apocalypse game.Dying Light allows you traverse an open world mired into chaos and destruction. In this environment, you scrap for survival against an array of enemies as the infected are not the only threat: accosting other desperate human beings is typically the only way to get precious supplies.My PC Specs for comparison CPU- AMD FX(tm)-4130 Quad-Core Processor 3.80GHz GPU- NVIDIA GTX 650 DDR3- 16.00gb Windows 7 64bit Motherboard- M5A78L-M/usb3 Review of Techy Things-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This game has no external DRM (besides steam of coarse)-The game is only 12gb download, which was very weclomed for a full hard drive-When running through the city of Haran I get an average of 45fps, and for my budget computer is extremely good (specs above)Review of Storyline/Gameplay------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------While this game does host it fair share of fetching missions, once I had started the story I just couldn't seem to get enough of this gameplay. The story had its rough parts,  like the final missions being only parkour  but through it all you knew exactly what your goal was and why you were doing it.-As for gameplay and controls think of it as ""Dead Island meets Mirror's Edge with a more serious tone.""-This is actually one of the first games where I fear for my character's life. Even in horror games like The Evil within I couldn't care less if my character died, but here, I quickly learned to fear the night, as that is when the zombie like to get increasingly faster.-The map is freaking huge, yet easy to travese, and then halfway through the storyline you get another map of slightly lesser size-However as a tradtional ""zombie survival"" game I think it missed the mark on how available supplies where.Metascore - 75/100Traditional Score - 7.8/10My Rating - 9.2/10End Summary- If you are looking for a fun multiplayer game with some amazing elements of parkour and combat, mixed with the free pvp dlc that game out at launch and a dev team who actually listens to their fanbase to hear the needs of the customers you are in for a sweet treat. If you are looking for another amazing ""Last of Us"" storyline with sparse pickups, or a true traditional zombie survival I suggest you look elsewhere as this storyline, while is does have some great moments, is mainly comprised of fetching missions, but hey, at least it isn't the cliche roadtrip storyline.

												Dying light is one of the best Zombies game I ever play. After spending days in this game, I still can not find any reason to feel bore. Dying light are mean to be play with friends, You will experience many interesting events along the progress. The gameplay in this game is similar to the Dead Island but lack of few things which don't give effect much to the game. The storyline is average, they are predictable~ yet it depend on individual, some people find out it interesting~ to me, i had play more games with better story than this. What make this game feel good is you and your friend depend on each other, share same moment of funny/scare/terrify, do trading, do competition, running at night,...etc~although there are few things i dont like in this game but they are too unimportant to be mention, It is highly recommand to play this game with your friends where you guys can level up together from Zero to Hero.85% I need to find more algae~			"

 Innovation in a zombie game? This can't be true! Originally posted by Wikipedia:Dying Light is a zombie apocalypse-themed game set in an open world. Players traverse an expansive urban environment overrun by a vicious epidemic, scavenging the world for supplies and crafting weapons to defend against the growing infected population with a heavy focus on freerunning mechanics, allowing players to perform actions such as climbing ledges, leaping off from edges, sliding, jumping from roofs to roofs and zip-lining.I'll tell you something right away. Dying Light is something you'd never expect from a zombie game: innovation, smooth mechanics, a storyline, tons of tasks, variety and devs who listen to the consumers. So the story... is it really that bad? Not really. The story is not the best thing you could hope for — it's cheesy, it betrays you with a great start... which is bad.  It has replay value, though. The smooth mechanics of the game really save the story, since slicing and bashing zombies and jumping from rooftop to rooftop feels really fluid and it really is a blast. The first half of the main story is promising, but after you get to Old Town, the tasks get quite repetitive and the plot isn't anything special.Overall, Dying Light is a great game, despite its flaws. I couldn't ask for more when it comes to gameplay, weapons and co-op. The only real con is the story — if it was done as well as the game mechanics, this game would be GOTY without a doubt.			"

												UPDATED: After a Nvidia graphics update the Windows side runs much better, seems to not go over 60fps, maybe it's capped? Wouldn't be the first time on a console port; nevertheless, it is a much better experience now. I still get some fraemrate drops here and there, but over all good. The SteamOS (Linux) version still has lots problems, but I hope with some time they can patch this. I like how I can buy the game for SteamOS and if I have problems-- not saying I like the problems-- I go over to play on my desktop and I don't have to buy again, sweet. Right now I still wouldn't recommned until they push out some updates, but if you don't mind some bugs here and there it's playable on Windows, again not on SteamOS.PC specs: GTX 970, i5, 16 GB RAM, Windows 8.1 U1 Pro.SteamOS:My Steambox is running i5, 8GB RAM, GTX 650TI, SteamOS (Linux). The game runs okay while in the tower, but once I step outside I see huge framerate drops, I know the GTX 650 isn't the best, but even after setting the resolution to the lowest and turning the graphics down it doesn't change a thing. Also, doesn't look like you can turn off motion blur, makes me wonder what else isn't working right. DON'T buy this for SteamOS or Linux right now.			"

												Okay so when this first came out I didn't even check it out or give it the time of day it so very much deserved.  I had played the first Dead Island game when it became cheap on the consoles back in the day and it wasn't my cup of tea.  Wasn't a bad game, just didn't feel polished, the missions were pretty bland,  and how fast the weapons broke drove me mad!!!So then people started telling me how great this game was.  I still didn't think it was for me (after all they were fans of the Dead Island games).  Finally enough people told me to shut up and play it, so I did. and boy was I in for a surprise.  After playing tutorial and venturing outside for the first time WOW! It was so intense, scary got my heart pumping really good.  I played it in the dark, with headphones on and a few beers in hand yikes!!!I'm currently about 8 hours into it, and have progressed my character enough to where I don't feel so helpless all the time (except for night that is!!!) but tides can change very quickly in this game so you're almost always on edge.  I feel the developers really took to heart and listened to their fans and their critics when making this game.  They took the best parts of the Dead Isand games, put it with a decent storyline (predictible yes, but that's not why we play these games) added a better more polished gaming enviroment and character skill system to create a very fun and stressful Zombie game.  I ended up finding a good deal on this game, but if I would have paid full price I would have been happy as well.  If you're on the fence because of their past zombie games, try and find a way to demo this, either rent it for a console or go to a buddy's house that has this.  I'm glad I got this on steam because this game runs flawlessly on my PC and looks great on the big screen in the living room (plays great with an xbox controller) .As for people on here commenting and saying this like a mash up of Far Cry and Dead Island, I'd say its an accurate representation.  Also would like to give the developers props for making a fun to control Parkour game.  Yeah Assasians Creed has it, but you just hold down a button, this one requires skill and finesse.  Feels a little cumbersome at first, but once you get the hang of it (and level your agility up a bit more) it feels very fluid and rewarding.			"

												Pros:- Really solid gameplay. - The parkour elements are fun.- Night is ♥♥♥♥ing scary.- Interesting main storyline for 3/4 of the game. - Some of the side quests have interesting story. Some will progress alongside the main storyline.Cons:- The last 1/4 main storyline is really ""meh"" (but not as bad as what people said about it online).- sidequesting can be tiring since you need to travel everywhere manually. Luckily the parkour can be quite fun (and it will contribute to your leveling).- *SPOILER* ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t QTE for the final boss battle. Almost make me rage. ♥♥♥♥ing hell.Not reviewed:- Co-op gameplay (up to 4 people I think)- ""Be the zombie"" mode (invasion)Overall: Pick this up whenever it is on sale. Worth the money spent. 5/7 (for dank purposes lel lel)*Edit: ♥♥♥♥ing valve stop ♥♥♥♥ing censoring my ♥♥♥♥ing review god ♥♥♥♥ing dammit. Love you xoxo			"

												Highly recommended! This world is alive (even though it's full of undead). There are moments of pure fear, laughs and many believable situations. They have made the zombies come to life (ironic I know) but they feel so real and tangible you truly crap yourself when running through them to get to a house or wall to sramble up. There are a ton of things to do besides the main story line.Then night comes... As if there was not enough going on! When night comes you really learn the meaning of fear. You could sleep it away, but it draws you in more and more. Despite sweaty palms and a racing pulse you take the steps out from safety. Slowly at first, and then you almost become brazen about it. That is when you learn humility. Seriously, get this game. It's so much fun.			"

												Just finished the game and WOW what a ride!Not only is the story and characters great, particularly for a zombie game, but the combat and parkour are heaps of fun.A huge thank you goes to the devs from me on this. It was so very nice to pick up a new AAA title that had a lot of hype and play it for the first time, being able to experience everything in the glory that it was made to be. None of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of having to play with settings or mess with files to try and tweak things to get the frame rates etc right.This game worked. No bugs.No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.It worked.So thank you devs, in this day and age such a small thing (of actually completing a game before it hits shelves and not selling half finished garbage), doesn't go unnoticed.I have, I will and I do recommend anyone interested in something enjoyable, full of side missions, some great combat and progression system to buy this. Give it a go.			"

The skill trees/wep/unlocks were all great in this game.I absolutely love the way you could kill zombies! The amount of detail that went into is great! Day Time - Night Time cycles. Night Time is more rewarding but risky but who does love a good adrenaline rush? There's dificulty settings for everyones skill abilities which is great.Best played co-op for sure.In short - Loved the hell out of this game!!			"

												Dying light is one of the best Zombies game I ever play. After spending days in this game, I still can not find any reason to feel bore. Dying light are mean to be play with friends, You will experience many interesting events along the progress. The gameplay in this game is similar to the Dead Island but lack of few things which don't give effect much to the game. The storyline is average, they are predictable~ yet it depend on individual, some people find out it interesting~ to me, i had play more games with better story than this. What make this game feel good is you and your friend depend on each other, share same moment of funny/scare/terrify, do trading, do competition, running at night,...etc~although there are few things i dont like in this game but they are too unimportant to be mention, It is highly recommand to play this game with your friends where you guys can level up together from Zero to Hero.85% I need to find more algae~			"

												Singleplayer experience after 11 hrs.      Pros:-Everything I wanted from Dead Island that I never got.-Very intuitive movement. They nailed the parkour. You feel fast in the day and terrifingly slow at night.-You can see your body and legs. So many games leave this out and I notice every time. -Takes itself somewhat seriously. I never much cared for the silly weapon mods but they are here to stay and not a con.-Playable on my AMD Radeon 7850. Medium texture, low shadow, short view distance. -Slow progression, but not too frustrating. About 6 hrs in I had my first death. 11 hrs in I found my first gun. -Did not run into many things I couldnt scale.-Guns actually opperate like guns.-Good mash-up of good games (Farcry, Fallout 3, A.C. Mirrors Edge just to name a few.)-Weapons deteriorate fast so you don't get too attached... yeah I think I like that.-No more work benches! You can repair, upgrade, and modify any weapon at any time. Brilliant. -Lots of zombies and they are super slow. Finally a game that gets why this is good.-Consiquences for being too loud. -Gore Is satifying. I stood on a car for 10 min beating back a hoard of zombies with a grin on my face. It could always be better but it doesnt destract like in Dead Island.        Cons:-Generic male protagonist. What are they afraid of? Rochelle? Ok bad example. -Missions are meh. You feel like the only person who does anything.-They tried to streamline the looting but it still gets tedious.-Open world seems a bit small. (It might still open up. Only 17% through the game)-Can't scale large rock faces. Seems like this would be a walk in the park for a parkour master. -Techland was responsible for Dead Islands terribal face animation and voice acting. It's better but still underwheming.-Drops all the frames when I get pounced by zombies. Frame drop when I enter cinematics (AMD?)-Boss zombies Lack variety in apperance. I really wanted to see them tackle this. Even L4D2 had a boomer varient-Victim of all the latest flaws in game marketing (seasonpass/pre-perch)			"

An amazing game that manages to be all about zombies, without being a trite hoard mode survival shooter.Dying light is a unique game for how it manages to walk a fine line of an action, horror, and exploration.  You start out simply enough, learning how to run, jump, and parkour your way around the city while bashing zombies with generic weapons like rusty pipes.  Lending itself to the active running and combat gameplay are the talent trees.  Every time you use a weapon you gain experience toward the power skill tree, and climbing buildings increases your agility skill. This all leads to new abilities that change how you play the game.  Using a skill based leveling system also lends itself to the game's open world design.  In Dying Light you're encouraged to explore by two things, leveling up and random loot.  Similar to games like Diablo and Borderlands, Dying Light utilizes a classic colored random loot system for all the weapons you find in the world.  These weapons however are directly tied to a third skill tree, Survival.  Your Survival skill is what governs the quality of loot you find in the world, and survival points are only acquired by completing quests, helping survivors, or running for airdrops.  This three point system ensures that you're encouraged to explore and complete quests to level up, to get better loot, to kill stronger zombies, to do harder quests, to level up, to get better loot- you get the idea.  Additionally finding powerful weapons is kept in check with item durability, and all weapons need repair but will eventually break completely.   Thus even when you utilizes the games basic crafting system to create an amazing arm, you're encouraged to stay on the lookout for new and equally powerful weapons.  Topping all of this off is a day night cycle that gives the game a risk reward element.  During the day the world is filled with mostly unthreatening shambling zombies, but at night the map is populated with fast running and powerful super zombies called volatiles.  Normally you want to avoid going out at night, but when the real horrors come out the agility and power experience you gain are doubled, giving a sometimes much needed boost to skill leveling.  What's more there are many side quests that require you to run at night and dive head first into dangerous zombie dens, further encouraging you to go out after dark.  All and all Dying light is an amazing although imperfect game that manages to be all about zombies, without being a trite hoard mode survival shooter.  If you like RPGs, exploring, looting, and simple crafting, then Dying Light is for you.			"

												Probably spent as much time if not more on the free roam aspects than the actual story, which is pretty rare for an open world game. Dying light does a pretty solid job of making its flavour content actually entertaining, rather than just being filler/gimmicky like many comparable games. Parkour makes even the humblest of collection or A to B quests enjoyable, and there is a constant prospect of nice loot turning up in any given location.The plot was pretty much what you would expect from any respectable zombie apocalypse, although my investment in it grew towards the finale. The game also blurs the boundaries of morality, with Crane making for a refreshing anti-hero.			"

												This is a very entertaining game. I like the environment, the weapons and the story. My only complaint is the pace of the side missions. Most of the side missions I have played involve following a character around while they either collect or drop items off around the map, they move very slowly and you are supposed to just follow them around a protect them from zombies. Other than that one complaint, I love everything else about this game and would highly recommend it.			"

The story is enjoyable, clear, has solid characterization and provides a satisfying conclusion. The visuals are smooth with beautiful landscapes and sky shots.

												This Game is pretty awsomeGood point:1. parkour system is so cool, you can run to lots of place, you can climb the wall, you can cimb to really high, you can jump over the head of the zombie, you can crash the zombie, you can roll to decrese fall damage when jumping fron high place balabalabalalalal 2. Zombie system, yep, I like the zombie in this game, zombie party divide to two party, one is day party which is pretty dumb, another is night party which is powerful.3. Online invsion system, eventhough i didn;t play so much in the online system, it is awsome when you and your friend fight with other zombie player, when your game is been invaded, game will give your signal to prepare. Bad point.1. parkour system, yep, sometimes, I feel not good that I died when I fall from a place which is not too high, especially, in the DLC, I can feel this problem is a issue.2. Zombie system, I like fight with Zombie, I like be a warrior in the night but I don;t like to fight all the time, Usually, when I kill some night zombies in one place there will be some night zombies respawn around me immediately, WTF,  I think this should give the player to feel safe  or take a breath when they have killed bunch of night zombie.3. Mission system, the map in this game is so big, that is cool and I like run free in the map and do something fun . However, sometimes you need to across to do the mission, then, guess what, you need to run across the map agaion to tell someone that ""you finished this mission"".................................................................................. this is another reason, I am tired of wasting time during the run for♥♥♥♥♥♥stuff.

												Before I get into what I do and don't like about the game, I should mention that I have an Alienware AMD machine. Before purchasing the game I read reviews and articles about how this game wasn't optimized for AMD machines. I decided to bite the bullet anyways because one can only watch so many gameplays and eventually want to play for themselves. This game seemed awesome from the youtube videos and despite having read about the AMD vs Nvidia discussions I sold some CS GO skins so as to be able to get it.At first the game is quite grainy and seemed to have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fps. I toyed around with the video settings and it wasn't until I switched it to Best Performance setting that I was even able to move my mouse around without the graphics stuttering. I did more reading and I found a handy program called Process Lasso which I highly recommend. Obviusly read about it and what it does before doing anything that can potentially ♥♥♥♥ up your machine. I highly suggest reading up on it herehttps://bitsum.com/processlasso/. I digress. Once I figured out my problem was I no longer felt duped and was ready to move on with completing missions while avoiding harassment from the undead. Things I liked:-Its reminiscent of Mirror's Edge-The skill tree is less like that of Dead Island and more like Borderlands/Borderlands 2. The skills you spend your points on will most likely make you either or. On my part I seem to be leaning towards having better defensive skills rather than combative.-Graphics are amazing and it played on my fear of heights; I found myself screaming ""Jump ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, JUMP!"" while trying to outrun a zombie that was chasing after me. The game is immersive to the point that when I do jump I feel like I'm on the tower of terror everytime I land; you know that feeling that you get when your insides seem to wanna come out?-I like the storyline.Things I didn't like:-Maybe its because I'm still trying to get used to it, or maybe it's because I'm still trying out which one I prefer; my XBOX controller of the mouse and keypad, but I feel that the controls could be a bit more seamless. Actions that need to happen in sequence are harder (for me) to execute because the bindings are physically too far apart. -It might be too scary to play by yourself during the nighttime mode. The zombies do not ♥♥♥♥ around when the lights go out.-Be the Zombie Mode seems more of an interruption than an enhancement.  "

												I thought since I had finally beaten this game that I'd delete my old review that I made the day this game launched. It was less of a review and more of a ""Don't play this if you have AMD"" PSA. If you'd like to read it, I kept a screenshot here- http://gyazo.com/efe939cdf154cd75f3ce66bfa1c1d358However the issues mentioned there were MOSTLY fixed. They never really bothered fixing crossfire glitches or properly optimizing the game to AMD, but they've at least made it playable. Being that I pre-ordered I still feel kind of betrayed that they'd treat my system like garbage just cause I have AMD GPUs, but I'd like to toss that all aside for now and talk about the game itself will all technical issues aside.+This game's graphics are beautiful. I can finally crank everything up to high except view distance due to the optimization Techland HAS done, and it looks amazing. My only complaint is there's too many nonsensical particles floating around...everywhere. Not a big deal, just an immersion-breaker sometimes.+The best parkour system I have ever seen in any game. Makes Mirrors Edge look like a protoype.+The combat is very fun and very responsive. You can feel the weight of two-handed weapons and every gadget you can craft can be used tactically to your advantage or disadvantage in the midst of combat.+The crafting system is even better than in Dead Island. From upgrading your weapons with elemental abilities to adding ""mods"" to them to simply buff the stats they already have. You can also craft a number of tools and gadgets to help you such as flares, firecrackers, night-vision enhancing boosters, and grenades to name a few.+The sounds are great. From the running, to the fires, to the zombie cries, to the screamers, to the grunts of pain and fear your character has. They are very immersive.+MODS! Modding community! What does that mean? EXTENDED LIFESPAN! The mods allow creators to add new scenarios to the game, create stories of their own. This has already extended the lifespan of the game and will continue to do so and long as the community keeps producing quality mods.+The drop in and drop out co-op mode we all know from dead island is done just as well here as it has been done before. The connection is always stable and it is a blast to play this game with a friend.+/-Multiplayer is actually quite fun. You play as a ""hunter"" and invade the games of players (Invade 1 lone player or a full group of 4!), trying to acquire 10 kills before they can destroy 5 of your hives. Unfortunately however I have seen people who when invaded crank on some trainers/hacks so that they can always see you through objects at any distance, which ruins the experience sometimes. You can tell if its a hacker if you're having a staring contest through 10 buildings for about a minute.+/- The game doesn't have too much replayability story-wise. But if you like the gameplay a lot like I do, the game definitely warants a New Game Plus playthrough on Hard Mode just to face the challenge.-The characters however are sub-par. Each has little to no character development and I never quite felt attached to any of these characters by the end of my experience. ESPECIALLY in scenes of death that you could tell were supposed to be ""meaningful"" I was just like....ok. You didn't develop that character at all, stop pretending you did please. Every one of these characters are cliche and predictable at that, they've been done a million times before.-The story is the most predictable, most cliche, and least interesting story I've ever played in a AAA title. Techland made this game since they didn't want to make another ""comedic"" Dead Island game. Looks like their ""comedy"" is the only thing that ever made their stories interesting to begin with. Because Dying Light's story is ""Just another sitcom"" in a sea of sitcoms when you're already watching Friends.Now for the final verdict. Taking into account everything stated above, including the CURRENT technical state of the game, I'd give this game an 8.5/10. I really wanted to push for a 9/10 here but the game just doesn't earn it. It's still very unoptimized for AMD systems. Old crossfire bugs that they announced were being fixed shortly after release are still existent. That and the characters and story are so poorly done the game wasn't interesting in any other aspect but the combat, and that's not really what RPGs are supposed to be rembered for. Maybe in time they'll fix the optimization issues and I will update my review if they do, but until then I can still safely recommend this game to just about everyone. However if you do use AMD, do note you will NOT get the full power of your GPUs. CPUs work fine, but your GPUs are not optimized for this game.			"

												This game surpassed my expectations both positively and negatively. As amazingly fun and satisfying as it is, it is also one of the most rage inducing games I have ever played recentlyPros: Things I loved-Satisfying sound effects (oohh glorious gore)-Intelligent Human AI, for example if you pull out a gun they will surrender if they have only melee weapons. However, if they have strength in numbers they will not give in, they will simply keep their distance and throw knives and♥♥♥♥♥♥at you from cover and roof tops-Great parkour mechanics, not clunky or faulty in the slightest-A truly immersive story, it not only has emotion but suspense as well as a dynamic protagonist as well.-Weapon customization and rarity is very balanced-Night time is challenging, you truly are the prey at night. Fighting back against Night Virals is almost useless. Night is very dramatic, anxiety inducing, horrific, and exhillirating. But they still sweeten the pot with double XP if you're up to the challenge after dark.-Wonderful and properly implemented environmental killsCons: Now for the rage inducing part-Despite the wonderful AI for humans. They are extremely overpowered. Not only are they pretty much unaffected by kicks (one of your most useful abilities), they also seem to have superhuman reflexes and health as well. Also they tend to throw knives with almost 100% accuracy, seemingly from angles that not even Captain America himself could throw♥♥♥♥♥♥from and hit his (moving) target.-Zombies grapple you every five seconds, and medkits are rare. Though they can be quickly countered it happens way too often. However it is something you must be smart about as this game is not about plunging through hordes of infected. It encourages you to keep your distance however the main issue is it's used a little too frequently, and it is also a very clunky mechanic. If a zombie attempts to grapple you, kicking it a split second too late (even if the kick lands successfully) the hitboxes be like ""Nah he got you first."" The main dodge and throw thing you do is ineffective because of this. 60% of the time it will register the zombie grappling you regardless if you press the series of buttons first.-The game tends to kick you while you're down a lot. You lose XP when you die, and if you're broke and have no equipment it adds insult to injury with constant death as well. A lot of the game depends on how well equipped you are, and if you're not well equipped enough not only do you die a lot, it's very hard to climb out of that pit of chronic death once you're already ♥♥♥♥ed as it is, it's not very helpful when you're losing XP non stop at the same time. Especially at night.-The game tends to bs you into instant death a lot. It's very aggravating especially the fact that every flammable object tends to explode for seemingly no reason a lot of the time.Summary: Great game, the combat mechanics need improvement for specific things. 8.5/10			"

												After beating all the story modes in normal, with all side quests including the followings.I am ready to write this review.THIS GAME IS ADDICTING AF.The replayable ability is limited.but sure enough this game is really deep, solid 30-40 hours main story  gameplay. I enjoy almost every secs of it, except the muliplayer hunt vs human, and the dlc for the bow... those are a bit tricky to get your hands into.The free running parkour is very smooth, it's like and extension to Assassin's Creed.combat is quite smooth.Weapons are litmited with 25-50 different types of weapons, I am drawn to one-hand swords, like katana, and machettes.

												Dying Light, what can I say, an exceptional game that is definitely the best game I've played in a long time, parkour is smooth, seamless, fun and rewarding. Better than Mirrors Edge though I would have liked a wall run, but I easily forgot about it and didn't even miss it as much as I thought I did, this is even better than Brink which tried hard but failed. The First Person combat and Parkour in this game is what most other games should be aspiring to be, it's THAT good. The learning curve is easy, it just takes a little bit to get used to if you're using a controller, ""A"" for jump on a Xbox controller or ""X"" for jump on a Playstation controller is now your ""RB"" on Xbox or ""R1"" on Playstation. so it takes a little bit to get used to but it doesn't take long.Now the story, it wasn't the greatest, but it wasn't the worst, I've seen better, but it didn't break the game for me. What makes it for me is the multiplayer along side with side missions, challenges, invasion, etc. It all adds up to a superior multiplayer experience and the world is nice, big, and diverse. There's plenty to do, and plenty to do with others, even if it's as simple as just killing zombies for fun, or exploring the world.There's a variety of weapons, and weapon mods, as you progress there's plenty of options to upgrade. There are guns but there's minimal use for them and not to mention the noise from them attracts the more volatile of the zombies, so beware, DO NOT use guns unless you have to, but afterwards, bail as quickly as possible, don't stick around that area for too long.Now if Walking Dead was a game, I'd imagine it to be something like this, but no parkour. The scare factor of this game is pretty intense at night when the stakes are higher, you can easily die at night, whether it's a walker, runner, or volatile. Daytime is just a walk in the park, though I have this habit of testing the waters and even during the day being very cautious, and I was right to do so very early on in the game.Overall this game gets a 10/10 from me, even with a lacking story, this game made up for it in all other aspects. LOVE IT!			"

												Ok; admittedly, I am a little biased... I've been in love with zombies from such a young age I don't remember when it began. I DO remember, from at least 7 years old and up, watching night of the living dead every single birthday. When resident evil dropped for PSX back in the 90's, I'd found my new favorite genre of game. Also; I am a traceur, a parkour practitioner; and so am that much more biased towards the game.But you've come for a game review, not a life history; and the review is simple.....THIS GAME ♥♥♥♥ING ROCKS!!!!From flying across the rooftops, to grappling and smashing zombie skulls; from running for your life in white knuckling, edge of your seat chases, to sniping out other human survivors, Dying light brings stomach butterflies, and more...Sometimes I enjoy simply sitting back in the comfort of a rooftop observing the zombies roam around, bumping into each other, dropping from rooftops... the physics engine is incredible. The graphics are amazing, even run on my meager I3 rig, and are probably phenominal run on an I7.The founder and creator of Parkour, David Belle, aided in the creation of the Parkour engine, and, upon playing Dying Light, indicated that he would recommend the game to anyone interested in learning Parkour; as it offers a realistic introduction and feel to the martial art. This alone is an impressive review for the game.Overall, I would give Dying light a sincere and well deserved 10/ 10. I have NO complaints, and would (and do, daily) recommend this game to everyone.Happy roof jumping.It should be noted; the developers, Techland, do an amazing job of keeping the game and community alive with great multiplayer co-op and vs modes, as well as with frequent community challenges; offering prizes for succeeding.One Love!!!!

												I don't know where to start. I could discuss the many hours of my life that this game has taken; I could talk about the excellent mechanics, story, characters, voice acting, etc. etc. etc.I could pan the unique combination of Mirror's Edge and Dishonored and Far Cry 3&4 and every classic zombie title; I could. . . the list goes on. I highly recommend this game.Really the only down-side is the grind feeling you get with some of the leveling up and the lack of player base when you are the zombie. There are a few times where my health or stamina would freeze, or a glitch would give too many of a pick up, but I can forgive that.			"

												I managed to get this game running on an overclocked GTX 660M (Core: 1085 MHz (up from 950); VRAM: 6 GHz (up from 5 GHz)). For what it's worth, I'm on Linux. It's running on lowest settings at 768p. I get ~40 FPS.It's only crashed once, but I'm not surprised or angry; I'm *far* below the minimum specs, and I've got a rather large overclock.BTW, loving this native Linux support. Keep it up, Techland + WB.Now, on to gameplay.I love the gameplay. This game is addicting. It's kinda like a mixture of Mirror's Edge and Fallout.Mirror's Edge because, well, parkour. I've never played Mirror's Edge.Fallout because it's a fairly open-world game with quests, neat combat mechanics, and interesting item mechanics (trading, looting, that kinda jazz). Oh yeah, and I love the lockpicking mechanic. It requires *actual* skill instead of some skill that you level up. I love that.I'm a sucker for a fast-paced first-person game with tight controls and interesting game mechanics. If you are too, buy this game.			"

Some people are talking♥♥♥♥♥♥about the story, but I didn't really have a problem with it. The killing is satisfying, the weapon modification system is great fun, the enviorment is creepy, the COOP aspect is hilarius and the nights are horrorfying.I allready can't wait for the DLC comming out in February.If you see this game on sale sometime, you should definitly consider buying it ;)			"

												Dying Light is basically what Dead Islan had the potential to be. I personally love Dead Island, although I understand why a lot of people were disappointed. Pretty much everything that was bad about Dead Island was fixed in this game, plus they added a whole bunch of fun new mechanics like the parkour. I know that I am reviewing this game like it is a sequel to Dead Island, but that is because it really feels like a spiritual successor to that game. Combat is very fun and extremely rewarding, co-op is very good, with teamork being essential, loot is varied and fun. Not only combat skill is important, but also strategy is vital, giving the game a high and rewarding skill ceiling. The skill trees are fantastic, most of the skills in them are very good, making decisions on which to get very difficult. For me the game is a little bit unstable and buggy, but others have not had any trouble so I'm not sure what the deal is, but honestly, I don't care. It is almost like Skyrim in that regard. Buggy, but no one cares because it is so good. 10/10			"

												Great game.  I bought it on release date of the following,  these hours have been put in since then.  An awesome game.  Great to play with current friends or to make new friends.  Decent story and very well optimized currently.  Running @ 60 fps with vsync at 4k resolution on 2 980 ti'sThe main game has a decent story as I said, (better than I expected).  The multiplayer aspect keeps the game fresh for you, in my opinion.  It may also make you a bit braver about going out at night :).  The visuals are stunning.  Especially at Ultra.  I haven't found too many glitches, a few but none that are game breaking.  I have completed the game once and I am currently working on the following and the game has only crashed on me once the entire time.  I don't have the best internet unfortunately, only 20mbps and I have had very few connection issues on the multiplayer side.  Loot system is cool as well as the rpg aspects of the game.  I have had a blast with this game.  It makes you feel bad♥♥♥♥♥when you start getting good weapons and high level.  Once I got a cross bow I felt like Darrel Dixon from Walking Dead :)  You can too!

												Dying Light is the best zombie-game up to this date. Atmosphere filled post-apocalypse with strong emphasis on survival. Fighting and movement/parkour feels fantastic and quick. The world is huge and very detailed, and hence very satisfying to explore. The world is very immersive with some varying weather and day-night cycles, where it gets much more dangerous during the dark. The story is interesting enough: epic at times, but overall standard and sometimes cheesy. The character you control is fun and sarcastic, overall adding to the shifting sense between dramatic and humoristic world. Overall this game excels as a an action game with a rich world to explore. The game reminded me of Stalker some times, where you can never be too sure how an encounter or a situation will end. Other times it reminded me of Fallout, where if you pay attention to details when exploring, you can find small clues telling a short story of i.e. what happened to that corpse in the bed. The game's graphics are fantastic (but I am aware that some people have experienced technical problems), especially the lighting is very immersive and atmospheric.Dying Light lets you play the way you prefer. You can be quick and fast, practicly flying and sliding through the city. Or you can be slow and explore your surroundings. The best part is that both approaches are rewarding in their own way, but I would suggest the slower exploring style, due to all the fantastic detail that can be observed.The zombies are traditional, in that sense that they are almost no match for you when you single one out. But once you are surrounded by a group, everything changes. And as is standard in many classic zombie stories, man can often turn out to be your worst enemy.Dying Light also offers many side quests, some of which are really epic, both in terms of action and humor. Some other quests are simple fetch-tasks, but are complimented by the main characters reactions: such as tossing the fetched package at the quest-giver angrily and insulting him/her. It' satisfying that way.The game offers lots of variety in terms of surroundings, enemies, side quests, items, and locations. An approximate estimation is that it will keep you entertained and engaged for 40-50 hours. If the modding tools deliver in the future, this game could have so much more. I played mostly single player and found it superior to coop. Coop was too simple, where the otherwise threatening world turned into a easy playground. I hope this gets adressed in the coming hard mode.The infamous night mode is a very strong aspect of why the game feels so fresh, but here I also found a loophole. It is very easy to avoid the dangerous zombies through the mini-map, which literalily makes the night time a breeze. I found it much more engaging when trying my best to ignore the game's clues, and relying on hearing only (since it is otherwise dark..). This hopefuly will be attended to in the hard-mode which is coming from the developers.			"

												Dying Light is a first-person zombie apocalypse-themed game set in an open world. Players traverse an expansive urban environment overrun by a vicious epidemic, scavenging the world for supplies and crafting weapons to defend against the growing infected population with a heavy focus on parkour mechanics, allowing players to perform actions such as climbing ledges, leaping off from edges, sliding, jumping from roofs to roofs and zip-lining. Parkour mechanics also applied on combat. Players can perform action such as drop-kicking when engaging combat with enemies. A grappling hook is also featured in the game, allowing players to climb up buildings and travel between places quickly.The game is mostly melee-based with the majority of fighting using melee weapons. There are more than 100 weapons that can be used and more than 1000 weapon possibilities when players begin crafting new weapons. The melee-weapons have a limited lifespan and will be degraded and eventually broken if the player uses them for combat for a long time. Players can repair a weapon a limited number of times. Crafting weapons require crafting ingredients such as gauze and metal parts and a blueprint, which can be scavenged or purchased from a shop. Guns are also featured in the game, but players will only gain access to it in the later half of the game. However, ammo is often very scarce. The variety of guns consists of two types of assault rifles and a variety of small firearms and shotguns. Gun customization is very limited but guns don't break or become unusable after an extended amount of use.Dying Light contains a dynamic day and night cycle. During the day, the player has to go out and scavenge for supplies to send back to the safe zones. They can set up traps, save random survivors, and make their way to airdrops. The infected are slow, apathetic, and easily visible, allowing the player to simply make their way past them, but their danger grows in numbers. Players can also use environmental traps, such as spikes and electrified fences to kill the infected. Lead game designer Maciej Binkowski stated that day time will last for approximately 64 minutes, while night time will last for approximately 7 minutes. The game also features a physics-based lighting system and a dynamic weather system, which includes a variety of conditions such as fog, rain, and wind. I highly recommend Dying Light it is the best open world zombie survival i have ever played!			"

												This is the best zombie action game of the last decade. A huge open world with movement like no other genre. Then it picks up again with an even larger world complete with a buggy to slam around in, smashing walkers and hitting jumps. The story is enjoyable, clear, has solid characterization and provides a satisfying conclusion. The visuals are smooth with beautiful landscapes and sky shots. Combat feels tight with weapons that have impact and a good upgrade system. This is the zombie game that I have always wanted and it is a must play game for everyone!			"

												Going into this game as a Dead Island vet, I have to admit, the learning curve was a bit steeper.  I'll keep this review short and sweet.Public multiplayer in this game isn't worth playing at this point.  Everyone is too highly buffed to make the quests have relevance.  Do what I did, play through the campaign in Single Player mode, then do some side quests online.  This game excels on what Dead Island did in every way.  There's a great level of exploration, vulnerability, variety, and satisfaction that comes with this title.  A solid first-person zombie game that I would recommend to anyone.Plays well on the Steam Controller.8/10 for any survival-action fanatic out there.			"

												It's a typical Technland product, that's for sure, but it was also to be expected that there will be issues (performance optimizations).So far however that is my only negative aspect. I already liked the Dead Islands and Dying light improves every aspect (controlls, story, characters, gameplay, overall size). It's by far not perfect, but in my opinion the best zombie game right now. Not too arcady and not too much realism simulator either.Also, the combination of Dead Island and Mirrors Edge feels like a natural fusion and pretty much all I wished for. It always hurts in fps games, that even small obstacles stop you movement and the constant feeling ""in real live getting up there wouldn't be an issue at all. (There are still places and borders you can't go around, but those are at a minimum and don't affect the gamplay too much)There are a lot of people that have an issue with decaying weapons, but honestly, there are more than enough lying around, and you can repair your weapons and with skills you can delay the decay.

												Dying Light: The Following - EE Is an amazing game which incorporates fast parkour-like movement and a brutal & bloody combat system. The game itself has an amazing story, fantastic graphics, and fun mechanics. As is probbably already obvious, this is a game which takes place in a ""zombie universe"" where the fictional city of ""Harran"" has been overrun and quarantined from the rest of the world. You are Kyle Crane, a GRE (Global Relief Effort) operative and it is up to you to do something about it. Pros:-Amazing Graphics-Fun movement & combat system-Interesting & immersive story-Decent amount of stuff to do ingame (sidequests challenges etc)-Co-op is pretty cool if you're into that kind of thing (I still finished most of it solo)-The Following DLC adds more mechanics and an additional map and campaign, which are amazing!-High FPS 90% of the game (50~60) with a medium specced setup. (And medium settings)Cons:- Some of the challenges really are not any fun at all, however if you're a completionist you'll find yourself performing many stressfull challenges.-Only The Following is a worthy DLC, the rest just seems worse quality. Especially the (imo) lacking in fun, Bozak Horde DLCPS: If you pick up or just have picked up Dying Light, dont forget to google ""Dying Light Weapon Dockets"" which is a nice way to get a few extra's ingame (while still possible, most codes have expired) And if you have an android or apple phone don't forget the companion app which apparently can in the end help you scavenge for King upgrades (legendary mods) if you level up your runners in the app.Good night, and good luck survivors!

												First off let me say that this game is not perfect, but oh boy, does it not dissapoint. If you do not like games with Parkour and Zombies plus blood gushing and bodily effects to show the damage you are causing to your enemy well, look elswhere. But this game is beautiful. Not only does it deliver in the exploration but it delivers a very satisfying crafting experience, as well as brutal combat. Let me get into the first few hours of my experience with Dying Light, I was intrigued at the intro, the story is a cliche, but it really got me into thinking about the characters. And I thought that Itd be boring doing side quests, but every character seems to have his or her own personality, aside from some npcs looking the exact same, every quest has something different about it. And some quests align with eachother depending on what npc plays a part in the main story. But instead of playing the story I would find myself exploring the environment which is very pretty and there is a high level of detail in it. I saw a building in the distance that had a zombie on the rooftop, and I thought ""Im gonna go kill that zombie.""So I sprinted off another rooftop, climbed through a building, saw a chest, picked its lock, looked around that building and inside and found a way to make it a safe house by pushing the bookshelves in front of the windows, preventing any zombies to climb in. After I had done this I heard a character say ""Dont be a hero, get to a safe house now, youve got about one hour."" I was like, one hour? I can go kill that zombie I saw on a rooftop and explore that building. So I set out to do just that. Before I knew it though, It was getting very dark. And as I arrived at the house it was night. And fear sets in. I was trying to sneak back to the safehouse I just recently secured but was spotted by a hunterzombie. And the chase was on, Now I had just started playing so I wasnt very good at the freerunning which at first is not seemless. You have to really pay attention to where you are going and jumping, which is good. It adds to the desperation you feel when running from this... thing. I was running through the darkness, jumping and climbing until I realized I had climbed very high and I jumped without thinking into a rooftop that broke underneath my feet. I hard screams all around me, I couldnt see a thing. I tried to climb out but it was too late, I had been caught by the Hunter. I loved every minute of that chase and desperation. Even though I died it made me go, WOW! I was actually scared by a zombie game. Anyway, moving on, coop is also satisfying. You and 3 friends can do quests, the main story, or challenges. And lets not forget the invasions by other players at night while they take on the role of a hunter.8.5/10			"

												The game was fun to play with a group of friends for a full party, and it's still fun solo. It gradually turns from a fight for survival to a moshpit of facing a crowd of zombies, and it's enjoyable along the journey. However, the storytelling started plunging near the end in both the original plot and The Following. I wasn't as satisfied with the endings as I was with the developing story. The endgame is also repetitive with legend ranks. I wouldn't replay it because I've gotten all that I can from the game, but I do believe that playing the game while it was fresh was totally worth it.			"

The parkour and melee mechanics, along with the very motivating skill trees, are the core of the game. Too bad the 2 currently available DLCs are stupid (one worthless item pack, one crappy too-difficult-for-singleplayer arena). More regular quests or even new open(!) areas would be great.			"

												Probably spent as much time if not more on the free roam aspects than the actual story, which is pretty rare for an open world game. Dying light does a pretty solid job of making its flavour content actually entertaining, rather than just being filler/gimmicky like many comparable games. Parkour makes even the humblest of collection or A to B quests enjoyable, and there is a constant prospect of nice loot turning up in any given location.The plot was pretty much what you would expect from any respectable zombie apocalypse, although my investment in it grew towards the finale. The game also blurs the boundaries of morality, with Crane making for a refreshing anti-hero.			"

												This is a very entertaining game. I like the environment, the weapons and the story. My only complaint is the pace of the side missions. Most of the side missions I have played involve following a character around while they either collect or drop items off around the map, they move very slowly and you are supposed to just follow them around a protect them from zombies. Other than that one complaint, I love everything else about this game and would highly recommend it.			"

TL DR:The game is a masterpiece and I'm not afraid of that word.Immersion and atmosphere makes it amazing experience worth trying.One may feel a little bored at the end of the game, but it's nothing crucial.General score: 9/10General:Yet another zoombie game. In this particular case the word immersion is the most important thing. This game allows you to really experience the plot, the pressure, the pain and all the emotions. The game is not to hard, but as zoombies are really dangerous making you really feel like you need to run away from them - especially at nighttime. You just simply don't wan't to fight with them and if the plot pushes you to do something in night you really just want to make it done and run away as fast as you can to the ""safe zone"". Game balance is great and even though at some point you may kill all the zoombies you wan't (guns!) the game makes usage of loud weapon harder and annoying for the user. As we all know zoombies don't like noise and you may be surprised when after cleaning area around chest you try to open it and suddenly a bunch of nervous zombies that you woke up bites you in the neck! :)Plot:The plot is predictable and rather simple. No choices to make. Narration is very vivid though and immersion is accomplished so you can really feel sadness, happinesses and even real pain when your character do.The story is rather complete though there is a room for the story continuation.Main storyline takes about 12h to complete.Score: 7/10Audio:Audio is one of things making the game what it is. Music is good and not to intrusive. The main part of audio are all screams, steps, cries and other noises you hear during the game that makes you breath faster. For me the audio is the thing that keeps player under constant pressure and makes him released when he is finally reaching ""safe zone"" which is relatively quite and peaceful.Score: 10/10Polish dubbing: 8/10 (there are some minor issues, but IMHO it's very high quality).Video:First person camera with hands visible during stunts really makes you feel like a hero of the game. A lot of effects make everything very realistic not as a render, but as an experience of player.Score: 10/10 Gameplay - Stunts:It's great to run through roofs and moments when the game do not understand your intention are very rare. When it gets a little bit boring you get the hook to make things faster (perfect timing for me!).Score: 9/10Gameplay - Zoombies!:There are multiple types of zoombies kinda like in ""L4D"" there are tanks, splitters, hunters and many more. Yes there is a form of ""which"" as well ;-)On the other hand I would say that special kinds of zoombies are not ""realistic"" (lol) and a little bit OP and poorly implemented (I mean physic). This makes them unpredictable and a little bit frustrating. It kinda allows them to achieve a point as you really want to avoid them as they are kinda not fair ;-)This is what makes the game a little bit boring at the end.Score: 6/10Endgame:One has a lot of quests and challenges to complete, though I'm not huge fan of such gameplay. If you like to complete game 100% - I think there is at least 50-60h to go.Coop:Yet to be tested for me :-)Summary:This game is great.Score: 9/10(Blocking usage of hook in last mission is unforgivable though!)

												For an immersive zombie zurvival, it is pretty well made. The mix of Mirrors Edge and Dead Island compliment each other very well in this game. The different levels of Agility, Fighting, and Survival are great ways to pan out the skill trees. The beginning of the game is a small grind since youre weak and have no stamina, but once you pass that after maybe an hour, the game gets fun and enjoyable. The beauty of the world really shines if your computer can run it, the shaders, ambient occlusion, and zombie details are spot on. I recommend you get it if you enjoy a fast paced survival horror. 9/10			"

												Dying Light  Is one of my most favored games , the scavenging is a bit difficult in the beginning and the prologue seems a bit too long before you can play but besides that the combat and the parkour especially is very awesome , but the story is a bit bland for the type of game it is and it is also in a bit of a crowded genre but besides that i definitly recommend Dying Light to players who like scavenger missions and parkour			"

												Wasn't too sure how I felt about the game as it starts off on a rough note for me, but past the first few minutes this game more than exceeds my expectations.It's difficult enough without being impossible and it encourages hand to hand action over running and gunning. Even more, it encoruages being familiar with your environment by vaulting over objects - even zombies - and using every single terrain, building and barrier to your advantage.Night play is terrifying the first few times, but you quickly learn to use your feet and manuever around volotile zombies while keeping a healthy fear of them.This game is what Dead Island should have been. It  has a better skill tree, a more complete gameplay experience and characters that aren't total asshats. Each quest feels like its a part of the game instead of just busy work to make you feel like you are getting your moneys worth.The ending is intensly satisfying and while the main storyline itself follows some predicatable turns, it doesn't do it in a way thats so obvious you could plot out the entire story arc in the first fifteen minutes. You can try, but there is a feeling you might get it wrong that makes you want to keep playing.I havent had any performance issues and i'm on a computer with holder hardware, but i do have an Nvidia card. I think most of the launch issues with AMD cards were patched already, but other than that i havent experienced any other glitches. This game is incredibly smooth and there are nice little tidbits the developers leave in for people to find. It does have an assassins creed feel to it, but its so small and in passing that before you can fully explore that thought you have a zombie in your face.I'm already on my second playthrough and i'm noticing little things that make the experience and the world im playing in that much richer and dimensional.If you even semi liked Dead Island, you will really love Dying Light.

												A great game. Especially the gameplay. Its very fluid, has great parkour, feels wonderful and looks nice, however the balancing is extremely poorly done. Rather then a game with balanced leveling, you feel totally defenceless for the first quarter of the game, then skyrocket to super OP without ever feeling the growth between. The voice acting is lackluster and story is a absolutely TERRIBLE ripoff of far cry 3, however with gameplay as satisfying as this, it is definitely worth is to throw your cash at it. Final Verdict: It feels like a more solidified and fun dead island, with great gameplay, (however short without side missions...) making me come back to it a second time for another playthrough with friends. I suggest either waiting for a slight price drop, and pumping it full of balancing mods once mods are implemented in the game. 8.5/10 (would play again :D)			"

												The campaign is honestly very meh, it feels like a cheap rip-off of Far Cry 3 or 4, even with the pretty specific Radio tower climbing shamelessly copied directly from Far Cry 3, and the Villain is a Cartoony imitation of Vaas, again from Far Cry 3.So why would I recommend this when you can get Far Cry 3 cheaper? 2 things.1. Drop kicks, they are THAT awesome!2. Co-op, Far Cry 3 has co-op as well, but from what I get it's limited to attacking bases, Dying Light has co-op all throughout, except for the last very last mission.And if you're fan of TV shows like the Walking Dead you can definitely forget that you're not in that universe, I just really wish the story telling was better, and honestly a Walking Dead interpretation done like this could be awesome! They just need better writers, everything else works quite well!			"

												This is my first review of a game but I felt like I just had to show you guys how much I've loved this!I have wanted Dying light since I first heard about it, so you can imagine I was annoyed when they kept delaying the game for longer and longer. However, after buying the game I was so excited to play, Dying Light did not disappoint!!It has everything and more than I would have expected from a zombie game. However, some things did need a bit more work on them but apart from little things like a wider range of house interiors and zombies, this game is brilliant!Well worth the money!!9/10			"

Pros • Parkour Acrobatics• Awesome Weapons• Great Free roam• Co-op • Good level(s) of challenging• Plenty of Missions and side quests• Decent Graphic Options (but options like Anti-Aliasing On/Off sucks)• MODs Support• Easter Eggs• THOSE DAMN VOLATILES!! :P Cons • No Easy Difficulty (However coming from the Dead island games this is not surprising) • Not everything is explained or shown, you will need to learn or research a few things yourself (e.g. house with red smoke or quarantine zones)• Survivor Points death penalty (although i understand why they did this, it still feels like a kick in the nuts)• Recycled Combat system (and yes i say the same for games such as Assassin's Creed)• Predictable story• Rank Progression is a little slow (not recommended for people without patience)• THOSE DAMN VOLATILES!!! :POverall I very much enjoyed this game.Techland has made a very enjoyable game. 9/10  "

												Where do I start. First off, this is one of the best games I have ever played. It's like Dead Island, except better in every possible way. Graphics are great, facial animations are great, and just overall a great atmostphere. You really feel as if you are actually in the game, it pulls you in and doesn't let go.        The parkour aspect is top notch. It feels genuine, and not like some arcadey junk. Running across rooftops, climbing fences, and running away from volatiles at night really gets your blood going.         Combat system is great. Most of the weapons you will use are melee weapons (one handed and two handed), but there are also guns (pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, smgs), a bow with different arrow types and a crossbow thrown into the mix once you start the following. There are a ton of collectible blueprints scattered around the map, and some you can get from completing missions, that you can use to enhance your melee weapon with different effects like Toxic, Electric, Fire, and Impact. More advanced blueprints let you put two effects on one weapon. It is so damn staisfying chopping off heads with a machete and bashing in zombie skulls with a sledgehammer.          The story is alright, not going to dive into any spoilers, but it does its job in keeping everything flowing smoothly. I have completed the main story twice now, and all of the side quests as well.          You get two different maps in the base game, Slums and Old Town, that I think are very detailed and do a good job of rewarding exploration. Each one has a very different feel to it, and that helps add to the overall atmostphere of the game.          This is one of the few games where I have found/completed most of the easter eggs, and collected most if not all of the developer blueprints. No other game has made me want to come back and throughly collect and explore as much as Dying Light. I love going around and exploring every little nook and cranny, just to make sure there's nothing that I missed. The biggest thing I have accomplished is grinding for about 12 hours or so, getting around 9k disater relief packages to reach max legend level at 250. I don't believe any other game will pull me back in as much as this one.           To sum it up, Dying Light is one of the best games I have and I think I will ever play. Everything from the graphics, the animations, the combat, the parkour and the story, feels very very solid and well done. And as much fun as it is to play it alone, playing with your friends is an absolute blast. Techland nailed this one. 10/10 "

												When I first saw the trailer to the game I knew it would become something awesome! It absolutely did, I completed the story 100 % with one of my friends estimated on 12 hours of gameplay, unfortunately. The game is the best zombie apocalypse horror game -ever, but it should be harder to complete and a bit longer in my oppinion. That is why the community created the tool for modding which i assume will be a great way to keep on evolving and play the game.10 / 10ps: why is 4 the unchangeable number of players in survival games?

												Dying light is a wonderful Zombie survival game. First thing it reminded me of was Dead Island, but I honestly got way more enjoyment out of this game. It's like they smashed Mirror's Edge and Dead Island together to create a game with an amazing Parkour environment, but great gameplay overall. Here's my two bits : [ ~{  P R O S }~ ]+ Amazing graphics+ Parkour+ Chopping countless zombies+ Stress during nightime+ Weather+ CO-OP (So much fun)+ Great story+ GRAPPLING. HOOK. ... And Pyza suit+ Leveling system[ ~{  C O N S  }~ ]- Items are not very appealing- All firearms are similar and not much fun to use- Character customisation... Yet you can't see your own character in game anyway?- Coolest weapon is a DLC and you have to get through a rage inducing gauntlet.- Zombie invasions aren't very fair (Multiplayer VS.)- Not much replayability value.

I enjoy almost every secs of it, except the muliplayer hunt vs human, and the dlc for the bow... those are a bit tricky to get your hands into.The free running parkour is very smooth, it's like and extension to Assassin's Creed.combat is quite smooth.Weapons are litmited with 25-50 different types of weapons, I am drawn to one-hand swords, like katana, and machettes.

												Dying Light, what can I say, an exceptional game that is definitely the best game I've played in a long time, parkour is smooth, seamless, fun and rewarding. Better than Mirrors Edge though I would have liked a wall run, but I easily forgot about it and didn't even miss it as much as I thought I did, this is even better than Brink which tried hard but failed. The First Person combat and Parkour in this game is what most other games should be aspiring to be, it's THAT good. The learning curve is easy, it just takes a little bit to get used to if you're using a controller, ""A"" for jump on a Xbox controller or ""X"" for jump on a Playstation controller is now your ""RB"" on Xbox or ""R1"" on Playstation. so it takes a little bit to get used to but it doesn't take long.Now the story, it wasn't the greatest, but it wasn't the worst, I've seen better, but it didn't break the game for me. What makes it for me is the multiplayer along side with side missions, challenges, invasion, etc. It all adds up to a superior multiplayer experience and the world is nice, big, and diverse. There's plenty to do, and plenty to do with others, even if it's as simple as just killing zombies for fun, or exploring the world.There's a variety of weapons, and weapon mods, as you progress there's plenty of options to upgrade. There are guns but there's minimal use for them and not to mention the noise from them attracts the more volatile of the zombies, so beware, DO NOT use guns unless you have to, but afterwards, bail as quickly as possible, don't stick around that area for too long.Now if Walking Dead was a game, I'd imagine it to be something like this, but no parkour. The scare factor of this game is pretty intense at night when the stakes are higher, you can easily die at night, whether it's a walker, runner, or volatile. Daytime is just a walk in the park, though I have this habit of testing the waters and even during the day being very cautious, and I was right to do so very early on in the game.Overall this game gets a 10/10 from me, even with a lacking story, this game made up for it in all other aspects. LOVE IT!			"

												I have been waiting so long for a new hit zombie game since L4D2! But for me this is game of the year or even game of the generation, in general not even just in the zombie genre. The graphics (played on max) is unbelievable, the shadows, the sun and glare, reflections. My favorite thing is the the Night-Day cycle, very realistic as the sun goes down and♥♥♥♥♥♥gets scary! I love having to scavenge for well pretty much everything, all the weapon modifications and upgrades you can do.. The story is really good too, i love the characters and really felt the connection with them. Im almost done the story but i will for sure still be playing for hours just choppin zombies legs off, drop kicking them off building etc.. never gets boring. The only negative thing i have to say is sometimes the side missions are abit boring, and that is truly just my opinion, i feel a bit of repetition here.. where as i always just need to get scavenge for supplies, although you'll sometimes learn abit more about the characters and their story. Overall I give it 10/10 perfect game, a MUST TRY next gen game.			"

												Dying Light is an absolute masterpiece when it comes to zombie games. As it is indeed THE zombie game. It combines one of the best free-running mechanics I've ever seen with an incredibly detailed map and rather well built. Which adds more to the experience.At the start you begin with nothing and feel naked, but as you progress this fear dissipitates and another sets in, which is the volatiles and the hunters.The way the game keeps you on your toes is incredible and the story even if a bit cliche keeps it all together. Having experienced both the dying light and the following and still getting a kick out of the game with new game(+) mode where you can keep all your stuff and perks. Other than that the game is extremely well optimized and even amongst the chaos, the blood, the massacre and the running you'll find yourself stopping on top of a building to just gaze on the map. Verdict : Dying Light is hands down THE zombie AND the best parkour game I have ever played and I recommend it to anyone who wants something like the undead genre to be refreshed through a solid campaign, a good multiplayer which offers competition as well as rewards and an overall excellent experience.Absolutely a 10/10!!!

The parkour and better atmosphere definitely completes this game. Any zombie lover interested in a decently put together story and open world enviroment will like this. The co-op is cool, while it doesn't promise as much as open world zombie multiplayer only games, it at least feels like a complete game. I've been having trouble doing mods for this game, maybe thats the only downside.			"

												Better than Evolve, Left 4 Dead, Dead Island, Killing Floor, Borderlands, Assassins Greed , Uncharted and it bassiclly has all those gamemodes in one. Evolve Monster vs 4 players= 4 player vs zombie mutant Left 4 Dead = 4 player campaing. Did I freaken mention you can jump off walls and off zombies like a ninja. That's Mirror's Edge and Assassins Greed gameplay right there with zombies. There's also a few missions that get your head working. Great story line. Plus good ammount of Special infected.			"

												Dying Light  Is one of my most favored games , the scavenging is a bit difficult in the beginning and the prologue seems a bit too long before you can play but besides that the combat and the parkour especially is very awesome , but the story is a bit bland for the type of game it is and it is also in a bit of a crowded genre but besides that i definitly recommend Dying Light to players who like scavenger missions and parkour			"

												An extremely awesome game that can cause your pulse to reach new heights!Thou, I thought the game itself would last much longer than the 28 so hours I spend clearing the main quest.If you go through the side quests, you will probably have a alot more to do.Oh the zombies. They are EVERYWHERE!Hacking & slashing my way through a horde of them! Love it!What I don't love that much, is the freaking Volatiles!They are the kind of zombie you DON'T wanna meet in a dark back alley.Bombers got me jumpy ALOT!The parkour is also great!Just start running in one direction, and you just climb, jump and grapple hook pretty much everywhere.It's so great!The weapons are plain awesome!And all those thing you can do with them!I really thought thou, that the guns would eventually get attachments but sadly no.Axes, knifes, swords and so on do.How about a machete with fire and electricity attachment?I give this game 8/10 due to the length of the main quest.

												If you have ever played and enjoyed Dead Island, Mirror's Edge, and the Far Cry series you will enjoy this game. After 25 hours of game play I am still satisfied with the story, side quests, and jumping from rooftop to rooftop at night. Overall the story, so far, is well done and the game mechanics make it a great purchase.I'm waiting to finally get my achievment for kicking zombies off the roofs/cliffs, all while yelling, ""This is Harraaaaaan!"" I just have to figure out if the slide tackle and the jump kick actually add to my totals, eithe way, 10/10 for letting me be a Spartan.			"

												Dying Light is more than just your average zombie apocalypse game.Dying Light allows you traverse an open world mired into chaos and destruction. In this environment, you scrap for survival against an array of enemies as the infected are not the only threat: accosting other desperate human beings is typically the only way to get precious supplies.My PC Specs for comparison CPU- AMD FX(tm)-4130 Quad-Core Processor 3.80GHz GPU- NVIDIA GTX 650 DDR3- 16.00gb Windows 7 64bit Motherboard- M5A78L-M/usb3 Review of Techy Things-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This game has no external DRM (besides steam of coarse)-The game is only 12gb download, which was very weclomed for a full hard drive-When running through the city of Haran I get an average of 45fps, and for my budget computer is extremely good (specs above)Review of Storyline/Gameplay------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------While this game does host it fair share of fetching missions, once I had started the story I just couldn't seem to get enough of this gameplay. The story had its rough parts,  like the final missions being only parkour  but through it all you knew exactly what your goal was and why you were doing it.-As for gameplay and controls think of it as ""Dead Island meets Mirror's Edge with a more serious tone.""-This is actually one of the first games where I fear for my character's life. Even in horror games like The Evil within I couldn't care less if my character died, but here, I quickly learned to fear the night, as that is when the zombie like to get increasingly faster.-The map is freaking huge, yet easy to travese, and then halfway through the storyline you get another map of slightly lesser size-However as a tradtional ""zombie survival"" game I think it missed the mark on how available supplies where.Metascore - 75/100Traditional Score - 7.8/10My Rating - 9.2/10End Summary- If you are looking for a fun multiplayer game with some amazing elements of parkour and combat, mixed with the free pvp dlc that game out at launch and a dev team who actually listens to their fanbase to hear the needs of the customers you are in for a sweet treat. If you are looking for another amazing ""Last of Us"" storyline with sparse pickups, or a true traditional zombie survival I suggest you look elsewhere as this storyline, while is does have some great moments, is mainly comprised of fetching missions, but hey, at least it isn't the cliche roadtrip storyline.

												I finished Dying Light around the first two days of release and have been playing it on and off since then. The game itself is great, the movement is fluid, and the combat is pretty standard but satisfying. The crafting system is pretty bare-boned, but you can create some pretty awesome, and ridiculous weapons. Some of the blueprints are difficult to find, and requires you to explore some hidden places, which is perfectly fine. The story itself is pretty straight forward, and standard; nothing special. Side quests have some nice short stories, but some also include standard fetch quests. The parkour is similar to Mirror's Edge. It may feel sluggish at first, but once you level up your agility, it gets much better; you even have the ability to pick up a grappeling hook down the line! I highly recommend playing this game with a few friends, and even if you don't have anyone to play with, I still recommend it.			"

												MINOR SPOILERs (not realy story based, more about endgame equipment)The parkour element is unique and a major positive thing, the side activitives is both fun and rewarding, and the crafting is both wide and balanced, but the crafting materials need a bit more ""drop chance"" calibration (have 700+ metal parts after first playthrough, the drop rate could be lowerd with 50%, without problems).The concept with the melee weapons is good too, but when you reach max level, you only find swords, so if you are an axe or mace type, you need to either buy them or use something else.THE GUNS, need more difference, it dosen't matter if the rareity of the gun is blue or orange, it deals the same damage and have the same price as the rest of the guns with the same name. So it need to be remade to be better, allso there need to be added more types of guns (fx. slow fireing - high damage - bolt action. and pumpaction shotgun etc., to give us a wider range of guns)Allso, the melee weapon spawns at the end of the game (when you are max level) should be more than only swords.But all in all. I give it 4.5 / 5.0.			"

												I hope this game wins game of the year (well would be awsome if another game this good came out tho) I got 41+ hours in this now. I have done about 40% of the main mission. Most of the time I have done side quests and I even spendt 4 hours testing out the laws of the game , finding bugs and such. I spent 2h  looking for a better gun, but guns don't seem to get stronger. A headshot normaly kills most enemies so it dosnt realy matter. The game is awsome.+ The parkour is so good, the whole city is your playground.+ Zombles are grouped so you cant realy just go kill them (not in the beginning anyway) for they outnumber you rather fast. + To me the game got the most awsome level system ever.+ If you kill a zomble another zomble can stand ontop of the first. I managed to make a pile of dead that got halfway up the truck I stood on.+ Graphics is awsome. + Theres many interesting types of zombles.+ Night time. Fun time.+ Many missions.+ Story isn't the best but it's good enoth. + The game is just sooo good!!!Not many bad things realy. - A few rare bugs. like flying.- In safesone. A girl sits 30 cm abow/outside of the sofa. Some of the npc hold items outside of hands. This is more or less only in safesones as far as I have noticed and isnt realy a big deal.- Getting up form water keeps your eyes unfocused for way to long.- Some places look like you can grab into but you cant. 40 deaths thank you.\sure theres a few more minor things but I cant even remember them spesific. xDIs it worth it? YEA! 10/10   100/100  I love this game so much!			"

												My review is more for people who are not sure how it will run. I've used msi afterburner to monitor how much RAM and video memory is used.First my setup.i5 4670k OC 4.5GHzEVGA GTX 760 4GB overclocked8GB DDR3 RAMWindows 7 64. I'm running this game at 1920x1080p. with all settings maxed OTHER then AA which is off and FOV is about 35-40% everything is turned on and set to high/very high for shadows. Running at 45-60FPS. The game uses 3.2GB of Video memory and 6GB of RAM from what I have monitored. So there 2GB recommended is pretty much a lie. Now as for the game it's very fun. Just think of Dead Island meets mirror's egde. At night is really not all that scary and you can very easily just run pass all the crazy zombies that come out. Literally the have a field of view indicated on your map so you can just run pass them all so long as you stay out of the fov lol. I have yet to beat the game or put any real time in so I cant review the game that much. I just wanted to get how the game runs and what it really uses for specs.			"

												Review is based on few hours of gameplay in co-op and solo.First of all Dying light looks amazing  and the atmosphere is spot on. Reminds a lot like earlier first person zombie games but the free running element adds a lot more into the gameplay. The free running gets a lot more fun via perks for example you can vault off a zombie and dropkick another in mid air. You can jump from pretty high up without dying only if there is a convenient trash dump to land on.Melee weapons tend to break quite fast and they can only be fixed 4-6 times depending on the quality of the weapon. Weapon modification is nice also, you can add electric damage, burning, toxic etc..or better handling or even durability.Crafting is easy and you tend to find a lot of materials lying around to make medkits, molotov's, lockpicks etc.When the city gets dark the game gets creepier, adds a bit more difficulty and different gameplay. Some of the quests require you to do them in the night and offer good rewards. You get a lot more experience when playing in night mode and have higher stats also.Co-op is super fun with friends! There is nothing more satisfying than ganging up on zombies with human players. You can advance in the story mode in co-op just like in solo campaign.Be the zombie-mode doesn't really work yet. It won't connect to any games.Developers are adding modding tools later! +++			"

												Unlike other buyers i didnt have a problem with performance everything ran great, ive been following this game for almost 2 years before it come out so i was really exited about it (to be fair i lose my♥♥♥♥♥♥over every zombie game, huge fan of the undead) but when it came close to release i got really nervus that my computer wouldnt be able to run it (even youcanrunit.com told me i was♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck) but when i fired it up and turned off Vsync i was getting a soild 45 fps in the most dense moments. (higher in other smaller places 60+) As for the gameplay: its amazing just killing zombies and ignoring everything else, it never gets old, bashing in thos soft blood filled skulls feels just as good the 1000th time around, hacking away at legs and arms watchng them go flying off with their head to follow is great, you get guns yes, but why use them when a sledgehammer does the job with more satisfaction? although the shotgun is amazing!Story? Meh take it or leave it, they dont make you care much about other survivers (NPC's) and i dont care weather or not we save the earth, but only beacuse the story dont make me wanna care, or maybe its because im just having so much fun killing these brainless corpses, or then again it could be because i keep jumping in and out of coop and im missing alot of the story telling...? either way i dont think im missing much, just shut up and let me kill something. if your able to play coop, do it, dont wait go ahead and have a blast, its crazy fun. but as for Be The Zombie Mode... i dont know because i cant connect to anyone,,,,ever,,,FINAL SCORE 9/10 get it or dont, your the one missing out.http://steamcommunity.com/groups/StrangeGiftaways "

												Think Dead Island with parkour and a lot of improvements. Dying Light is good fun, and Techland seem to be showing they really care about their community despite being essentially AAA and being under a rather sketchy publisher for Dying Light. This is probably one of the most surprising games I've played. I wasn't hyped up at all before the release, I just thought 'eh it looks alright, don't think I'd buy it though'. Now I can barely go a day without playing it. The $60 price tag is worth the singleplayer experience alone. I haven't even bothered to give multiplayer a chance because i'm still enjoying the free roam so to me anything beyond single player is bonus in and of itself			"

These are the moments you expierence in Dying Light.Pros--Great Graphics-That combat -That dropkick-That stupid zombie that looks like a football player on steroids that took steroids that then took steroids Cons--Poorly optimized, I get anywhere from 70 to 22 frames within seconds of each other-While the villan (Rais) is neat, he's extremely cliche-The story too, is very clicheThis isnt a con, just something I wanted to bring up. The beginning of the game is extremely hard, zombies seem like they'll never die and your only choice is to run :/This is one of the best open world games I've ever played, Mirrors Edge meets a much more gritty and polished version of Dead Island!

												This game is unlike new games. Most new games are over hyped and then let donw the community. This game however has lived up to the expectations and is so entertaining and un-repetative that it tops so many new releases. Great game 10/10 !			"

												People say it is dead island mixed with mirror's edge but it it s way more than that. This game is amazing. Some poeple may not like it but that is a preference thing. In my opinioon it is one of the best games i have ever played. Ya some games are fun like csgo or gmod but this game is fun and its not rage inducing like csgo. I would rate this game 9.9/10 only because the other 0.1 is the fact that i can;'t get on any play as the zombie servers. But i believe that will eb fixed asap. Get this game if you have the money. Its worth it in my opinion.			"

												This is what Dead Island should have been, an amazing openworld zombie kill fest, with great movement mechanics and a good story and lead character. Definitly worth its price.This is a true AAA game, and it launched like a AAA game should, very few bugs and problems (the main one is the problem with AMD hardware, but they are working on it), and not a lick of network problems.I tip my hat to Techland, they made a amazing game.

The ONLY complaint I have, or rather a suggestion, maybe a question, is as follows.Why aren't there any bows or cross bows in the game?I could nit-pick about things like lack of body armor, the ""sameness"" of the enemies or the linear plot line but all in all the game kicks♥♥♥♥♥ Except for the no bows thing...that is simple unacceptable.

												Remember Dead Island, remember how it promised a large open world for you to explore in and survive? Remember how none of that was true and it was a linear mess. Well this is what Dead Island should have been. This game has left me speachless based of the fact that this game has a great balance of fun addicting gameplay and a hump or actural survival horror. Coming into this game the first thing you will relize is the outstanding graphics and how the atmosphere feels like an actual zombie breakout. Along with that the sound quality that this game delivers is outstanding, when the sun goes down in the game the sounds of distance zombies screaming really sets the mood. Speaking of night time, this game goes from a very fun hack and slash game to a very tense and scary game. The first time that the game changes from day to night, I was sitting straight up in my seat screaming because the game turns very scary. which is a great thing that I have not seen from a zombie title is long time. All in all, this game delivers what it promised which is impressive for a newer game. I strongly recomend this game to anyone who likes to feel their heart pump while playing games.Whats Good:Graphics GameplayCombatVariety of enemys and weaponsOutstanding sound quality Horror Element Whats Bad:Freerunning can be clunky at times Story is a wee bland Voice acting My Score: 92/100BUY THIS BLOODY GAME, ITS WORTH ALL $60			"

												MINOR SPOILER ALERTI hate lockpicking.Story was so-so. But I think it's some sort of ""writer crisis"" going on right now. A lot of games have very mediocre plot. Game industry could use some fresh blood, probably.But this game is pretty good. A lot of really nice ways to deal with your enemies.This game isn't infected with that racial/pc/feminazi♥♥♥♥♥♥ There are even zombie children here (and they are pretty awesome).Parkour is good. You really feel that your character has weight and strengh, unlike in ME where all that jumping was arcade-ish as hell like it was Mario or something.Modifications are nicely animated. Just don't get attached to your weapon.Day and night cycle is very well done, so you'll be entertained, that's for sure.Almost forgot: bombers will make you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants.

												I’m torn on this one.The store page promises “parkour-fueled zombie survival” and it does deliver in that regard. You will forage for knick knacks to craft weapons while running along rooftops chased by zombies. Besides Romero style shambling hordes there are fast zombies and various super special zombies like ones that try to suicide bomb you or spit toxic goop at you. We’ve seen most of these before in Dead Island (and other games) but Dying Light has added some really nasty specimens that only come out when the sun goes down.The thing that really sets Dying Light apart from Dead Island is the focus on parkour. They did a really good job with this. It’s easy to run around the world, leaping from roof top to roof top and climbing every building, bus, and pole in the game. Unfortunately, I don’t care for jumping puzzles in my first person shooters and this is a huge aspect of Dying Light. Expect to fall to your death a lot because you weren’t being precise enough.Another problem that I have with the game is that its environments are a little less diverse than Dead Island’s mix of sea side luxury resort, sewers, and slums. There are some different districts in Harran but the main game is pretty much entirely set in one big urban environment and its sewers (which we spend too much time in).That being said I enjoyed it enough to sit through all the first person platforming and sewer sections, so I’m going to recommend it.

												Dying light is one of those games that has a decent coop, isn't boring and has a fair enough single-player story. There are tons of side quests and things to do. The main game isn't as challenging if you abuse game mechanics to get really powerful really fast, but the dlc (the bozak horde) is still a really fun challenge.The most fun part is the freedom to run around and and the ability to slice zombies in half with a katana. The graphics are beatiful too. Overall, this is one of the few games of 2015 that is indeed worth a buy. I got it for 16 euros, but if I compare the overall value and the amount of things to do in the game to other 50 euro games, I'd say this is definitely worth full price. Especially so, if you have friends to do coop with.TL; DR; Other than an annoying early game, the game is definitely worth a buy, because of coop, fun combat, cool parkour, zombies and a lot of sidequests and things to do.

The story was good, and the layout of the map was well thought out, also introducing the buggy was a smart move on their part. Really up'd their game with that idea. Playing it at night will always make for the best of thrills. I would recommend doing the side quests, get yourself out and about with exploring. The side quest will really help you find new areas within the map. Overall I think anyone who's willing to give this game a chance will love it. And don't be too scared to set the difficulty to it's highest.			"

You`ll think twice about shootin your gun when its dark.- Roaming the city for loot and skill points is fun to do again and again. There`s allways new things to do, or another way to do it. ME LIKE!- HUD and crafting menu is sweet, Good implemented. You are not safe while crafting! Con`s There are some glitches, does not apear often tho. Like when Using grappling hook (directions).Sometimes the sound from rushing down a cable hangs, doesn`t go away before a loading area.Sudden crash to desktop (story is saved, pjuh).Grappling hook is a bit OP, gets to easy to get away situations that could potentially kill you.

												I played through Dead Island, and wasn't expecting much from the same creator. But this game is overwhelmingly well done. It's visuals are incredibly good on both a technical and artistic level. Every frame could be it's own painting, every screenshot looks too good to be true - but they are.After I calmed down a bit about how good it looked, I realized I was having a ton of fun. Not just ""hey this is neat"", but actually enjoying it. The melee combat is exceptionally good, and never once did I feel like something should have connected but didn't, or should have been a headshot but wasn't. I love to complain, but I couldn't find a bug with the melee. The guns, when they came out, felt balanced and useful (using them risks attracting more dangerous zombies, ammo is limited, headshots are required), but I was a little let down that guns were so reliable. Melee weapons need to be repaired and replaced constantly, meaning you never get attached to even the most awesome butchering knife - but your gun is forever.I'm just going to gush for a second, because there's a lot to love about this game. The parkour is seamless, I never felt gypped by it, and it genuinely takes skill to use, but doesn't feel prohibitively hard. The fact that you have to replace your weapons constantly is excellent, it made every loot drop feel like it could be useful - not just ""I've already got the best weapon I can have"". Dismembering, defenestrating, and beating zombies continues to be fun, especially at later levels with swords that can behead many zombies at once if you execute the swing correctly. Nighttime presents a genuine challenge with serious rewards, and I actually avoided nighttime for many levels, simply because I didn't think I'd survive. A lot of games just present unwinnable situations and force you to hide, but the nights in Dying Light are genuinely survivable, and a huge rush to experience. It's a *challenge*, not an unwinnable situation. The coop is perfectly integrated, you can pick a save (a ""character"") to join in with your friends, and it acts just like it should. Not laggy, you both share quests and progress on your characters, voice chat exists (if a bit quiet), and nothing even looks strange about it. I coop'd 70% of the game.You know what? I can't even think of anything to complain about. Seriously, I whine about the smallest details, but Dying Light doesn't have a single flaw as far as I can tell. It took on an enormous amount of gameplay challenges that no game before it has managed to combine - and absolutely crushed it.Maybe with time I'll get jaded and talk about how some future game did it better than DL, but for today - this is the finest game you can buy.

												THE BAD: 1. The start is agonzingly slow, and there's no clear direction on what to do during the begging of the game when your character only has access to weak weapons.2. The UI is written in the same too small text with black box background you saw in Medal of Honor: Warfighter. 3. Not sure if the performance issues reported are exaggerations or not, but I ran the game fine on my laptop, which isn't the best but I need it for my mobile lifestyle.4. The story is dumb, there's one part where the player is ordered to do something that is so agonizingly stupid its impossible to take his story seriously after that. Basicly a bunch of sick people need anti-zombie medicine, and he's ordered by some evil ♥♥♥♥♥ to destroy it, so he takes some for himself (but not enough and ends up having seizures later) like a greedy prick and ♥♥♥♥ing BURNS the rest the medicine instead of HIDING it somewhere, which he easily could have done.5. Parkour is fun but eventually gets completely overshadowed by a grappling hook that basically functions like a A to B teleporter, you can make a lethal jump of a skyscraper and grapple the ground and you'll then the grapple will pull you down to the ground and you'll land safely. So forget about finding parkour paths up buildings or down buildings, or path-finding around open courts on rooftops to stay up high.6. New game plus is sort of useless, as for me the game is over when both the story is complete and the character is max level.7. The combat is tedious in the beginning until you realize this is NOT the game Dead Island, and you find other way of getting around zombies. It's a game that once you've done a first playthrough, the second is a lot more enjoyable because you know how the game works and what to expect. For example: your weapons are basicly useless at the beginning and upgrading your Combat skill tree by killing zombies won't change that: to get access to better weapons, you need to get Survivor Experience Points so you can buy more powerful weapons. So when you go through the game the second time knowing that, you don't even bother trying to fight the undead until you can kill them with weapons in 2-3 hits. At some point not to late in the game you'll get blade weapons and can perform instant decapitations.8. The fact that number 7 is not explicitly explained will result in a of futile combat early in the game. A tutorial message reading ""The weapons you have access to in the begging of your adventure will do very low damage and degrade quickly!!! To get access to weapons that do more damage and have higher durability, gain Survivor Experience points!!! Avoid combat with infected until you gain access to better weapons that will allow you to fight more effectively!!!"" would have resulted in a lot less frustration with combat and less grinding. That lack of one critical peice of information is the reason for 99% of the bad reviews from gamers and critics who got a bad first impression of the game because of this.THE GOOD:1. Graphically impressive, artistically impressive, character design.2. Music  and sound effects are both impressive. 3. Excellent atmosphere. The world of Harran this game takes place in is detailed and believable.4. Combat with good weapons against zombies is fun.5. Parkour system although unituitive once understood is fun.6. Challenges for both Parkour and Combat are fun. Once you know how the game works, it's great fun, and easily worth the money. The first playthrough is about learning the story (for what it is) and how to master the gameplay.I give it a 8.5 out of 10. It's very good at some things, and what it's good at easily makes up for what it lacks. Once you understand how to play the game at the beginning, the game is excellent. It's easy to overlook the games problems once you understand how to avoid them.			"

												Dying Light is the combination of almost every first-person game made today. Not only is was it a combination, but it was a very successful combination. The graphics on the chrome engine 6 are absolutely beautiful and stunning! Frames is still a question do the performance balance between the cpu cores. However, this is the best game that I've played within the past 5 years!			"

 Быстрые ноги зубов не боятсяКратко эту игру можно описать как Dead Island 2. И неудивительно - разработчиком является польская студия Techland, разработавшая в своё время DI. Сходство заметно невооружённым взглядом - живописная расчленёнка, хрупоксть нашего героя (явно имеющего в качестве наставника на базе МакГайвера), симпатичные пейзажи... и вусмерть клишированная история. Нет, я не из тех снобов, которые извергают ядовитую желчь от каждого уже увиденного художественного приёма или сюжетного хода. Просто всё происходящее в основном сюжете мы видели неоднократно. Ну пожалуй за исключением того, что зомби-апокалипсис локален в следствие действий правительства, а не в силу географической привязки/раннего планирования злых корпораций/самого начала бедствия/чего-либо ещё. В  турецкий вымышленный город Харран после внезапной вспышки зомби-вируса, произошедшей как раз перед  Олимпийскими Всемирным Атлетическими Играми где-то в 2014 году по заданию GRE высылают нашего героя - оперативника Кайла Крэйна с заданием найти Кадира Сулеймана, лица, ответственного за обеспечение порядка в городе и изъять у него документы, в которых содержится неполная информация по изготовлению лекарства. Но всё, как известно, идёт наперекосяк с самого начала - герой получает по зубам от каких-то бандитов, а после ещё и обзаводится укусом от зомби. Больше он не Кайл, а теперь он новоиспечённый бегун под номером 31, вынужденный жить от одной порции  Зомбрекса Антизина до другой. Но задание у него остаётся прежним. Сюжет, как я уже отметил выше, не слишком оригинален и не настолько хорошо подан, чтобы на это нельзя было обратить внимание. Но побочные задания на ура вытягивают положение. Тут тебе и поиск мелков и кубиков для детей, тут и убийство некоего тролля, шатающегося по стоянке, и диалоги с человеком, чья мама и мухи не обидит, и доставка алкоголя для дезинфекции при родах и раскрытие заговора рептилиоидов. Боёвка достаточно проста, но ближе к концу игры становится совсем незамысловатой. У врагов здоровье фиксировано, и если поначалу приходится достаточно долго махать гаечным ключом, чтобы зомби наконец-то успокоился (а связываться с тремя-четыремя сразу вообще противопоказано). то уже со второй трети игры оружие становится достаточно мощным, чтобы прорубаться через толпы. Если бы не верная подбородочная нога на пружинке - поначалу было бы ещё хуже. А рукопашные схватки с живыми людьми усложняются ещё больше - увороты и блокирование ударов здесь правило со стороны оппонентов. Так что как и в Dead Island, огнестрел против живых намного эффективнее. Впрочем, меткие выстрелы по головам теперь косят всех рядовых противников. А оружие ближнего боя легко можно улучшить чтобы оно зажигало, било током, травило...Крафт привычный. Разве что теперь не надо искать верстаки - герой сам на коленке скрутит всё, были бы чертежи и нужные припасы. Бесплатно. Для любого холодного оружия. Огнестрельное не модифицируется. Даже сам Кайл при заявлении о том, что ""тут у нас есть оружейник, он из любой пукалки гаубицу сделает"" отвечает ""лучше бы глушитель мог прикрутить"". Ремонт тоже быстрый и надёжный. Разве что каждое оружие можно починить лишь конечное количество раз, после чего оно годится лишь в утиль. Звуковое сопровождение... Не оставило особых эмоций. Что музыка, что реплики и т.д. - не слишком запоминается и без очередного техно-трека в какой-то момент вполне можно обойтись. Графика симпатичная. Каких-либо артефактов, огрехов анимации и других проблем не замечал. Порадовало внимание к деталям. Вроде металлических скреп на чиненном-перечиненном топорике или красных глаз у заплаканных девушек. Паркур? Да, ещё одна ""основная фишка"" игры. Кайл легко скачет по зданиям, прыгает по головам зомби, скользит по зиплайнам, карабкается по стенам, падает (без последствий, если на мусор/машины и с - если на асфальт). Управление лёгкое и если что-то не получается - либо цепляться не за что, либо у вас некоторые проблемы с реакцией. О сетевых режимах, дополнениях и локализации сказать ничего не могу, увы. Не пробовал и после прохождения как-то не тянет. Итог? Всё же рекомендую. История, пусть и избитая, не самая плохая, ночные вылазки подкупают опасностью, жестокие стычки за поставки гуманитарной помощи приедаются далеко не сразу... да и пасхалок со спрятанными уникальными вещами не так мало.

												The game was fun to play with a group of friends for a full party, and it's still fun solo. It gradually turns from a fight for survival to a moshpit of facing a crowd of zombies, and it's enjoyable along the journey. However, the storytelling started plunging near the end in both the original plot and The Following. I wasn't as satisfied with the endings as I was with the developing story. The endgame is also repetitive with legend ranks. I wouldn't replay it because I've gotten all that I can from the game, but I do believe that playing the game while it was fresh was totally worth it.			"

												MINOR SPOILER ALERTI hate lockpicking.Story was so-so. But I think it's some sort of ""writer crisis"" going on right now. A lot of games have very mediocre plot. Game industry could use some fresh blood, probably.But this game is pretty good. A lot of really nice ways to deal with your enemies.This game isn't infected with that racial/pc/feminazi♥♥♥♥♥♥ There are even zombie children here (and they are pretty awesome).Parkour is good. You really feel that your character has weight and strengh, unlike in ME where all that jumping was arcade-ish as hell like it was Mario or something.Modifications are nicely animated. Just don't get attached to your weapon.Day and night cycle is very well done, so you'll be entertained, that's for sure.Almost forgot: bombers will make you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants. And then you'll die.Good night, good luck.			"

												Dying Light takes a bunch of pages out of the cliche zombie game handbook and refines them to make them feel new. You play as Crane, a employee of the GRE (some goverment organisation i think) to obtain a top secret file that is even disclosed to you. you get droped into Harran which is quarantined off from the world due to a huge infection. After being attacked by a groups of survivors and zombies your saved by two people (one of which dies) and taken to ""The Tower"" where you are told to meet the boss, instead you talk to a kid in his teens named hasan. At this point you get your first mision and where you learn the mechanics of the game. Hasan has you go through a parkour puzzle and then sends you out on a fetch quest. The gameplay mainly consists of running to a place, avoid zombies, kill zombies, retrieve item, and run back. The game emphasizes using the parkour system to jump on the roofs of building to avoid zombie since most of the zombies can not climb. Most of the time it's better to use a melee weapon since guns make lots of noise and attract zombies. Your starting weapons and horrible and deal no damage and break quickly. It is important to spend the first hour of gameplay seearching for parts and money for weapons that can actually kill things. You can earn skill points by killing zombies, doing tasks, climbing, etc which allows you to unlock new abilitys. You can also craft weapons and items such as medpacks and lockpicks. You also can unlock safehouses by killing the zombies in a certain area and sealing off. Safe houses pretect you from zombies and give you a place to sleep and buy stuff. At nightime the zombies become more aggresive and night hunters come out which are very fast and strong zombies that if they see you will chase you through the city and you have to use traps to avade the hunters. The overall variety of zombies are limited but most of the time I found myself just jumping over and running away from most zombies especially the hammer zombies which deal massive amounts of damage and are hard to kill. The parkour system is a little clucky at times but works fairly well most of the time. The story is pretty intresting especially Rais (the main villan) who had a intresting pesonallity. He is a phyco but not in the traditional way. He will kill his own men for little reason and teases crane throughout the game how crane always takes orders. Other characters like Jade I didn't really like. Crane somehow managed to fall in love with her even though they barley talked to each other. The story overall is pretty good and engaging. The multiplayer is a litttle dull. One the the gamemodes is where one player takes controll of a really overpowered night hunter and the player(s) have to destroy all the nests without loosing all there lives. the survivors can using there UV flashlights to burn the hunter before he latches onto them which burns the hunter and gives the survivors and chance to kill it. The other modes involve killing zombies and collecting loot and other tasks. The level editor is intresiting and it allows you to download user made maps off the workshop to play and adds more replay value. I do not own any of the DLC so I cannot give my opinions on those yet but they don't look that bad. This game is a deffinate overlooked gem of 2015 and may be one of the best games of the first half of 2015. A fun story, good mechanics, and tense gameplay make this a really fun game to play. The only downsides are the repetitive fetch quests, no fast travel, and the abundant use of quick time events. At the 33% off ($40.00) it's 100% worth it and a must have for any zombie game fan. Can't wait to check out the DLC and mess around in the city of Harran some more. 8.8/10			"

												BEST GAME IN THE WORLD!!! Would you like to know why? then read the message below! I I                                                                                   I I                                                                                   V VOk so the game is increadibly fun in every way possible! The zombie slashing, the blood and the gore, and especially the campaingn! If your reading this message now and trying to get info if the game is worth it is very well worth it! One thing that everyone likes is a friend to play it with! With it's 4 player co-op problem solved! Now I now I know this message is sorta all over the place but in general, the game is a blast! There's lots of dlcs, weapons, skins, and best of all.. THE ZOMBIES! Now, the zombies in this game are increadibly.. I'd say dangarfull to low level characters so Techland (game developers) Put parkour in the game! There are lots of skills you can unlock and a total of 3 main skill trees such as, agility, (free running points) combat (get these for killing zom zoms and hostile surviviors) And finally survival! (you can get these points for doing quests and the campaign fairly quickly) Now, back to the zombies, I skipped them in order to mention the parkour. So here we go! The most common type of zombie is just a normal zombie; These zombies can be found anywhere! Even sleeping with your mum! lel jk. These zombies can be found if making noise ror just randomly found, they're called virals; Virals are zombies who just recently turned. And I won't be going on about the types of zom zoms anymore cause you'll need to see them for yourself! Now, this'll be all for the reveiw and I know it wasn't really why I like it, it was more of.. How the game is and things about it. But who cares? It's a game xD And I encourage you... To buy this wonderfull product!			"

												My expectations were fairly high going in to this game - and I was not disappointed.I had watched a couple of streams of people playing this game with their friends, and thought that it looked like a lot of fun, so I finally managed to talk my friend (who does not like zombie games) into playing it with me. And we definitely had fun.The story revolves around you, an agent/soldier type guy who is sent into a city which has been sealed off as a result of a zombie outbreak, in order to find some important research documents. While on this mission you meet some nice (and some not so nice) people, as well as learn some new things about the people you are working for.The story is maybe nothing too original, but the gameplay is where this game really shines, and I'll try to mention all the (in my opinion) most important things.- The weapons. You can fight your way through zombies using a wide range of weapons, from swords, daggers, clubs, guns, rifles, bows,  fists... You name it. Weapons can be found, crafted or bought, upgraded, sold... However, all weapons will eventually break.- The enemies. There are plenty of enemies, from the regular slow zombies to fast zombies, exploding zombies, huge, charging zombies - and the worst ones of them all, the ""night zombies"". The difference between night and day in this game is, well, like night and day. During the day you might feel safe, but during the night? Be sure to keep a bunch of flares on you and do not stop running.- The Grappling Hook. Once you get this item, the game changes completely. You are no longer limited to running and juming. You can zip around all over town, escaping zombies or reaching the roof of tall buildings much more easily. You can also use it as a (not very efficient) weapon. I love this item.- The Following. This expansion was also a lot of fun. You get access to a car, and let me tell you, driving around mowing down zombies is way more fun than it should be. Honestly, who needs a sword or a gun when you have a car? One thing that I missed when playing The Following was the ability to zip from building to building, as there are not that many buildings out there on the countryside where the expansion takes place. But then again, who needs buildings when you have a car.- The other DLCs. I enjoyed the parkour challenge DLC, however I didn't really enjoy the Bozak Horde survival challenge DLC. But these DLCs are not really mandatory, and you can choose to skip them all together if you don't want to do them (and don't care about achievements).I played this game with my friend from start to finish, and I really recommend playing it coop with someone, either a friend or just someone online. However it is completely possible to finish the game alone, so even people who prefer single player should definitely give the game a shot. Just be careful, especially during nighttime, as you won't have anyone to watch your back.Highly recommended!			"

LOOT LOOT LOOT ;D - Side missions are plentyful, story quest is soso fun but still ok.- Create weapons and smash walkers, skill the F up and  turn the hunt!- HECTIC as #%!# at night :D - Sounds from zombies is very good and scary at times. You`ll think twice about shootin your gun when its dark.- Roaming the city for loot and skill points is fun to do again and again. There`s allways new things to do, or another way to do it. ME LIKE!- HUD and crafting menu is sweet, Good implemented. You are not safe while crafting! Con`s There are some glitches, does not apear often tho. Like when Using grappling hook (directions).Sometimes the sound from rushing down a cable hangs, doesn`t go away before a loading area.Sudden crash to desktop (story is saved, pjuh).Grappling hook is a bit OP, gets to easy to get away situations that could potentially kill you.

												So far what I think of this game, it has dead islands gameplay core there with parkour some may like some not. It is a very resource intensive game, it holds 60fps for me while others with varying specs some can't hold even 30. I find the game fun  while exploring and unlocking safezones and finding loot. Its story could've been in more indepth with the characters. Day time is relax and night time is a struggle if caught. I really hope the dlc adds more story and new area because looking at the slums for most whole game. Working on Newgame+ now. I don't regret buying this game like most others I have this past year.

												I played through Dead Island, and wasn't expecting much from the same creator. But this game is overwhelmingly well done. It's visuals are incredibly good on both a technical and artistic level. Every frame could be it's own painting, every screenshot looks too good to be true - but they are.After I calmed down a bit about how good it looked, I realized I was having a ton of fun. Not just ""hey this is neat"", but actually enjoying it. The melee combat is exceptionally good, and never once did I feel like something should have connected but didn't, or should have been a headshot but wasn't. I love to complain, but I couldn't find a bug with the melee. The guns, when they came out, felt balanced and useful (using them risks attracting more dangerous zombies, ammo is limited, headshots are required), but I was a little let down that guns were so reliable. Melee weapons need to be repaired and replaced constantly, meaning you never get attached to even the most awesome butchering knife - but your gun is forever.I'm just going to gush for a second, because there's a lot to love about this game. The parkour is seamless, I never felt gypped by it, and it genuinely takes skill to use, but doesn't feel prohibitively hard. The fact that you have to replace your weapons constantly is excellent, it made every loot drop feel like it could be useful - not just ""I've already got the best weapon I can have"". Dismembering, defenestrating, and beating zombies continues to be fun, especially at later levels with swords that can behead many zombies at once if you execute the swing correctly. Nighttime presents a genuine challenge with serious rewards, and I actually avoided nighttime for many levels, simply because I didn't think I'd survive. A lot of games just present unwinnable situations and force you to hide, but the nights in Dying Light are genuinely survivable, and a huge rush to experience. It's a *challenge*, not an unwinnable situation. The coop is perfectly integrated, you can pick a save (a ""character"") to join in with your friends, and it acts just like it should. Not laggy, you both share quests and progress on your characters, voice chat exists (if a bit quiet), and nothing even looks strange about it. I coop'd 70% of the game.You know what? I can't even think of anything to complain about. Seriously, I whine about the smallest details, but Dying Light doesn't have a single flaw as far as I can tell. It took on an enormous amount of gameplay challenges that no game before it has managed to combine - and absolutely crushed it.Maybe with time I'll get jaded and talk about how some future game did it better than DL, but for today - this is the finest game you can buy.

												Unlikable characters, terrible story full of cliches and plot holes.  No real character customization other than weaponry which begins to get a bit thin.Game play is still fairly fun and for that I recommend the game.  The parkour death dealing zombie slaughter is fairly fun, and nothing beats drop kicking a zombie off the top of a building.			"

												Dying Light is the combination of almost every first-person game made today. Not only is was it a combination, but it was a very successful combination. The graphics on the chrome engine 6 are absolutely beautiful and stunning! Frames is still a question do the performance balance between the cpu cores. However, this is the best game that I've played within the past 5 years!			"

												THE BAD: 1. The start is agonzingly slow, and there's no clear direction on what to do during the begging of the game when your character only has access to weak weapons.2. The UI is written in the same too small text with black box background you saw in Medal of Honor: Warfighter. 3. Not sure if the performance issues reported are exaggerations or not, but I ran the game fine on my laptop, which isn't the best but I need it for my mobile lifestyle.4. The story is dumb, there's one part where the player is ordered to do something that is so agonizingly stupid its impossible to take his story seriously after that. Basicly a bunch of sick people need anti-zombie medicine, and he's ordered by some evil ♥♥♥♥♥ to destroy it, so he takes some for himself (but not enough and ends up having seizures later) like a greedy prick and ♥♥♥♥ing BURNS the rest the medicine instead of HIDING it somewhere, which he easily could have done.5. Parkour is fun but eventually gets completely overshadowed by a grappling hook that basically functions like a A to B teleporter, you can make a lethal jump of a skyscraper and grapple the ground and you'll then the grapple will pull you down to the ground and you'll land safely. So forget about finding parkour paths up buildings or down buildings, or path-finding around open courts on rooftops to stay up high.6. New game plus is sort of useless, as for me the game is over when both the story is complete and the character is max level.7. The combat is tedious in the beginning until you realize this is NOT the game Dead Island, and you find other way of getting around zombies. It's a game that once you've done a first playthrough, the second is a lot more enjoyable because you know how the game works and what to expect. For example: your weapons are basicly useless at the beginning and upgrading your Combat skill tree by killing zombies won't change that: to get access to better weapons, you need to get Survivor Experience Points so you can buy more powerful weapons. So when you go through the game the second time knowing that, you don't even bother trying to fight the undead until you can kill them with weapons in 2-3 hits. At some point not to late in the game you'll get blade weapons and can perform instant decapitations.8. The fact that number 7 is not explicitly explained will result in a of futile combat early in the game. A tutorial message reading ""The weapons you have access to in the begging of your adventure will do very low damage and degrade quickly!!! To get access to weapons that do more damage and have higher durability, gain Survivor Experience points!!! Avoid combat with infected until you gain access to better weapons that will allow you to fight more effectively!!!"" would have resulted in a lot less frustration with combat and less grinding. That lack of one critical peice of information is the reason for 99% of the bad reviews from gamers and critics who got a bad first impression of the game because of this.THE GOOD:1. Graphically impressive, artistically impressive, character design.2. Music  and sound effects are both impressive. 3. Excellent atmosphere. The world of Harran this game takes place in is detailed and believable.4. Combat with good weapons against zombies is fun.5. Parkour system although unituitive once understood is fun.6. Challenges for both Parkour and Combat are fun. Once you know how the game works, it's great fun, and easily worth the money. The first playthrough is about learning the story (for what it is) and how to master the gameplay.I give it a 8.5 out of 10. It's very good at some things, and what it's good at easily makes up for what it lacks. Once you understand how to play the game at the beginning, the game is excellent. It's easy to overlook the games problems once you understand how to avoid them.			"

												I've been playing for about 13 hours and here's a short reviewPros: +There are a lot of weapons, and the ability to craft and modify weapons with blueprints is great!+The Parkour is really smooth and flows well!+The graphics looks great! The brown-ish in-game colors does actually look good!+Dropkicking!+The skilltree is very nice and simple!+There are a lot of things to do. Good sidequests and collectibles!+Funny side characters and dialogues!+The game gets very exciting at night and rewards the player with more XP and such!+The game will get mod tools!Cons: -I'm not going to spoil anything but the story was predictable and a bit cliché!-Weapons break way to fast!-I would like to have more special zombies, good thing this game is getting mod tools!-The grappling hook! With it you don't need to run around and climb buildings( i think it ruins the immersion and gameplay a bit)Overall it's a very good zombie survival parkour game. The story is a bit meh, but other than that the game is great!			"

												I highly recommend this game for anyone that loves smashing zombie's on survival basis. this game does everything right from the beginning.. and after the prologue it gets even better as night comes in. alot of the missions throughout the story so far has me doing jobs for people. although a little repetive.. but so much fun cuz what else would you rather do? the best part is securing the safe houses.. you have to close the gate and turn on the lights while making sure zombies don't attack you. i haven't had any problems with this game crashing.. but there is a major frame rate drop through out the game which can be annoying but doesn't really ruin the gameplay that much. i just really miss 60 fps for a game like this. hopefully the patch will make things better but regardless no one should avoid it because of that reason. only other problem i have is with the inventory and upgrade/bluprint system. i wish it was explained to me alot better in the beginning cuz i'm still fumbling with it. skills are such an important feature of this game as it rewards you and your character levels up in agility, power and survival.

												Just amazing. The feel of the game and sounds of the game are just perfect. A zombie survival done right. In a way its like a hardcore dead island, and some. The parkour is an awsome addiction and adds to the night rush. You are not a god that can kill anything no matter the numbers. It gets to a point were its fight or flight, and fighting might kill you. The Zombie AI ranges from dumb to really scary. Night time is not like other games were its just stronger zombies and a larger number of them, Dying Lights night time is more intense, the night zombies are fast and will chase you and call their friends. Facing more than 1 is deadly. Overall it is a very well amde game, a few bugs that are not even important. Money well spent!!			"

												I would totally recomend this game, I understand modding was taken away and such, i'm not much of a modder so outside of that respect the game is amazing, it controls smoothly. I have a windforce 970 and it's doing very well averaging 60 fps wich is good enough for me. However my main gripe is the lack of impact you have on the story line. You have very little choice in the outcome and the main character's voice is cheesey at times. after all that, love the controls, the graphics (mine are medium to high) over all good port.			"

												It is a successor to the dead island franchise, or at least it feels like it.... if you like dead island 1 or 2, you will going to love this game, if you do not, beware.That aside, this game is great.... it feels a jump to the moon in comparison with the dead island games.Graphics are amazing.... you can't get more next gen than this right now.... very realistic and with amazing effects, which run just great on my laptop.... yes, laptop friendly, if you have a decent graphics card in it.Gameplay is, like I said, very similar to dead island, scavanging for weapons, fixing them, upgrading them, leveling up and unlocking abilities, so the mechanics are basically the same, with cool weapons and abilities.They also added pretty cool parkour moves to the game mechanics, and this makes it sooo amazing... you just can't get enough jumping and stomping zombies.Story is a little weak, and the side missions feel like part of the story, but they distract you from advancing, to a point, that you can't tell when a story is side mission or storyline.This is not the best zombie story out there, but it is good.This game feel very long... I feel like I've played forever, between side missions and main story, and I'm far from halfway of the story... so it is worth the money, since you will be getting long hours, if you are completionist.Zombies, violence, drugs and gore... if you are cool with that, I recommend it.

												Remember Dead Island, remember how it promised a large open world for you to explore in and survive? Remember how none of that was true and it was a linear mess. Well this is what Dead Island should have been. This game has left me speachless based of the fact that this game has a great balance of fun addicting gameplay and a hump or actural survival horror. Coming into this game the first thing you will relize is the outstanding graphics and how the atmosphere feels like an actual zombie breakout. Along with that the sound quality that this game delivers is outstanding, when the sun goes down in the game the sounds of distance zombies screaming really sets the mood. Speaking of night time, this game goes from a very fun hack and slash game to a very tense and scary game. The first time that the game changes from day to night, I was sitting straight up in my seat screaming because the game turns very scary. which is a great thing that I have not seen from a zombie title is long time. All in all, this game delivers what it promised which is impressive for a newer game. I strongly recomend this game to anyone who likes to feel their heart pump while playing games.Whats Good:Graphics GameplayCombatVariety of enemys and weaponsOutstanding sound quality Horror Element Whats Bad:Freerunning can be clunky at times Story is a wee bland Voice acting My Score: 92/100BUY THIS BLOODY GAME, ITS WORTH ALL $60			"

The gameplay is really fun, story is so-so and the online co-op is pretty solid, its not horrible OP as say dead island's co-op was.

												I finished Dying Light around the first two days of release and have been playing it on and off since then. The game itself is great, the movement is fluid, and the combat is pretty standard but satisfying. The crafting system is pretty bare-boned, but you can create some pretty awesome, and ridiculous weapons. Some of the blueprints are difficult to find, and requires you to explore some hidden places, which is perfectly fine. The story itself is pretty straight forward, and standard; nothing special. Side quests have some nice short stories, but some also include standard fetch quests. The parkour is similar to Mirror's Edge. It may feel sluggish at first, but once you level up your agility, it gets much better; you even have the ability to pick up a grappeling hook down the line! I highly recommend playing this game with a few friends, and even if you don't have anyone to play with, I still recommend it.			"

I see alot of people complaining about AMD graphic cards not working with the game. I have an AMD Radeon 7950 HD and i works perfectly for me. Tried fiddling with the graphics and there is not really any difference between low and high, but my fps is better when playing on low so i decided to do so. Another thing i want to point out is: I found a gun and decided to get a airdrop and when i aimed at the guards, they put their hands up and i looted the airdrop. This was without doubt my favorite moment so far. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes: fast paced gameplay (parkour), killing zombies, very realistic gameplay and a nice storyline.			"

Dying Light keeps you busy once you beat the game as well, the following DLC is an amazing end game DLC to play with your friends and you can also do bounties which will help you max your ranks once you've beaten the game. I'd reccomend this game to anyone who loves zombie games and co-op with friends or even randoms. The community isn't bad either, of course you'll come across a few bad people but that's normal, but you'll also make a lot of friends just by playing with randoms.

												MINOR SPOILER ALERTI hate lockpicking.Story was so-so. But I think it's some sort of ""writer crisis"" going on right now. A lot of games have very mediocre plot. Game industry could use some fresh blood, probably.But this game is pretty good. A lot of really nice ways to deal with your enemies.This game isn't infected with that racial/pc/feminazi♥♥♥♥♥♥ There are even zombie children here (and they are pretty awesome).Parkour is good. You really feel that your character has weight and strengh, unlike in ME where all that jumping was arcade-ish as hell like it was Mario or something.Modifications are nicely animated. Just don't get attached to your weapon.Day and night cycle is very well done, so you'll be entertained, that's for sure.Almost forgot: bombers will make you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants.

												Good game! Dont even have high enough specs to run at max settings, I tried it and it somehow ran better than the lower settings. K. Amazing game.Pros:-Open World-Parkour is great-Lots of customisations-Nice story-In depth gameplay-Cool Grappling Hook-Attempted Wingsuit (Pyza suit easter egg)Cons:-Pyza suit should be better. They should add a wingsuit in the DLC, but the pyza suit to be better. (Just make real wingsuit physics)-Invisible walls on tall places & Towers-Grappling hook doesn't work on tall places & towers.-Jumping from the top of the starting building doesn't actually make you plummet to your death, you just get the traveling UI and teleport back where you were. (Hard to wingsuit)Overall, I would give this game a 8/10, there is not much to do once you get good weapons, beat the story, and unlock all the outposts or safehouses, but thats what DLC is for amirite? Story is great! Better than a lot of games I've played.I reccomended this game to all my friends. :D			"

The game is big, and made for people who like to explore. But if you like to kill, then this is also your game.I'll explain myself here. Dying light can be seen and loved by many points of view. There's a leveling system that will level according to what you do most. There is Agility that specializes on escaping Zombies and climbing, Parkour. Then there's Power, which is the one that specializes in killing zombies and giving you fun and diverse ways to kill them. Storyline:Although I am not yet done with the Dying Light storyline, I'll tell you one thing: If you go straight trying to speedrun through the storyline, you'll end the game quickly, perhaps too quickly too. The game is aimed for you to explore, and enjoy, so if you are not the type to enjoy exploring and looking around looking for the highest place you can climb or how much you can find, how rich you can become, this is not your game. But I will give it to the storyline, I've found myself ignoring countless sidequests and opportunities to explore because I wanted to see what would happen next. Overall, I'd say the Storyline is fun, can hook you on but not something to speedrun through.Exploring:Like I said, this game has an AMAZING exploring system. If you go around and explore you'll find that there are collectibles for you to find, and chances are on first look you're not gonna find them all. There are three sorts of things you can find around the world. Zombie Statues, Flags and Notes. That is all I am gonna say. There are 30 Flags, like 100 Zombie statues and 67 notes. If you are the type to play this game and find everything and enjoy everything. You will find yourself enjoying this game to the maximum. Because there is a lot to explore and exploring is rewarded. Easter eggs can be found and the game will last a lot longer.Fighting:Although I will say, I died a LOT on this game, most of it was not because the Zombies took the upper hand and killed me. Zombies will seem threatening and even a bit scary at the early stages of the game. Where it takes you 5 hits to kill them and it is really satisfying to kill your first Zombie, your first 10, and soon your first 100. Zombies are fun to kill, even a bit relaxing after a while and if you get overwhelmed, even a bit hard to beat. There are many types of Zombies, I will not get into detail with them because that is for you to find out, but personally, I am satisfied with the fighting on this game. The Zombies don't follow Ragdoll physics, so if you kill one by kicking them off a cliff, they will look almost human falling off a cliff.Parkour:The Parkour in this game is very fun, at first a bit confusing but really fun in general. You will be able to find the highest place you can climb to and even find yourself just parkouring out of the actual questline or sidequest you were doing. Some fun things about Parkour is that there are some things you can find in some houses that you would not have found had you not gone ontop of a house or even a building. Overall, there is not much to say about parkour more than it's fast, exciting, and I would definitely say it is fun, although I found myself raging because I would die from fall distance, and whatnot but that's because I'm stubborn.Co-op:Co-op adds a LOT to this game. I found myself constantly running off from my partner just to see what I could find, and eventually both of us meeting somewhere and exchanging what it is that we found. Ranging from Weapons that perhaps he liked the bat and I liked the Cleaver, or anything, really. Co-op adds a different element to this game, that allows you to survive a Zombie Apocalypse with a friend, not alone. I would definitely reccomend it.Customization:Although this game is lacking whether I can be a female Runner or not, I would say it was quite disapointing. My Co-op friend also being Kyle Crane kind of killed the entire fun of two survivors and it made it seem more like that was just my twin running around. Outfits are pretty, I will admit that but they are not the maximum customization I would have wanted from this game. Overall, a bit disappointed.Overall:Dying Light is a game that can reach out to a lot of people. I, for one adore every aspect of the game whether it is getting Airdrops to rank up on Survival. Parkouring and jumping over Zombies to see if maybe I can find another note, another flag or another Zombie Statue or to see just what else I can discover. And also the fighting on the game that can be extremely satisfying with the slow motion, succeeding on the game making me feel indeed as a Hunter at Day and Prey at Night. I'll reccomend this game to any person. Even if it's just to do the storyline, it is a lot of fun. My rating for this game would be 9/10.			"

 + Positives +  Climbing mechanics are really good realistic. Skill tree is big. Itself consists of 3 parts, Agility, Power, Survivor. Great story. Funny and good fight mechanics :D CO-OP is working really good and its more enjoyable than singeplayer. Sounds, musics are good. Graphics detailed and great. Have a lots of different weapons. Detailed. Zombies are detailed. Night Hunters are op making you scare from night.  You can do different activities in open world detailed its good. - Negatives -  Characters are looks bad in cinematics.  Weapon durabilities are really bad. They are breaking so easly. Singleplayer little bit gets boring. Story is so SHORT.If i miss something forgive me x)Its a really great game. 8.7/10If you found this helpful please rate. :) "

												Dying light is one of those games that has a decent coop, isn't boring and has a fair enough single-player story. There are tons of side quests and things to do. The main game isn't as challenging if you abuse game mechanics to get really powerful really fast, but the dlc (the bozak horde) is still a really fun challenge.The most fun part is the freedom to run around and and the ability to slice zombies in half with a katana. The graphics are beatiful too. Overall, this is one of the few games of 2015 that is indeed worth a buy. I got it for 16 euros, but if I compare the overall value and the amount of things to do in the game to other 50 euro games, I'd say this is definitely worth full price. Especially so, if you have friends to do coop with.TL; DR; Other than an annoying early game, the game is definitely worth a buy, because of coop, fun combat, cool parkour, zombies and a lot of sidequests and things to do.

												Good game! Dont even have high enough specs to run at max settings, I tried it and it somehow ran better than the lower settings. K. Amazing game.Pros:-Open World-Parkour is great-Lots of customisations-Nice story-In depth gameplay-Cool Grappling Hook-Attempted Wingsuit (Pyza suit easter egg)Cons:-Pyza suit should be better. They should add a wingsuit in the DLC, but the pyza suit to be better. (Just make real wingsuit physics)-Invisible walls on tall places & Towers-Grappling hook doesn't work on tall places & towers.-Jumping from the top of the starting building doesn't actually make you plummet to your death, you just get the traveling UI and teleport back where you were. (Hard to wingsuit)Overall, I would give this game a 8/10, there is not much to do once you get good weapons, beat the story, and unlock all the outposts or safehouses, but thats what DLC is for amirite? Story is great! Better than a lot of games I've played.I reccomended this game to all my friends. :D			"

												Dying Light is a really well put together game. It looks amazing and incorporates a unique parkour system that manages to be fun, intuitive and still seem realistic at the same time. There is also a vast array of weapons and novel ways to kill zombies with pretty much anything you pick up in the game having some ability to form some type of weapon. The story and characters are put together really and put the player in a believeable zombie apocalypse atmosphere.9/10			"

												Never much enjoyed ""Dead island"" style games but this one has something more to it. Played Dying light in nvidia event. but never got around to play it at home and finish it. 50h in and still have stuff to do.There is something satisfying kicking zombies in head and looting stuff to get better weapons to chop zombie heads off faster.Can't really think about any negative stuff.Ok didn't like the big zombies but that's part of the game so can't really count that.now looking forward to new dying light that comes out in few months.

												Definitely better than the original content. Played best Co-Op. The story was good, and the layout of the map was well thought out, also introducing the buggy was a smart move on their part. Really up'd their game with that idea. Playing it at night will always make for the best of thrills. I would recommend doing the side quests, get yourself out and about with exploring. The side quest will really help you find new areas within the map. Overall I think anyone who's willing to give this game a chance will love it. And don't be too scared to set the difficulty to it's highest.			"

												I hope this game wins game of the year (well would be awsome if another game this good came out tho) I got 41+ hours in this now. I have done about 40% of the main mission. Most of the time I have done side quests and I even spendt 4 hours testing out the laws of the game , finding bugs and such. I spent 2h  looking for a better gun, but guns don't seem to get stronger. A headshot normaly kills most enemies so it dosnt realy matter. The game is awsome.+ The parkour is so good, the whole city is your playground.+ Zombles are grouped so you cant realy just go kill them (not in the beginning anyway) for they outnumber you rather fast. + To me the game got the most awsome level system ever.+ If you kill a zomble another zomble can stand ontop of the first. I managed to make a pile of dead that got halfway up the truck I stood on.+ Graphics is awsome. + Theres many interesting types of zombles.+ Night time. Fun time.+ Many missions.+ Story isn't the best but it's good enoth. + The game is just sooo good!!!Not many bad things realy. - A few rare bugs. like flying.- In safesone. A girl sits 30 cm abow/outside of the sofa. Some of the npc hold items outside of hands. This is more or less only in safesones as far as I have noticed and isnt realy a big deal.- Getting up form water keeps your eyes unfocused for way to long.- Some places look like you can grab into but you cant. 40 deaths thank you.\sure theres a few more minor things but I cant even remember them spesific. xDIs it worth it? YEA! 10/10   100/100  I love this game so much!			"

A must have for all zombie/survival fans out there.Already played Dead Island ? Liked it ? Well Dead island was like the pre-alpha of this game.You can move all around Parkour-Style and drop-kick zombies 'till they get stuck into walls !Craft and loot mechanics are very similar to Dead Island. Your weapons have limited lifetime, you can't repair them more than a defined number of times but it's not as limiting as it sounds. You can craft and find a lot of weapons so you'll find yourself selling/dismantling more weapon in an hour than you'll break in a day.Co-op is just what this game was made for : watch your friends die slowly when they fail a jump in a mass of zombies or die at night while your ""friends"" are running away laughing cause you missed a door ! Techland also made interesting day/night mechanics, hunt the day, cry hide during the night. But for the bravest ones, fighting at night brings you double experience ! More details in game ;p.Give it a shot, Dying Light won't deceive you.			"

												If you are looking for a good story, or at least one that isn't inexcusably cliché at every single opportunity, as well as solid/likeable characters- look elsewhere. With that said, what Dying Light lacks in story and exciting quests, it makes up for with its absolutely brilliant co-op parkour fun. There is much fun to be had when running around and exploring this city with your friends, especially once you begin to level up different skills and obtain stronger weapons to help you mow through the large zombie counts.The graphics were a little muddy, but that was easily forgettable after an hour or two of gameplay. Additionally, the damage you deal to zombies was exquisite- giving you proper visual feedback of the damage that you are dealing versus obviously predetermined death animations.All things considered- this game has many high and many low points. If you liked Dead Island's gameplay, you will love this game as it is a logical upgrade to the development team's previous work. I would recommend Dying Light if you have a group of friends to play with, but I would hesitate to recommend it if you are just playing on playing the game solo.7/10			"

												My review is more for people who are not sure how it will run. I've used msi afterburner to monitor how much RAM and video memory is used.First my setup.i5 4670k OC 4.5GHzEVGA GTX 760 4GB overclocked8GB DDR3 RAMWindows 7 64. I'm running this game at 1920x1080p. with all settings maxed OTHER then AA which is off and FOV is about 35-40% everything is turned on and set to high/very high for shadows. Running at 45-60FPS. The game uses 3.2GB of Video memory and 6GB of RAM from what I have monitored. So there 2GB recommended is pretty much a lie. Now as for the game it's very fun. Just think of Dead Island meets mirror's egde. At night is really not all that scary and you can very easily just run pass all the crazy zombies that come out. Literally the have a field of view indicated on your map so you can just run pass them all so long as you stay out of the fov lol. I have yet to beat the game or put any real time in so I cant review the game that much. I just wanted to get how the game runs and what it really uses for specs.			"

												No, I have not played this game for long and frankly this is the only game that you can not compare it to, no Dead island and mirrors edge did not have a baby. Those are the babies, This game runs nice for a new release some optimization could be made I think but this runs very solid and I love the graphics. The only negative thing about this game is the cut scenes, I would love to do something in those but otherwise I love this game drop some money on it and enjoy smashing some heads in with whatever weapon you wan't or just be a complete cool kid and curb stomp them.

												     What's interesting about this game is the story and how it evolves throughout the game. It takes place in a fictional city called Harran. Landmarks and people of the city are simply astonishing. Considering the place, it is away from zombie stereotypes, a zombie apocalypse in middle east is a clever and unique idea in my opinion. I was gonna say they could've done the story better but after the Following dlc there was nothing to say. Beautifully connected and the next story was much more interesting and mysterious. I loved how religion placed into the story. I played for the story and probably stayed for the music, it put me into the game and left me suffer. I also loved how the music reflects their environment it was so correct and well done.     Game functions are easy to understand and skill trees are simple and well organized. Weapon crafting is quite fun and creative since using a gun is not a good idea in an environment like this. Co-op is really nice and fun when you have no balls to go out during night. You can continue from your story or your friend's story without any confusion.			"

												My expectations were fairly high going in to this game - and I was not disappointed.I had watched a couple of streams of people playing this game with their friends, and thought that it looked like a lot of fun, so I finally managed to talk my friend (who does not like zombie games) into playing it with me. And we definitely had fun.The story revolves around you, an agent/soldier type guy who is sent into a city which has been sealed off as a result of a zombie outbreak, in order to find some important research documents. While on this mission you meet some nice (and some not so nice) people, as well as learn some new things about the people you are working for.The story is maybe nothing too original, but the gameplay is where this game really shines, and I'll try to mention all the (in my opinion) most important things.- The weapons. You can fight your way through zombies using a wide range of weapons, from swords, daggers, clubs, guns, rifles, bows,  fists... You name it. Weapons can be found, crafted or bought, upgraded, sold... However, all weapons will eventually break.- The enemies. There are plenty of enemies, from the regular slow zombies to fast zombies, exploding zombies, huge, charging zombies - and the worst ones of them all, the ""night zombies"". The difference between night and day in this game is, well, like night and day. During the day you might feel safe, but during the night? Be sure to keep a bunch of flares on you and do not stop running.- The Grappling Hook. Once you get this item, the game changes completely. You are no longer limited to running and juming. You can zip around all over town, escaping zombies or reaching the roof of tall buildings much more easily. You can also use it as a (not very efficient) weapon. I love this item.- The Following. This expansion was also a lot of fun. You get access to a car, and let me tell you, driving around mowing down zombies is way more fun than it should be. Honestly, who needs a sword or a gun when you have a car? One thing that I missed when playing The Following was the ability to zip from building to building, as there are not that many buildings out there on the countryside where the expansion takes place. But then again, who needs buildings when you have a car.- The other DLCs. I enjoyed the parkour challenge DLC, however I didn't really enjoy the Bozak Horde survival challenge DLC. But these DLCs are not really mandatory, and you can choose to skip them all together if you don't want to do them (and don't care about achievements).I played this game with my friend from start to finish, and I really recommend playing it coop with someone, either a friend or just someone online. However it is completely possible to finish the game alone, so even people who prefer single player should definitely give the game a shot. Just be careful, especially during nighttime, as you won't have anyone to watch your back.Highly recommended!			"

In my opinioon it is one of the best games i have ever played. Ya some games are fun like csgo or gmod but this game is fun and its not rage inducing like csgo. I would rate this game 9.9/10 only because the other 0.1 is the fact that i can;'t get on any play as the zombie servers. But i believe that will eb fixed asap. Get this game if you have the money. Its worth it in my opinion.			"

												This is what Dead Island should have been, an amazing openworld zombie kill fest, with great movement mechanics and a good story and lead character. Definitly worth its price.This is a true AAA game, and it launched like a AAA game should, very few bugs and problems (the main one is the problem with AMD hardware, but they are working on it), and not a lick of network problems.I tip my hat to Techland, they made a amazing game.

												One of the stupid zombies fell off of a really high building and on to a car... The cars alarm went off as 40 more zombies came out of no where. These are the moments you expierence in Dying Light.Pros--Great Graphics-That combat -That dropkick-That stupid zombie that looks like a football player on steroids that took steroids that then took steroids Cons--Poorly optimized, I get anywhere from 70 to 22 frames within seconds of each other-While the villan (Rais) is neat, he's extremely cliche-The story too, is very clicheThis isnt a con, just something I wanted to bring up. The beginning of the game is extremely hard, zombies seem like they'll never die and your only choice is to run :/This is one of the best open world games I've ever played, Mirrors Edge meets a much more gritty and polished version of Dead Island!

												I played a lot in Co-op but I can talk for the main story.The Main Character: You could literally replace him with a jar of mayonnaise with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ face and stubble drawn in with a permenant marker and there would literally be no difference except it would probably be creepy if the mayonnaise talked.The Story: Was pretty good, actually. I came in thinking that this was going to be Dead Island. I wasn't keeping my hopes high. Plesantly surprised honestly. The Zombies: Oh boy I am so happy that they kept in the style of zombies from Dead Island though. I loved that the freshly infected were quick and nasty, the ones that had been rotting for weeks out in the heat were slow and dumb. Your specials are back and they bought their mean nasty friend and the kid that they were babysitting. Screamers are fun when you glitch out and can smack them with a sword.NPC Impact: Most of the non main NPCs are bland but Gazi is love, Gazi is life.Overall, if you like zombies, kicking zombies, punching zombies or parkour you should get this game. It's a heap of fun ith friends too.			"

												This game is basically what Dead Island should have been. The game offers a beautiful large open world which is a joy to roam around, especially compared to other games of the same genre. The Mirror's edge like parkour movement works really well in this game. The game can be quite difficult from time to time, especially at night when zombies are more powerful, however when you succeed it makes it all the more rewarding. A major downside to this game is the story. It is uninmerserve and the characters are far from intresting to say the least. The quests mostly consist of fetching stuff for people & ""go here and kill people or zombies''. On top off that; the ending of the story is one of the worst I've ever played. However in my opinion the gameplay makes up for the boring story and quests.			"

												Best game I have ever played, even when i'm into other games Dying Light will still be my TOP GAME. The feel of the game makes you feel like your apart of the story like your acualy Kyle Crane (Main character). No other way to put this game into words other than saying. Get it!			"

												Disclaimer: i'm a sucker for zombie games so i might be biased in the review for this game since i just love games which include zombies and they instantly gain at least +1 point in grading.There are plenty of zombie games on the market and thematic is rather washed out, but for me the game is pure fun. If one played Dead Island than this is similar to what one can expect from the game, but with much improved weapons, handling, physics and fine-tuned elements.Some people and reviews complain about the story. I don't want to spoil it, but for me the story is far from bad one. It isn't great as in Mass Effect, but this game has a completely different concept one should take in account. The story is good and IMO decent enough to keep you going. Plus, the side quests add to diversity of the game and give you extra reason to further explore the city.The game is rather well balanced and it will go easy on you at start and become increasingly difficult as you progress through the game. Also, skill tree (BTW, there are three different skill trees), weapons and environment options really add up to the diversity of gameplay and playing style.Technically the game is decently optimized for PC. Yes, there were some problems with some GPU's and CPU's (mostly AMD) but most of the issues have been fixed and they're actively working on fixing the rest.From audio point of view if one has a decent headset or surround sound system audio really adds to the immersion in the zombie infected city. Screams in the background and soft music adds to the great game atmosphere. Combine that with well-designed environment (good graphics) and day-night cycle which cycles between rather dull and slow zombies to aggressive ones which are supported by extra powerful zombies which appear only during the night, and you get a great zombie game.Some reviews point out that the missions are repetitive and most of them are based on the same concept which is go-to-location-X-and-fetch-object-Y. While i agree that missions are mostly of that type, they have enough variety to keep player interested for the game and further explore the game. Secondly, just think of it for a second. If one would really find him/her-self in a zombie infected city there would be rather high demand for brave people who would risk their lives to get necessary supplies from dangerous locations infected with zombies. For me this makes 100% sense. And third, if one pays close attention to detail one can hear irritation in Kyle's (main protagonist aka YOU) voice when he needs to do a go-and-fetch mission again.All i have written so far is for single player and on top of that the game offers a nice CO-OP mode which one can play with his/her friends or random players. Plus, there is a multiplayer addition to the game too which is a mixture of Left 4 Dead and Evolve game. In the multiplayer one can choose to be one of the four survivors or be super powerful zombie. CO-OP and multiplayer are highly dependent on people one plays with, as any other multiplayer experience. If one is playing with friends or good players fun is guaranteed and if you play with trolls or bad players who don't respect CO-OP/MP one will have bad time and a free test of his/her tolerance.The game has some amazing extra value which comes in form of weapon dockets (ie. gold keys if you played Borderlands) which will give player top tier weapons when reclaimed in the game (1 docket = 1 weapon). And the game has a companion app for Android and iOS where one can play Dying Light in a form of Facebook Mafia Wars where one sends scouts on missions. Great thing is that loot from the missions can be transferred to the original game one is playing on the PC or console!To sum things up, i would highly recommend the game to any player and it would be a must to those who love zombie games. To be completely hones, i haven't played such a great zombie game for quite a while. For those looking for numbers, here is my game review roundup:Video: 9/10Audio: 8/10Gameplay: 9/10Fun factor: 10/10Extra value: 8/10At the end, one is killing zombies in many creative ways, and if you don't have fun with it and all you have is frustration from the game - you must be doing something wrong.

 Быстрые ноги зубов не боятсяКратко эту игру можно описать как Dead Island 2. И неудивительно - разработчиком является польская студия Techland, разработавшая в своё время DI. Сходство заметно невооружённым взглядом - живописная расчленёнка, хрупоксть нашего героя (явно имеющего в качестве наставника на базе МакГайвера), симпатичные пейзажи... и вусмерть клишированная история. Нет, я не из тех снобов, которые извергают ядовитую желчь от каждого уже увиденного художественного приёма или сюжетного хода. Просто всё происходящее в основном сюжете мы видели неоднократно. Ну пожалуй за исключением того, что зомби-апокалипсис локален в следствие действий правительства, а не в силу географической привязки/раннего планирования злых корпораций/самого начала бедствия/чего-либо ещё. В  турецкий вымышленный город Харран после внезапной вспышки зомби-вируса, произошедшей как раз перед  Олимпийскими Всемирным Атлетическими Играми где-то в 2014 году по заданию GRE высылают нашего героя - оперативника Кайла Крэйна с заданием найти Кадира Сулеймана, лица, ответственного за обеспечение порядка в городе и изъять у него документы, в которых содержится неполная информация по изготовлению лекарства. Но всё, как известно, идёт наперекосяк с самого начала - герой получает по зубам от каких-то бандитов, а после ещё и обзаводится укусом от зомби. Больше он не Кайл, а теперь он новоиспечённый бегун под номером 31, вынужденный жить от одной порции  Зомбрекса Антизина до другой. Но задание у него остаётся прежним. Сюжет, как я уже отметил выше, не слишком оригинален и не настолько хорошо подан, чтобы на это нельзя было обратить внимание. Но побочные задания на ура вытягивают положение. Тут тебе и поиск мелков и кубиков для детей, тут и убийство некоего тролля, шатающегося по стоянке, и диалоги с человеком, чья мама и мухи не обидит, и доставка алкоголя для дезинфекции при родах и раскрытие заговора рептилиоидов. Боёвка достаточно проста, но ближе к концу игры становится совсем незамысловатой. У врагов здоровье фиксировано, и если поначалу приходится достаточно долго махать гаечным ключом, чтобы зомби наконец-то успокоился (а связываться с тремя-четыремя сразу вообще противопоказано). то уже со второй трети игры оружие становится достаточно мощным, чтобы прорубаться через толпы. Если бы не верная подбородочная нога на пружинке - поначалу было бы ещё хуже. А рукопашные схватки с живыми людьми усложняются ещё больше - увороты и блокирование ударов здесь правило со стороны оппонентов. Так что как и в Dead Island, огнестрел против живых намного эффективнее. Впрочем, меткие выстрелы по головам теперь косят всех рядовых противников. А оружие ближнего боя легко можно улучшить чтобы оно зажигало, било током, травило...Крафт привычный. Разве что теперь не надо искать верстаки - герой сам на коленке скрутит всё, были бы чертежи и нужные припасы. Бесплатно. Для любого холодного оружия. Огнестрельное не модифицируется. Даже сам Кайл при заявлении о том, что ""тут у нас есть оружейник, он из любой пукалки гаубицу сделает"" отвечает ""лучше бы глушитель мог прикрутить"". Ремонт тоже быстрый и надёжный. Разве что каждое оружие можно починить лишь конечное количество раз, после чего оно годится лишь в утиль. Звуковое сопровождение... Не оставило особых эмоций. Что музыка, что реплики и т.д. - не слишком запоминается и без очередного техно-трека в какой-то момент вполне можно обойтись. Графика симпатичная. Каких-либо артефактов, огрехов анимации и других проблем не замечал. Порадовало внимание к деталям. Вроде металлических скреп на чиненном-перечиненном топорике или красных глаз у заплаканных девушек. Паркур? Да, ещё одна ""основная фишка"" игры. Кайл легко скачет по зданиям, прыгает по головам зомби, скользит по зиплайнам, карабкается по стенам, падает (без последствий, если на мусор/машины и с - если на асфальт). Управление лёгкое и если что-то не получается - либо цепляться не за что, либо у вас некоторые проблемы с реакцией. О сетевых режимах, дополнениях и локализации сказать ничего не могу, увы. Не пробовал и после прохождения как-то не тянет. Итог? Всё же рекомендую. История, пусть и избитая, не самая плохая, ночные вылазки подкупают опасностью, жестокие стычки за поставки гуманитарной помощи приедаются далеко не сразу... да и пасхалок со спрятанными уникальными вещами не так мало.

												Dying Light presents a great example of the zombie genre’s coming of age. Serious, impactful and brutal, but still suffering from a few lingering issues that seem to plague the entire concept of the undead in interactive entertainment. Poorly directed narrative with little motivation beyond getting from point A to B, a lot of stereotypical NPCs, and a traditionally out-dated damsel-in-distress plot-point are among the most glaring of pitfalls the game suffers, but taken as a whole package, it stands high above most other zombie games and declares, “I am different. I am fun. I am Dying Light!”. And you know what? It is different. With it’s speed orientated focus on survival and it’s visceral and punishing combat, it differentiates itself from even it’s closest kin, the Dead Island franchise, which frankly feels like a proof of concept for Dying Light by comparison. It is fun. With a great level of challenge, a huge array of weaponry and moves, more Easter eggs than the upcoming Christian holiday, and loads of pop culture references, it is fun. And, well, it is Dying Light. Need I say more? 8.9/10For full review, read my article over at http://shoddypixels.com/dying-light-review/ "

												İşte Dead Island ve Dead Island: Riptide başından beri böyle olmalıydı. Dying Light, yüksek tempolu ve kendini daha az tekrar eden oynanışıyla ikisini de gölgede bırakıyor. This is what Dead Island and Dead Island: Riptide should have been from the beginning. With its fast-paced and less repetitive gameplay, Dying Light surely outshines both of them.			"

												The game was fun to play with a group of friends for a full party, and it's still fun solo. It gradually turns from a fight for survival to a moshpit of facing a crowd of zombies, and it's enjoyable along the journey. However, the storytelling started plunging near the end in both the original plot and The Following. I wasn't as satisfied with the endings as I was with the developing story. The endgame is also repetitive with legend ranks. I wouldn't replay it because I've gotten all that I can from the game, but I do believe that playing the game while it was fresh was totally worth it.			"

												AMAZING combat, AMAZING movement and AMAZING everything. I have racked up a good 30+ hours all alone and there are still things to do. It's a mix between Farcry 3/4 and Dead Island as you can explore the map and clear out ""safe zones"" and the combat feels just like Dead Island's with the satisfying crunches as you hit the Zombies.The DLC ""The Following"" is basically an extended campaign but adds in many awesome things such as the Buggy, weapons and more quests. The map for the DLC is also amazing as it takes place in a much different area than the base game, it has mountains, waterfalls and even a racetrack for the Buggy.One of the first games that I could play by my self without getting bored, definetely worth the money.

												I’m torn on this one.The store page promises “parkour-fueled zombie survival” and it does deliver in that regard. You will forage for knick knacks to craft weapons while running along rooftops chased by zombies. Besides Romero style shambling hordes there are fast zombies and various super special zombies like ones that try to suicide bomb you or spit toxic goop at you. We’ve seen most of these before in Dead Island (and other games) but Dying Light has added some really nasty specimens that only come out when the sun goes down.The thing that really sets Dying Light apart from Dead Island is the focus on parkour. They did a really good job with this. It’s easy to run around the world, leaping from roof top to roof top and climbing every building, bus, and pole in the game. Unfortunately, I don’t care for jumping puzzles in my first person shooters and this is a huge aspect of Dying Light. Expect to fall to your death a lot because you weren’t being precise enough.Another problem that I have with the game is that its environments are a little less diverse than Dead Island’s mix of sea side luxury resort, sewers, and slums. There are some different districts in Harran but the main game is pretty much entirely set in one big urban environment and its sewers (which we spend too much time in).That being said I enjoyed it enough to sit through all the first person platforming and sewer sections, so I’m going to recommend it.

												It's a typical Technland product, that's for sure, but it was also to be expected that there will be issues (performance optimizations).So far however that is my only negative aspect. I already liked the Dead Islands and Dying light improves every aspect (controlls, story, characters, gameplay, overall size). It's by far not perfect, but in my opinion the best zombie game right now. Not too arcady and not too much realism simulator either.Also, the combination of Dead Island and Mirrors Edge feels like a natural fusion and pretty much all I wished for. It always hurts in fps games, that even small obstacles stop you movement and the constant feeling ""in real live getting up there wouldn't be an issue at all. (There are still places and borders you can't go around, but those are at a minimum and don't affect the gamplay too much)There are a lot of people that have an issue with decaying weapons, but honestly, there are more than enough lying around, and you can repair your weapons and with skills you can delay the decay.

												Dying Light is the kind of game that makes you observe your surroundings and ask ""I wonder if I can..."" and the answer is almost always yes. This is a game that puts fun before anything else, sometimes to a fault. Craft creative weapons, leap from rooftop to rooftop, engages with zombies or simply flee while triggering traps and throwing distractions. The amount of fun and hilarity is multiplied significantly if playing with 1 or more co-op partners. The story might not blow you away, but the creative sense of exploration and discovery should leave a smile on the face of those willing to toss out expectations and just ""go with it"". You can tell the developers had fun with this one.			"

												Dying Light presents a great example of the zombie genre’s coming of age. Serious, impactful and brutal, but still suffering from a few lingering issues that seem to plague the entire concept of the undead in interactive entertainment. Poorly directed narrative with little motivation beyond getting from point A to B, a lot of stereotypical NPCs, and a traditionally out-dated damsel-in-distress plot-point are among the most glaring of pitfalls the game suffers, but taken as a whole package, it stands high above most other zombie games and declares, “I am different. I am fun. I am Dying Light!”. And you know what? It is different. With it’s speed orientated focus on survival and it’s visceral and punishing combat, it differentiates itself from even it’s closest kin, the Dead Island franchise, which frankly feels like a proof of concept for Dying Light by comparison. It is fun. With a great level of challenge, a huge array of weaponry and moves, more Easter eggs than the upcoming Christian holiday, and loads of pop culture references, it is fun. And, well, it is Dying Light. Need I say more? 8.9/10For full review, read my article over at http://shoddypixels.com/dying-light-review/ "

												It may be squalid and zombie-infested, but Dying Light's city of Harran isn't a depressing wasteland – it's a vibrant, ambitious, open-world playground. Here, buildings are for climbing, the undead are there to be destroyed in creative ways, and there's always something interesting to be discovered nearby. It takes a while for that to become clear, though; at first, you might even think Dying Light is really about running scared from mobs of seemingly unconquerable zombies, who can quickly drain your stamina and wear out your improvised weapons. Don't be fooled.			"

												Both the maps are incredibly dense with interesting geography and architecture - every square inch of the world is worth having in the game, there are no barren wastelands or boring buildings that serve as nothing more than obstacles, but at the same time the maps are large enough that you would wish there were vehicles if not for zee jumping and zee leaping and zee climbing mamma miaSome of the textures are sloppy but the way it looks in motion is A+.Because modern technology allows such brutal, graphic combat and incredibly seamless parkour, it shows that no matter how good the games of the past were, this game is just as fun purely out of how well the features have been implemented, even if it's not quite as compelling as Bioshock or sucking you into another dimension like Oblivion. 9/10 my goty			"

												Before I get in to my thoughts on the game, allow me to tell a story of something that happened to me about a year ago. So I'd recently moved states (a year ago) and we got here when there was a ridiculous amount of snow on the ground. Now, being from Florida, you'd expect me to freak out and panic and scream about how badly I want to kill myself because my hands are cold or something but you'd be wrong. I hated the heat. ♥♥♥♥ the heat. at least in the cold you can just put more clothes on. In the heat? you can only take so much off before the cops bring out the black censor bars (for those of you that don't know, you are 100% allowed to get fully naked in florida because of the heat, but the cops have to be called so they can bring out black censor bars to stick to your body. I know it sounds weird but it was a good thing. It was still too hot though. and you can't just take off your ♥♥♥♥ing skin when you're too hot. Florida ♥♥♥♥ing SUCKED. you were either near the beach, or in a ♥♥♥♥ing swamp. The more north you went, the more ""southern"" the people got. It was a nightmare). But that's not what I wanted to talk about. long story short: I enjoy the cold and the snow even though I was born and raised in florida and even if yawning outside makes my nose burn like hell for 20+ seconds. SO back to what I had actually wanted to say... The house I live in is literally RIGHT across the street from some.. woods. forest? I don't know the ♥♥♥♥ing difference. the point is I can walk right across the street and instantly be surrrounded by a lot of trees. In those woods forest♥♥♥♥♥♥place there lives animals I have NEVER Seen in my life (in person). they would be ""Deer"". Now, sure, we HAD deer in florida... but have I ever seen one there? No. As far as I know, they didn't exist there. you NEVER saw deer there. You were more likely to see alligators than deer (and that is not an exaggeration). So when we got here, I saw deer for the first time and they are ♥♥♥♥ing COOL. I remember my first time seeing them here was at like around 2am when I finally decided to get to bed (yes I have a terrible sleep schedule. I always stay up until at least 2am. I'm slowly dying as a result but I refuse to change), I looked out my window and BAM. there were TWO deer outside. It was the best moment of my life (at that point). And it's funny becuase I thought seeing TWO deer at once was lucky and a lot of them to see at once, but the other night I saw 8 outside my window. EIGHT! Man, back in florida I was missing out. Never going back there. ♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ state			"

												Well, Just finished this game and theres some good and some bad about it.I played on all high settings and the game looked fantastic and played very smoothly.The Good:-Parkour mechanic is good and works well.- Some pretty well developed characters.- A story you can really get into.- Some fun weapons.- Some good combat techniques.- Early game is very immersive and makes you want to keep playing.- The game is optimized quite well.The Meh:- Voice acting feels forced.- Theres like 5 guns, the pistols are pretty much the same anyway.- Last 15% of the game just drags.- The night part of the game is okay but is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥and was underused.The Bad:- The ending is♥♥♥♥♥♥br>- The ending is a quicktime event- The ending is predictable- The ending is like Modern Warfare 2 - The price, only buy if its on sale.Overall, I really did enjoy this game but the ending really lets it down. its a well made game that is pretty well optimized and can be very immersive in the first half. Honestly, the second half of the game feels like its been made by different people as its very different from the first half. the last part of the game drags out and honestly can get a little boring. I would rate this game 8/10.Thank you for taking the time to read my review.			"

												Well, finished Dying Light, not going to play it again ever. Was sorta good while it lasted.Don't bother conserving weaponry, just use whatever you can find and whatever upgrades you have at the moment. By the time your weapon breaks, if it's a decent one, you'll either have found a stronger one earlier on or be easily able to buy whatever store weapon is the strongest at that time. The economy is completely broken and pretty much meaningless. Likewise you'll never run out of medkits: make them whenever you have materials, buy two every time you open the shop since they're dirt cheap, take whatever you find in airdrops. After the first 5% of the game, you'll never run out.Parkour is super fun. It's the heart of game. Be warned there are some annoying ledges-and-edges-that-turn-out-to-be-ungrabbable here and there. If it's a rock cliff, fugadaboudit. If you think 40 hours of parkour plus some simple zombie combat (the best tactic is still swing at heads with a bit of dodging, the special moves leave you vulnerable) is worth the price, get this game. I frankly got this due to not having much else to play. You may want to wait till a deal brings it to the 20 dollar mark.Don't really see how Be The Zombie can be fun. Basically you're a troll who gets killed a lot. No ladder etc.Characters are not very interesting. Your charater's voice acting is pretty decent and get entertaingly snarky here and there. Bad guy is like FC3 Vaas diluted to one part per ten parts water. Plot may not make much sense due to railroaded feelings that have nothing to do with the gamer's experience, eg massive grief over characters you literally spoke to about four times.Ending was a horrible QTE, not to mention the carbon copy of COD's famed <spoilers ahead> pull knife out of your body to stab super evil bad guy. I had no technical issues whatsoever. Of course I'm using a i3 and R9 290, so if your processor is AMD or your graphics card is less powerful, it might get tricky.			"

												This game is fun. Very fun.I'll confess, I don't know what it's like to play by yourself (apart from the first mission/tutorial mission) as I've played the game so far with my boyfriend. The co-op is very easy and works really well (unlike some coop in games like Dead Rising 3). It might take a little bit to get used to the controls/free running but once you do, the game seems pretty fluid. The missions seem fun and you get involved in the story, I even got angry at the playable character when he did something pretty scumbaggy on orders. But anyway, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves zombie games. It's not as hilarious as Dead Rising 3 and not as horrifyingly scary (imo) as Dead Island games, but it's probably the most fluid one out there and if you want scary/tough, there's always the nighttime.

												This game is awesome. The free running is done really well, the fighting is great, and the skills you learn as you level up are pretty useful. Vault over zombies! Slide under zombies! Fire your grappling hook at a wall and pull yourself through zombies! Slice, stab, kick, burn, electrocute, poison, ram, and smash zombies like you never smashed them before!That being said, it's really -- a much less buggy Dead Island/Mirrors Edge/Farcry 3(4?) rolled into one!Night time brings the real zasty ones that you can't really outrun or fight in a safe manner, so it's more of a stealth game at night...or run like you got caught sleeping with the police chiefs wife!

												Preface: I liked mirrors edge and I have played a lot of shooters/melee games. I did not  like dead island but did like it's option to throw melee weapons and modify them.Now that that I have declared the things which may lead me to have some bias we can get on with it. The game has a reasonably good storyline albeit somewhat predictable at times. The reason for you being in the situation makes sense, the interavtion with other characters makes sense. If I were to criticise any character ni the ggame it would be the main character for not developing much of a personality until about 60-70% of the way into the story. You may have heard that it relis upon a damsel in destress storyline, this is NOT the case with the ""damsel"" saving your life at least twice during the course of the game.The combat is good and relatively fluid. you can equip 4 melee weapons at a time and 4 utilities ranging from a UV torch to electricuted riot shields. The stamina systems keep the game challenging and the different ""special infected"" range from irritating to down right deadly and maintain that position until relatively late into the game.The weapon crafting is reasonable extensible with the ability to add effects such as fire or impact to weapons as well as modifications which add to damage, handling or durability to varying degrees.The exp rewards are reasonable and the skills you can unlock are helpful with only one of them, the grappling hook, really detracting to the difficulty of the game bar the ultimate upgrade from each tree, which essentially give you infinite stamina for their associated ability e.g. agility gemoves running and climbing stamina costs.The different skill trees do add a lot of different playstyles to your arsenal and I will say it again none of the upgrades feel boken.There is a reasonable amount of humour in the game including one of my favourite insults I have heard in years from ""the twins"" who are a pair of intelligent yet condescending brothers with an inability to relate to other people.The co-op is a good laugh and saves any progress you make to your campaign evein if you are not the host.Overall I would recommend this game a lot. It may not be original but it has taken the best parts of a lot of games with only a few issues that I have noticed.			"

												Well, finished Dying Light, not going to play it again ever. Was sorta good while it lasted.Don't bother conserving weaponry, just use whatever you can find and whatever upgrades you have at the moment. By the time your weapon breaks, if it's a decent one, you'll either have found a stronger one earlier on or be easily able to buy whatever store weapon is the strongest at that time. The economy is completely broken and pretty much meaningless. Likewise you'll never run out of medkits: make them whenever you have materials, buy two every time you open the shop since they're dirt cheap, take whatever you find in airdrops. After the first 5% of the game, you'll never run out.Parkour is super fun. It's the heart of game. Be warned there are some annoying ledges-and-edges-that-turn-out-to-be-ungrabbable here and there.

												Dying Light is an open world first person zombie action game from the developers of Dead Island. I was very disappointed by Dead Island, so I almost didn't bother playing Dying Light at all, but I took a chance and it turns out that Dying Light is ... okay. Not great, but not terrible either. It has some problems but I had some fun with it and its certainly better than Dead Island.GameplayThe combat is primarily focused on melee. There are some guns (pistol, rifle, shotgun) but ammo is rare and the noise just attracts more zombies, so I only used guns on story missions against Human bandits. You can also find and craft throwable weapons such as knives, molotovs and grenades which are useful against large groups of zombies. But most of the time, you'll be using a variety of blades and blunt weapons to slice and bludgeon your way through the undead.At the start of the game, your character is very weak. The weapons do hardly any damage, it can take around ten hits to kill each zombie, and because every attack uses stamina, by the time you've killed one you're out of breath. Fighting multiple zombies together is basically impossible. So you have a tedious situation where you have to kill one, run away (combat stamina and movement stamina are different), wait for stamina to recharge, go back, kill another, repeat. You can easily avoid zombies by climbing on top of cars or buildings, but sooner or later you to have to fight, because you need the XP to get stronger.After a few hours, the combat does start to get more enjoyable. You'll unlock abilities to get more stamina and health. You'll find weapons that do alot more damage. You can unlock special moves, such as the ability to stomp on the head of a zombie lying on the ground for an instant kill. Eventually you're strong enough to kill zombies in one or two hits and you've got enough stamina to fight a horde of a dozen zombies with no problem. I tended to use alot of blades, so when I was chopping off zombie arms and heads I felt a bit like Michonne from the Walking Dead TV show.There are a few types of special zombies, although nothing we haven't seen before in other games, especially Left 4 Dead. There are spitters, exploders, chargers, and tanks. And then there are the ""volatiles"", who only attack at night and are really dangerous, so its best to just sneak past or run away from them. They're not too hard to kill individually, but it seems like if one sees you, every other volatile in the city is instantly alerted to your location so you end up getting swarmed. Fighting against Humans is the weakest part of combat. Especially after you've found a gun, their AI is so dumb that they provide no challenge to a veteran FPS gamer.StoryFor some reason the story never really excited me. Its kinda basic - the city of Harran has been quarantined because zombies happened and the player character, Kyle Crane, has been parachuted in to try and find research relating to a cure. There are a bunch of friendly civilians who need your help to survive and there's also a bandit leader who is evil because reasons. (It was something stupid like his brother died on the first day of the outbreak so he decided that everyone else should die as well). Most of the characters, including Crane, are lacking in personality. The voice actors did a decent job, but unfortunately the script writers just never gave them anything interesting to say.I guess I could have missed something, but if I did, its not my fault. This is one of those games that does the whole ""I know you're surrounded by enemies but now this NPC is going to give you plot details over a radio even though you're not paying attention because you're trying to not die"" thing. I prefer to have all the dialogue in a cutscene or at least a secure location, so that I can concentrate fully on what is being said.TechnicalGraphics are really nice, lots of detail in the buildings and environment, and performance is good. The recommended specs are quite demanding, and I'm right on the edge (I have an i7 2600K @ 3.4 Ghz, 8GB ram and a GTX 770 with 4GB vram) but I was able to maintain a mostly consistent 60 FPS without too much tweaking. I've turned off the useless stuff like motion blur, film grain and depth of field, I've got view distance turned down to around 1/4 of the bar (credit goes to Total Buscuit's port report video on Youtube for demonstrating the effect of that setting) and I've turned off Nvidia's special HBAO but left the normal version on. Everything else is on highest setting at 1920x1080. I've also forced Vsync through Nvidia control panel to eliminate screen tearing (the in game Vsync setting is useless).Sadly, there are lots of achievement bugs. Maybe not the most critical problem, but hey, I like unlocking achievements, especially after finishing a game's main story I can usually spend a few more hours achievement hunting. Most of the problems seem to be with achievements that require you to perform a certain action X number of times. I currently have seven different incomplete achievements where the counter seems to be stuck on 0 or 1, but I know I've done those actions loads of times. Meanwhile I've unlocked a coop achievement but I haven't even touched coop mode, and I unlocked two other achievements several hours before I actually performed their actions. Judging by the forums there are lots of other players experiencing similar bugs.RecommendationAs I said, despite my complaints, Dying Light is a decent game and I did have some fun with it. I think its worth playing, but I wouldn't class it as a high priority, especially if you have other games in your backlog that you're excited to play.			"

												Absolutely entrancing, at least to me.  I never really could get into the Assassin's Creed II mojo, mainly because I disliked having to be stealthy so often.  And then I never really revisted that series.  Dying Light takes the parkour type movement that I did really like from AC, makes it feel even a bit more fluid like Mirror's Edge (but you do have to level up some before you're that level of competent), and combines it with combat that makes you feel powerful.Don't get me wrong, the hordes of zombies can be terrifying when you are new, because they can absolutely overwhelm you.  But later on I'm flipping over their heads and slashing skulls in half with one blow, and setting guys on fire with my insane propane-spewing hatchet-thing, and just feeling in general like a badass....and then night comes.  That whole power thing with traversal during the day is absolutely flipped on its head at night, and it's way more tense and dangerous than AC.  And this time I actualy like it, because I feel the fear of the monsters, not the ineptitude of my character.  I've already established that I'm a badass during the day, so the fact that these monsters at night practically insta-kill me if I get seen makes them all the more terrifying....and then, as you level up and as you learn more and more, suddenly you start being more powerful at night, too.  Suddenly the nights aren't quite so terrifying, and you can survive for a while if you hold your ground, heart pounding, fighting for your life but winning against the odds and having a blast doing it.  What a rush.I have never seen first-person melee combat that felt this good, to be frank.  There are some guns, but those tend to call in larger zombies (as do any other loud noises), and I preferred using melee in general.  Even when I could use throwing knives or similar, I'd avoid that at all costs.  Band of human psychos out to kill me with guns?  No problem, I'll just go from cover to cover and kill everyone with my electrified sickle.I am not a violent person, but there's something deeply cathartic here to me. ;)  I get the sort of feeling that I used to play when playing Quake II way back in the day.  This is a whole lot better, though.I have not had any technical glitches or other issues.  As soon as they make any more content, or a sequel or whatever, I'll be buying it.  It's just plain fun.

My only real complaint is there isn't any real variation to how you level up your character. Nothing that will distinguish one playthrough from another. Other than that the melee is fun, gunplay is nothing special but gets the job done, the world and everything in it look fantastic and at least for the most part run fine.i5 2500k8gb ddr3 ramGTX 780Windows 7 64bit			"

												Dying Light: Basically Dead Island gone right as many of these reviews probably already say. I played through the whole game with a friend and I can say there wasn't a moment where I was getting bored of it, My friend and I mostly trying to avoid the main quests and mostly just screwing around/doing side quests had a blast and thought it was very unfortunate when there wren't a many side quests to do in the Old Town part, but the recent addition of Hard mode made it 10x more challenging and 10x more fun. We honestly could say we were getting bored of the game when we were able to one hit Goons, but with hard mode that was instantly fixed, even the normal zombies were made a challenge.The story focuses on Kyle Crane who is an agent sent in by the GRE to get files back from survivors who supposedly stole them, but to Crane's findings they actually were not the ones who stole them and so in turn he started helping them out, and thats pretty much how the introduction to the game starts. The story itself has a couple cliche moments but not enough to make the story predictable. There are a good amount of plot twists and parts that are honestly very sad when you realise what is happening.Overall I would rate it:8/10 Singleplayer10/10 MultiplayerSeriously, the addition of Co-op was probably the best thing this game has.My friend personally gives it:7/10 Singleplayer10/10 MultiplayerWe have gotten a full enjoyment of the game and I can say that all these hours I've spent in this game are well worth it.Thanks for reading.

												Price 35 dollars. Patch 1.5. Season pass installed. Single player only.Played in 1920x1080 on max settings. 100% complete all missions/side missions before review.Graphics 9/10 Beside some random slowdowns, gorgeous graphics.Sound 6/10 Great ambient sound. The infected sounds great. Voice acting horribleReplay value 3/10. A horrible story with paper-thin characters.Overall 8/10:I had a great time playing this game. No bugs beside some random slowdown. Did all missions/side missions in 4 gaming sessions /40 hours including the DLC missions.  Fun/Simple crafting system. Looting opportunists everywhere. A great climbing system ala Mirrors Edge. Different game play during day/night cycles. During day you can play Rambo, but during night stealth is a must.Some real annoying side mission/protection missions that re-spawned. Helping a guy sell stuff or another guy fishing during a zombie apocalypse does not seem likely. The game gets really easy when you learn how to camouflage from infected.  You can just run around and break every infected neck. There are however events during missions that will not trigger if you are camouflaged.The grabbing hook you can acquire during later parts of the game changes game play a lot. Suddenly you can just jump buildings and climb bridges with easy but during missions you are ""to fatigued"" to use the hook not to break game play.The game is not worth 60 dollars/50 euro full price. 30-40 is a fair value.The season pass is a bust. Dont get it. The extra missions are just more of the same.			"

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

This is a whole lot better, though.I have not had any technical glitches or other issues.  As soon as they make any more content, or a sequel or whatever, I'll be buying it.  It's just plain fun.

												If you like parkour, zombies or crazy weapons, this is the game for you. In the day you are a certified badass killing everything on sight and in night you are a hiding under your covers. True Story! Prepare for a lot of running and gunning and a lot more deaths by falling to death, because you missed that dam legde.			"

It's an amazing concept and it's nice to see it actually works. Free running and zombies, what more do you want?			"

												Just finished the game today. Really enjoyed it. It is pretty similar to Dead Island with the biggest difference being the vertical aspect of movement that Dead Island lacked. Parkour is a lot of fun and is similar to Mirror's Edge. The world is huge and open. Just about every building can be entered and explored. Loot is everywhere. Combat is fun. Crafting is fun. The quests are fun. Challenges are fun. Movement is fun. Almost everything about this game is simply fun.The storyline is really good as well and is lengthy. I logged 57 hours in the game and left out some of the stuff you can do although I feel confident that I covered almost all of it.I really only had 2 complaints. The first is that my frame rate would dip when one of the spitting special zombies would hit me in the face with spit. Possibly correctable with tweaked settings and/or improved hardware. The other is the ""water blur"" effect on the screen any time you get wet. It's super annoying and makes it nearly impossible to see anything for a good 5 seconds after you get out of the water.All in all I really enjoyed this game. It's fun just to run/parkour around the city. It almost becomes an art form after you get the hang of it. Well done, Techland!			"

												""Good night, good luck."" -- 10/10.To sum it up, Dying Light is what Dead Island should be.  The Dev got the right idea for the core game play: Parkour and salvaging.  It's almost perfect but still have a few areas that need polishing.  e.g. In Co-op, zoning should be done with a timeout (like Borderlands 2) instead of waiting for all players to synchronize.  The weapon depreciation concept is a bit dated (Diablo 1?).  The Dev should think about a better idea to have players to continue salvage and craft new equipment, and at the same time do not force them to abandon their previously crafted weapons using depreciation.The PvP zombie invasion is a nice touch borrowing from Dark Souls.  The story is alright though the QTE finale is probably not to everyone's taste.At last, this game has beautiful architecture!  To get the best out of it, run it in 4K with pre-patch drawing distance (8.26).Post v1.1.1 update.  Techland has finally added a Chromatic aberration toggle.  Review score has been upgraded to 10/10 as a result.  Good work Techland!			"

Have played a fair amount of this game as you can see. The DLC called ""The Following"" was an excellent addition to the game however it really only added another 7 missions but at least it was in a whole new area with driveable vehicles. All the DLC together has added about another 100+ hours to my gameplay just by trying to do all the side missions, etc.Recommend this game to any zombie-thriller / survival fans out there. However once you play for about 25 hours it might start seeming a little boring and after the campaigns are done basically it felt to me like there was no worth anymore.Goodnight.

Even if you're not, you can easily get 40hours on this one.Negative- Need a somewhat good system to run it (had a gtx690 at the time and it was fine)- Story is *Ok*- Found multiplayer to be quite dull sadly, lacked something, can't really pinpointSo, should you get this game ? YES8.5/10EDIT : After the ""The following"" expansion update, this game has become one of my favorite games officialy. So beautiful, smooth like butter and god the gameplay is fun as hell.

												Two thumbs up! Super fun time online action adventure with best parkour free running I've ever played.The melee combat is exactly what Fallout 3 was missing, but V.A.T.S cut scenes promised and Killing Floor sometimes almost felt like when I was 'in the flow' as they say.Invasion mode can be super annoying, unless you're in the mood for it, then its a good rush. Level up and stockpile flares, stay with your team. The ""press B"" and ""everyone needs to be there for the quest to continue"" brings things down sometimes when there's five quests givers and an elevator and a shop and a quartermaster and an exit to the outside map all in one location for instance and someone is afk in team of four. Chaos.I guess Rais is on to something and sometimes the only thing to do is chop the offending hand off. "

												Dying Light is a zombie game which isn't shy of upholding cliches but does so in a fun and innovative way. Comparing the game to Dead Island (: Riptide) the game has fixed a lot of the core flaws and completely rebooted the story in a new setting with new parkour mechanics. The game does this very well, you start up with a character which is fumbling around in the dark, has no idea what to do and your parkouring still has to evolve. The pacing is really good for the first few hours. However this turns into disaster real quick. If you start co-op and do a few side-quests, your leveling will lead you to overpowered skills much too fast, obliberating minibosses with a few hits while that shouldn't feel possible as it makes the kills majorly disappointing. It goes from bad to normal to holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I'm a biotic spiderman with guns parkour, which is fun for new players to the freerunning scene but doesn't feel as fun for the purist parkour-only Mirror's Edge players.The story, as-is, is a bit lackluster. It doesn't include backstory (just a bit in the side-quests) and you don't really feel as if you're involved in a greater world with a lot of things going on. The architecture and levels reflect this, have a lot of conflicting design choices. Of course, this is Techland and they did not think this through, no biggie, the gameplay makes up for it. Smashing zombies in and running around the place with the day-night mechanics makes for a very fun game where you just want to run around and explore every inch.Even though the scaling isn't brilliant and the story isn't up to par, the gameplay, gunplay, graphics are all awesome and fun. If you can see through the 00's zombie action movie cliches, love blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up with your fists and traps and you really like freedom of movement in a game, Dying Light is just for you.			"

												After finishing the game, figured I'd give a short review.The game definately has some downfalls, but it can also be very fun at times. If you're looking for a game that has a good story, this is NOT one of them. Pros:- Amazing zombie killing mechanics. Slo-mo head explosions, decapatations, amputations, and thousands of creative ways to murder a zombie.- Creative, different zombie types.- Awesome night time gameplay, truly terrifying.- Great difficulty scaling. Fighting a zombie horde is actually something you may need to avoid, as a situation can turn from a fun zombie killing spree to being eaten alive.- Fantastically fun to play online as a zombie, and even better to play the Co-op campaign.- Weapon crafting is creative, and adds a lot of substance. The ability to modify stats is an added bonus.- Side quests and the open world aspects presented after you have completed the game means you get about a hundred hours of gameplay, depending on how much you like murdering the undead.- Lots to do!Cons:- The game itself isn't optimized very efficiently. Some areas drop your FPS considerably, and in general, using hardware that normally allowed you to play AAA titles on high will only net you a Medium-High. (Tip- Turn down View Distance, it has little impact on gameplay since its mostly Melee). I assume this will be fixed by patches.- Storyline is bland and predictable, the game's attempt at creating an emotional attachment to characters laughably falls through, and you soon find yourself forgetting the names that reappear or are mentioned mid to late game. Most campaign missions put you through mazes, or a generally recycled premises. (Like how many times do you have to be stripped of your weapons? Every single major encounter.)- The parkour mechanics need some work, prepare to fall to your death a few times when your character grabs onto a beam, only to scale and jump over it (Not a good idea on high heights) or even fail to grab a ledge altogether. The grappling hook is pretty.. Interesting too.- The minimap is terrible. Using the indicator to find quest locations. safehouses, etc results in frustration. - There's really no use for money. You can accumulate great amounts, but the weapons sold by the shop tend to be worse than your current- or only 30 minutes away from finding it on a dead guy.In summary :Don't buy the game for it's storyline. It sucks. Other than that, if you just want something to play with your friends then it is a great choice. Or if you just like the good old zombie killing action. Most other issues, like poor optimization and weird parkour mechanics, can be fixed through patches.For what its worth, I'd rate it6.5/10			"

												To start off, the parkour is very well done.  Less restrictive and glitchy than Assassin's Creed.  -The gameplay is very similar to Dead Island, a little too similar.  You can see shared animations between the two games, which isn't necessarily a bad thing in this case.  -The shooter segments are pretty poorly done to be honest.  There aren't many guns, but they aren't very useful anyway.  Why are there different values and colors for guns that have identical stats and skins??? The animations are just as funky as Dead Island in terms of guns.  If there were suppressors, then maybe it would have a bit more depth.  -PLEASE OPTIMIZE YOUR GAME BEFORE RELEASE!!! I had to knock down the graphics to 720p and everything else on low just to get ~30-40 FPS.  This should not be happening on a GTX 760!! It's not the most powerful card, but it sure can handle a lot more than this game looks.  This is a PC!! 60 FPS is the minimum expectation on low settings with a reasonable rig! This isn't a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console!! *SPOILER ALERT*- The story is meh at best.  I'm not sure if there was supposed to be a little romance between Crane and Jade.  Some cutscenes are illogical and out of place.  Cut his hand off, but let him live to extend the story?  Insert a far cry 3/4 hallucination level which honestly doesn't make much sense.  I don't think everyone infected traveled through a floating wonder world before they ate someone. It is also SUPER predictable. I was not surprised at any point. I'm not sure if I was supposed to be either.-The voice acting is ok, could use a little more authenticity in their vocals.  Sometimes they don't show much emotion, as if they're reading someone else's script (that's pretty much what they do anyway).  Bioshock infinite is an example of voice acting done right.- Some of the crafting doesn't make much sense.  I need a box of metal parts to bend a paper clip to use as a lockpick??  At least the lockpicking is familiar to Skyrim or Fallout 3 players and not the least bit glitchy.  The blueprints and upgrades are pretty standard, but at least it works like it should. It's a shame you can't make zombies fly with your great hammer of thor like you could in Dead Island.-I think there is enough to recommend, just barely.  I wouldn't get addicted to it like I did with Skyrim.  -The missions are good with variety.-I love the night segment since that actually made my♥♥♥♥♥pucker up.-Why is there no manual saving option?  I understand the ""sleep here to save your game"", but I've BSOD'd twice and each time it happened I had already completed a few quests, which were not saved.  Why is there no save at the end of a quest???  Sure it could boost authenticity and immersion, but taking out that option just forces us to back track multiple times to make sure our progress was actually saved.  This is a major disappointment for me.  I don't like having to back track for something that should be in the menu. Overall, the story sort of ruined it for me.  There isn't much immersion especially when compared to games like Metro Last Light.  For me, I consider a game a good buy if I at least get 1 hour per dollar of enjoyable game time.  I'm on the second playthrough and I'm already forcing myself to play, trying to find something interesting and unique. Just over 20 hours played.  I'm getting the same feeling I got with Wolfenstein: The New Order, ""why did I pay $60 for this?""  I'm someone who prefers context.  Best example I can think of is: sex with a hooker < sex with a lover. Seriously, I felt unfufilled after I beat the game. It's fun otherwise.  5/10			"

												Waited just about 2 years for this game and end result? I am LOVING this game ^_^Pros:-> Parkour around the map-> Get to higher lvls to use grappling hook for extra mobility in parkour ;) (spiderman style) -> Skill tree builds are awesome when maxed out anything is possible at night :) -> Graphics are awesome at high resolution-> Dropkick, vault (jump from 1 zombie head), stomp (break zombie head by stompping it ^_^ ), break zombie legs - arms - body - head or stun them in general, ram the zombies-> Ram or Dropkick a zombie off of a building or a bridge :) -> good weapon mods to build and customize to a lot of damage, I got a short sword for 2.2k dmg - 84 dura - 134 handle - 5 repair. It has Fire 2 Lightning 2 artibutes and its fun to have ^_^-> Weapon needed is a short sword, machete then you see 1 zombie jump and slash? Now you get 2 zombie pieces :) from head down you split the zombie into 2-> Certain protect quests will give you a chance to restore the lost repairs on a weapon, like the short sword I mentioned above for example to have 2 repairs left and then you do this protect quest and at the end instead of just cash or a weapon it will offer you to restore it back to full durability and 5 repairs which is awesome. Middle:-> The story I will do some were around the middle which is not too bad but too good either since you probably can guess how it will end. If only it had a suprize plot twist ;) like if the player did a certain side quest it would change the result of the ending. Cons: -> There is a cave off of where lavender plants are, and that cave has some invisible rocks. So if you go in there you might get stuck if you don't have any flares on you then you are really stuck. -> (my experience) The Spitters, when they hit you with their poison it drops the frames down from up high to down low. Sometimes it's okay but sometimes its not when there is a bomber around the corner :( -> If only on Game+ (meaning game was finished 100% and restarted on same thing but higher difficulty) the night runners aka voltiles did more damage when resistance poition was used. Like the resistance poition had less effect so that the night would still be good ;) -> Maybe on Game+ (advanced mode) it would have hidden abilites unlocked other wise going through the same quests might get a bit boring if there is nothing to spend those exp on. My stats where maxed out around 45% of main story completion before the Game+ advanced higher difficulty mode thing. I have got over 30 of these air drop things and I cant use them since my survivor stats are maxed out... I could give them to friends but other than that just dropping them off to quartermaster serves no purpose much. If it had more stats so that I can spend exp on I would have given it a 10, or the story line part too to get that 10. Other than those my overall rating would be 9/10.			"

												Developed by Techland, yup that same company that made Dead Island games, is in my opinion one of the best zombie themed game I have ever played. The key differenced between dead island and dying light is very substantial. The element of parkour (Mirror's Edge style) through an open world, leaping over obstacles and standing up on ledges rooftops but in first person view (some what Assasin's Creed style) is an extraordinarily perfect fit for this game. Unlocking safe houses and cascading up radio towers to claim them (Far Cry 3/4 style), and collecting crafting items to craft melee weapons is very satisfying. There are a few variety of pistols and rifles that you can pick up and use, but the most staisfying part of the game is seeing the dismantling of body parts with the swing of a blunt, or sharp edged weapon. Also dropkicking zombies into oblivion is the best part of it all. The replayability is suprisingly very high, because there are multiple side quests you can play solo or coop you can take on, and you can play online with other people  as a human or a zombie player is  most definitely the juiciest part of the meat. 10/10			"

												The Dead Island sequel we've all been waiting for! Techland improved a lot of the mechanics. The parkour addition makes the world accessible vertically and feels great. Good game for completionists looking to get the most bang for their buck.PROS:-Dead Island with parkour-Excellent skill tree progression gives the game a nice RPG feel as you level up-Tons of content for completionists-Looks awesome in motion. Very nice looking overall.-Day/Night cycles. Night time really ups the tension with special infected and higher XP gains.-Sense of verticality is unparalleled. Was never affraid of heights in a game until Dying LightCONS:-Weapon crafting/variety was much better in Dead Island. Seems like Techland went backwards in this regard.-Only one protagonist, even in multiplayer! Dead Island handled multiplayer much better.-The final encounter is single player only! (This is not a spoiler, the game tells you before you approach it.)-No vehiclesNOTE: The game has nvidia-centric features. AMD users should do some research BEFORE buying.So in a nutshell, diehard DI fans should feel right at home. Just don't expect the same refined co-op experience. Also, the game rips off iconic ideas from mainstream games like Far Cry and Assassins Creed. Not a bad thing in my book, but some may consider this a con. Lastly, expect a very cliche and predictable story. Didn't add this as a con since DI games were never going to win an award for original story telling. It's all about the side quests!I enjoyed all 43 hours of my experience and can't wait to dive back in!			"

												The story was predictable, side quests were mediocre and the final boss was a Vaas wannabe that was simply awful (it was the worst QTE that I've seen in years).And yet I've loved it! It soaked me for 31 hours and I know I'll be returning to this game. Combat is satisfying, parkour in my opinion was even better than in Mirror's Edge and the atmosphere! The first 10 hours of the game were incredibly tense and the first night was simply terrifying!Pick it up, trust me. I don't like Dead Island, I'm not really interested in zombie games but this one was worth every penny.			"

												After finishing the game, figured I'd give a short review.The game definately has some downfalls, but it can also be very fun at times. If you're looking for a game that has a good story, this is NOT one of them. Pros:- Amazing zombie killing mechanics. Slo-mo head explosions, decapatations, amputations, and thousands of creative ways to murder a zombie.- Creative, different zombie types.- Awesome night time gameplay, truly terrifying.- Great difficulty scaling. Fighting a zombie horde is actually something you may need to avoid, as a situation can turn from a fun zombie killing spree to being eaten alive.- Fantastically fun to play online as a zombie, and even better to play the Co-op campaign.- Weapon crafting is creative, and adds a lot of substance. The ability to modify stats is an added bonus.- Side quests and the open world aspects presented after you have completed the game means you get about a hundred hours of gameplay, depending on how much you like murdering the undead.- Lots to do!Cons:- The game itself isn't optimized very efficiently. Some areas drop your FPS considerably, and in general, using hardware that normally allowed you to play AAA titles on high will only net you a Medium-High. (Tip- Turn down View Distance, it has little impact on gameplay since its mostly Melee). I assume this will be fixed by patches.- Storyline is bland and predictable, the game's attempt at creating an emotional attachment to characters laughably falls through, and you soon find yourself forgetting the names that reappear or are mentioned mid to late game. Most campaign missions put you through mazes, or a generally recycled premises. (Like how many times do you have to be stripped of your weapons? Every single major encounter.)- The parkour mechanics need some work, prepare to fall to your death a few times when your character grabs onto a beam, only to scale and jump over it (Not a good idea on high heights) or even fail to grab a ledge altogether. The grappling hook is pretty.. Interesting too.- The minimap is terrible. Using the indicator to find quest locations. safehouses, etc results in frustration. - There's really no use for money. You can accumulate great amounts, but the weapons sold by the shop tend to be worse than your current- or only 30 minutes away from finding it on a dead guy.In summary :Don't buy the game for it's storyline. It sucks. Other than that, if you just want something to play with your friends then it is a great choice. Or if you just like the good old zombie killing action. Most other issues, like poor optimization and weird parkour mechanics, can be fixed through patches.For what its worth, I'd rate it6.5/10			"

												To start this off with a twist when the game was first publicly under development and all the way up to launch I didn't think much of it, wasn't hyped, and even went so far as to think it to be ""just another zombie game"". Boy oh boy was I wrong. A friend convinced me to get this recently 3 months or so after launch by now and I did. As soon as I got into the game and started I was entranced by the parkour, the beautiful graphics, the smooth and well optimized 60 FPS, the great and powerful feeling impact of the combat, and the intense and very real danger of being too loud or trying to fight more than one zombie. Some may disagree with this next part so don't get offended. It's just my opinion. I personally love the story, and the voice acting, and the way my character reacts throughout. The game is so good it even managed to manifest a strong sense of hatred within me towards the main antagonist ""Rais"". (Which is rare in games these days.) Pros:- Incredible smooth and impactful combat system.- Great fluid parkour system.- Wonderful story and very well made antagonist. (King of Cliches)- Tons of Easter Eggs and things to do that are non-linear.- Amazing and stunning graphics. (Very well optimized graphics at that too.)- Giant well designed open world.- Good zombie variety. (Normal, Biters, Exploders, Chasers, Climbers, Night Hunters... Plenty to keep you on your toes.)- Really good crafting system.- Lots of realism in the survival aspects.- Wonderful plethora of finishing moves / ways to gruesomely dispatch zombies.- Hilariously good dropkick feature.- Great range of weapons and weapon upgrades.- New major DLC only 3 months after launch.- Very respectable and not deaf developers.- Very stable servers.- Fluid Co-op gameplay.- Fun ""BE THE ZOMBIE"" mode available to everyone for free.- Really nice modding potential and modding is officially recognized by the developers.- Amazing replay value.CONS:- The rare odd zombie through a wall glitch- Meets a few stereotypes of other games (This is only a con to the majority, some like that in a game.)- Meany developers patched my favorite exploit. (Killing tower guard with propane tank smacks for a free gun.)OVERALL RATING: 9.5/10JUST ****ING BUY IT ALREADY.			"

												Well, Where to begin with Dying Light.After finishing the main storyline with plenty of side quests that I missed, I can safely say that this game was quite something.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'm not quite sure where to start with this review so I'll just start with the good stuff first.It holds good variety in weapons and zombies, As well as various human enemies, Both military and non-military. The parkour is, in my opinion, pretty smooth, Maybe not to Mirror's Edge standard but it gets the job done nicely. Combat feels very satisfying and well done, Especially with the dismemberment of body parts. Graphics aren't too bad, Even at a low resolution, The game still looked very pretty on my computer, though others may disagree. The variation between day and night offers a nice change in the gameplay, One minute you're a zombie killing badass, The next you're a wimpy baby hiding from corners and climbing rooftops as if your life depends on it, Because 9 times out of 10, it does.A few very small but noticable features in the game add to it's charm, Such as the three seperate skill trees, Survivor, Agility and Power, Each having unique perks that help improve the way you play the game (If you're not too busy dropkicking Zomboids off the rooftops to notice them). The menu's are similar to Dead Island, So those who played that should instantly be used to it, Though it's easy for new people to understand. Certain NPC's in the game can offer some valuable loot and a weapon completely for free,  Crafting feels very well done with the different varieties of blueprints you can find throughout the world or earn through quests (Flaming, Electrifying Sledgehammers FTW!) And it's open world gameplay with two different areas to explore: The Slums, where you start the game off and play about 70% of the game, The other being The City, Where you travel to during the main storyline and has much, much bigger buildings.I personally haven't played Multiplayer with any of my friends who also own the game but from the few random dudes who have joined my game whilst I play, I would say that the Multiplayer runs quite smoothly. As the host, It gives you plenty of oppertunities to set up challenges for you and your friends to complete, Such as kill the most zombies or find the most loot and whatever else the game decides. I do have a personal recommendation if you intend to go public online when you're playing so random people and friends can join you, TURN OFF ZOMBIE INVASION. If you don't want to be CONSTANTLY invaded by super zombies trying to munch your face off, Turn this off. If not, You'll most likely find yourself being invaded every 5 minutes with NO ONE to help you, You'll be left alone and have quite a disadvantage, Though if that's your kind of thing, Go right ahead.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Plenty of good stuff to say about this game, Now for the bad stuff...The story isn't great. Pretty much throughout the entire thing, You can already see what will happen from miles away and most times they do. The characters aren't too interesting and some are completely forgettable, Even though this game tries at times to make you feel something for the characters and make you feel connected to them (I'm looking at you, Rahim.)The game takes a little while to bring out the different enemy variations, Which mainly consists of you having to play through the main storyline before you even see mutated zombies in the world and even then, You rarely notice any or don't pay enough attention to notice them, the most I've seen is the normal snappy bitey zombies, Some Viral zombies which come when you make noise (The super fast ones in daylight) and the big hulking fellas with metal rebars usually standing around in one place.And I cannot finish off this review without mentioning The Final Boss of the game, The psychopathic dude who has♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, Killed your comrades and ultimately made your life terrible in this zombie apocalypse. It comes down to that final moment, you finally reach the top of his mighty tower after scratching and clawing your way past zomboids and virals and falling to the dirt many, many times. A cutscene comes along, You and your enemy face off and what do you know? QUICK TIME EVEEEEENT!!!! You could see it coming a mile away, A God Damn Quick Time Event for the final boss. Please bear in mind that other bosses in the game that you fight, The Main Boss's Right Hand Man being just one of them, You fight all of those in the game normally, Dodging and leaping and slashing and dying a lot. But oh no, Not with this final boss, They treat you with a nice little QTE right at the end and you could EASILY see it coming a mile off. A dissapointing ending, In my opinion.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, If you could be bothered to read through all my rubbish, Welcome to the end! ~Confetti and Fanfare~So, Final opinion on Dying Light.Although it has a few faults in the game that can be noticed with ease and may annoy a lot of players, Especially that damn final boss, Does it make Dying Light a bad game? Not. At. All.It's Fun, It's Satisfying and it certainly lived up to my personal expectations when I first heard about it and got excited to play it.If you're a Zomboid fan, A Parkour Fan or you just like to slice dudes up and dropkick them from rooftops like a total boss, I HIGHLY recommend Dying Light to you. Some may argue about the asking price of this game but from what I've played and seen, I personally think it's worth it.Dying Light has been, In my opinion, A great start to a new year of gaming, I only hope that developers can keep this up for the months to come.Until Then, Catch ya later, Folks!Good Night And Good Luck!

												Dying light is an astounding free roam parkour action packed zombie shooter game. It is by FAR the best zombie game I have played with few exceptions. I knew this game was going to be good when I found out it was made by the same creators as Dead Island (another great game). Dying light has a good storyline and crazy amounts of different missions you can do, ranging from gathering supplies to holding off a safehouse from zombies. There are an endless amount of different upgrades and customization features you can add to your weapons.  It is quite a long BUT fun game. Even after you complete the game you can still have COUNTLESS hours of fun. For 60$ this game is WELL WORTH THE MONEY. Even though it is still in early access, it is definitely playable. This is definitely a great adition to anyones steam library, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes action/adventure games.                                                   10/10			"

												This game combines the ideas of several games I like. The main idea probably comes from Dead Island - I would say this is a nice remake. Then there are areas that need to be unlocked similar to FarCry. And the last thing I already knew was the opening of the chests like in Skyrim. All in all a game that hopefully in koop mode ensures a lot of fun. So far so good. I'll keep you up to date.			"

												Well, Where to begin with Dying Light.After finishing the main storyline with plenty of side quests that I missed, I can safely say that this game was quite something.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'm not quite sure where to start with this review so I'll just start with the good stuff first.It holds good variety in weapons and zombies, As well as various human enemies, Both military and non-military. The parkour is, in my opinion, pretty smooth, Maybe not to Mirror's Edge standard but it gets the job done nicely. Combat feels very satisfying and well done, Especially with the dismemberment of body parts. Graphics aren't too bad, Even at a low resolution, The game still looked very pretty on my computer, though others may disagree. The variation between day and night offers a nice change in the gameplay, One minute you're a zombie killing badass, The next you're a wimpy baby hiding from corners and climbing rooftops as if your life depends on it, Because 9 times out of 10, it does.A few very small but noticable features in the game add to it's charm, Such as the three seperate skill trees, Survivor, Agility and Power, Each having unique perks that help improve the way you play the game (If you're not too busy dropkicking Zomboids off the rooftops to notice them). The menu's are similar to Dead Island, So those who played that should instantly be used to it, Though it's easy for new people to understand. Certain NPC's in the game can offer some valuable loot and a weapon completely for free,  Crafting feels very well done with the different varieties of blueprints you can find throughout the world or earn through quests (Flaming, Electrifying Sledgehammers FTW!) And it's open world gameplay with two different areas to explore: The Slums, where you start the game off and play about 70% of the game, The other being The City, Where you travel to during the main storyline and has much, much bigger buildings.I personally haven't played Multiplayer with any of my friends who also own the game but from the few random dudes who have joined my game whilst I play, I would say that the Multiplayer runs quite smoothly. As the host, It gives you plenty of oppertunities to set up challenges for you and your friends to complete, Such as kill the most zombies or find the most loot and whatever else the game decides. I do have a personal recommendation if you intend to go public online when you're playing so random people and friends can join you, TURN OFF ZOMBIE INVASION. If you don't want to be CONSTANTLY invaded by super zombies trying to munch your face off, Turn this off. If not, You'll most likely find yourself being invaded every 5 minutes with NO ONE to help you, You'll be left alone and have quite a disadvantage, Though if that's your kind of thing, Go right ahead.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Plenty of good stuff to say about this game, Now for the bad stuff...The story isn't great. Pretty much throughout the entire thing, You can already see what will happen from miles away and most times they do. The characters aren't too interesting and some are completely forgettable, Even though this game tries at times to make you feel something for the characters and make you feel connected to them (I'm looking at you, Rahim.)The game takes a little while to bring out the different enemy variations, Which mainly consists of you having to play through the main storyline before you even see mutated zombies in the world and even then, You rarely notice any or don't pay enough attention to notice them, the most I've seen is the normal snappy bitey zombies, Some Viral zombies which come when you make noise (The super fast ones in daylight) and the big hulking fellas with metal rebars usually standing around in one place.And I cannot finish off this review without mentioning The Final Boss of the game, The psychopathic dude who has♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, Killed your comrades and ultimately made your life terrible in this zombie apocalypse. It comes down to that final moment, you finally reach the top of his mighty tower after scratching and clawing your way past zomboids and virals and falling to the dirt many, many times. A cutscene comes along, You and your enemy face off and what do you know? QUICK TIME EVEEEEENT!!!! You could see it coming a mile away, A God Damn Quick Time Event for the final boss. Please bear in mind that other bosses in the game that you fight, The Main Boss's Right Hand Man being just one of them, You fight all of those in the game normally, Dodging and leaping and slashing and dying a lot. But oh no, Not with this final boss, They treat you with a nice little QTE right at the end and you could EASILY see it coming a mile off. A dissapointing ending, In my opinion.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, If you could be bothered to read through all my rubbish, Welcome to the end! ~Confetti and Fanfare~So, Final opinion on Dying Light.Although it has a few faults in the game that can be noticed with ease and may annoy a lot of players, Especially that damn final boss, Does it make Dying Light a bad game? Not. At. All.It's Fun, It's Satisfying and it certainly lived up to my personal expectations when I first heard about it and got excited to play it.If you're a Zomboid fan, A Parkour Fan or you just like to slice dudes up and dropkick them from rooftops like a total boss, I HIGHLY recommend Dying Light to you. Some may argue about the asking price of this game but from what I've played and seen, I personally think it's worth it.Dying Light has been, In my opinion, A great start to a new year of gaming, I only hope that developers can keep this up for the months to come.Until Then, Catch ya later, Folks!Good Night And Good Luck!

												If you are familiar with the first Dead Island game or enjoyed slow paced zombie survival games, this is the game worth looking and getting. Gameplay wise, it's very similar to Dead Island but thrown in some Mirror's Edge parkour and Far Cry Series. There are lot's to explore in the fictional City of Harran and plenty of collectables. There are lot's of weapons to find, upgrade, and customize for entertainment. The zombies are very satisfying to kill with the nice detail gore to it. There are plenty of side quest to do and they are not really repetitive but rather fun and sometimes very rewarding to do. You'll spend a good 20~ hours into this game with all the side quest and exploring.			"

												In all honesty, this is the best game I've ever played. There's so much to do in this game. Dropkick, side-quests, main-story,   level up, upgrade weapons, do zombie-hunter mode, walk around and just plain kill stuff, and much much more!  This game has a large reply value and it makes it even more fun if you play with friends! Techland is working on modding-tools for this game so soon we'll even be seeing mods at the level of games like Skyrim and Oblivion! This game contains so much and the mods that soon will come will make it, in my opinion, the greatest game this year.If you haven't gotten it already, do it now. You won't regret getting this wonderful game.			"

												One of my favorite games to play to this day! It's such an amazing game to play with your friends and even solo. The story line is also very entertaining along side with the graphics which just perfects the game. I've completed this game twice on PS4 and yet to finish it on PC :D Hopefully, finish it for the 4th time!Rating 9/10Great Points:- Graphics- Gameplay- FreeworldFlaws:- The story line gets abit repetitive which drops it down to a 9- Grapling hook sometimes doesn't allow you to get to some places Overall: AMAZING GAME!

												This review is based on my personal opinion.This review will NOT contain spoilers.Every once in a while, I start up my PC feeling wonderful and I wanna play something.This game is always there for me when I feel like I have nothing to play because it's fun to slice zombies up in many different areas multiple times and you'd be proud of yourself because it just feels so rewarding.People who fear scary games should play this though. It remedies your fear. A lot. Because if you want this game but you fear of going outside from safe zones cause there are biters everywhere? Well.. you can't complete anything without fighting them. (Except farm your agility up so high for hours and hours because it takes a long time to do so but agility takes you nowhere because you'd have no fighting skills right?.. right..)But to summarize the gameplay. It has many varities in weapons and I'm not going to mention them here because it's fun to discover them and many of them have their own pros and cons. Regular zombies are like dust on the streets and other types of zombies.. well.. if you're interested... find it out for yourself. They're not hard. Kinda.. *Wink* *Wink*Co-op is excellent and it has even a LAN mode which is quite rare for a game of this time.Newcomers, here's a warning to you: You do NOT want to rush into Be The Zombie mode. It will make you rage quit multiple times. It's a gamemode for tryhards at most but you do NOT need to play this mode to get the full experience of this game. This game DOES have seamless co-op. (Yes you can stay in front of a zombie with your friend and kick the zombie about a 1000 times without having to worry about disconnecting due to inactivity on quests and side quests)On the performance side of things:You will not play this game on max settings. It is impossible. Even with Nvidia settings off it is quite hard to get stable FPS with view distance slider to the fullest extent of its reach because game casts shadows on everything on its screen. (Even the building that haven't been rendered completely? Yes even those and not low quality either. They'll be full HD shadows if you crank your distance to the max)Core i3-3220 would be my personal suggestion of a minimum 1080p smooth experience as I'm running this on 25% View  Distance. Textures, Foliage and Shadows are on the highest quality possible which is High. No Ultra here folks, you'll achieve Ultra with Nvidia Gameworks settings if you enable them. Which you shouldn't cause they cause such a hassle that you'll barely stop stuttering for a few seconds. Yes. Even with an i5. Just not as much as my i3.Basically anyone who has a better rig than mine will run standard 1080p High settings. If you have a monster rig you can go for some of the gameworks settings. I don't recommend it though because 30 FPS isn't acceptable here. 40-60 minimum for a good clean experience in fighting and intense situations.Summarized version: This game has a few bugs. Runs nicely on old systems if you know the capabilities and tinker with the settings right. Story is quite interesting. Has seamless co-op. Nice number of side quests. Spend your time out in the night at your own risk, it's really hard for newcomers and good night, good luck.			"

												Overall this game is very fun, but there are several problems that may question you wanting to buy this game. Here are the Pros & Cons.-Pros:Fun, fluent gameplay with an outstanding parkour systemThere is so much to do throughout the mapI have never wanted to 100% a game so muchThe combat is also fluent and doesn't get very repetitiveThe co-op is very funny and some things you can do are complete jokes-Cons:Trash story that is very shortWhoever wrote this had a book of cliche's right next to him (Bad guy screams your name, leaves you for dead, says your   not a man, and there is a quick-time event at the end)Fetch quests are the new meta?FPS drops here and there-Be The Zombie is broken:   Survivor sense is overpowered and defeats the purpose of hunting survivors when they hunt the Night Hunter   The Night Hunter has to defend even thought he supposedly ""hunts""   Connection is so trash, especially in BTZ   Early levels of BTZ are very frustratingCo-op is pretty sloppy when it comes to animations, connection, and style.Poor DLC (So Far)Overall, it is a fun, singleplayer game that has solid gameplay, but everything else is pretty bad. If you make this purchase, keep in mind that it is for the zombie-whacking hardcore-parkour experience, not the story.			"

												Gra genialna, jedna z najlepszych w jaką mogłem zagrać. Bardzo dobra grafika, ciekawa fabuła choć ogólny zarys bardzo schematyczny, super się gra; bardzo grywalna. Polski dubbing wbrew pozorom nie jest tak zły. Jedyne minusy: trochę droga(jak na rok od premiery), wymaga dobrego sprzętu, mimo wszystko dubbing zbyt obsadzony nastoletnimi głosami, jak ktoś jest wrażliwy to fabuła go doprowadzi do wewnętrznego płaczu xD Świetne mechanizmy i animacje parkouru, odczucią są dosyć zbliżone do tego w prawdziwym życiu.Edit: Niestety dodatek, mimo że ma nowe bronie, a przede wszystkim samochody, psuje prakour (nie ma go praktycznie wcale), a fabuła jest zrobiona ""na odwal się"", bardzo nieścisła. Jest przynajmniej wreszcie jakiś wybór, czego brakowało w podstawce, ale jest on średniawy.Podsumowanie: Jedna z najlepszysch survivalowych gier, najlepsza jeśli chodzi o ""brutalną kreatywność"". Najlepszy ""symulator parkouru"" i jedna z najlepszych gier o zombie.Serdecznie polecam.Ocena:9,5/10			"

												The best Zombie-slayer game i have ever played. The graphics are breathtaking, characters are perfect and the story is great: there are many twists in it which make it exciting. The parkour moves are also excellent and the coop is working well. It is not by accident that this game was signed to the best coop game of the year 2015. Rank system is okay too. It is also a survival game so you need to collect items in the daytime to create weapons and other creative useful things which helps you to survive the much deadlier night. And yes, it contains many frightening things. I absolutely recommend this one to every zombie-slayer gamer because your dreams will come true in this game. :)			"

												I was afraid of getting this because it seemed like ""Yet Another Zombie [Thing]"". Across my entire library, I only had one other zombie game. It's simply not a genre I care about because I generally find zombies to be fairly boring enemies to fight. But after poking the reviews and seeing a lot of comments like ""20 hours played, 15% of story complete. 10/10"", this implied that there was more to the game that it seemed. Indeed, I took a chance and dropped the full 60$ on this and I turned out to be fairly surprised, and pleasantly so.For me, what sets this apart is the ability to parkour around. This makes traversing the cityscape a lot more interesting and keeps this game from being a boring slog ""Point A to Point B"" with some zombie-smacking in between.What I continue to love most about this game is how it's multi-genre'd. After a few hours of play, by day, you'll be a powerhouse with weapons that will be able to one-shot the standard zombies (If you aim properly). Daytime is scavenging/questing time.But by night, it becomes a prolonged stealth mission. Double experience gain, a few quests that can ONLY be done at night, and enemies that will destroy you regardless of levels and weapon statistics, if you allow yourself to be 'alerted' for too long. Every night is absolutely intense and it's just great fun.Add to the fact that once you encounter ""Bolters"", enemies that will literally flee at the sight of you, hunting them is like an assassination mission as you can only kill them by sneaking up behind them. You could shoot them, too, but have fun with its four Volatile buddies that like to hang out.So what's keeping me on this game is the variance it offers. Traversing the land is fun, slaughting zombies en masse is great, and sneaking around at night is an intense and great experience.I've been recommending this to most of my friends.			"

												Review for dying light main game: This is a very well put together game. one fo my favorite zombie games. The way parecore, survival, and weapons are incorperated are brillant. sure, theyre are other games similar to dying light but DL just as a little more parecore, this is true, but also far from the truth. dying light is such a brilliantly put together story and charaters. I bought this game for 20 dollars on sale before 'The Following' was released. in my opinion the main game it self is not worth 60 dollars, but i would pay no more than 40 dollars for this game which makes me think i basically stole this game. one of my favorite parcour/zombie/openworld/shooter experience i think i will ever havereview for 'The following' : i payed 20 dollars for the following when it was released but if i didnt have the main game first both together would have been well worth 60 dollars. the following adds WAY more story that expected. tons of side missions and bounties which adds hundreds of hours of gameplay. the story is very well put toghter with a crazy twist ending. they really nailed this dlc. everything you would want with a 20 dollar dlc. (the buggys are great too!)dying light main game: 7/10 awesome game, boss fight was under whelming, characters could use workThe Following: 7/10 everything you would want from a zombie game dlc. its bigger than you thinkoverall 7.5/10 dying light is a great game with great dlc content and still lots of hours ahead of me			"

												I WAS APPREHENSIVE. I didn't wanna buy another zombie game since I already had DayZ, Infestation, H1Z1, etc.I kept putting it off because I was bored with it all but I saw it on sale for 30 bucks on {LINK REMOVED}cdkeys.com.What the hell.I now can't stop. Especially after the massive scene on the suspension bridge trying to find a specific quest item.The strumming, thumping music as I closely observed how realistic the infected behaviour was. They really have created a movie like experience that you actually get scared and tense to. The slow zombies aren't too bad unless they gather up on you but once you create a ruckuss the sprinters come and they are very rabid. The animations are so lifelike I sometimes felt sad when their humanity comes out and they plead for forgiveness but they still scream and lose control. All the zombies are tough as nails especially the larger zombies, vomiters and such.At night, that is the real scary moment. The extremely aggressive mutant infected are panther-like and tough to get by but with your parkour skills and crafting you will overcome.The graphics with ambient animations, weather and ai acting is so cinematic and immersive. I would like to play this with an Occulus Rift.I highly recommend this game. Believe me you will not be dissapointed and your wallet won't scream if you can get a deal. Why wouldn't anyone not want a good gamer deal? I have spent more for games that I hardly ever play but I swear to finish this one. "

												Like expected, it is similar to Dead Island in a lot of ways. So, where does it differ? Well, the graphics and general tone of the game are a lot grittier and darker than Dead Island. Think of this as the Empire Strikes Back to Dead Island's Star Wars. The looting and melee part of the game is very similar. You pick up, trade, craft weapons and use blueprints to upgrade them and so on. They increase in damage as you level up and unlock rarer varieties. The free-running is unique here - I don't think I have ever seen it done in a first person game before. It is both a blessing and a curse. It's a blessing because when it works, it works really well and gives a new depth to the game that would not have existed without it. It's a curse because it can be extremely fiddly and disorientating. Sometimes things just don't seem to work as well as they should and simple things turn into frustration inducing annoyances. It's a real shame too, since the system is *almost* good. Example: want to climb down and hang on the ledge? Forget it, something this simple is possibly the most frustrating thing you will ever do in this game. This game also features a unique night-time experience where you must run, dodge and hide from powerful super-zombies during night time. Unlike the normal Z's, these ones chase you and can run just as fast as you can. When they catch you it's game over - so a race for the nearest safe-zone ensues. This part of the game really fills you with panicked adrenaline and mixes up the pace of the game. It is a welcome and interesting addition. The (side) quests suffer from the same thing they did in Dead Island - fetchy and boring for the most part. There is one exception that I have found so far. In order to tell you about this I will just explain what happened to me: I was tasked by a man in the ""tower"" to power up 2 electricity generators in town and then head to the main distribution center and power that up. There was a catch - the center is crawling with Z's - I mean, hundreds of the ♥♥♥♥ers - and that's not all, I have to do it AT NIGHT time so that all the Z's get fried when I power it up. First I went and powered up the other 2 sub-stations with little issue. When I reached the main one I think my exact words were something along the lines of ""holy ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥"". There WERE hundreds of them. I gingerly scouted the area (in the day-time still), to see what I was going to do. There was a small entrance in the fence at the front and no other way in. I also didn't know which of the buildings I had to reach to turn on the generators. I dashed through the fence and jumped onto a van. A horde surrounded me within seconds and I was trapped. Fumbling through my inventory I fashioned 2 molotovs and let rip. The Z's burned and I jumped down. A second massive horde approached and I jumped back onto the van. I spent a few minutes trying to thin the heard, but after a time realised this was not going to work. Low on health, weapons all broken I decided I had to make a break for it. I jumped over several Z heads and ran for an opening, hoping it would lead me somewhere. Z's where everywhere and I was dodging and jumping past them. I came to a fence and vaulted over it. The area was ""safe"" and had a building. I went in and found the generator I was meant to use - some good luck that this was the right building. Problem was, it was day-time. Fair enough, at least I knew where to come now. I marked the location that I was standing on my map and made my escape. I headed to the nearest safe-zone where I slept until night time... Night was here. It was pitch black. I couldn't see more than 2 metres in front of me without a torch - yet the torch attracted zombies. Great. It's okay, I knew the terrain now and I had a custom waypoint set. All I had to do was get there without anything seeing me. I made my way to the station, slowly, avoiding all the ""super-z's"". When I got to the station my heart sank - one of the super-z's was pacing along the bit of fence that I had to get through. Bugger. Checking my inventory I found a couple of firecrackers. Hmmmm. I chucked some in the opposite direction and it vaulted over to them, attracting some of the massive horde inside as well. This was it. This was my moment. I ran. Jumping over the van, onto some z-heads. I got stuck on my planned route because there were too many of them. I had to think fast as they were everywhere. At this point I had little choice, I had to turn my torch on to see what was going on. I did. All the Z's turned and began after me. I climbed up a nearby generator before taking a running jump into the enclosure. Running to the building I slammed the door behind me and turned on the generator. I made it, phew. The sound of electric fizzing outside caught my attention and I went for a look. Sure enough, most of the horde was now being fried. One more firecracker left, I chucked it and made my escape. On the way out a super-z noticed me and gave chase. I was clambering up buildings, over fences, through houses to make it to the safe-zone. I picked up about 4 of these super-Z's on the way but finally managed to get the the safe zone. I lit up a cigarette and congratulated myself on a job well done. ""You see, preparation is key, bur?"", I said to myself.That's a side quest. It has turned out to be my most memorable moment in the game as of yet. When it works, it works really well. This story above however, is not the only way the game works sadly. A lot of time is spent running from point to point doing meaningless fetch quests and trying to climb buildings (and failing) over and over again. It does suffer because of this and the tedious running from point to point doing nothing but boring quests drops my score down from a 8 to a 7. Sure, I can skip this content, but I would miss out on a good chunk of the game as a result.It's a real shame that you begin to become OP later in the game, as the ""survival"" aspect of the game's early hours where you are scrounging for supplies and having to come up with genius plans to tackle the horde are it's strongest, definitive moments. As the game progresses, this gets thrown out of the window and you are left with another zombie smasher game with free-running tagged on.Jimbo Rating: 7/10			"

												Let me start by saying so worth the 59.99$ if this is on sale BUY IT! i insist this game gave me a solid 31.1 hours of gameplay so far i idled a little (LEFT somewhere and forgot to shutdown so shave off a good 3 hours of the 31.1) this game has so little cons and so many pros for instance =zombies are amazing looking and have very good blood effects and also limb separation=world looks beautiful and or stunning =parkour is really cool you can run up tons of ledges/jump almost anything=NPCS (characters) were unique & cool (But Sadly were really weak and died shortly after saving them)And thats not even all of it some tiny cons i noticed (Could just be me) sometimes after cutting a limp it rolls around right side up Be The Zombie (A GameMode) i found wasn't the greatest (Played as zombie twice and got attacked and killed twice didnt like both but thats just me nor did i like being the group that attacks the zombie)OverAll i would give this game a nine out of ten (9/10) great work (Rough Write up will be Rewrote later)			"

Posted: January 28, 2015
												Thought it was gonna be exactly like Dead Island, ended up being an improvement imo.It's not perfect so if you wanna see what I have bad to say about the game, skip to the cons.It's a great experience if you actually get into it, if you like killing zombies and parkouring, you should feel right at home, in this new enviroment. So here's a serious review.Before I start, alot of people with AMD cards report bad fps, so be aware of that.Actually check the system requirements before purchasing, so you don't end up complaining about hardware problems.- Pros/Features- +Decent story, there are still ridiculous and bizarre side quests. There are some really colorful characters in this game. But honestly, if you have a sense of humor you'll get a good laugh out of some parts of the storyline.+Parkour, allows you to navigate the enviroment in a very different way, viral zombies can parkour as well and are pretty decent at it.+Survival senses (Spider senses?) If you press the Q button, your survival senses kick in and will basically show little markings on lootable objects/items that you can pick up or interact with. Some people may find this a turn off, but honestly, there is ALOT of looting in this game, when your running from zombies, or low on time, it's helpful. It also shows the waypoint, so it's easy to figure out where your supposed to go without checking the map constantly. Overall it's a nice feature, and extremely helpful.+Crafting is very simple, create shurikens, medkits, molotovs, even beneficial boosters which are created with herbs. (Such as improved night vision, or damage resistance) As well as blueprints which let you modify weapons you already have, and add pretty devasating effects. Very similar to dead Island with the blueprints, except there are alot more. Some even let you put multiple elemental effects on a single weapon. +Weapon mechanics work well. Different weapons have different amounts of upgrade slots. You can add things like ""Crusader"" or ""Juggernaut"" to your weapon to increase handling/durability etc. on top of this you can upgrade with blueprints you find such as fire, electricity, and toxic. similar to Dead Island, but a step up with the new upgrades. You can also repair your weapons using tool parts that you loot. Eventually the weapon will break, but it's nice that you can repair and delay the inevitible.You can also dismantle weapons which gives you 1 or a couple repair parts.+Control over the combat. With the skill tree upgrades you can unlock the ability to dodge, unlock new weapon moves. Grapple opponets, dropkick them. You can also kick zombies/humans into spikes in the enviroment, and even use traps found in the open world such as electric fences, car bombs, and more.+The player can also hold up to 4 different equipments at a time (Shurikens, grenades, molotovs, UV light, etc.)+3 different skill trees, level up independently (Agility, Power, and Survival.) Everytime you level one of these up you can pick a skill which gives access to new crafting items, unlocks new moves such as the dropkick, or increases speed and whatknot. There's quite alot of upgrades.Power is increased by fighting enemies, you unlock combat moves for weapons among other things.Agility is increased by doing parkour, jumping, etc. Unlocks moves like the dropkick, also increases stats.And survival is increased by doing quests and recovering airdrop packages. These give alot of upgrades like making crafting more effective, learning new crafts, and also unlocking moves. When you die you also lose survival points, which makes it more intense.Overall the skill system is really good in my opinion, they can each go up to level 25. +Looting feels good, honestly I think they nailed the RPG feeling of just getting tons of loot.You can go in alot of the buildings, picklock chests. Most of these buildings have locked doors, so you have to look around and find different entrances such as going through a roof door, or lifting up the garage door.The human enemies will drop melee weapons, if their using them, as well as throwing items.And even the special zombies have some weapons you can pick up which include the concrete rebars and sledgehammer.+Special zombies are actually pretty interesting. It basically has the suicider from Dead Island still, but their are spitters which lob poisonous exploding bile (extremely annoying) And concrete rebar wielding zombies which are like 3 times the size of a normal zombie. Even the hazmat zombies are cool, they sound grim, and explode on death. Night zombies, are brutal...and yeah I stay away from them.(Very much a stepup from Dead Island with some of these zombie variants imo.)+Guns are a HUGE improvement from Dead Island. They handle better, and actually kill the targets instead of them just soaking up bullets. Exception to this is some of the special zombies, which depending on the type can take alot more bullets.The guns are somewhat overpowered because of the availability of ammunition, but they cause major noise which usually attracts alot of zombies. +Human combat is intense, most of the enemies wield different weapons, can throw knives, and will dodge accordingly, they can even block items such as throwing knives unless you time them correctly. The gunplay here is also improved, they die quite easily from bullets, but if they are wielding guns they can kill the player just as quickly if given the opportunity. This is my experience with the game, I came into it expecting a mediocre game and ended up getting an awesome open world experience. If you like killing zombies, parkouring, crafting, making awesome weapons, exploring an open world, just buy the game and play it. Develop your own opinion. - Cons - -Experienced quite a few crashes throughout my gameplay. A couple during cutscenes, and alot over the course of just traveling/doing missions. Nothing game breaking though, thankfully the autosave works out. Still, it's annoying having to reboot the game.-No manual save (This is a big deal to me) I really hate when games leave you with an autosave feature and no manual save. Haven't had any huge problems with it yet, but it would be nice to be able to manually save.-Some people report AMD card problems.- No vehicles, but parkour is more fun in my opinion, didn't really have a problem with no vehicles.-""Resize buffer failed"" Not sure what this means, but this has crashed my game about 5 times over 13 hours. Thankfully the game autosaves, and I haven't lost any of my loot to it yet. Still it's extremely annoying and needs to be fixed.-Most of the time when I load my save my character says ""OH♥♥♥♥♥♥"" I don't really consider this a con, but it's pretty entertaining. I can't think of any, i've been playing for quite a while and haven't run across any game breaking bugs. I'll add more cons if I do find some though.			"

												This is what dead Islan shouldve been!The games narrative is merely a device to get you into the real gameplay, not much context, but enough to get you going This is where it shines, Dying Light provides immense opportunities to forge grand weapons and claim ultimate power over the zombies. The early game of running away with sparse combat later turns into a ""revenge"" upon them for all of those med kits the used up earlier. Additionally the parkour is fun, while also being a bit nauseating at first, becomes a pleasure later.  "

												Oh man, This game just air drops you into hell. -Gameplay is Really intresting with a mirrors edge parkour type game with skill trees and crafting system. it's pretty addictive..-Questing aside from a few quests, they actually make you feel like youre doing something helpful not just, ""Go help tim find his old phone bill in a pool of zombies"" more like ""Help the dude find the guy who's selling speedballs as fake antidote thats killing everyone / Beat his♥♥♥♥♥""-Play this game with 7.1 headphones the sounds are amazing especially played in the dark. (I'd kill for an oculus version of this game)-Graphics look good, Not over the top but enough to still add flavor to the game.-Story is decent, generic but still interesting and differnt enough approach from the traditional zombie survival games.-Enemies, feel like your classic 28days later approach zombies with added ""Special"" zombies inbetween.One of the very best zombie apocolypse games i've played so far and it's a load of fun.tldr;Open world mirrors edge meets the walking dead.Smashing Brains in with a pipe wrench 9 / 10.Seriously try this game.

												This game is one of the most immersive games I've ever played.I could go on about its incredible optimization and how it sets out to do so much in just one game it's staggering, but this is one of the first games I've played that truly, completely immersed me. I went outside IRL on a errand earlier and a plane went overhead, and my first instinct was to look for the airdrop crate.I think that speaks volumes.Only downside is that Be The Zombie is slightly broken and it's difficult to find a match, but if you buy this game you don't need to buy so many others because it contains those games within it.9.5/10, Despite the high price probably the best value game I've bought for a few years.

												Definitely worth buying.  Since there is no demo, SWIM torrented the game to check performance.  Given the trend of bad ports running poorly on high end hardware regardless of system requirements, it's really the only way to protect yourself from $60 of regret that will eat at you forever.So anyways... to the game!  It's a zombie survival FPS game which is all the craze these days, but they did manage to bring something new to the table.  It doesn't feel like anything else out there.  Some games give you an arsenal and promote shooting your way through zombies, other games don't give you any weapons but make you wander around defenseless in the dark, and Dying Light does neither of these.  Guns are rare so using your enviornment and blunt force weapons are how you'll kill zombies.  But most of the time it's better to evade, which you do using the new parkour system.  Parkour and manuverabiltiy are a huge part of the game, and they pulled it off surprisingly well.  I expected it to be buggy and have its shortcomings, but it seems to work perfect.The story is intreguing, missions varied so it doesn't feel like you're doing the same thing over and over, and it feels like a fresh title instead of a rehash of someone else's idea.As far as performance goes, it runs great on my i7 4770k 3.5GHz/SLI 780 setup.  I have most of the settings maxed out except for Shadows and Draw Distance (which is set to half way), and I get 60-80fps outdoors and 144+ indoors running at 1080p.Your CPU has a major effect on the performance in this game, as it mainly uses just a single core.  So if you're running a modern Intel setup you're going to have a better time than someone who has more but slower cores (like with most AMD rigs).I tend to buy games, give them a 10 or 20 minute chance to grab my interest... and usually never open them again.  But Dying Light breaks the mold and has me hooked.			"

												When I got Dead Island, I was disapointed because for me,the game felt doll and boring (I'm more the single player type) so when I saw dying Light, I wanted to give Techland another chance so I waited for a good sale (got the game for 20$) and right at the start of it I fell in love with it.Story: The story was decent, sure I didn't expected that it would be like Mass Effect but it was fun to play.Gameplay: This is the real star of the game, I felt like playing Mirror's Edge in a zombie open world, the game play was fast,fun and balaced (while the end game got my nurves lol). Overall amazing gameplay.Soundtrack: The game don't use it's OST out side the missions very much but each mission got a great theme (my favorite is the brodcast mission, that track was AMAZING). I only wish that while free roaming there was a more tracks.Overall,I can recommend Dying Light to any one who os looking for a fun game that will last for a while, is it worth 60$? Well I don't know but with the new DLC I think it is because of Techland's support and the community, there will be always new things to do in the game.			"

												Dying light is a very great game that I truly enjoy. For starters the main story line is not extremely long to a point where the player is confused and it's not too short to where the player would become bored or finish it fast. Next if you love brutality or killing zombie guts this game is not going to disappoint with over 50 known weapons that kill in their own unique way or the characters own abilities not to mention all the throwable weapons that do multiple things. Another thing I really love and enjoy is that the open world aspect is one where you have so much freedom you can practically do anything you want. Lastly I find the PvP or night invasions to be a very fun activity to do with friends. All in all I truly love this game and if you are able to run this game and you like open world zombie killing games ((or a fan of Dead Island)) then Dying light is a game you should get.Good Night and Good Luck			"

												I’ve been very skeptical about Dying Light prior to its launch, ever since it was announced on the annual E3 press event in 2013. My time with Dead Island, which was made by the same developer, wasn’t as good as it could be and I wasn’t very pleased with it’s follow-up either, Dead Island: Riptide. Developer Techland showed an interesting setting with the announcement trailer and promised awesome gameplay mechanics, but this wasn’t enough to get me over the fence, and I’ve waited waiting.Read more at: http://www.torasko.com/2015/03/recommendation-dying-light/ "

For those of you who don't want to read a proper review, here's a summary:- I found extremely few bugs.- The game runs smoothly enough. FPS dips from 75 down to 45 occurs from time to time.- The game is TRULY frightening at night.- If you do as many of the side missions as you can, you'll get great gameplay value for your buck.- I gave this game a 10/10.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -First off, a thank you to Techland.I'm a gamer who never falls for the trailer hype. Ever. Why? Because they're made to sell the game. Wait! Before you say ""well duh, of course it's made to sell the game"", just let me explain... Even the worst game ever made can have a badass trailer. It doesn't matter how big of a turd a game is, it can still look like the shiniest diamond with the help of a good trailer.This is why I decided that before I bought this game I should probably check out some game play footage. This is where I throw out a HUGE thank you to Techland/WB for deciding to give select Youtubers exclusive access to this game before release. It really payed off for me, and probably for Techland as well.On to the review!I loved Dead Island and Dead Island Riptide (again, because I didn't fall for the trailer hype), and one of my favorite games of all time is Mirror's Edge. Therefore this game fits me like a glove. It has the braindead slaughter of zombies plus awesome free-running all wrapped up in a stunningly beautiful package.Sufficed to say, this is a pretty solid game. However, not without its flaws and optimization was one of very few. My FPS dips to 45 at certain points, but most of the time it's a solid 75-ish. Good thing I'm not an obsessed performance freak, or I would've found that annoying and ripped this game a new a-hole just based on that. Yeah... I'm looking at you, fools. You know who you are.Anyway...I think Techland did the right thing when they decided to make this game (which was obviously meant to be Dead Island 2) and dump the semi-bad reputation of Dead Island in someone else's lap. It has the exact same mechanics of Dead Island and it plays exactly like a Dead Island game. Now this is not something bad. On the contrary. Techland learned from their mistakes with Dead Island - and obviously wanted to start over with a fresh franchise and thus a better reputation - and they managed to fix everything that was wrong with the Dead Island games.I only experienced two bugs in the first 30 hours of playing the game; one where a zombie clipped through the hood of a car (happened 3 times) and me falling through the world when climbing a com tower (happened once and never again). That is not bad at all by any video game standard.The crafting system is exactly the same as in Dead Island with one exception: you can't upgrade guns. This is neither a good nor bad thing. They are guns. Shoot a zombie in the head and it'll die wether you do 500 extra electrocute damage to it or not. Gun modifications could have been helpful when trying to take down some of the bigger brutes in the game, but it's not a big deal since you can avoid 99.9% of them anyway. Dying Light is not a gun-heavy game and you will not miss these upgrades.I have one main rule when it comes to buying games; get roughly 1 hour of gameplay per euro payed. If you are like me you will not be disappointed. Granted I did get my game cheaper than on Steam at another retailer, so I was quite happy since it has already pretty much payed off, with me having played just about 50% of the main story in almost 31 hours.And no in-game shop for micro-transactions! Thank you!I've been thinking hard about the negative aspects of this game and I can't really think of anything. I haven't experienced anything bad or game breaking at all. The climbing is solid as a rock - no Assassin's Creed BS where your character jumps opposite of where you wanted him to go half the time - and the game's mechanics work well. The skill trees are helpful and actually do make the game a tiny bit easier for you, but not so easy as to you just running through the game without even trying. It really feels as if Crane has become more skilled at what he does and it's the perfect feeling for a game like this. The skills do exactly what they should. You are not a god, you are just a man who, as time goes by, learns how to take care of himself in a zombie infested world.And of course, night missions are scary as hell. +1!This game gets a solid 10 out of 10 from me. It's a breath of fresh air in an otherwise over-saturated market filled to the brim with rehashes, micro-transactions and badly optimized games with huge day one patches. Thank you, Techland. You did extremely well.			"

Recensione Italiana in fondo---Welcome to Dead Island 2 Dying Light. For the one who already know Dead Island's saga: Dying Light is heavily, really a lot, based on DI's mechanics, you will still find a distant tropical city with an unknown infection, a huge load of loot and weapons that can be upgraded with projects, all of this while you level up your character in 3 different skill trees. Plus you will have parkour style movements that will allow you to jump over obstacles, climbs on various surfaces, run over cables between roofs and many other things, including a grappling hook later in the game.For the one that don't know the Dead Island's saga: Add to what we said above that the game is an open world first person shooter where the weapon you will usually use are melee weapons, not guns, and you will have a questlog system to keep track on what missions you have and what to follow. The main focus of the game is that you will find various components during the game (iron pieces, gauze, electric cables,...) by looting item and corpses and with those things you will be able to upgrade your weapons with projects you will learn around. Plus the various actions you will perform (doing missions, do parkour, fighting, ...) will give you experience points in 3 different branch (Survival, Agility e Combat) that work like 3 independent skill-tree that will grand abilities to your character making him stronger.Dying Light has a slighty more serious feel compared to his two predecessor(the 2 Dead Island) with more aggresive and resistant zombies that will force you at the low levels to stay on the roofs, plus the Night that not only will increase the zombies stats but will spwan the Nocturnal, ferocius zombies that will be your nightmare at least until halfway the game. The story looks like to be trying to follow a more mature and emotional path but in my opinion they did not meet the wanted results, it's clique and not engaging with predictable plot twists. Even your big nemesis that I think was born like an evil, slightly mad but charismatic character is a collage of boring catchphrases and ""already heard"" speeches.The good side is that this is a big game with two ample maps (Slums and Old Town) where you can't fast travel (except from map to map) and with various random events that vary with the story. Even the secondary missions are many (more than 50 if you count every mission that lands in your questlog) and the main story count a quite good amount of missions as well. To complete it with almost all the secondaty missions done (except the single players one, see below) it took me 45 hours in coop.Pro:  Many missions, many hours of gameplay Stunning graphics Really beautiful to play with friends Thousands of moddable weapons Parkour movements system is well done and funnyCons:  Story lack of originality As well as the npc characters, clique and don't develop At high levels the fear for the night and the zombies hordes goes away, you are Terminator If you want high graphics you will need a really good computer Single player mode only for the protection missions, a weird choice for a coop oriented game. Even more if you think that they were coop in Dead Island Weird choice as well to make the FINAL mission single player only It remembers WAY TOO MUCH Dead Island (excluded parkour), they should have tried something more---Benvenuti in Dead Island 2 Dying Light. Per quelli che già conoscono la saga di Dead Island: Dying Light è fortemente, molto fortemente, basato sulle meccaniche di DI, troverete ancora una remota città tropicale con una infezione misteriosa, loot a non finire con svariate armi alle quali applicare progetti mentre sviluppate il vostro personaggio tramite 3 skill set differenti. In più avrete dei movimenti in stile parkour che vi permetteranno di superare ostacoli, correre, scalare edifici, sfruttare corde sospese e più avanti nel gioco anche un rampino.Per quelli che non conoscono la saga di Dead Island: Oltre ciò detto sopra sappiate che il gioco è un first person shooter open world dove le armi che andrete ad usare principalmente sono le armi da mischia, non quelle da fuoco, e avrete un sistema di questlog che vi permetterà di scegliere quale missione seguire in un dato momento. La caratteristica del gioco è il poter trovare componenti vari (pezzi di metallo, garze, componenti elettronici,...) con le quali potrete creare dei potenziamenti per le vostre armi. Inoltre le differenti azioni che farete (completare missioni, fare parkour, combattere, ...) vi daranno punti esperienza in 3 diversi settori (Sopravvivenza, Agilità e Combattimento) che funzionano come skill-tree indipendenti dai quali scegliere varie abilità che renderanno il vostro personaggio migliore.Dying Light è caratterizzato da un'impronta leggermente più seria dei suoi predecessori (I 2 Dead Island) con zombie più cattivi e resistenti che ai livelli bassi vi costringeranno a stare sui tetti e l'avvento della notte che non solo migliorerà la forza dei non morti ma farà anche comparire i tremendi notturni che fino ad almeno metà gioco saranno il vostro incubo. Anche la storia sembra voglia seguire un'impronta più matura ed emozionale anche se a mio avviso non hanno centrato il bersaglio, risulta scontata e poco coinvolgente con colpi di scena facilmente prevedibili. Anche la vostra grande nemesi che penso avessero inteso come una persona malvagia, un po' pazza ma carismatica è un'insieme di frasi ""ad effetto"" poco originali.Il lato buono però è che si tratta di un gioco molto vasto con due grandi mappe (Bassifondi e Città Vecchia) nella quali non è possibile viaggiare rapidamente (a parte da una maxi mappa all'altra) e con svariati eventi casuali che mutano ad un certo punto del gioco. Anche le missioni secondarie sono svariate (più di 50 se si tiene conto di ogni missione che va nel quest log) e la storia principale si difende bene in termini di numero di missioni. In tutto per completarlo con quasi tutte le missioni secondarie fatte (tranne le singleplayer, vedi poi) ci ho messo 45 ore in coop.Pro:  Tante missioni, tante ore di gioco Grafica mozzafiato Bellissimo da giocare con altre persone Migliaia di armi modificabili Il sistema di movimento a parkour è molto divertente e ben fattoContro:  La storia non brilla certo per originalità Così come i personaggi che incontrerete sono alquanto piatti Ai livelli alti la paura della notte e delle folle di zombie scompare, siete Terminator Requisiti di sistema esosi se volete alzare il livello della grafica Missioni di protezione solo single player, scelta bizzarra in un gioco che punta al coop. Ancora di più considerando che esistevano coop in Dead Island Così come la missione finale è solo single player, scelta strana  Ricorda davvero troppo Dead Island nelle meccaniche (escluso il parkour), avrebbero dovuto osare di più "

												As a massive fan of the original Dead Island I was surprised at my lack of hype of Dying Light which may have something to do with me not clicking with Riptide. After spending 8 hours in Dying Light I can say this should have been Dead Island 2. so far I've only completed 15% of the main story because I keep losing myself in the games sidequests which, after the first 3 hours of painstaking tutorial missions, come thick and fast and each has been interesting enough to make me do them first. Mixing the combat of Dead Island with a parkour mechanic for getting to higher ground faster, Dying Light feels more dynamic in every way, especially during the night missions (night isn't scripted but an actual cycle) when the machanics change stealth style as you face the volatiles, Zombies that can run as fast as you and can take you down in seconds. The visuals are gorgeous at max settings although the best settings come at a very high performance cost so your going to need something beefy to run it at those settings.Dying Light jis easily one the best zombie games available and in my opinion beats my previous favourite; Dead Island.EDIT: 23 hours in and still in the first map. This game has a shedload of interesting content to do away from the main missions.The ollowing Update: Just a small note on the Paid DLC that was released as part of the Enhanced Edition update. This DLC is massive, adding in new quests over a whole new map that is easily as good as the content in the main game. You are given a buggy ala Half Life 2 to upgrade and repair along with new weapons. If you liked the main game then this is unmissable.			"

												Cam multe jocuri am terminat in ultima perioada :))Dying Light Review ! PRO - Poveste jocului - Soundtrack-ul - Grafica- Gameplay-ul ( Iti poti crafta armele, sa le upgradezi, sa cauti resurse sa le duci in baza ) - Parkour-ul - Side-quest ( Evident dupa ce ai terminat jocul , poti sa continui faci cele 44 de side-questuri. Aceste side-questuri au legatura cu povestea in sine , deci ar fi bine sa nu faci aceste questuri fix cand terminati jocul ) - Limitarea armelor - Rick Grimes ( sa-ti pui organe de zombie pe tine ca sa nu te urmareasca zombie ) - Challenge ( O sa gasiti tot felul de personaje care va provoaca la diferite concursuri  ) CONTRA- Optimizarea lasa de dorit- Coop-ul la aceast joc lasa de dorit - Modul multiplayer Concluzie Merita sa va jucati acest joc . Aveti o gramada de facut in acest joc , de la misiuni principale la cele secundare plus challenge-uri si alte chestii de explorat . Un lucru important este ca puteti descarca devkit-ul pentru acest joc. Deci cand nu mai aveti ce face in Dying Light puteti sa descarca devkit-ul si puteti sa va faceti propia harta si dupa sa o postati pe workshop. Sau la randul vostru sa descarcati harti facute de comunitate si sa va jucati. Acum astept sa joc acel expansion The Following. Sa speram ca o sa continuie povestea care si asa s-a terminat in copac. Nota finala 8. Si un review la Dying Light The Following Expansion va urma in zilele urmatoare !			"

OverviewAs a fan of all things zombie, I’ve been looking forward to Dying Light for a while now. Overall, it’s a great game, and it has much going for it, but there are some odd design issues, a serious case of couriering (is that a word?) and just some attention-to-detail features that make me go, what?I’ve played for about 28 hours, I’m at 70% story completion, I’ve finished 39 side missions, and I’ve done six of the quarantine zones, as of the time of this review.Want the TL:DR? Great game with great mechanics, a story that slowly devolves into a clichéd mess, with some technical issues that shouldn’t really exist, and a few questionable design choices spread throughout. Still a great game. If I were to put it on a numbered scale, it’d get a seven out of ten.The Good+ Visuals are astounding, great atmospheric effects (such as debris floating around), explosions look terrific, zombies have great models. One touch I quite like is if a viral is in front of you and screams, their mouth actually opens and closes as it screams. Not a big deal, but adds a touch of realism.+ Sound is also great, be it the music or effects. Connecting with a melee weapon gives a satisfying crunch, and guns sound like how guns should; firing off a shotgun blast results in a roar, not a pathetic tinny sound many games use for gun sounds.+ The story, at least at the beginning. Sure, it’s rehashed (something happens, people become zombies), but it’s presented differently and keeps you intrigued for a bit, drawing you into wondering what happened.+ The main mission. The primary goal of the game changes a few hours into the story, but the missions that you undertake for the main story are great, and they aren’t recycled very much.+ Parkour. If Dying Light didn’t have a parkour element, it would definitely be your standard zombie exploration game. Not only does the parkour add an extra dimension, but it’s also done right; it doesn’t feel tacky or sloppy.+ Progression and perks. There are three categories you improve in: Survivor, Agility, Power. Survivor points are gained by completing quests and quarantine zones, as well as challenges. Agility points are gained by just playing the game; climbing, jumping, strafing. Power points are gained by killing; melee, firearms, explosions, traps. There are 25 levels of each, and the perks are pretty nice. They act as a tree, and to unlock one, you’ll have to unlock the first tier and go from there. It’s not too in-depth, but adds a nice touch.+ Night mode. Nighttime adds an extra layer of trouble for you; it’s pitch black, and there are more dangerous zombies with heightened senses. It’s basically a stealth mode. However, completing quests, exploring or just being outside doubles what you earn for the period.+ Random events. There are many random events. Air drops, which contain relief packages and some other goodies, are the big one for the first little bit. Get there quick enough, it’ll be yours. Take your time, you may have to fight off some other humans for it. Take too long, and you’ll lose the drop completely. There will be random survivors under attack who will reward you for helping them. Some people may turn into shopkeepers when you save them, giving you another location to buy and sell from. Some people might only be there to give some background on life in Harran before the outbreak. Maybe you’ll help a group of survivors fight off some zombies, only to have them attack you afterwards. Lots can happen!The Bad- The story. As I said, the story starts off great, but after a couple of hours, it devolves into what has been seen hundreds of times before. I won’t give it away, but you can likely figure out what your goal changes to.- Hit detection/clipping. I’ve mainly seen this on the bigger guys with the huge rebars, but the hit detection is atrocious. He’ll begin swinging, I’ll dodge backwards completely out of range (even of the shockwave), yet I’ll still get hit by it. Same for clipping. I might run behind a truck, yet the attack still manages to get me.- First aid. To make a medkit, you need alcohol and gauze. Pretty realistic, as that will actually tend to wounds, although not restore you fully. Yet every single first aid/medical box you open will have gauze. Just gauze. No alcohol. A few hours in, I had maybe nine bottles of alcohol, yet I was up to 50 or so gauze. Just seems weird.- Night mode. Yes, night mode is good (see The Good). But it’s not really that much more difficult. Your survivor sense will show an outline of the dangerous ones, and the minimap always shows their vision cone, so it’s not at all challenging to avoid them. You’ll likely only run into them if you mistime a jump and fall hard and one’s nearby, or if you kill an enemy that makes a loud noise (hazmat guy by attacking the air compressor, or have one of the bloaters blow up).- Technical issues. Even after the 1.2.1 patch, there are a few technical issues. While they obviously won’t apply to everyone, every few times I quit the game, it doesn’t exit properly. It drops me to the desktop, but the game is still running in task manager. I then have to end the task, and upon restarting the game, it begins in windowed mode, and I have to set it to full screen.Aside from the odd exit issue, cutscenes sometimes freezes for a few seconds while the audio plays. If I wind up getting hit directly by the belching zombie’s green blob thing, the game freezes for a few seconds. Lowering view distance seems to help, but I shouldn’t have to lower that to compensate for poor optimization.The Rest+ Zombie models are pretty varied, with lots of different combinations. While you will run into reused models, they’ll be few and far between.- Godlike human enemies. Zombies, sure, they might take a little to knock down. But the humans are definitely of a godlike stature. There is no reason why, after burning for ten seconds from a Molotov cocktail, that they should survive a shot to the head from a pistol, and still require a few whacks to put down for good. That’s just ridiculous.- Not much variation in the boxes or crates you run across. If you see a green, white or yellow box that looks dirty or rusty, it’ll never require a lockpick. Likewise, if you come across a box that looks nice, or adorned with something, even if it’s in the dirtiest part of the slums, it’ll require lockpicking.- Most of the side quests are typical courier fare. Go talk to person, get item for them, return, get reward. This is a good 90% of the side quests, not including the quarantine missions. It’s like an MMO in the way they’ve handled Crane being a courier.- Protected survivors. Every now and then, you’ll see a shield icon on your map; these are survivors who need escorting. They are all annoying, they don’t shut up, it’s never A to B, and they all run headfirst into every zombie without waiting for an escort. For example, a fisherman wants you to escort him to his secret fishing spot. But before that, you’ll need to escort him to his rod. And listen to him talk about what a good deal it was. There’s also the American guy. I wanted to shoot his legs out and leave him for the zombies.			"

												Dying Light is not what I expected it to be. I wasn't really excited for the game, saw no interest in it as I am not into these zombie survival type games. However, I found a good deal on the game and thought, why the hell not? When I started playing the game I was just blown away. I wasn't expecting a beautiful open world game. I was expecting a game that tried to be as scary as possible for no reason.The story is great. It shows the epic tale of the survivors in Harran fighting to stay alive and get out of the hellhole. Once nighttime hits you realize this is the most hard and scary parts of the game. Special types of zombies appear especially at night that are ruthless killers. You can avoid the night by sleeping in your safehouses, which are located all throughout the map and you have to ""liberate"" to make them yours.The graphics are very gorgeous. The world is detailed and full of interesting things to explore. However, as you progress through the quests I noticed a lot of the characters looked very similar to each other and thought that ruined the immersion.The gameplay is great and frustrating at the same time. Running around Harran in the slums or old town you are constantly climbing and jumping from rooftop to rooftop. I think Techland did a great job with the parkour and nailed it. At times it felt like a first person Assassin's Creed or Mirror's Edge in a post apocalyptic world. However, the combat is sometimes very frustrating, it could take up to 10-20 hits to kill a enemy and is annoying and tedious trying to kill them.A thing Techland could have added is fast travel although it may seem like cheating in a survival game like this. It gets a little tedious and annoying running from ends of the city to the mission objectives and I feel as if there was a faster way to travel around the city it would be a lot greater. Near the end of the game we are given a grappel gun which does indeed help moving around a little faster but this is something that should be looked on in the sequel.Overall, I am happy with my purchase and I feel like the game exceeded my expectations and proves Techland can make games that don't fall into the cliche zombie survival type games.9/10			"

												This game is way more than I expected. It is a LOT of fun. I played for around 5 hours with my friend today and we had a blast ! :) Graphics are stunning, gameplay is really good, interesting story & amazing combat system !Only bad thing which doesn't really apply to me is the fact that the game is pretty hard to run. I get around 50 to 70 fps with a gtx 970 4gb and sometimes can dip to 40. Do not buy this game if you're running a card under the 780 series imo.And also the day/night cycle isn't bound to the quests at all ! At least that's what I noticed.*updateafter the patch was released my frames went up a lot ! a 760 to a 770 should do the job			"

												So here is what I have to say after a night with much less sleep than I should have got.Dying Light is going to get compaired to Techland's previous title Dead Island a lot. And it is fair that it is, because a lot of thing, big and small, feel so similar to it. However, don't let that part put you off. Really. Don't.In Dead Island, much of the combat felt like a bunch of little one on ones, with no real interaction with ""the mob"". In this, there seems to be so much more fluid combat to the game, send one zombie flying into about 6 others, and get the one that is still standing while the others on the floor figure out what the heck happened.While it feels like I don't have the reach I would think I do, the free running feels great. It may be quite easy to fall off a pipe you run on, at least at first. After a bit, you will have the motions down a bit more like second nature.In summary, what I am saying is this is five times better than what Dead Island was. Just... know it is a little intensive on the graphics if you want to crank it all up, espeially with mid range gaming rigs.			"

												This game is just ...well more than incredible i really enjoyed the story and the overall gameplay. JUST freerun every in a zombie apocalypse. Dead island was kindof a hack and slash game as where dying light was a cool zombie horror experience. With its realistc  effects and the enviroment was just beutiful . open world zombie outbreak. just awseome . another thing is how in one dying light review they said how you can be like an assasin creed like character in a zombie game. You get find cool weapons get guns and ammo and like food water and medicine really adds on thank you so much techland.			"

												A total improvement in this company's direction since Dead Island.  This one goes on the wall of rare games you will never forget and will want to play again and again (and I will definitely revisit this game often).  The story was a little weak in spots, but had a decent climactic ending in comparison to previous titles.  Story-wise, this game shines a little more with side quests, albeit some were similar to others, I didn't feel as if I was repeating mundane tasks over and over - filler-quests if you will (Just Cause 1, for ex.).  Several of the side-quests turned out to be a series of quests rather than a the snatch-and-grab-and-return-for-experience-points-and-your-done scenario.  Regardless, I can't wait to see what they do next.10/10.			"

												Okay. So I saw this game back when it was introduced. I was like COOL. Then for some reason for the longest time I lost interest. Then my friends came on and said they might be interested in it. I bought it and damn do I love it. It's well optimised, fun, beautiful. Just. Yes.ONE downside I can think of is that some of the challenges are STUPID hard. Even on EASY or Medium. They're ridiculous.But still a very fun gameEDIT:After taking time away from it and thinking back on the experience, I can still certainly say it's fun. The only downside is once the story is gone and all the missions are done it's just boring.  For the time I spent on it, I still had a lot of fun but when my friends stopped playing it...I just kinda forgot about it.(I mean all of the missions not counting fighting/parkor challenges)			"

												Generally I'm not a fan of zombie type games. I usually go for the fps multiplayer tactical games. However, I do enjoy a good co-op experience with friends every now and then. This game has been nothing short of impressive. They put a lot of detail into this game, not only into the world itself but the mechanics and gameplay as well. Add in a co-op player or three, and you are sure to have a blast. Roaming the world and looting can get pretty addictive, as you search for better weapons or new boosters to craft. Most of the zombies are just plain fun to kill. But,when the sun goes down, the volatiles come out and the adrenaline starts pumping as you try and outrun them trying to get to a safe zone.For most games, side missions outside of the main story line get boring and repetitive (gta 5 for example). But with dying light, I find myself more interested in just wandering around, looting, and beating up zombies, that the story is not the most important thing anymore. With that said the story here is pretty solid. And there are a tone of side missions to do as well. I've played almost 20 hours so far and am only 35% through the story!Anyways, this is a great game. If you are into zombies or looking for a fun co-op experience - pick this up! "

												I have hundreds of hours in Zombie games, from DayZ to WarZ (Or infestation survivor stories) I have played games like This War of Mine and Dead Island, this game manages to take the good aspects of these great survival and zombie games and turn them into something really special! Dying Light is a first person action, zombie, survival, parkour game, with a thirlling storyline and a loot system that reminds me of Diablo days, just not as♥♥♥♥♥♥ While the annoyance of having 'spacebar' be the singe most important key in the whole game, and when it doesn't work in a challenge or in a pinch, you are sure to die, the game for the most part is exciting! The DLC added to the game is enjoyable, I wont blow smoke up your♥♥♥♥♥ the paid DLC is obviously where it is at, some of it worth much more than the others. The Bozak hore was a challenging and rewarding experience that once I completed I felt a great sense of achievement! The other challenges in the game offer brief, but rage filled, similar experiences. I would recommend this game to a friend, it is much more enjoyable surviving the world with a friend!			"

												Not your average predictable jump scare horror game.This was really well designed , and carfully planned.Side quests are not just boring go there fecth that repetitive tasks but actually quite interesting well throught out missions and the rewards are awesome. ""The main questline (not completed yet) is a very addicative storylineCons 1.Wishing that choices could influence the story line to add replay value2. Buying weapons at the shop is a no go. it will deplete your money v quickly 3. Human enemies are a bit earier to beat especially after getting the hang of it 4. the weapon repair balancing needs a bit of work, not that keen on spending my entire stash of money on a weapon i can throw and get killed before I can pick it up and loose it forever, also a weapon that cannot be repaired after a certian amount of fixes, never ran into the problem but i think phsycology gets in the way5. more houseghold supplies, I have tons of cables batteries alcohol and metal, but household supplies should not be that rare, I get it with why electornics are rare but cmon now.---And spoiler alert----you knew that stupid kid was going to try and bomb the tower ; predicatable as hell			"

												UPDATE!!!! really my only gripe is the last fight is a quick time event... kind of a let down but w.e. very open ended ending leaving room for dlc or a sequel. still very fun, gripping storyline, and definitely going to run through it again. back to the original review, now.100% worth full price!simply the best game i've played in awhile, the only zombie game you purposefully run into a giant crowd of infected to vault yourself over them, fall on one of them to stun them, squash their brains out, and repeat. techland really out did themselves on this one, for me dead island was dead weight. shoddy story, predictable game elements from other 4 person co-op kill stuff games... but this, dying light is so much more polished and is so amazing and nearly perfect.at the time of writing i have 40 hours in and am 53% done with the main story, so awesomesauze. right now some fps issues are noted when getting grabbed by a biter or spat on by a toad, but that's really it. it crashed a few times cause i didn't lanch it from steam. have not yet tried any co-op or multiplayer modes, but i'll get there.

												There comes a time when you simply stop being so enthusiastic about a whole bunch of games, which are being released or already are out there. You simply cannot find it exciting anymore, all those continuous franchises... fast paced, scripted gameplay, recycled stories... all bleached out and without a soul. There's a bunch, and even if you haven't experienced some of those newer combinations of elements in aforementioned types... you simply don't care. You've seen it all.But then, once in a while, comes a game which wakes up that child in you again. This is that kind of game.All the segments which make it so refreshing and enjoyable construct a unique and a special combination. Combat and player flexibility, atmosphere which is primarily enriched by the beautiful graphics - is was sets it apart. Story in this game is just a side dish. So I won't go nitpicking around, finding what's wrong with it... there is always something, saturation comes inevitably... like with almost everything in life. It is not perfect... but it is best of its kind.This is the best zombie skull smasher, while dashing through the vast city, there is... and ever was.			"

												I bought this game only because my friends wanted to play something coop with zombies. Let me tell you this game surprised me way more then I expected. It is so good, so well built. I fell like I'm in the movie ""I Am Legend"" all the time. The night is scary but the most important thing is the coop element: at first I didn't wanted to buy it cause I knew you play as a single carachter even in coop...but now I'm here to tell you that I was completely wrong. Immersion in this game is complete, the cutscenes are really good and you never feel out of the game cause of the coop. I like the melee weapons a lot, I like that you find almost no rifles and guns at the start of the game, I like the city, I like the night.The light at night...good god I love it! It is SO DARK when the moon is covered by clouds.The game is also well optimized cause the lowest settings will guarantee a GREAT graphic experience (45+ fps on a ATI 7850 i3 3220). If you like zombies games and/or first-person games with parkour and melee combat elements in it GO BUY THIS GAME!Only 1 complain: the sky texture could be better.			"

												Very entertaining game from what I have played. Yet to see how short the story is, but so far it has been interesting enough to keep me hopping around Haran. With the new DLC there are buggies and a whole new map to explore with friends which could be interesting to experement with. The combat is slightly boring as it becomes a case of repeatedly hitting a zombie till it lands on the ground, at which point, you hit it again. The co-op is a fun little addition, but only if your whole team knows how to play, otherwise it is a case of running back and forth to help your team. Swarms of zombies hiding on the streets can also be a big problem if you dont have Firecrackers to lure the oncoming horde away from your objective or home. Even then the radius of the firecrackers isn't all that effective.I say this game is fun but there are somethings that could be improved apon.  7/10			"

Play it Co-Op with 1 friend you get along with, follow the side quests  do the story, it's by far the best Zombie Survival game I've played in a very long time! The graphics even on Medium are stunning, the game is fluid with very few glitches or setbacks, the learning curve is great as far as tailoring the Protagonist to how you want him to be played. Skill tree is great, crafting is entertaining. Things I don't like about the game. I'd like it to have 6 to a group rather then just 4. The in game voice quality is a bit shabby, but I use skype most days. I've been playing this everyday and I am loving every hour so far! I would recommend this to people who enjoy survival games looting crafting running for your life and fast to think of where you'll be in the next second. It's fast paced and scary! I love it. The story is very nice to listen to and the tidbits of info you get from the game is also fun to collect. The Achievements are good fun as well...I am going to complete them all.			"

												One of the best zombie games I've played so far, ♥♥♥♥♥ on dead island.Don't  know where to begin, game has no faults in my book.Moving around the city is awesome as the parkour aspect is easy to get used to. Especially when you have unlocked the grappling hook. The games visual appearance (design, detail) benefits this as well.The main story and side quests will keep you busy for days. Most of my time spent in this game is doing these side quests and exploring as you always get distracted from every turn.Most of my game time is also spent during the day as I could take everything at my own pace. When night comes around, everything is fast paced and becomes a heart racing nightmare, but with a double experience perk.Overall a great game that is worth every cent. You can see how much thought and design has gone into this to make it one of the best games of the year. Definitely stands out as one of the top games that have come out recently. Whether you enjoy the exploring - open world aspect or slaughtering zombies with friends, BUY THIS GAME!9/10. "

												Probably the best game i've ever played. The graphics is amazingly good at medium and aboveand runs super smooth but on low it doesnt run to good, and there are plenty of missions, bounties and easter eggs to do and find when you finish the game. there are not many glitches so... have fun :)			"

												I've had fun with this game just like dead island, the only problem i have with it is that it can get repetitive leading to me throwing my weapons often times just to make a bit of fun, there is a problem with throwing your weapons however, they every now and then teleport really high or into the ground becoming irretrievable. The parkour is done well, its all pretty basic so its not like its going to blow your mind or anything. Overall an OK experience.			"

												Fun. Main complaint is that the zombies aren't really scary during the day, and there's not really much point to going out at night unless the plot makes you :/ They all also take a lot of hits to kill to the point that it breaks immersion.But whatever, it's enjoyable when you play with other people - despite all needing to be in the same place to talk to people or go through doors. ""Press B to win"".Parkour is fun, grappling hook is fun. Water graphics: 8 / 10			"

												I rarely write reviews unless I feel the game deserves recognition for being a complete pleasure to play. I can whole heartedly recommend this game to all who are thinking about purchasing it. A fantastic ride through and through with plenty of side quests, challeneges, and just a plain and simple great story and characters. By far my all-time favorite game in this Zombie infested genre. It blends all it's differnet parts together in a way that allows you to go about your missions as you see fit to your play style. Hats off to Techland for getting it right this time around. High hopes for a sequel.			"

												Dying Light is something of a spiritual successor to Dead Island, made by the same company and containing many of the same mechanics. You run around killing zombies, attach various junk to weapons to make them cause more and different kinds of damage, and you progress in the plot by running chores for various survivors in the city.However, this time around they've completely removed the enemy level system, making it possible to become an absolute zombie-slaying god among men once you got yourself levelled up and crafted some high-end weapons. You'll face more difficult enemies down the line for sure, and as is true to form you can get overwhelmed when too many swarm you at once, but you always have the option to level up and get more powerful stuff and come back to absolutely stomp the enemies later.They also added two new key features: Day/night cycle, and parkour. Both of which help immensly to spice up the regular zombie slaying.During the day you'll mostly only face regular zombies and the occasional special variant. You can safely run around the rooftops and outmanouver them, take them head-on with whatever blunt or sharp instrument of your choice, set up traps and blow up several at once, or just ignore them and use them as jumping blocks to reach that annoying ledge you couldnt otherwise (this move is hilarious. get it early :)During the night, however, the tone changes. The normal zombies get a little feistier, but more importantly the streets will be stalked by deadly hunter zombies called volatiles.These beasts constantly scan for anything you-shaped or you-sounding, and once they see you you better run for your life. They are NOT to be trifled with until very late in the game, and even then they're pretty dangerous. They also investigate any sound their fellow undead make, so if you take a swing at something, You better leave before they come looking.The Parkour elements provide you with the means to escape the Volatiles, as well as a fun & fast way to get around the city. You can jump and climp almost anything, giving you near total freedom of movement. Later in the game you even get a grappling hook to quickly scale even the tallest building, though it has a cooldown so you can't rely on it to save you every time when you're being persued.The story is ok. It's nothing too fancy, but it's interesting enough to keep you playing. It's definitely not the main draw of the game, but at the very least it doesn't detract from the experience.My main gripe with it comes at the end when you are suddenly forced into a QTE event which instakills you if you fail a single press. The rest of the game has only mild QTE influences, like hammering the use key to open a door, and this particular sequence come at you without warning. You'll likely die in it many times before you learn the right keypresses. The game did not need this part.All in all, the game was great fun throughout and I highly recommend it to anyone who liked the Dead Island series. Dying Light improves upon the formula in many ways, and (aside from that one-off QTE event) it all adds up to a satisfying game all the way to the end. Pros:+ Zombie killing in creative ways+ Fun parkour in an open-world city (a bit like Assassins Creed, but faster paced)+ Levelling system with abilities that heavily impacts gameplay+ You can dropkick people (great fun!)+ Crafting system from Dead Island (mostly unchanged. If it ain't broke, don't fix it?)Cons:- Not as optimized as it could be. The game has been patched to fix several issues, but you'll probably want to set draw distance to the minimum. It only reduces far away terrain detail, as far as I've seen, so you'll likely not even notice any difference.- If you want to go singleplayer-only, the game will constantly nag you about wanting to go online with no way to turn those messages off. A nitpick to be sure, but it annoyed me quite a bit.- That instakill QTE event near the end. Seriously, wtf?			"

												Dying Light is an open-world zombie game. Here you can craft and improve your weapons using the resources gathered from scavenging in the zombie-infested city of Harran. At night, a harder special infected arises making the game even more challenging. I made a youtube review that covers the basics of the game. It's one of those releases that lives up to its hype. Good storyline, fast-paced and tons of fun!

												Not a Dead island Launch, the game actually works perfectly fine with no crashes and glitches. Good thing they delayed this game to prevent that from happening. (Looking at you Dead island)Pros-Parkour (evading infected and bandits)-Satitfying kills (Not like Dead island)-Different variants of mutated infects-Mutilation is back (from Dead Island)-Voatiles pursuits (Like GTA with cops, only at night time if you are seen by Voatiles) -Guns are actually balanced and works -Resources are scarce, and rare in most occasions-Fight or Flight situations-Brainstorming kills using the environments-More craftables (Unlike Dead island with weapon mods only)-Dynamic events (Airdrops, rescues, assistance, and other)-Safe house (functions like FC3 and 4 outposts)cons-Side Quest (DAMN IT, DEAD ISLAND OVER AGAIN, but not as bad as dead island though)-Some dynamic events are rather repetitive in the same location.-Airdrop no longer drops as you progress through the story-Other than that, annoying minor glitches.I would recommend this game with friends to play with.

Short and to the PointThis game was an honest shock for me as to how well it was put together. Dead Island was a special game as well but it did indeed fall short. Very buggy, awkward character development but was still enjoyable being the first Borderlands/Zombie game. Dying Light really improved on all the aspects Techland was trying to create with the original. Honestly I am happy they got away from Deep Silver. Considering the shambles that Dead Island 2 is in at the moment. The graphics have improved, animations are cleaner, characters are easier to connect with and sound design is pretty nice as well. My biggest clap is to the RPG elements of the game. All quests are mostly voiced and give you some characters to mess around with. They have a pretty good variety as well. The skill trees are pretty diverse give you some different ways to focus at first. Overall it is a great game and I totally recommend it. Awesome with friends. Things that could still use some work. Mostly story development. Although much better it still sometimes feels a little empty. In the sense as I didn't always feel the drive to get to the end all the time. Again, it wasn't bad but I still think it's one of Techlands improvement points. The animations are much better yes, but characters can also feel a bit static in the face when in conversation. I'm sure Dying Light 2 will have heavily improved face works which will immerse the emotions the game trys to convey. Also at times it seems the game doesn't always respond or connect in combat at times. It's not really bad but sometimes it just doesn't seem to work correctly. That's being very picky.One thing I would like to see in Dying Light 2 is creating your own character and gender picks. It would be a huge step for Techland but that would be awesome to have. Again, love the game, it's near perfect. Just has a few things the sequel can perfect. PLAY IT!9/10			"

												Where to start? Dying light is an open world, zombie survival, first person parkour game and I love it!Although the zombie genre is very crowded at the moment as long as your not feeling to much fatigue and you love parkour I can almost guarantee you will love this game!Pros: FANTASTIC PARKOUR SYSTEM 9/10Fast paced parkour challenges.Great graphics (Pro tip turn down view distance for almost double the amount of frames the graphical difference? Well, there isn't really one at all!)In depth skill system.Combat feels great!FOV slider ( I believe it ranges from 65* - 90* or somewhere around that)Steam workshop support.Free developer tools download to make custom maps for steam workshop.MOS SUPPORT! Last I checked (a couple days ago) mods still work! (Or the ones I tried at least I cant guarantee 100% support for every mod) the only catch is, you can only play with the people who have the same mods.Cool weapons and tools available to use.In between: PC optimization certainly isn't great, that said it isn't horrible either, you may have some problems running this on lower end rigs. I can run it 1080p texure quality: medium everything else off or low (with the exception of hbao+ depth of field etc) roughly at 30 -60 fps. Specs: Intel i7 4765t, gtx 860m factory overclocked, 16gb ddr3l.The story isn't that great, its not horrible, I would personally say its just passable from staying out of the cons category.Cons: Well... $70 USD is a little pricey, I guess thats a con, but otherwise well theres really nothing that bad about this game!The only other negative is that this is by no means an original game, it borrows very heavily of other game such as farcry 4, dead island (although they are the same people who made dying light) etc.Final verdict: 8/10 This games parkour mechanics are incredible, it is the best first person parkour simulator out there in my opinion. The combat is awesome, the skill tree mechanic implemented is well designed, I love the support for steam workshop mods and how they have giving you thye tools to make your own custom maps. I also like the regular mod support it provides (granted some wont work but there are some that do!)The story is a little tedious at times and can be a bit of a drag and the game optimization is nothing to be bragging about, and it is a little pricier than regular AAA games on the market today costing roughly $70 USD. The game also does not have an original bone in its body, but the gameplay certainly makes up for that!			"

												Definite Buy. Game starts out really fun, there is just a satisfaction to beating zombies with a metal pipe it just doesn't get old. I like to play my games thoroughly and although it was fun there was just too many fetch missions for my taste. Lots of   running around across the map. I did eventually get tired of doing them but I was already 15+ hours in. The main quest was a blast seemed to have really good pacing and just felt good and satisfying. My only real complaints would have to be the amount of running around you have to do if you do like doing the side quest and the guns just didn't feel right to me or maybe the melee was just too good. 8.5/10 Thumbs up!

												I first got this game when it came out. I finished it and I enjoyed it, for the most part. I am now playing again in anticipation of the expansion coming in 2016 and I am having more fun than ever.If you enjoy survival this game is for you. Just make sure to play on Hard Mode. This is one of the very few zombie apocalypse games that made me think twice about swinging my weapon about like a kid on a temper tantrum. You will feel like a survivor in choosing tactics, evasion and mobility over brute force.Prior to Hard Mode being added, your character would much too quickly become a Johny Rambo one-man zombie killing machine, slaughtering thousands of infected without breaking a sweat. No more. Now you're just a fit guy with a bunch of saw blades duck-tapped to a brick hammer, and you know (magical) parkour. This fixes a big narrative problem with the game as it was released, captured in the following question: If its so ♥♥♥♥ing easy (for me) to slaughter my way through day and night, why in the flying ♥♥♥♥ are all these people holed up and scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? Well, Hard Mode answers that question by bringing you down a peg.Just don't come for the (main) story. Its atroucious. Side stories and characters, however, are equal parts humorous and empathetic.Get it, Play it, Enjoy it.			"

												First of all, this game is easily the best zombie game in existence.  The parkour is phenomenal, and it complements the combat very well.  The fighting is as fun as the running, but don't expect to be a ninja at the beginning of the game.  The protagonist, Kyle Crane, hasn't much stamina, so the game has a slow start during which one needs to focus on survival; on finding enough weapons.  Durability is a huge aspect of this game.  Things break, and, once things break, they don't return.  Minecraft style.  The game doesn't take long to speed up, though.  Before you know it, your stats will be maxed out, and you'll be rolling your eyes at an inventory that's stuffed with weapons.  If the beginning is too slow for you, I find it necessary to tell you that there is a New Game Plus option.  You keep your inventory and your abilities.  Meanwhile, you enjoy the game, again.  Definitely don't worry about replayability.			"

												I really like this game, if you were unfortunate enough to get this when it first came out and you had a nvidia GPU you most likely would not agree with me due to all the permonace issues and game crashes etc etc. but thanks to the latest patches this game now plays flawlessly.The graphics on this game are awesome providing that your GPU can handle it but one tip i found was to set your view distance to minimum as it does not make much of a difference and you can push around another 10FPS out the game, also motion blur and film grain effect give you a few more frames if disabled.The gameplay is great; free-running whilst smashing zombies up, what not to like? A wide range of activities, chalenges, side quests, colectables and decent leveling system will keep you busy for hours. I got over 50 hours out of it but at least 10 of these hours were played after i had got everything in game. Online is rather active and you shouldnt have any issues finding groups.I definately recomend this game but make sure that your system meets the minimum requirements as quite a few people have thought that their system could run it only to be dissapointed or end up playing on much lower graphics settings.If you like Dead Island, you will like this. Think of Dead Island crossed with Mirrors edge and it should give a pretty good idea of what to expect.			"

												Awesome,  i have to say getting chased in this game scared the hell out of me i loved it.  Remember dont look back even though there is a button for it (Y on xboxone control).  Unfortunately im too big a wuss to stay up at night in game and play this (irl or ingame).I do feel that the night is kind of one sided.  Probably intentional especially at the start of the game.  I havent felt like i've explored the game fully like other open world games.  as my lack of skills/cohonas prevents me from even approaching heavily populated areas.Remember sometimes you will die just learn from it.  A great experience worth your time and money.  Havent even tried the mp yet.			"

												Incredible game. Was expecting disappointment, was pleasantly surprised with one of the most entertaining zombie, hell, one of the most entertaining games I've played in recent memory. From the way movement is handled, combat, customization, crafting... everything is just great. Runs like a dream on my decent rig with a fairly weak GPU (GTX 660) at mostly high-medium settings with view distance set somewhere in the middle.			"

												You know i was excited for this game before launch, than before it's release they announced that zombie mode would only avaliable if you pre-ordered the game, so i did'nt buy it. Time has passed and i got it at 50% off and the mode is avaliable for everyone now.What a great zombie FPS, similarites to dead island, yes,  but what the game offers is so much more. with power-ups as you progress that add alot more fun into the game instead of having something that is rarely used it or a novelty skill that is useless. First game I was scared running away in pitch darkness with zombies right on my tail, It really gets the adrenaline pumping. Also the free running is great, very fluent and flawless I have no trouble with getting my charecter where I want him to go at all times.			"

												Dying Light is quite a fun game, but has its downsides. Killing zombies is always fun of course. The most exciting bit is going out at night, when there are more of the bigger dangerous zombies outside. It actually is kinda scary being chased by a quick and strong zombie in the night, with almost no vision.The parkour abilities that you can use are also quite nice. However, the story is a bit dull and becomes quite boring. The game also becomes quite repetitive. Killing zombies, clearing safezones and running from one mission location to the next, is pretty much all you do.If you're looking for a game to spend a lot of time on, Dying Light is probably going to get too boring for that.

												This is how a zombie survival game should be done. It makes the inevetably repetitive action of slashing/avoiding zombies fun and tactical, and the story's not too bad either. Plus, the game world is very detailed and there are lots of fun easter eggs hidden around for you to find.There are however some moments which I feel can quickly become tedious or frustrating. At later levels, fast running ""viral zombies"" will spawn almost constantly, and will chase you across the entire map while screaming their lungs out (and I do mean SCREAMING. The damn things don't shut up!) Additionally, I feel that night, which the game advertises as being very dangerous, is difficult for all the wrong reasons. Namely, the fact that it's exactly the same as daytime except for the addition of extremely fast zombies with a huge aggro range and an instant kill attack, which is not so much a danger as it is a massive annoyance.

Its worth the full price consindering the gameplay is awsome and we are getting more and more content, especially you got the season pass, because on the 9th of feb we are getting the Following! :D			"

I only put 22 hours into this game and its already one of my top 3 favorite games ever. There is a great leveling system that really makes  me feel like Im getting a lot stronger. I feel soo powerful when I decapitate or cut a zombie clean in half. This game is amazing and really sets the bar high when it comes to open world action.  I rate this amazing game 10/10			"

												The game is a big step-up from Dead Island. The side quests aren't all generic fetch quests and the main story is actually engaging. The combat system has been reworked and the game has you feeling helpless at the start which is a very good thing. I was positively surprised by how open the map is. The only invisible walls are the boundaries of the map and story-related locations. The parkour system is also fun and pretty intuitive to use. The use of skilltrees prevents the game from going stale and adds some really big changes/additions to how you play the game.If you liked Dead Island and/or Mirror's Edge, get it.The main story quest will net you around 10h of gameplay. I have done all of the sidequests and I'm currently sitting at around 35h. The game is fun enough that I might replay it in co-op though.There have been some CPU and RAM management issues but they have all been fixed with the 1.40 Patch resulting in a dramatic increase in framerate. Props to Techland. "

It's, in my opinion, even better than the base game. Interesting idea with an own car and the Mother. One bad thing was only a lack of GPS.

												Beginning as a furtive, desperate survival-horror experience, Dying Light gradually and gratifyingly evolves into a fast, hyper-violent celebration of vertical freedom and zombie destruction. Its main story is unspectacular, but the memorable side quests and sheer fun of exploring its world do a fantastic job of offsetting that, making Dying Light one of the most engrossing open-world games – zombie-infested or otherwise – I've played in a while.

												7/10, good game (+1 with EE: The Following)--- edited review ---(quick review update for game version 1.11.1, Linux tested, played multiplayer The Following addon)Good news. Game finally seems to be fixed and actually is playable on 680 GTX. I assume game is not up to par with Windows version but framerates are way better than on 1.5.0.Mouse re-binding WORKS. Even SIDE BUTTONS. Hear that, 4A Games (Metro: LL)?You still have interface designed for gamepads, but doing more complex actions like selecting arrow types for the bow etc. seems to work well.Fixed: + framerates + keybindingWorth of trying, especially if you grab the enchanced edition from the Steam sales. EE includes addon campaign The Following and several minor DLC's.--- old review below ---(review for game version 1.4.0, Windows playthrough, Linux tested)edit: Linux 1.5.0 tested, low performance compared to Windows versionPlus: + generic gameplay: movement and combat is fun + woo-effect: nice looking, lots of graphical detail + gore effects: good gore effects which are not ultra-overdone Minus: - lame boss fights, QTE WTF? - exploring is not rewarding (unless for Steam achievement) - game console syndrome (awkward UI, feels like non-PC game)  - keybinding: even on Windows it's bad, and don't even mention Linux   - very low FPS on Linux/SteamOS even game is marketed as SteamOS game  - grappling hook Dying Light is Dead Island re-animated... er... zombified? Worst parts of DI have been rotten out, so you now have actually playable game.Gameplay is heavily parkour-styled, so your character, Kyle Crane, will climb and jump around the city of Harran in search of cure research for the zombie virus. Harran is made up from two large areas Slums and Old Town, which are enough distinct to spark your EXPLORE!-fire again when you change the map. The game world is quite amazing and graphics developers have been doing marvelous job to add lots of details all around. Exploring the world will give you XP, but when you hit the level cap the rewards from exploring won't account much unless you play for Steam achievements. On the other hand, as there aren't any practical reason to explore more, two large map areas will suffice.Movement is fluid and usually you get intended action (grab a ledge, jump off from the wall) so you actually feel like you're doing parkour moves. If surface looks like it could be grapped or climbed, that's usually the case. Movement skill level also adds to the feeling that Kyle Crane physically learns more as he goes on. Having seen some games which kind of sucked (Mirror World *cough* *cough*) and some games where all surfaces are fair game (Ninja Gaiden), doing parkour in DL is simply fun. Of course some movement restrictions are in place as game world is finite, there are surfaces you can't grab and gameplay area is confined by magical invisible walls. Later on you get grappling hook, while it speeds up gameplay considerably, you lose most of the illusion of being parkour runner.Combat system is fairly simple. Neverthless it's entertaining enough for few hours just to bash, slash, maul and maim zombies with whatever weapon you get on your hands. Zombies react to physics, so they can tackled, toppled over fences or forced to climb on high places to even reach you (and then they get kick in the face). You're able to target generic body area so usually button mashing is a great combat tactic. There is unfortunate auto-targetting when doing some combat moves but I guess it's price to pay for playing console game. Story is kind of mixed bag, as side quests have more story than the main quest. Most of NPCs have at least somewhat interesting dialogue and voice acting & animations are ok, some overacting, but also some really excellent performances. Most of the default story line aspects living in the city full of undead are handled in way or another through side quests or collectibles. Unfortunately main quest includes some really dumb forced story events, bad boss seems to have constant grip from Crane's balls whatever Kyle tries to do. Kyle Crane voice acting shows him as quite strong-willed character, he's not on par with JC Denton but delivers his punch lines with real punch well enough (except every time when Kyle meets evil boss he puts whimp clothes on so he can receive good spanking). I have kind of insight after my playthrough that Techland can't make a game without horrible main story twists. Dead Island was such a dog puke, DL is bit better though as side quests will give some credibility for the story writer.Of course the zombie game aren't zombie game at all if there aren't any gibs! In DL zombie gibs are also finite, for example you can't cut only fingers off, then palm off, wrist off and so on, you only chop off whole hand from elbow. Gore effects are fairly well done and stay within reasonable limits so you can enjoy the effects and do not get WTFs every time. Gore with taste, I say! Also splatter effects on walls seems to correspond with weapon you're using.User Interface is designed for consoles, game has ""hold this key and move mouse""-style weapon/item menu. This might work if you have gamepad or such, but I played this with keyboard and mouse. You can rebind the keys, but you need to limit yourself to only some items or juggle through awkward inventory if you want to use more items (especially elixirs). Also keybinding on Linux version is horrible and mouse recognizes only 3 buttons.Of course review would not be completed without nitpicking about some things. Developers are marketing this game for Linux/SteamOS and then when you buy it you will experience about half of  FPS of what it should achieve. DON'T BUY THIS GAME FOR LINUX/STEAMOS until developers fix this! Patch 1.5 recently came out and fixed some issues. I tested Linux version with same hardware and fact is game does not perform well enough to be playable.Also final battle with the boss is just one facepalm moment you can't forget. So, you're ready with best weapons with best upgrades, holding boss' own gun to give it back one bullet at time and lots of invulnerability elixirs to gulp. You climb on the final ledge ready to pump this guy full of lead and then chop him to tiny grilled evil zombi-snack bits with your Fiery Sword of Death. Well, that's how it should go? Instead you're treated with Quick-Time Event (QTE) where one-handed man beats your zombi-killing hero to ground only using one hand and whole battle...  no, not battle... watching interactive movie... consist of pressing seven buttons in certain order. WTF? In fact, here's pro-tip for you: in this game you can discard your weapons before playing any main quests against boss as you can't never use them.Conclusion: despite some shortcomings this is quite fun game. Main story sucks but as one NPC said to Crane, blockbuster movies are all about happy endings and badly told stories. Here's story for 70€ (incl. Season Pass). As long you remember to turn your brain off for the main story quest, you should have fun. Worst letdowns are technical problems with SteamOS/Linux version (hopefully to be patched) and main story had lots of brain-dead parts in it.On the bright side, gameplay is fun and entertaining for one playthrough. Multiplayer might add some more hours, but I'll suggest you first try the game on single player or with newbie friends as best parts of the game experience is at the beginning of the game. I would say with more experienced story designer, ironing out all technical problems before release and adapting interface more for keyboard/mouse this could have been excellent gem. Anyways, it's worth of try if you buy game for Windows. I can't recommend buying this game for Linux/SteamOS and paying full price. "

												I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical about this game. I'm not (or better, I wasn't) a big fan of parkour-style games, but Dying Light proved to be a great buy. If you like running, jumping, falling, bashing zombies, running away from zombies, really running from scary freaks when night falls and eventually finding some guns and weapon upgrades so you can do some serious damage while you run and jump, then this is your game. Parkour, many side quests to keep you busy, great soundtrack, upgradeable skills, upgradeable weapons that can really smash zombies (including an electrified cricket bat, respect to the developers), all manner of potions, some creative traps and more running and jumping. You also have a lot of freedom in how you go about doing things, so you can take your time and brain some infected while you hone your jumping/crashing-to-the-ground skills.Graphically very good, control-responsive, no glitches or bugs to report. Awesome game.			"

But I love crashing into zombies! just *Vroom vroom* over em! <3The DLC story was very good, I am very happy about the DLC story line :) I would recommend you guys to give it a shot!

Dying Light... spiritual successor to Dead IslandWhy spiritual successor? Deep Silver acquired the rights of the Dead Island franchise and Yager is developing Dead Island 2. Dying Light is made by Techland and is a completely new franchise however, very much inspired of Dead Island 1 and Riptide!Okay, now finished with the story mode. Here is the updated review!For gamers on the fence with this game, I can honestly tell you that it is a fun game. Granted, I liked Dead Island 1 even with the repetitiveness, bad voice acting and goofy humor but Dying Light has many differences. It's got a more serious tone and the setting is mainly focused on survival. You finally have a day/night cycle and lemme give you an idea how's the night cycle... Exactly like the movie I AM LEGEND. You run for your life if you dare do stuff at night... You can try to kill one of those ""Volatiles"" but highly not recommended until you are high level, like at least 10 or you'll just get killed easily by them swarming you. Thing is, just like I AM LEGEND, once a Volatile spots you, it screams and then you get swarmed by other Volatiles and Virals. So, better do exactly like Will Smith and run like hell!A good change from Dead Island is you do not level up once for many ability trees but once for every three and just by playing. If you do lots of parkour, you level faster in the Agility tree... if you lockpick many chests, you level up faster the survivor tree, etc. I think this is a cool new system and a welcome change from Dead Island where you had many trees of abilities and had to focus on specific trees as well.As for the story, it is about you, the character, that gets airdropped to Harran, the quarantined city that has a nasty epidemic going on. You are sent to investigate while blending in with the locals, who are fighting each other for the sparse resources scattered over the city. Brief synopsis but better than Dead Island. It drags on for long though which I was a tad disappointed but it gets the job done!PROS:+A very stable game especially at launch! The delay did paid off it seems!+Outstanding visuals (graphics, models, weather effects, animations, etc).+Old school style soundtrack!+Decent voice acting unlike cheesy Dead Island!+Fantastic ""old-school style"" soundtrack. Really gives that '80s zombie vibe!+Fun First Person Parkour done right (mostly!).+Rewarding carnage that never gets old!+Three-way levelling up is an innovative way to keep you playing.+Highly tensed Night cycle.+Lots of lots of exploration with many side quests. Basically, lots of contents to keep you busy for many hours!+Co-op and competitive play (Be the Zombie) can add up replayability but as of now, the Zombie mode lacks balance.+Many easter eggs! I haven't seen many in-game but I watched a few Youtbue videos and Techland went nuts with those eggs!CONS:-Underwhelming story with an ambiguous ending leading to story DLC (highly likely).-Tedious side-quests. Get to point A then to B and backtracks to A and then go to C to the otherside of the whole map. -No fast travel until you beat the campaign that is.-Last level parkour running is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Be prepared to do many retries!-QTE last boss fight.-Unbalanced competitive Zombie mode. Just spam UV light and the Volatile/Zombie is toast!-Lackluster season pass content (it includes two missions for dlc1 then items pack for dlc2 and some horde mode for dlc3). I'd advise anyone to wait for it since the content doesn't seem worth the purchase right now.OVERALL:If you loved Dead Island, you should love this one as it is much better in every ways. Its not cheesy like DI and more survival focused. The game is not perfect (heck, has any game ever been?), has a few faults here and there but the goods outweight the cons and I had lots of decent fun in this sweet violent game.On the technical side, the game was quite stable on my rig with every settings maxed out. I only had one crash to desktop but it may have been on my fault since I didn't restarted the game once I upped the settings. Aside from that, the game runs A-OK to me! The delay this game got surely went into QA and I wish more games would do the same. To see a new modern AA/AAA game releasing on DAY ONE and working properly is exceptionnal nowadays!RECOMMENDATION:I recommend this game especially if you loved Dead Island, you will truly love Dying Light. Many improvements to be seen/experienced. Is it worth the retail price? YES! Especially if you're looking into a new game right now, then give it a shot!RATING:8.0 / 10THE FOLLOWING DLCThe Following DLC picks up exactly where you left of. You are meeting a character that tells you of a cure to the devastating plague in Harran from a friend but his dying words mentions to travel in a new location. Once there, you get to play around and even drive a dune buggy (that you can improve as you level up the Driver section). There is new enemies that you find who are labelled as ""elite enemies"" that you ""shouldn't fight on your own""... which is correct if you play the game in Nightmare mode! Talking difficulty level, I played the whole DL game in nightmare mode and it was mostly fair fights! But in TF, nightmare mode is a bigger chore. Enemies have more hit points and your damages are very low. You also die more easily vs Volatiles at night... or in Volatiles Nests! The Countryside region is BIG and fun to explore but my biggest gripe with Dying Light is you don't have ANY fast travel... and almost all quests/missions are all far apart, implying lots of driving and time spent there.SPOILER ALERTEnding is... bad. I liked it! Basically, you have two choices... sacrifice yourself and all those pointless quests, for the greater good by activating a nuke OR, fight The Mother (Sentient Volatile that can walk in day light but turns mindless killer at night) and ""save your friends""... by infecting them with your ""Volatile cure""! Both endings, I find cool! Would be interesting to keep the story going with your Volatile self and for the mission, infect a whole city! Would be a cool new game style!.PROS:+Massive new area to drive through and explore.+Frantic gameplay in Volatile hives!+Dune buggy is a fun new gameplay mechanic+Interesting cult conspiracy story.CONS:-More fetch quest missions (the annoying part is from far away locations).-Boring and stupid protagonist Kyle Crane (your character).-The fast respawns of zombies in cleared zones is very irritating.RATING:8.0 / 10 "

You only have to look at what they have done for the dying light fanbase to see what im talking about. Fantastic free updates which massively expands the games life past the end game and the new expansion pack The following which has a whole new game world new story skill trees buggy riding.

												You know i was excited for this game before launch, than before it's release they announced that zombie mode would only avaliable if you pre-ordered the game, so i did'nt buy it. Time has passed and i got it at 50% off and the mode is avaliable for everyone now.What a great zombie FPS, similarites to dead island, yes,  but what the game offers is so much more. with power-ups as you progress that add alot more fun into the game instead of having something that is rarely used it or a novelty skill that is useless. First game I was scared running away in pitch darkness with zombies right on my tail, It really gets the adrenaline pumping. Also the free running is great, very fluent and flawless I have no trouble with getting my charecter where I want him to go at all times.			"

Think GTA quality open world/graphics, integrated co-op story, an actual varying and engaging combat system (you don't just spam one attack), and despite a lack of vehicles you can operate (though I hear that is on the way) the parkour movement system is about as fun as cruising around in your favorite supercar in GTA.

												Wow! One of the best games I have ever played. I love zombie themed games and this is basically FarCry 3 with Zombies (seriously I'm convinced the devs from Dying Light used the same engine as there were features that I've absolutely seen in both games). An absolute must play. 10/10Pros- Story and cutscene animations are excellent- Gorgeous (or should I say disgusting?) artwork really helps with the vibe- The Parkour is some of the most fun part of the game- Weapons are fantastic - RPG elements unlock new features at a good pace- Game world is huge with lots of in-game content that will let you keep playing long after the main storyline is over- The night missions help you never feel quite safe even when your character is overpowered- The Following episode adds the buggy. Running over zombies is more fun than I would like to admit.- The game is not overly frightening but the engine can randomly produce some decent jump scaresCons- The later The Following episode had a number of ""soft"" ledges where the character would miss grabbing on to something that the skin made look grabbable. This led to quite a few annoying deaths during high climbs. - The Bozak's horde extra missions had a great idea but the save system annoyed me to the point that I decided not to finish them.- Eventually your character becomes so overpowered that killing zombies can become almost a nuisance- Besides adding missions, once a safe zone is unlocked it didn't have much more to offer than a safe place to sleep and/or sell stuff. I felt this was a missed opportunity as I would have loved to see some base building or defense elements included in the game.			"

												worth the $30 sale at the moment, typical game playthrough time though, only issue i have with it is the 8-12 hours gameplay if you do only story and a few side quests here and there. storyline is acceptional, somewhat unbelievable. side quests are mostly, ""go find my friend X to see if he's alive and help him back here"" only to see that he is either dead or you just say that his friend is looking for him and he just bails, never to see him again. another issue i was having is the grappling hook, you'll grapple onto something way high up, and the game just decides, NOPE, and it drops you rather than having your character grab on the ledge, letting you die. 7/10 game, i enjoyed it.

												Countless hours of fun! After some time is put into character development the fun meter just keeps rising. Are you a slaughter monster? This game caters to you. Very satisfying zombie bashing combat abilities that are devastating and gory. You more the scout type, play it realistic? There is room for you in Dying Light as well! This game has something I really like, a majority of the enemies are CLASSIC zombies! The move like you would expect and only special types can book it after you. Even before you unlock the plethora of wickid Parkour (Agility) abilities you are able to move around, over, and through the swarms of deadies with relative ease. It is really really enjoyable to run through crowds of shambling zombies, turning and sidestepping like a dance as zeds reach for you and miss as you cut through the crowd like butter. And as even better feeling is reaching your hands into a freshly killed zombie and smear their guts all over your face and body and just moving WITH the hordes. Anyway you look at it there is something for every zombie fan, as well as most action/adventure fans as well! PLENTY of thrilling moments backed up with a solid and cool storyline. Tons of weapons and collectibles. Great crafting system. Well balanced levelling system. And many many side quests. Not to mention playing with even ONE friend in cooperative mode completely changes the game. Going out in groups is almost cathartic! You basically feel like you can handle anything slow and steady whether you are luring enemies, setting traps, or just aiming high with sweet melee weapons from flanking positions, attacks from both sides, or just classic kick*** back to back slaughterfest. I personally suggest everyone try modding a sledgehammer for impact and watch as your dead foes go sailing out of the park! Basically, there are many many ways to play and enjoy the aspects of this game from the movement (my favorite part) to the fighting, to the moral dilemmas. A real treat for anyone who it runs smoothly for. I was lucky to not have been affected by a lot of the initial bugs and optimization. "

												It is Assassins Creed with Zombies. The game itself is great, it is a new attempt to the zombie genre. The story is good, not great but good. You drop in as a soldier to eliminate a guy, yet you don't have the stamina to hit three zombies in a row - kind of makes you wonder what kind of soldier they have sent in. You can't barely scavange real weapons in the beginning, that might be okay so you learn how to proper climb, close combat etc. Still I would appreciate if I can choose what to use. The game basically forces you to play on so you can get really strong and get really good weapons. It does actually missing a little bit the part of a run around slaying zombies. I went to the hardware store, got myself a shovel aimed for the head and it still needed like three attempts, I don't think there is a skill to hit a slow zombie with a shovel on a one meter distance. The night is pretty scary, if you do a run, you need to be focused - I like that, it is a challange comapred to the daylight activity. Over all I like it, I would not give it a too high score since you can't really go on slaying  and dismembering from the beginning and you start of as a bootcamp soldier that through whatever events has been sent into the city as an assassin with no endurance or close combat skills. I will probably take you 20+ hours to realy start enjoying the game, yet not something if you just look for a open world zombie slaying.			"

												Great gameplay, awful story. Lite spoilers below, but if you couldn't guess the things I spoil during the intro cinematic, I'm not sure you should be allowed on the internet.I was absolutely skeptical about the first-person parkour, but honestly it works more smoothly than the climbing systems in any Assassin's Creed or Uncharted (I'll leave Mirror's Edge out of it, as the system really has more in common with those third person titles). Weapon crafting isn't as diverse as the pre-release ads claimed (shocking), but is fun enough to mess around with. The weapons themselves, along with the protagonist's various limbs and environmental hazards, are incredibly fun to use. It feels satisfyingly meaty to hack away at the undead. Avoids QTEs that feel out of place or shoehorned (they are occasionally there, but aren't particularly obtrusive) until one VERY dissapointing instance that detracts from the game at a crucial moment.The much-hyped night time is genuinely scary... The first few times. After you get an idea of the city's layout, and then level up substantially, even the big baddies don't pose much of a threat unless you aggro quite a few at once.Story is Lion King 2/Dances with Wolves/Avatar, where the protag works for bad people but has a change of heart and nobody playing the game gives a ♥♥♥♥ because they want to dropkick zombies into spikes. Characters who clearly are going to die will often die. Villain wants so desperately to be Vaas, but he just can't manage it. Pushing ""create"" on an un-edited space marine class in an MMO will give you a character with more personality than the God-awful (and fully voiced) protag.Worth a buy at 35 or lower, quite a bit more fun with friends.

												Without a doubt the best zombie game I've played, I was hesitant about buying it at first because of how redundant the zombie sub-genre of horror videogames has become, but this is actually one of the first games in a while that I could not put down once I started playing.The combat is brilliant and brutal - Guns are extremely powerful, as they should be, but will attract stronger zombies due to the loud noise, which is a great trade off. The melee system is great and weapons feel impactful and brutal, especially the heavier weapons like pickaxes.The parkour - The free running and climbing in the game works so well, usually in zombie games it feels like a boring slog getting from one place to another, but the parkour system is so fluid and well designed, especially when upgraded through the in game skill trees.The day/night cycle - One of my absolute favourite parts of this game, the game turns from a fun zombie hack and slash fest during the day, into a terrifying and intense hide and run game during the night, due to the extremely tough and fast monsters that only come out at night. You can sleep until daytime in safe zones, but if you do go out, your only hope of survival is to stick to the rooftops and if you are spotted, using a UV flashlight and flares to make your escape. You can also use a gun in an extremely desperate situation but it won't last long, because the loud noise attracts more monsters and they take a lot of damage, you will get overrun eventually if you stay in one place for too long. However, you earn double XP for staying out during the night. And this is on normal mode, if you play on nightmare difficulty, it's something else completely.Addictive as hell - scavenging and looting to find blueprints and new weapons/upgrades makes the game hard to put down, it's seriously addictive.Overall a really great game and one of the games that took me by surprise the most after I bought it, the story and characters are as good as you would expect from a zombie game though, so don't expect any groundbreaking writing or character depth, this game is just about the fun.

Wether you like playing co-op, or solo this game is a blast, just on the amount of side missions and weapons+customisations this game is worth a purcahse, throw the parkour into the mix and you just have a completly awesome experience but there you get to massacure zombies too,,,,just perfect.I plan to get the season pass for this simnply because what they also have coming sounds even more awesome :-) Buy it and dont forget.....Good night, Good luck!

												Very fun with many hours of great gameplay. although the story seems to be a little like the rest with the hero saving the day and killing a hell of a lot of zombies, the gameplay makes up for it immensly. The coop added just that more fun with a good plot twist. the side quest and leveling systems add fun to the game even after you have beaten it. would definently reccomend to anyone who just wants to have a blast			"

												If you are looking for a fun parkour/beat em up game this is for you. If you are used to great writing and storytelling ( aka spoilt by RPGs) then this is not for you, they basically checked off all the videogame cliches and tropes on the checklist.Story was unremarkable and some voice acting (apart from the Protagonist) was just bland.But overall good fun.

												A more polished and focused version of what Techland tried to do with Dead Island. A surprisingly well put together open-world game with a lot of moving parts, all of which add up to something pretty fun to play. It’s not going to blow your mind in terms of story, and it's mechanics are still rough in places, but Dying Light has enough meat on it's bones to make it enjoyable. The day night cycle, the crafting system, it's Mirrors Edge style parkour system and chaotic combat. If you like zombies or are in the market for a new open world game it's defiantly worth a look.

												TL;DR at the bottomDying Light is one of those games. It's one of those games that you know is cliched and built off of worn out ideas, but is so ♥♥♥♥ing fun and interesting in the way that it delivers itself, that you can't help but just binge on it for a week. Seriously though when I say cliched, I mean, have you played farcry 3? Yes? Well then you probably don't need to play dying light to understand what it's trying to do. Don't get me wrong the gameplay is great. Good enough that I, in the end, binged on it for a full week. The controls are tight, (except for ♥♥♥♥ing grappling enemies, or breaking their legs while sliding, like wtf i dont have 15 fingers) the parkour is good though at times frusterating like in the parkour challenges. But the controls, and the flow of the game is top notch. It speeds up quickly, with the teirs of weapons you find, and then slow down again because you one shot everything in your path eventually. The story itself, is your average zombie survival story. Some place is riddled with a disease that over the course of a week or something, a day maybe, turns its victims into hordes of infected brainless and vicious monsters that tear down anything that makes a sound or stands out (almost like social media today). And you, as the brave protagonist, have to fight your way through militias, and zombies to, in the end, figure out how to survive, meet your doom to an ankle biter or something, or cure the infection. To the games credit the characters and writing do make you want to tear your hair out sometimes, in a good way of course. Like when a character that you meet does something ♥♥♥♥ing stupid (Rahim) and your attatchment to that character actually affects you. Say for example one of the main characters die, throughout the story you grow attatched to that character based on their defined personality and meaning to their cause. The writing and characters are good, the gameplay is good. Overall the only thing that I had a problem with was pointing out little things in cutscenes that don't mean much, such as opening a train side door almost instantly, like it's nothing, then coming back shortly after to struggle like a infant forever fiddling with a baby proof door knob cover. It's just little things that make this game ever so slightly less of what it could be, which in my mind would be a flawless, yet still very cliched, fps zombie survival game. I highly reccomend it to anyone, despite its flaws, it is still very worth a play. TL;DR-It's a good game with little flaws, and I reccomend you get it!			"

												Good:- Awsome Gameplay (it's like Dead island + Mirrors edge)- Allot of content- We are getting more content than they originally told us that we would get- anywhere along the main storyline in singleplayer you are able to invite a friend to join you in your missions and keep on playing the whole storyline in coop.Less Good:- Story, feels like its missing something - Voice acting, pretty bad from time to timeBad:?Conclusion: There is nothing i would consider ""Bad"" with this game so ill just skip that part. Its worth the full price consindering the gameplay is awsome and we are getting more and more content, especially you got the season pass, because on the 9th of feb we are getting the Following! :D			"

												I loved this game! If you like Borderlands or the original Dead Island you will like this game. It's fun exploring, killing and crafting. The wrestling moves are also hysterical. When you play with friends and just drop kick zombies it is so funny. I loved it a lot. I'd definitely buy this game again. As of right now I'm just waiting for more expansive DLC or campaign/areas.			"

												Alone, and at first, this game is a horrifying experience. Being grabbed is almost certain death, and a direct encounter with a night zombie? Forget about it. You run as much as possible, with only a plank of wood to defend yourself. However, once you've stayed in Harran long enough you start to learn, and ultimately become a powerful survivor (granted you use your skills appropriately.) You learn to cloak yourself in zombie guts to hide in plain sight, or snap their unsuspecting necks.I'm not gonna spoil everything for you, but if you're wondering if this game is a Dead Island knockoff, it's not. :)It's a fresh installment to a world everyone is quite familiar with. Also, coop is a BLAST. It's never a bad thing to have a buddy watching your back.""Good night. And good luck.""			"

The story is still bad and the voice acthing sometimes meh... but not to the point where it takes away from the game.Zombie free-runing game is a perfect match. One of the best running machanics to date. Zombie AI is good, after a little while in the game and leveling you feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥ Night is scarey and dangerous. Chases are heart pumping.Gameplay is everything in this game... whether you fight, trap or run... it is always fun especially with a friends. Co-op and competative works amazingly.			"

												WOW!  I was presently surprised.8.5/10Once you get equiped to start really taking on the biters you will be in heaven.  Never has a game so perfectly captured my love for straight up drop kicking zombie faces off the top of buildings.  Oh man, I didn't want it to stop.I took a half a point away for the something around the end of the story mission.  I don't want to spoil it but it did spoil a lot for me.  It did not take away from the fact that I just spent 4 days binging on this game.  I just finished the story missions about an hour ago and was still running around slashing the heads off zombies with my super elictrified machete and looting police vans.I usually delete my games after they are finished and beat, but not this one.  I will most definitely recommend this game to others and I am book marking future DLCs.			"

												Let me start off by saying that, while I was disappointed in Dead Island not being what I had expected fromm all the stops the HyperTrain made, I did throughly enjoy it and Riptide both as light-hearted, open-world zombie killing games. Now, on the opposite side of that, Dying Light is exactly what I wanted Dead Island to be before I played it. The feeling of dread that even daytime can bring when you turn around the corner out of an alley and being confronted by a sudden horde of zombies is wonderful, and the chilling terror that night brings when you get caught out is something I can't get over.This game has been exactly what I wanted all along, from the simple and well made parkour and combat, to the deeper story, as predictable as it can be.10/10			"

The end of this game was the only let down, otherwise this game is overall fun.			"

												Definitely a fun zombie fps game. Satisfied my itch for the zombie game genre.Took about 16 hours to complete the main storyline (maybe less, I did do a sidequest or two), which is a nice amount for a storyline. It was on hard though, so I retried quite a few times and got one-shotted many of times (thanks, exploding zombies). However, I enjoyed the story to it and the open-ness of it all is really cool. It's like a first person AC game in terms of parkour mechanics.It's also spooky when you realize it's close to dark and you're far from a safe house, then dark hits and you haul♥♥♥♥♥only to be spotted and chased like no other.I recommend it.EDIT (2/15/2016):The Following is a great DLC, more like expansion pack. Adds so much more content to the game, definitely a great purchase.			"

												Dying Light is truly an enigma. There are so many large problems with the game that make it feel like progress completely halts. It's got a pretty questionable combat system, the main story is incredibly predictable, and it feels like a good portion of the game contains unfinished mechanics. I freaking love it.I've almost 100% the main game, and definitely plan to. I don't know if it's the skill trees, constantly urging me to continue playing, for just one more level. Or the actually decent parkour mechanics, beckoning me to frolick atop the rooftops, for just 5 minutes more. Maybe I'm still searching for the questgiver that just slowly sunk into the floor, like it was quicksand.I don't know what it is, but I love this game. I highly recommend giving it a shot, but perhaps walk in prepared for dissapointment.			"

												Finally a zombie game that allows a truly free roam experience. Ever played a zombie game and said to yourself ""In real life I would just hop on that car, or climb over that box, or step up onto that curb"" but the game doesn't allow you to? Well the creators of this game heard us and made a zombie game for us. The only negative thing I can think of is this game came out a little too late; the zombie craze has died down, but this game is very well done and deserves a try. My first time out at night running from the 'I am legend zombies' had me giddy and squealing like a girl. This game offers a truly horrifying experience but it allows you to gain experience and confidence later on in the game to take those night zombies on.8/10 Because the replayability isn't as gripping. Once you beat the game there is little to keep you playing.			"

												I just finished playing this game 2 weeks ago and I have to say this is a fantastic sequel to the disappointing Dead Island series. If Dead Island was actually good, it would be Dying Light. What DL does right is the gameplay, a open world parkour zombie game where you go where you choose and its instantly my favorite part of the game just exploring and fighting zombies and the night sections of the game is absolutely terrifying, forget fighting just run as fast as you can cause the zombies are practically invincible. And the graphics are fantastic and the game runs extremely smooth on AMD and i havent encountered too many FPS issues at all.There are many problems with the game, first off the story is dull and tries to be exactly like Far Cry 3 and hell they try to make there villain this new Vaas from FC3 but fails miserably. The story goes nowhere and is much more serious than previous DI installments which are wacky and completely stupid. Also the sidequests are pretty redundant too and the characters are so unlikeable.I personally like doing the sidequests just to find new loot and level up. And thats where the game truly shines in its addicting nature to find new and amazing weapons, get more money and upgrade your character to do some amazing parkour maneurs.  Out of 5 I would give this game a 3/5.			"

												I am not a fan of your average zombie killing games. However Dying Light is in my top 5 Favorite Games of All Time and Space. Not even joking.  The mechanics, the story, the characters, the heart wrenching and shattering happenings... It is absolutlely amazing.I won't make a pros and cons list because honestly the only true con I can even remotely think of, and I don't feel like it even counts, is after you get about 40-60% through the game, you can completely overpower your character and it makes the game easier. BUT That is your choice. You don't need to give your weapons special stats and additions to annihilate everything. The freerunning is awesome and pretty much lets you do anything and go anywhere. No predesigned paths or obvious ""climb rocks"" on buildings or mountains. It is so open. The zombies are fairly weak in groups of one or two, but if you turn a quick corner into about 20 of them... you better run or start hacking, hoping for the best. Then when the sun sets, the game changes. I won't say how but I wouldn't recommend casually walking the streets after 21:00.I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who likes the excitement and thrill of being in danger basically everywhere.  As a final note... Goodnight, and Good luck.			"

Also the storyline is deeply touching with occasional well-needed & -timed comic relief punctuating the tragedy, horror & sadism in post-outbreak Harran. Prepare to find yourself playing the game with authentic emotion-driven skill that you've never experienced surfacing in any other video game, as the main story will pull you in deeply and not let go until you've finished (and even then you'll find yourself going back to Harran time and again for side-quests and new content).

Overall amazing game except for relatively small secondary map. I would recommend this to anyone as long as they plan on playing with someone too. Sidenote: Easter eggs in this game are over the top, so far i have found the mario world, pvz, and destiny ones not sure whats left. Also the developer blueprints and weapons left in the game add that extra ridiculous decapitation boosting the appeal. Looking forward to the ability to add mods to this game already have some ideas. Anyways great game, nice, fun, relatively easy campaign with the exception of a few boss fights, tons of side quests, weapon combinations, skill trees etc. Buy this with friends.			"

												Very fun game! This is the only game I have played that made zombies not push-overs. (Until end game) This game has a good story, and very enjoyable! BUT, there is absolutely no end game... Hopefully DLC can fix that!After hardmode update:To me it seems zombies got weaker. On normal game+ mode it would take 2-3 hits to kill a zombie. At the start of hard+ mode I one shot everything. Hopefully it gets harder as I progress further (I am just after the fight pit mission.) It IS ""harder"" but still not very hard once you know what you're doing. If you are newish to the game it would probably be pretty difficult. I would still recomend this game.			"

												I had a ton of fun with this game. The stroyline was fine, but could have been better. However, I really enjoyed the protagonist's attitude and quirky comments throughout the storyline. Each side quest added more depth to the protagonist. For example: when a survivor asks you to perform a simple fetch quest for X amount, your character will typically state he wants more money due to the danger associated with such quest. This is a far cry from normal games where you never negotiate a higher finder's fee. The protagonist felt like a real character, with depth and attitude, unlike many games where the protagnist is a silent-type standing in for the player. This game has many ""little"" things that add together to create a genuinely interesting, fund, and terrifying experience. The night creatures are no joke; even at higher levels, I rarely could take them on by myself.The parkour running and killing of zombies was amazing! It's really hard to play any game similar to this (Far Cry series comes to mind) without the parkour style now. The game felt like it dragged a little too long, but probably due to the amount of time I spent running around and completing side quests. I would highly recommend this game. I paid full price, and when this game is discounted, you should pounce on it, like a ninja from above.			"

												As a AAA title this game truly has it all, but stay tuned for my annoyances.Firstly, I can't totally blame the makers of this game for their implementation of the RPG element as the following has existed in many titles of the like. I hate running errands (I'm talking to you Skyrim). This game starts with a series of errand running that is completely absurd and as a survival game - I would frankly let some of these people just die. In a survival situation you can't save everyone nor should you try.. that's probably my opinion alone and I'm okay with it.Secondly, I didn't find much incentive to follow many side-quests. In the early game most are too troublesome to endure and in the late game they don't seem to be worth the effort. Though a second play-through seems plausible in which I would probably side-quest more.This may be just me being initially bad at the game - but deaths can really set you back. Pro-tip: Don't Die.Also, some of the weapon crafting seems secondary at best. At one point you get a weapon so good that no matter much you craft - unless you've played through once - you won't bother with any other.With all of that said, this game is GREAT. I highly recommend it. Once you pass some of the initial and annoying quests you move into some fun, intense, and high-stress missions. At one point it tells you how to look back as fast and agile zombies run you down - I chose not to look - but my heart-rate definitely increased and boy was it fun. This game has a great potential for immersion once you get passed the potentially way-too-long-tutorial levels. The story has been great, and co-op as been nicely implemented.CO-OP: I've only had limited experience with multiplayer and it has been CO-OP. In co-op you join a friends game at the point where they are at - provided they have progressed to certain point. When someone picks a quest it doesn't start until both players are in the area and, in my experience (being far ahead of my friend), I got to have all of my late/end-game weapons in his early game missions. For me this made the experience great. Running through the previously hard missions chopping zombies in half (yes, in half) was a great experience.I have not played any other multiplayer modes yet - but once I do I will update this review.In conclusion, once you get passed some of the early game monotony this game really stands up and makes itself noticed. The graphics are top notch. The sound A+ and the story, once fleshed out, really holds up. I would recommend this - but maybe at no more then a 40 USD price point. On a side note related to price: Digital games should never cost as much as their physical counterparts. This feels like gouging.			"

												this is a briliant game, although lacking in storyline there are a ton of sidequests that are both fun and exciting to do, there are a multitude of different weapons to create and find and the skill tree is amazing for; power, agility and survivor and don't even get me started on how good and creative the free-running is. I would definitely recomend this game for anyone interested in free-running intence action and adventure and the thrill of stealthy night explorations.			"

												This game is full of win. Nicely balanced between story, side quests, crafting and other aspects.It is fluid and enjoyable. It is pretty and it can be ugly and scary. The way you have to literally look/hear over your shoulder in order to stay one step ahead is a masterpiece in suspense. I'm not talking about the *actual* ability to look over your shoulder in game - but the atmospheric presence the game draws you into.TEN / TEN			"

												Overall Rating: 9/10Gameplay: 9/10Where should I start, the parkour in this game for the most part is very smooth, it can be kind of glitchy in certain areas but for the most part very smooth. Combat is also very smooth, most weapons don't feel heavy and smashing the skull of a zombie is very oddly satisfying.Story: 7/10I won't spoil anything, but in general most of the story was pretty predictable, and the ending is just a quicktime event, I could make this longer but it would spoil a lot.Graphics: 10/10Overall really high quality and smooth, the textures really make you a lot more immersed, and can make the night time gameplay a lot more scary.DLC: 7/10In my opinion The Following is the only DLC worth purchasing, everything else are kind of skin packs and little arenas, The Following on the other hand adds so much content to the game and escalates the diffuculty but you get a lot better loot, even though it gets a lot of criticism for the map not being interesting and very little parkour, but you do get cars.

												This is what Dead Island should have been. Techland bested themselves in every way on Dying Light. The combat is better, movement is better, the world is better, the story is better, and there's loads of more content in Dying Light. The DLC policy for this game is fantastic as well, and Techland deserves praise for it. It's affordable, and in a lot of cases, free. There's even a legitimate expansion pack that adds a huge new world, a driving mechanic, and gives us more quality Dying Light goodness. That's rare these days.If you like zombies, this is a must play. One of the most underrated games of 2015.			"

												This game is overall super great. The graphics and main story are awesome! All characters are worked out and you are not left with any weird questions. I think this is one of the most ""realistic"" zombie games out there in my opinion. Completing the whole game took me and my friends around 25-30 hours, which in my opinion is wonderfull aswell. The DLC is must have, because it adds a splendid new story! There is one negative point, the game needs to be played with 2 people to be fun. The fun parts that happen in this game should be laughed at by friends. Ofcourse you can play the game solo, but I really think it adds more to the game if you play it with 2-4 friends! Further I recommend the game to everyone, it's a must have!			"

												Got the game for ~$25 USD This game was definitly worth the price I paid for it. I'm notoriously cheap so I usually only buy games on sale, so that definitly puts a bit of bias on my reviews.Normally, I'm not one to like zombie games, they're either way too hard, or way too easy. This game stuck a pretty good balance between the two, with the ability to change your difficulty if need be to adjust it. One of my only gripes is that once you play a bit, you'll begin to identify if a ""normal"" enemy is going to be annoying or not to deal with. IE: This guy is definitly going to take more hits than normal, just by appearances.This version of the game (The Following Enhanced) Contains the Season Pass DLC. It does not include several of the weapon/skin DLC's, but AFAIK the only one of those that matter are the Harran Ranger, as it gives you access to one of the best bows in the game early, without having to go through the Bozak Challenge to get it.

												This is a super fun game! Jumping and running around the big and open world, using your parkour skills to climb and slide makes the movement in Dying Light very easy and smooth. The combat isn't too bad, you learn more killing techniques as you progress through the Power skill tree. The story was decent enough to keep me playing, and the night phases totally made me poop a little.			"

Overall, I give it a 7/10...It was pretty dang fun for the somewhat short duration that it lasted.  The story wasn't memorable to me, as were many of the side quest.  Crafting is pretty fun, you can make some crazy stuff, just wish they had more for you to do with it.  In all there are two maps and about 19 hours of gameplay (for me at least, and I'm slow, so if you were rushing though I'd say it would take around 10-15 hours).  The two maps are decently satisfying... I spent the most of my time in the first (just because I found it far more enjoyable and diverse than the second) but they seemed small to me.  If you are a side quest junky this is a good game for you, unfortunately I am not; I just didn't find the side quests all that rewarding, other than completing the stories behind them, which as I previously stated were lack-luster.       The parquor is very fun, I really liked that part of the gameplay!  I saw some guy comparing it to Mirror's Edge (which unfortunately I've never played so I wouldn't know the comparisons) and Titanfall, which I thought was ridiculous because there are no similarities whatsoever between the parquor systems of Titanfall (a futuristic game w/ jetpacks and enhanced armor) and Dying Light (a more realistic system with some kinks).  One thing I didn't like apart from the parquor system was the grappling hook and the falling system; mainly because the crafting and the survival immerse you in the game and the parquor is so awesome and feels real until you suddenly pull out a grappling hook and you're flying accross the map like spiderman.  Another kink in the parquor system was the ""falling onto cars portion"", when you finaly scale the top of a radio tower and get that sense of vertigo from the extremely realistic surroundings and the shear height you've climbed... something like this happens and ruins the whole mood: 


YouTube™ Video: exactly how far can you fall onto a car in dying light?! 

			Views: 153		

			happened by accident the first time, so I decided to try it from a bit higher up and it still works, so I think you can officially say that you can fall from as far as you like onto a car roof and...		

(Sorry for the Ad, it is not my video) Other then those problems I really liked the parquor system and thought it was one of the key aspects of the game.  If you're not into parquor style games then this isn't a game for you.       Pricing wise I strongly encourage you to wait for this game to go on sale or wait to see what the DLC (PAID) will be like.  Even though I thought many aspects were fun, I felt just *slightly* ripped off in terms of content.  I would feel like a safer price for this game would be $40 and not $60.UPDATE: 08/14/2015 -- I have huge hype for this upcoming ""The Following"" DLC (Including a ""huge"" new map, vehicles, and more), I will update this review after it releases and I get some playtime on it.

												Dying Light has really set the bar for first-person survival horror and must be noted as one of the best games to come out this year.  While I can't speak too much for the online play, the hours I've put in have flown by in the single player alone.  In the beginning I had turned on a function that allowed online co-op, and a player by the name of ""Bush Ninja"" began playing alongside me.  I had forgotten this function was on.  This was very early, most likely fewer than 6 hours in, so my strongest weapons did between 30-50 damage and my inventory consisted of pipes, wrenches and police batons.Bush Ninja carried a flaming, electrofied Kheposh, a weapon I had never even heard of prior to Dying Light.  He asked me if I would like him to make me one.  Who would say no?The weapon had 721 damage, an orange rarity rating (the highest), and killed pretty much everything instantly.   At first I figured, well♥♥♥♥♥♥ is this going to break the game now?  Using such an overpowered weapon so early on?  You'd might think so at first, until you realize weapons will break beyond repair.  I used it often, then saved it only for emergenices, and eventually kept it in storage as a momento.  Bush Ninja was a time traveling ninja who bestowed the fruits of his labor to a lowly leveled DL noob.  Thanks Bush Ninja.  You made a lot of difficult moments easier in my earliest hours of playing.To summarize though, this game succeeds at:-Creating massive replay value-Building incredible atmosphere and immersion-A skill tree that rewards players with a better and more enjoyable gaming experience-Allowing creativity in it's completion of missions and challenges-Providing online co-op -Great parkour mechanics (I might add this tends to ruin other games with similar first-person open worlds)   And these are just what I've gathered from the single player.  The game's tagline ""Good night and good luck"" is pretty ironic considering how difficult it's been to not stay up all night playing.  More like ""good luck saying good night ever after playing our game mf.""The only con I can give now is it will eat up all of your time.  Regardless, I highly reccommended this to all FPS, survival horror, and open-world fans out there.			"

												Alone, and at first, this game is a horrifying experience. Being grabbed is almost certain death, and a direct encounter with a night zombie? Forget about it. You run as much as possible, with only a plank of wood to defend yourself. However, once you've stayed in Harran long enough you start to learn, and ultimately become a powerful survivor (granted you use your skills appropriately.) You learn to cloak yourself in zombie guts to hide in plain sight, or snap their unsuspecting necks.I'm not gonna spoil everything for you, but if you're wondering if this game is a Dead Island knockoff, it's not. :)It's a fresh installment to a world everyone is quite familiar with. Also, coop is a BLAST. It's never a bad thing to have a buddy watching your back.""Good night. And good luck.""			"

												Okay. Firstable this game is not worth 50$. I got mine for like 25$ or something and thats good price for this game. I hate to play it myself but with friends its great fun! But I think story mode was too short. It was very nice story and I enjoyed it but when it ended I was like ""Wtf the end?!?!"" So thats kinda dissapointing. One big bonus is the MAP! Its so freakin big and theres a lot of easter eggs and and fun stuff to do! And you also can custom this game with mods. You can download mods from nexusmods. I love that superkick xD But about dlc's...ehh...they are kinda overpriced like the game. You get 1 extra hour for like 5-15$... But my overall rating for this game is 7/10! If this game is selling for 20-30$ BUY IT and tell your friends to buy it too! +Big Map+Gr8 Fun+Easter eggs+Mods+Awesome Weapons+Gr8 Graphichs -/+ ITS NOT SCARY!-Glitches-Price^^			"

 Hello everyone! My name is SynificHD and I am a YouTuber who uploads many gameplay content, such as this game.This review will show my thoughts and opinions towards the game, also including a link to the game for you guys to check out and hopefully enjoy; and give you an insight of the game! A Dying Light Review The game ""Dying Light"" is a first-person survival horror, zombie apocalypse, where you play as a ""GRE agent"" who is to secure a file that includes secret data towards the outbreak. You uncover survivors who tell their story and have a meaning to their home Harran, and you are to help them by jumping, sliding and doing fancy maneuvers, before their very little lives come to an end.I recommend this game TRUELY to people who enjoy the satisfaction of slicing zombies up, and having an open-world map to run a muck; uncovering many weapons and mysteries.Gameplay Here for Reference ►

												UPDATE!!!! really my only gripe is the last fight is a quick time event... kind of a let down but w.e. very open ended ending leaving room for dlc or a sequel. still very fun, gripping storyline, and definitely going to run through it again. back to the original review, now.100% worth full price!simply the best game i've played in awhile, the only zombie game you purposefully run into a giant crowd of infected to vault yourself over them, fall on one of them to stun them, squash their brains out, and repeat. techland really out did themselves on this one, for me dead island was dead weight. shoddy story, predictable game elements from other 4 person co-op kill stuff games... but this, dying light is so much more polished and is so amazing and nearly perfect.at the time of writing i have 40 hours in and am 53% done with the main story, so awesomesauze. right now some fps issues are noted when getting grabbed by a biter or spat on by a toad, but that's really it. it crashed a few times cause i didn't lanch it from steam. have not yet tried any co-op or multiplayer modes, but i'll get there.

												There comes a time when you simply stop being so enthusiastic about a whole bunch of games, which are being released or already are out there. You simply cannot find it exciting anymore, all those continuous franchises... fast paced, scripted gameplay, recycled stories... all bleached out and without a soul. There's a bunch, and even if you haven't experienced some of those newer combinations of elements in aforementioned types... you simply don't care. You've seen it all.But then, once in a while, comes a game which wakes up that child in you again. This is that kind of game.All the segments which make it so refreshing and enjoyable construct a unique and a special combination. Combat and player flexibility, atmosphere which is primarily enriched by the beautiful graphics - is was sets it apart. Story in this game is just a side dish. So I won't go nitpicking around, finding what's wrong with it... there is always something, saturation comes inevitably... like with almost everything in life. It is not perfect... but it is best of its kind.This is the best zombie skull smasher, while dashing through the vast city, there is... and ever was.			"

												Such a great and intense game. I played with one of my friends and it was awesome. The main game and the DLC all rocked! The only problem,,, the ending for 'The Following DLC' sucked. There was a choice and both of them lead to the same ending so it was a disappointment especially after such a strong main campaign. The ending hit me hard since I loved, I mean loved the full game but I guess people don't know how to end good things. Anyhow I definitely recommend buying this game and playing the sh*t out of it!

												This game is incredibly fun and has tons to do so there is no possible way you can be bored. The freerunning experience, for me, was amazing and really in depth with how the mechanics ( the moves ) of Parkour in real life. As i am a Parkour and Freerunner enthusiast myself, when in multiplayer, the Parkour is really spot on. The whole experience is fantastic and i will be playing it over and over again. The only problem was that there isn't any PS4 and PC cross platform gameplay, whereas a friend of mine owns it on PS4 and we wanted to play together. Unfortunately, that was not possible, which was a little bit of a let down for such a perfect and practically flawless game. Anyway, the game is great, i would recommend buying it. Fantastic work!!

												Soooo, this game, HOLY CRAP, I haven't fully fallen in love with a game in years. One of the first to absolutely consume my time was mirrors edge on the xbox 360. This game is mirrors edge blended with an open world zombie survival scenario. This game does an incredible job of making you feel like you're an actual survivor and the side missions to just help survivors in Harran made me feel like i was actually a part of their community. I wasn;t just going to get meds or bandages for quest points but because MY people needed them. If I could help i would. The story line is full of intrigue and multiple twists and turns. Loved every minute of it so far but not out of the quarantine zone yet! Anyways all in all this game blends, survival in the form of combat, running, parkour, crafting, helping other survivors and trying to just not die. Cause ya... that happens more than i'd like to admit. Alot of the time from my horrible parkour skills and falling from high up. Also the volatiles and different types of zombies are badass. for the first 10-15 hours of gameplay i wouldn't leave safezones at night. First real game to fray my nerves in years while also making me feel like a badass running around the streets of Harran. Night running is now an amazingly satisfying experience! :D well that's my rambling on this AMAZING GAME! If you liked mirrors edge but wanna bash some zombie brains, get this game, you won't regret it.			"

												Dying light is a fun, amazing, and at some moments, scary game! If you have a good computer, I reccomend this game.Let's start off with the pros.If you liked Dead Island, Mirror's Edge, or both, this is the game for you. It's more of a combination between the two, with you smashing and slicing (and sometimes shooting) your way through thousands of zombies and special infected, or running from rooftop to rooftop trying not to die. It's a ton of joy and fun to go through all this.The one problem i did have with the game though is that it requires a GOOD COMPUTER unless you want to have horrible FPS. Throughout the game It feels like I've been playing half the speed in slow motion most of the time. Sure, It's fun to drop kick a zombie off the roof and watch him slowly fall to his death, but it's just straight up annoying at times.To conclude, Dying Light is a great combination of zombie parkour with dead island mechanics, and if you have a good PC, I totally and completely reccomend this game. If you dont, I might wait until you get a better one. Overall, I loved it!			"

												Let me just say, I wasn't expecting much out of this game to be quite honest, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The graphics are beautiful, for one thing.  Another thing I enjoy is that in this game--unlike most other zombie games--you don't start out this game immediately able to kill every zombie with ease, no, you are given crappy weapons that break quickly.  You do your best to avoid combat rather than bullrushing in and killing everything in sight.  At night is a complete different story, you run for your life to get to a safe house.  Night is when the spooky zombies come out to play.  You don't even have a tiny little speck of survival at night, either get to high ground or become zombie food.  I also enjoy the parkour in this game.  Your character can't jump super far either, so it's not like ""I can make that jump"", you MIGHT make that jump.  The AI in this game are kind of condescending, but that's to be expected.  They believe that you are ignorant to the current situation in Harran, so it makes sense that they explain certain things in detail.  One thing, idk if this is a bug or something with my pc itself, but every time I enter a cutscene at night time, the video just freezes for a solid 10 seconds or so.  The audio is fine, but the video is the problem.  If it's a bug, I hope it gets fixed because it's not too pleasant having that happen.Edit: I forgot to add my specs, they areZotac GeForce GTX 970 i5 Quad Core 4690K8 gb RAMEdit 2: Now any cutscene or time that a zombie grabs me my game freezes.All in all, this is quite a good game.  If you enjoyed (yes I'm going to say it) Dead Island, then you'll enjoy this game.			"

												I picked this game up for twenty bones during the exploration sale, I can say it was definitely worth that.  Sadly, I don't think I will shell out the money for the season pass since the multiplayer is broken for me.  Pros:Game feels good, and the story starts out pretty compelling.  I had a lot of fun at the beginning not knowing how the game world works and just running from building to building exploring.  I'm a sucker for light based games so I loved how they blended UV light and normal light together as monster deterrents.  Freerunning feels fluid and combat is exciting.  Cons:There's a point in the game where the story becomes very dull.  It's almost as if you can spot when they stopped caring about providing a compelling storyline.  My multiplayer is also broken, and many people also report the same.  I'm on Linux so maybe I condemned myself to bugs, but it really shouldn't disconnect me every time I try to connect.			"

												Dying Light doesn't stray far from the typical open-world zombie apocalypse game, you take side quests where you fetch things, kill things, blow up some stuff and then you have the main quest, which can be completed at your own pace. The game does not hold you to a schedule, so you can easily do whatever side quests you want and then do the main quests after leveling-up. I’m not sure if monsters level with you, the game did seem much easier when I was leveled-up.Dying Light is by the same people that made Dead Island so there will be some similarities, but Dying Light actually feels much more polished than the Dead Island games; it runs good, the graphics are nice, and the audio is very good. I played on an i7-950 with a GTX 970, I cranked all details except I ran shadows at one notch below max to keep the game above 60FPS.When completing the game, it said I had played for 40 hours; that is missing one side mission, missing some collectibles, needing to meet a few odd characters, and probably needing to complete most of the challenges (testing weapons, running courses).I enjoyed it.

												Easily one of the best FPS games I have ever played. You can tell Techland spent so much time making everything in this game solid from the moment you start. Everything about this game felt perfect, even the side missions all had substance and were far from repetitive (excluding time trials etc which I didn’t do). The protagonist was great, voice acting great, supporting characters. I can’t think of a single flaw with this game and I believe the devs didn't take any shortcuts. The music channeled that great feel from old 80s zombie movies and even had a touch of John Carpenters style. The free running was absolutely spot on and should be the basis that future free running FPS games get their inspiration from. Honestly any open world FPS game I play from this point on will feel like a step backwards if they don’t incorporate free running. All the options are there for PC gamers including a FOV slider, never experienced a single crash and the game ran butter smooth with just about everything maxed out on my 780 GTX. I waited for a sale before picking this game up but it is easily worth full price. I put 39 hours in this game and was going out of my way to pick up every side mission I could and I STILL wanted more. I know DI2 isn’t being developed by Techland but if they are holding this game back because “it doesn’t meet their standards” ala Hellraid, then by all means take your time and keep pumping out quality gaming like DL. BUY THIS GAME NOW. ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic!			"

												Note that I played through this entire game in co-op.I'm not a big zombie game guy but nowadays it's hard to get around them.This is one of the best out there though.  While Dead Island drew a lot of its inspiration from Borderlands, Dying Light drew the same amount of inspiration from Far Cry 3.It's basically an open world zombie game with parkour type mechanics for traversal.  It does the parkour very well.  Possibly the best of any game I've played.  You have skill trees with some skills that aid your parkour and other skills that aid combat.Combat starts off kind of difficult, then balances out, then becomes ridiculously easy.  I don't have an issue with this because the change is so gradual.  I felt like I achieved that power.  Plus it's great to be able to fight back against certain zombies that you didn't stand a chance against earlier in the game.Most of the quests are generic and NPCs all blend together, except for key story characters.  I don't really care about that, mainly because I played through the entire game in co-op.  The game was so fun to play for me, that repetitive quests were just another excuse for me to play in the sandbox.  But I imagine in single player it can get pretty tedious.Overall I'd say that if you have a friend to co-op with, this is definitely worth playing.  If you're playing alone, I hope you're into zombie games or you may be disappointed.			"

												Dying Light is one of those games that does many things right, and it is a whole lot of fun. Techland created a zombie game in the vein of Dead Island, with huge improvements, but without the campiness. The zombie world of Dying Light revolves around a great premise. The sidequests range from somewhat fun to damn cool. There are many different scenarios, and they are events and occurrences that would more than likely occur in a post-apocalyptic world. There are 44 side quests. While they may not be all worth doing, the player may be surprised by some of the adventures they bring. The parkour is fluid and connected, while building off on climbing and jumping mechanics that makes free-running exhilarating. It starts off slow, but once you get going on the agility skill tree, free-running is really fun. I highly recommend putting points in the fall damage mitigation, and forward roll. For instance, parkour/free-running has three stages of upgrades. You start off as a novice freerunner, and as you progress through the skill tree, you become more athletic, therefore, traversing the world faster with less stumbles. These all make for smooth controls that are very responsive, and it does not miss a beat. Fun times.You can also combine abilities from different skill trees to perform combos. For example, you can use ""vault"" on a zombie, followed by a ""drop attack"" for a satisfying combo finisher. If you are trying to connect Dead Island and DI: Riptide to this game, it probably shares in common some visual art design, melee combat, without the campiness. But the melee combat has been greatly improved. The melee combat is extremely satisfying.The gameplay is where Dying Light shines. Gunplay is so much better too. Throw in free-running abilities, the three skill trees, and gameplay is a blast. Dying Light sports the best melee/parkour combat to date.And while I feel the gameplay is the best part of the game, Dying Light does many other things right too. In another light, the ending was predictable, although it could have been handled differently. I would have liked to see a twist in the story. I feel like the premise of Dying Light could have served a multitude of story branches. A missed opportunity, indeed.It is one of those games that takes bits of concepts from other games like Mirror's Edge, Dead Island, Far Cry 3+4, and executes it well. It does not feel like you're playing those games per say, but it does remind you of them. If that makes any sense. It feels different, and more than enough to stand on its own. If you guys have a chance, give it a try. But if you choose to focus too much on its flaws, you will probably end up not liking it, and you will probably dislike it for the wrong reasons. I felt this way in the beginning, but this is one of those games that really grows on you. It is not amazing, but it has some spectacular moments.The visuals are up to par with modern games, atmospheric and immersive, slick and smooth controls--button mapping is great to accommodate for melee combat and free-running, extremely detailed game world, combined with satisfying melee combat complimented by three skill trees that enhance gameplay incredibly.The sound design is excellent, from the cries of a zombie from several yards away, to a great soundtrack (some 80s/90s music), There are many different zombie types--common, stronger common, special, and nighttime zombies all make for interesting enemy and A.I. During nighttime, some common zombies behave more aggressively, and the nighttime zombies like the Volatiles come out on patrol. Volatiles, like the more alert and aggressive common zombies, have a cone of vision that appears on the mini-map to show the player if they have been alerted. A eye icon appears over the actual zombie on screen if they have spotted you, and the icon fills up with a red color indicator to show if you are being pursued. The zombie A.I. is smart. Day-zombies may not be much of a threat as night-zombies, but day-zombies can be a threat in numbers. ""Free-runner"" zombies are former runners that turned into the infected. They move and run faster, and they can climb objects and structures, unlike their common zombie cousins. They are more aggressive and they relentlessly pursue you until you put them out of their misery. The physics is good, and it makes for some unintentional, hilarious moments. I highly recommend crafting and experimenting with every weapon, even if you feel like you will not like ""throwing weapons"" or ""trap bombs."" In this game, you're going to want to try everything. They're all fun to use, and they provide for cool gameplay scenarios you can come up with. Achievements in Dying Light are worth hunting, especially in co-op mode. Take a little time to read through them because they encourage you to experiment and try different things. I am glad I looked through them. Point being is, get creative. Use your imagination and try to do everything. Experiment.Nighttime is really intense because that's when the more hellish zombies come out and stalk you. You have probably read that other players have reported that the game does not feature real-time day and night cycles, and that is untrue. Early on in the game, there are a few story missions that introduce you to nighttime. I think this confused players. After you have completed those, day and nighttime cycle kicks in. Day lasts several hours, and nighttime only lasts for a very short time. And this occurs without story mission/side quests. You can fast-forward time by clicking on a bed (wait until night or morning), and go off on your adventure. However, I do take issue with the timer for nighttime. There could have been a setting to change how long nighttime lasted. Seven minutes isn't all that much, even though it can sometimes feel like ""forever"" with Volatiles chasing you across the city.There are mini-games spread throughout the world of Dying Light. These include ""challenges"" that you can participate in, like a free-running challenge, killing a specfic amount of the infected in the quarantine zone, or a challenge scenario where you need to kill 40 zombies within a limited amount of time. It sounds simple on paper, but these challenges can be pretty entertaining in spurts and especially with a co-op partner.Dying Light is one of those rare videogames that was designed thoughtfully. Single-player and co-op intertwine in harmony, and one mode does not hamper the other. After having played over 50 hours of Dying Light, I can genuinely say that this is one of the best single-player/co-op campaign games out there. With Invasion mode and nighttime adding a whole new dynamic to zombie-killing madness, gameplay is intensified and it brings fresh new gameplay that would have been missed had it not been included. It is one of the better games that have been released in recent years, and it definitely stands out from the crowd of new-gen games.9.0 out of 10. - Highly recommmended. - Huge improvement over Dead Island- Excellent and thoughtful single-player/co-op design- Extremely satisfying melee combat system- Great parkour that is fluid and highly responsive- Deep skill trees, and game mechanics like crafting and upgrades- Great visuals for an open-world game - Immersive and atmospheric- Cool characters- Solid writing for the most part, and good dialogue - Great premise- Many zombie types provide for dynamic gameplay - Excellent zombie A.I.- Innovative nighttime zombie gameplay- Excellent and responsive controls- Missed opportunities in plot twist- Ending was anti-climatic- Missed opportunities in potentially good scares- Main protagonist feels hollow- Most characters are forgettableCPU Intel Extreme Core i7 6950X Deca-Core 3.0GHz (3.5GHz TurboBoost)GPU Dual Dual 12GB NVIDIA Titan X64GB RAMOS: Windows 10 Professional Resolution: 4K			"

												This game is by far the most entertaining zombie game i've played in ages. Crafting system is great, and it has the Borderlands feel regarding loot so you just keep wanting to do ""One more run"". Story is well done and immersion is great.At first I played this game solo and did decent but then started joining other people's games and having them join mine. This brings the game to a whole new level. So much fun as a co-op multiplayer.I was afrid to stay up at night for the longest time. If you play this game with good quality headphones and the sound up, you'll understand why this game can be so scary, especially at night. Whenever i finish a session of an hour or more and take my headphones off, i'm hearing the screams still for awhile. Don't hesitate to buy this game, it's a ton of fun and you'll get many hours out of it.			"

												Robbing the dead has become my current mania. The graphics are beautiful. The game play is so smooth it almost takes the place of good beer. The seek and find for loot is great fun, and the better you get at running, jumping, climbing, the more fun it is to discover hidden places and hidden loot. I love the old-school Romero zombies. The music that pops up now and then is atmospheric; the sounds that pop up are frightening.  So take some time to kill zombies, loot them, and join the rest of us grave robbers.			"

												This game left me with a mixed bag of feelings.+ Free running / parkour was awesome, its great fun just roaming around with you grappling hook+ Main story line, i though it was pretty good, although a bit predictable.+ Weapons and their modifications, great fun slicing up Zs with a sword thats on fire.- Side quests... There is so many and they have nothing to do with the main story line. So boring.- Animations, they are pretty bad sometimes if your playing coop. (can be fun too)+/- Lack of true coop, this is a single player game that has got coop slapped upon it. If your playing Coop with friends, you are all just copies of the main character. (the last part of the game is single player only).This works, but not much more, its still better than being singleplayer only. Whacking zombies and competing to climb some tower can be really fun.

												When I first got this game I thought I'd wait a bit before reviewing to see what patching they'd do as performance is my main concern with games, it can be the best game ever but it's only as good as it runs.To begin with it wasn't good it wasn't bad; random fps drops, weird supersampling thing and so on but with some tweaks it was managable. But after a few patches it runs a lot smoother, definately increased fps, that's not to say it's perfect there's still some weird sh*t but it's good to see devs actually caring for a game after release. It, as usual, runs better on NVIDIA and intel than AMD stuff (my entire rig is AMD I can't afford intel/nvidia as much as I'd like it)Gameplay wise it's very fun, challenging to begin with, I couldn't kill more than 2 zombies at once. The skill system is nice but of course to be OP takes time. It's not as grindy as it could be because killing zombies never gets old and if you really want you can risk doing night activity but I wouldn't recommend this until you've upgraded health and stamina a bit, even then it's tricky to get right and dying causes you to lose the points you accumilated (this doesn't happen during missions, only when free roam). It is a bit of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ undoing a bit of progress but I'm not too sure how big of an impact it makes really. In terms of what skills are good, the finisher is so so handy throughout the game, I never used the throwing weapon one or half the crafting ones, or the double handed weapon ones (too slow for my liking). Do buy drop kick asap, it's the best thing in the game.The story is what you'd expect: go here, kill this, find this, ID him, find cure, help them, call them. It doesn't really matter to be honest, it's fun to play and sets things up well but it's hardly heavy rain... Also there's a couple of plot holes which are extremely obvious. Some including antizin but most of all interacting with people in a side mission that have already been killed in the story. Again, doesn't matter too much because Dying Light didn't try for that 'girl falling out of window, look it's emotional' trailer from Dead Island feel (I know it's the same people).They just released dev tools which should also bring a new experience, challenges and so on. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens.Basically if you played dead island, it's a bit like that in the smashy smashy kind of way but a lot better in every other way.  "

												Polish software house Techland took everything they learned from making Dead Island - a somewhat decent, but overall mediocre proof of concept for an open world zombie title - and they used it to produce this real masterwork of a video game.In Dying Light, they've crafted a world that feels truly devastated, threatening, and filled with characters who are remarkably human. A first-person ""Mirror's Edge"" style movement system encourages you to whisk your way over fences and jump across rooftops while ogling the crowds of zombies occupying the streets below. Vicious enemies, eye-popping scenery, and an 80’s documentary-style electronic music soundtrack lend for a perfectly tense flavor of atmosphere that both oppresses you and beckons you to explore its nooks and crannies at the same time. A proper day/night cycle will instill a pavlovian urge in you to find the nearest safehouse every time you watch the sun go down, lest you think you can weather out the brutality of the darkness (and when it’s dark out, a whole new breed of powerful enemies will manifest, ready to shred you apart the moment they spot you).I also can’t forget to mention the combat. It’s deliciously juicy. Your melee weapons allow you to slice and dice enemies with visceral impact, lopping off heads, limbs, and sometimes splitting their torsos outright in half, while hearing every splat, gurgle, and crunch in astounding aural detail. Smash their heads in with your foot, or kick them off of rooftops and watch their corpses go tumbling to the ground like a sack of potatoes. There are dozens of different ways you can craft weapons using the objects in your environment and it’s immensely satisfying to see the end result.Dying Light is one of the more well-designed open world games I’ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing. It’s clear the developers put a lot of love and thought into it. Would strongly recommend.			"

												Best zombie game i have ever played yet. Game itself has everything players needs.Campaign maps (Slums, Old Town) - 9.5, Really awesome parkour maps, with realistic houses, furniture etc.Campaign story - 8, Starts from very interesting story, but does not have full conclusion.The Following DLC map (Countryside) - 10, I can't even believe how much game developers worked to make this giant awesome map, twice as big as Slums and Old Town together, and Buggy and it's upgrades are too awesome fitting the map!The Following DLC story - 6.5, Starts kinda weirdly, and ending is really frustrating, but most missions are still awesome.Game overall: 9.8, Has everything you need! Best zombie game you can ever play.			"

												This game is like being in a zombie movie, from the great looks (the city is gorgeous, they realy captured that apocalyptic feeling and it's fun just to explore, many intresting details to be discovered and that's just me wading through the slums, haven't gotten from the slums yet) to the creepy italian zombie movie style type music. The story so far has been nice and some of the side quests are fun too, the one with books is really funny. Funny main character too and some really evil antagonists. Only flaw this far is that you need a good graphics card to really enjoy the game. Well worth the money.			"

												Best zombie game I've played in years. Lots of fun if you like this genre. The ambiance it creates, especially at night, is just incredible in my opinion. Zombies + Parkour = MUST PLAY. Only real dowsides is that missions can get repetitive, and I feel this game gets a lot of its feel from the FarCry series, which, although not necessarily a bad thing, does male it feel a bit unimagined. I'm about 30 hours into it, about 70% story completion. Unless the rest is just one huge qte sequence, I'm gonna say you cannot go wrong with this game.			"

												Right so, this game quite complex and long winded for what goes on.I think I should start to adrress the control of the game, their not easy to get on with to start off! If your coming from Assessins Creed Frachise or Brink or any kind of the free running is done for you, that kind of game play, your going to hate this to start. The main misstions are good and well organised and realy intresting and where you want to spend most of your time, but  the side misstions are long and kind feel like they get in the way... though some are fun and some are not. The free run challenges may look fun but the time limts are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ if you don't complete it in the time you fail and have to restart, I gave up after 3 attemps because the devlopers think that begginers would ever play this game clearly by the set times that are given, this let the game down a lot for me, this game been out for ages and seems like as if the devlopers have talord the game (for publish) towards people who played the beta or have good understanding of the controls work even on the easy challeneges, considering the first freerun challenege bar was set so high, out of 26 cheackpoints I got 18, it not easy to keep up. So my point is for bigginers, the bar is set far to high, this is something Techland should work on to allow people to enjoy the game at the start, the bigging should be easy and regarless of how badly you mess up, you should be able to still win.Though the game is decorated and wondfuly colourd compared to DI serise (even that was good for the time) and the game seems to work well and does what you want for the most part, been time where you dont want to climb but the ladders their and you jump up and your like the dam ladders right their!I feel this revirew been very negitive, probley because of it big ego and high bar setting for others.Overall the story good 8/10. controlls 4/10 after some time 7/10, layout of map and general suroundings 9/10 (Techland, its great and the following is better), Main Misstions 7/10, side misstions 4/10 to long mostly and to much jumping though hopes. All in all a good 7/10 for the hole game, considering it not talord that well, but looks are wonderfull supports their big ego or bar settings.			"

												This game is akin to 'free running' games like Mirror's edge mixed with Far Cry.The free-running and climbing is excellent and good fun. The combat has a steep learning curve, and can be a bit clunky, but does get easier as you go (especially when you get guns, though they just attract more zombies). Mostly, you'll be running away.Graphics are the best I've seen, akin to Witcher 3, and so inspired me to go buy a 1070 GTX. The sound is amazing, but the moaning of the zombies gets old fast. Quests are typical: deliver this thing to some guy, or go find a thing and fix it. Wish they'd been a bit more creative. Overall, great game tho. Worth it just for the visuals. Amazing. 8/10			"

[Get it on sale - 50% or more. Get a full pack with all DLC]It started so well, but then it just peaked out and flatlined. Don't get me wrong, there is fun to be had here, but it's more in adrenaline doses than anything else. See, the game has an inherent level of catharsis to it, so it's hardly a surprise that slaughtering zombies is a novel idea. In fact, slaughtering anything in games is generally satisfying, especially when in hordes.However, don't expect Dead Rising levels of carnage, as the zombies here are a tad more diverse. The developers desided to go with the super slow zombies by day, super fast zombies by night, and the somewhere in the middle climbing zombies that spawn when you make too much noise. This, initially forces you to play very conservatively, as a few of those special zombos can quickly overpower your greenhorn♥♥♥♥♥♥ However as you progress in levels, and get better and better gear, it starts taking less and less hits to chop off a zombie head. That's when you start going from a zombie survivor to a zombie hunter. At that point, two distinct gameplay styles emerge. The daytime style is that if a king of the jungle. As the alpha male in the city, there is no creature that can challenge you, you simply decapitate everything that comes along your path. At nighttime however, things quickly change, as you no longer find yourself the predator at the top of the food chain, you'll be forced to save yourself by utilizing all your skills and equipment to escape from the clutches of death. Assuming you don't become prey, you'll get a solid boost of xp. This makes you actively seek being spotted, in order to capitalize on that sweet xp at dusk.Unfortunately none of this will last you for long. Despite the parkour system being one of the best I've ever seen in a first person game, it becomes obsolete as you progress through the levels. Once you get a grapling hook, scaling buildings becomes a pointless endeavor, since the hook is both faster and more convenient. It is so ridiculous not even batman would be allowed to use it. It's more like a reverse Scorpion ""get over here"" instead of a grappling hook. In fact, that's exactly what it is. Anyway, the point here is that at this stage, the game becomes incredibly boring. You have plenty of equipment and flares to escape night pursiut in a matter of seconds. You are basically an uncatchable prey at that stage. During daylight, you might as well be called Tarzan, because nothing can challenge you. Except the challenges, where said hook is disabled (the deves knew they broke their game, but still left it in).Things only go downhil from there, once you hit damage numbers of 500 and up, anything in your hand becomes an instagib weapon. You soon find the zombies being more of a nuisance than a problem. In fact, you will most likely only engage with them to pick an exposed police van's trunk to get some sweet weapons. Though that bit is also made pointless, since you can simply cover yourself in zombie guts and just go for a nice relaxing walk along the hordes of the dead.Speaking of weapons, there are some strange choices the devs have made regarding that. This game has the most useless, and pretty much insulting Bow mechanics I've seen in any game. Thief 2 had better bow mechanics. Thief ONE had better mechanics. But I digress. While the bow is certainly weird in that I can spit further than the arrows fly, it's at the very least useful for the fat guys. What I don't understand is how could they make explosives so useless. You have tomahawk throwing axes that behead zombies like levitating lawnmowers, but the highest grade bait grenade (think pipe bomb from L4D2) can't even kill the lowest of zombies. There is such a distinct parralel betwen L4D and this, that it has to be mentioned. Whereas in L4D there is a massive horde of zombies that get shredded by 1 item, the very same (mechanically) counterpart in Dying Light struggles to produce a respectable explosion or deal even a moderate amount of damage.At the other end of the spectrum, we have guns. These things are incredibely powerful, makes you think how the military lost the city in the first place. You can literally mow down hordes and hordes of zombies and henchmen with 1 magazine and an assault rifle.At any rate, despite these pretty much useless weapons, your arsenal still grows rather powerful over the course of the game. You soon become more interested of the night-time. You devise your own little traps for your hunters, slowly evolving from prey to predator. There isn't a point in the game where you can totally establish your dominance as the ""Can't touch me"" top of the food chain master slayer, but you do come pretty close to it. You really have to try to make the game challenging.Now obviously there are other difficulties, however with higher difficulties also comes better gear which deals ridiculous damage. And while the night is almost always a risk, given enough time and levels ups, even the highest difficuly will prove to be little challenge. To be fair though, if you play co-op, you have to play it on the harder settings, otherwise it's just a roflstomp. It feels nice when your friend has to watch your back while you pick a lock, not only for convenience, but because you can't just murder everything in a flash and then leisurely go about your business. At least not untill your reach legendary levels.The story is forgettable, cliche and bland. You will most likely end up disliking both the protagonist and the antagonist. At least I found both of them to be braindead. Maybe it's the zombie virus that got them, maybe the writing sucked, we'll never know.All in all the game becomes boring and pointless once you enter godmode. Look forward to flying over everything, jumping over zombies, rolling off some serious height drops with 0 damage and basically setting up your own challenges, mostly at night. Ultimately, this is a survival sandbox game that sufferes from the Far Cry syndrome. It quickly (or slowly, depending on difficuly) and infallibly turns from a ""save yoursel"" to ""find your own fun"". And when that happens in a game, I stop playing it, because I believe it's the game's job, more importantly the developer's job, to entertain me, not make me find my own entertainment. If that was the case, I'd be watching a movie.Despite my harshness, I will give this game a thumbs up, because it does provide a healthy initial dose of fun, especially in co-op. Just don't go in expecting the game to stick to you like The Witcher for example.			"

												Dying Light is everything that the Dead Island games should have been in the first place.  Just goes to show that the developers are only doing what they're told really.  Dead Island was published under Deep Silver and Dying Light was published under Warner Bros. Dying Light is a very open-world zombie game.  The size and scope of the city they drop you in is enormous, especially considering there is no fast-travel or vehicles, you're on foot for this game friends.  I really liked that they kept fast travel and vehicles out of this game, it really would have ruined it, and you can certainly tell they catered the game to people who were going to explore and spend a lot of time roaming around the city, going through the houses and finding all the crafting items they can.The crafting system in this game is nearly exactly the same as Dead Island, which isn't bad, there are few complaints there from me.The combat system is nice, but has a few flaws.  The only major one is that when a zombie is rushing you to grab and bite you, you are forced into a button-mashing sequence to get the zombie off, regardless of what you were doing when it lunged at you (you can be crouched, sliding, etc...).  Which gets quite frustrating.  Otherwise, the combat of the game was nicely done really.The movement mechanics are exactly what they need to be for a parkour game such as this.  You are easily able to run around the rooftops and slide under obstacles, kicking zombies along the way.  You have realistic jumping and running capabilities, and there isn't anything in the game that is too outlandish regarding the way you run, jump and generally get around Harran.The story of this game is really good.  It gets you invested in the characters and gets you to actually want to play the missions and learn how it all ends.  But this is where I'll add that the ending is bittersweet (as the achievement is titled).  It doesn't go back and revisit some of the characters, or have much closure, and really leaves a nice open gap for DLC or a sequel to fill, which is fine, as long as they fill it eventually.The graphics are great, but even modern hardware in the mid-end desktop spectrum may have a little trouble with this on high quality, or even medium.  The particle effects (smoke, fire, toxic gas effects, flies and so on) cause some very noticeable frame drops, even on a i5-4690K and a GTX 960 4GB.The variety in the types of zombies is really nice and very well thought out.  There is the cliched types though.  The normal zombies, the running/fast zombies, the big, hefty zombies, the ones that spit nasty crap at you, the ones that are elusive and mutated, the crazy scary ones that only come out at night and the giant big one that runs you over and throws cars.I will say though, there are challenges in this game, and most of them were poorly planned and executed and provide for a very annoying time trying to complete.  There is no way to restart the challenge once in it except for dying, and you have to hear the dialog before the challenge every time you restart.  Not to mention some of them are ridiculously difficult for some reason.There are also a TON of easter eggs to experience, though, from all sorts of references, which I found to be a lot of fun to find.Overall though, this is a very well developed game, and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of playing it to completion, and look forward to any kind of continuation of the story.  I feel no regret in giving this game a 9/10.			"
