												Okay, so, Champions Online. I'm just gonna ramble about this, because I can't be bothered being neat and succinct with it. TL;DR: Game's dead.EDIT: Yes, I have a lot of hours clocked on this game. I basically use this title as a more populated version of Paragon Chat. I log in, I screw around or roleplay for a bit, then log off. I rarely, if ever, actually use this software as an actual video game. It's a chat client at this point. I've been at this game since 2011, and I'd wager 2/3rds of that playtime was just me being AFK or RP'ing.  (Now Onto the Point...)Most people will say that the character creator is the highlight of this game -- and they'd be right. The character creator is one of the highest points this game achieves, and it achieves it in style....However, don't expect to make anything particularly awesome without first dropping real cash on this thing. Costume sets are quite overpriced, too, sometimes requiring the user to spend up to $10 for a single set (mind you, each set doesn't contain that many costume pieces to begin with). Being under the F2P model, you can expect the game to nickel and dime you, but ever since the takeover from Perfect World Entertainment, they've really gone overboard with the microtransactions, all while the devs have simply stopped caring about the game as a whole.There's no ambition to be had; anything cool you see upon booting up the game was very likely put there years ago, when the game was in its prime, under the guidance of developers with the drive to make a legitimately good game. The ambition once had by the development team has since dwindled to nothing. As a result, content is largely stagnant. Most of the new content is half-♥♥♥♥♥ shlock they expect you to pay top dollar for, and anything that's halfway decent is shuttered away behind a lockbox which is essentially a big gamble that you have to pay $1 a pop to open -- and believe me, it may not sound like much, but that will add up quick. Beyond the diseased, sickly cash cow Perfect World reduced this game to, it's also not that amazing as a game in itself. Sure, the gameplay can be deceptively nice at first, and may even feel like it has great variety -- and in some aspects, it does. But like everything in this game, it seems to only get worse as time goes on, and you'll find yourself fighting the same classes of reskinned, repurposed bad guys over and over again, doing the same types of objectives passing off as something more interesting, all while running around in relatively uninteresting, mundane locales that only have the passing resemblance to something with inspiration put into them.You can also largely forget about questing, because an expansion introduced a while back basically made it redundant to do so. Instead of adventuring through the game and leveling your character up through time, dedication, and some approximation of hard work, you can instead just queue yourself up for one of the many ""alerts"" in the game that takes you and four other players to a self-contained instance to fight a boss and get an easy XP or monetary reward. Rinse, repeat, ad nauseam.The graphics themselves can be summed up in one word: ""Meh"". They're not bad, but they're not exactly that great, either. On high settings, the visuals can look crisp and well-defined, with pleasing particle effects scattered about to whet your appetite. But the keen eye will notice that the art design is all over the place. This game has a BIG problem with artistic cohesion: you'll often find high-poly models with highly detailed textures in one place, and as little as five feet away will run into a very low-poly, blurry-textured mess of a model right next to it. It can't decide if it wants to look like a PS3 game or a PS2 game, and can be very distracting.Furthermore, the actual work put into the environments is lazy at best. There's misaligned and missing textures all over the place, spots where you can see straight through the level, and even simply disgusting corner-cutting measures that one can only assume the developers thought nobody would notice, such as entire buildings being misplaced and left out in the middle of the street, or pieces of level geometry hanging a full meter away from where they're supposed to be placed. The community is also quite lackluster. The overall population of the game is low at best, so I don't know where they're getting this ""thousands of heroes"" figure from on the bullet points. Maybe Cryptic means in terms of individual characters created and stored in the database, not even taking into account whether they're still active or not. Anywho, the PvP community is - as you'd expect - largely full of pompous blowhards that gloat over their ability to break this game's move sets or exploit some failure of the lackadaisical developers. On the other hand, the roleplay community is largely full of ERP'ers looking to get a quick fix off similarly horny players, all while roaming the one populated RP zone in scantily clad, large-chested women. In terms of the general ""I'm just here to level"" player, I can't really complain there. They usually don't say much unless they want to sell an item in zone, or party up to do an alert.All in all, I'd say avoid this one, unless you REALLY want to make some characters, like being begged by desperate devs to spend cash, or don't have much else better to do, such is the case for me....Oh yeah, and the game's kind of broken, too:

												Some years ago I would have (and did) recommend this game to people. It was fun, allows for some ridiculous levels of customization on one's character, and had a relatively decent leveling experience. Unfortunately nowadays I can't really give it much positive merit. Instead of working hard to release actual new content and deliver on a promise to raise the level cap and give us new content with an expansion, the developers instead pulled the rug out from us by revamping some systems to tie into their in-game store, completely ruined the leveling experience from what it used to be, removed crafting in favor of something that tries to get you to spend real money, and added a few other things that cost real money. All they do now is just half-heartedly produce a new vehicle or costume piece once in a while with pointless fanfare. There's no real incentive to level one's character through dedication and hard work anymore. Just idle in the city center and queue for the new ""Alerts"" (dungeons) until you can't stand it anymore. There's little effort that's been put into making these alerts consistent in terms of balance, structure, and bugtesting, and it really shows.Customer service is abysmal and it feels like it's been outsourced to people who are only there to earn a paycheck and nothing more. If you have a problem, tough cookies. You'll most likely get a canned-ham response attempting to tell you in a roundabout way that policy states you just have to deal with it. The developers rarely communicate with the players except to try to put together some sort of meaningless community event once in a blue moon. Their lack of interaction with players and the direction the game went really shows that there is zero passion for making and keeping this as a quality game anymore. There's no real reason to pay for a subscription, the ONLY incentive being that you get some coins for the in-game store every month, it unlocks a bit of costumes and content that's otherwise behind a paywall, and you get unlimited access to freeform builds.If you are coming into this expecting an awesome superhero MMORPG that you go out and fight bad guys on and save the world, prepare for disappointment. You're better off playing DC Universe Online or paying a subscription to play something that's actually worth it and with a diverse and active community such as WoW or FFXIV.If you like playing a free superhero paper doll simulator and like coming up with ridiculous or cool costume and power concepts, then this might be right up your alley. Just don't expect much in the realm of actual gameplay.			"

												Do you like massive customization? are you always coming up with characters, and stories in your head? or maybe you like superheroes, and think it could be cool to create your own, then take on the bad guys?if so, give this game a shot. I've been playing around 3 years so far, always had a blast. although the game's seen some neglect lately by the developers, theres a new dev team on the job now, and they seem to be on the ball.also, subscribers can not only completely customize how their hero looks, they dont need to choose a class either. instead it's build your own hero using any powers and skills you please. sound good? then try it. because I at least think its awesome.

												Maybe if you'd asked me a few years ago I could have reccommended you try out this game as while it had a rocky start and was somewhat buggy its really started to see an improvement around the time they introduced Vibora Bay and the story arc missions...However that all changed when PWE took over and content took a steep nosedive off a skyscraper while tied to an anvil.These days its hard to not make an overpowered hero that can blow through all content and this is coming from someone most may veiw as a 'filthy casual' player. What challanging content that was in the game has been nerfed into a joke and thanks to the alert system most can't even realy connect with what lore and interesting villians the game has beyond the ones that pop up to be beaten down in the alerts. I'd be surprised if most newer players that reach cap even know about any of the actual dungeons you had to unlock like Telios Tower.Pretty much PWE has rendered most previous and interesting content obsolete and the only thing Champions has going for it anymore is its extensive character customisation, which would be great if it wasn't all held behind paywalls.And as a lifetimer from launch it saddens me to see the state of what could have been such a great superhero MMO and makes me miss City of Heroes all the more /em torch			"

												After playing the game for 300+ hours and having a really fun time with a few really awesome characters, my main character was deleted without warning because he looked too much like megaman, and was named rockyman (like Rockman the Jap name for Megaman). --- This was before they put in the TOS that you couldn't have character look-alikes owned by other companies.After which I opened a support ticket only to get my Lifetime status removed and my other two characters deleted for literally no reason other than i had a single character that looked like megaman, and was named Rockyman.

												The game used to be amazing - probably one of the best MMOs of all time - but when PWE bought Cryptic and took over, they turned this game into a literal cash-grab scam. It can hardly even be called a game anymore. I stopped playing it shortly after that (sometime in 2011), and when I Iast checked in on the game (2015 or so), they had added literally zero new content outside of their cash shop - which is of course based on buying gamble-boxes and hoping you get something. Half of the loot drops in the game require you to spend money to actually use them. On top of that, many of the things that were a challenge and made the game fun have been removed. I stopped playing when they removed a majority of the unique loot drops from the end-game bosses, thus removing most of the motivation to kill them, but since then it has gotten even worse.One of the most badass things in the game was taking on world bosses, that were designed to be fought by 20+ players (and for the average player, 20 would sometimes not be enough) with a group of 2-5 friends (or even solo) by using carefully constructed builds and lots of skill. When I last played, I used some pre-made free character and was able to solo the former hardest boss in the game with almost no effort. All of the effort, strategy, and skill required to be a top-tier player in the game, which was more than any other MMO to date: gone. It's now just an endless grind that virtually requires you to pay money to accomplish anything. What PWE did to this game is nothing short of a tragedy, and they should not be given one ♥♥♥♥ing cent. Ever.I'm sure this new expansion that popped up on my Steam page is trash too without needing to play it, because PWE has proven that that is the only thing they are capable of producing.			"

												This was one of my favourite MMORPGs simply because of the extensive amount of customization.  You could make pretty much anything, whatever powers you basically wished, and change the colours of these powers (as well as animations) in many cases.  I enjoyed this game for a very long time, still have a longing to return...However, my experiences with the customer support was completely atrocious.  To explain, I had a subscription to Champions and, as with many MMORPGs I played, would unsub when I wasn't going to play much that month or if I hadn't played in a bit.  Let me clarify beforehand that I only unsubbed from Champions this once, this one time, and only did I return and want to play Champions again did my story start.I initially had unsubbed as I was busy with other things and games.  Months go by and I am suddenly noticing a charge on my account that I'm unable to track down, so I begin to do some inevstigation.  It turns out when I unsubbed from Champions, although I received a confirmation of doing so in my email, they still charged me.  It took me about a year to notice that they had still be charging me monthly actually, and when I contacted their customer service/support they fought tooth and nail in their own defense.It was mostly a finger pointing game of who dun it, but it was made to be as if it were my fault entirely on either end.  I was very clear and concise, however the people I spoke with were extremely unprofessional, accusative, and insanely defensive.  Basically, it was insisted that since it took me so long to notice they were basically stealing from me, it was my fault and they'd do absolutely zilch to compensate.Only after I had shown the email with the exact date and time of my cancellation did they cease trying to give me the run around.  I convinced them to reimburse me for half of what they charged me over that time, but they had tried to convince me to take less than a third of that, in addition to offering me a free month or two of subscription (hah, THANKS.)  I figured that was as much as I was going to get at this point after the customer service/support hooligan I was dealing with not only got my account information wrong regularly, but also threatened to ""permanently remove me from gold membership.""  Now, if you are unfamiliar with Champions and gold membership, it is a permanent subscription in a one-time fee.  It costs $300 and I'd actually known several in-game friends who'd invested in it.  The fact of the matter is that I never bought gold membership in the first place... and had I, that would mean I'd not have to pay a subscription in the first place.  Funny, that.Please be very, very careful with these people.  The game is wonderful, but watch your bank like a hawk.			"

												Alright, I've played this game far too much to not have written my honest opinion on it. BASIC SUMMARY: You are a superhero who's conveinently arrived to the world in times of crisis, and you (naturally) use your powers to help the general populace and occasionally assist the ""Champions"" themselves against greater threats.Pro's:Supermassive customization system; everything from tights and capes to having a lizard-face, tail and double-jointed legs.You can throw anyTHING at people, provided you have the strength to pick it up. Freight (Cargo) containers included.A wide and diverse variety of powers that you can choose from*, with many actually well-balanced ""Archetypes"", or pre-build powers to choose from as well. See cons for ""*""Tons of references to other sources when you pay attention.Maybe the game is just made of references?The ability to essentially create even the story behind your hero (Where'd they come from? Why do they fight for the common good? Etc...)You can create... your own rival! Your Nemesis will actually even be the cause of multiple missions.You can skip the tutorial and get right into the main world after your first character that isIn-depth tutorial and tooltips for newbies, provided they choose to do them.A diverse amount of areas that you can choose to explore (You don't have to leave a zone if you don't want to, there's generally higher level foes & quests available somewhere)Wide variety of unlockables. If you see an NPC using something, you can get it!But, this game does, sadly, have it's problemsCon's:Though you can skip right out of the tutorial, you always have to do the same starting set of missions every single time, and there's not much getting out of them. It can get a bit stale if you do it too often.Can get VERY grind-y! A lot of the good-quality items can take an extensive amount of materials to actually obtain, and potentially days or weeks to acquire. (This is true however for many MMO's, though, serously)MANY things are locked if you're not a Subscriber (Gold member). Free-form builds, where you pick your powerset, are only playable if you either subscribe or drop $50 into the game just for that. Many Archetypes are locked without Gold as well. (Total of 9 classes availible right at the get-go, which is few compared to the grand scheme of things.)Game has quite a bit of noticable bugs (But most of them are hilarious, like backflipping at hilarious speeds.)Nemesis system feels a bit tagged-on, just to say they have it.I think I covered just about everything. There are times when I can't stop playing and will get hooked for a week, but then, you can actually set this game down for a time and come back to it again later.			"

												Champions Online... where to begin with this one? Probably with a bit of history, for your personal culture. On the 28th September 2006, Microsoft Game Studios and Cryptic Studios announced a brand new multiplayer game for the Xbox 360 known as Marvel Universe Online. The only thing we can all Google about this project is a short teaser with an epic music that shows actually nothing revelant about the game itself but it was here... until the 11th February 2008 when Marvel decided to cancel everything without explaination.Ending with an almost completed game in their hands, Cryptic Studios didn't really want to lose this investment although they lost the Marvel licence for publication. So they played it smart : just looking for another super-heroic universe, they found a table-top roleplaying game called Champions created by George MacDonald, Steve Peterson, Bruce Harlick and Ray Greer in 1981. It was more or less the same thing as Marvel and DC so they exploited this newly acquired licence to quickly rebuild their game, renaming it Champions Online at the same time.Fact is, when you look at Champions' lore it seems quite dark, mature like DC because when we think Marvel many people instantly remember Spider Man, Deadpool and other cheerful characters. The best example for this argument could be the fact that one vigilante from Champions (named Nighthawk) looks shockingly like Batman from DC, and we can even find some kind of Joker in characters like Black Harlequin or Jack Fool... but that's probably me being nitpicky over the cell-shading technology employed in this game, while the feeling of the characters and places seem darker than that?Anyway, back to the game itself! I would recommand Champions Online for one thing mainly : near limitless character creation and customisation. If you've played City of Heroes before, you see what I mean instantly, it should be the spark that will ignite your wild imagination. For the new players who never got the chance to play this game (now lost because NCSoft have decided to shut it down, mostly to capitalise on the Guild Wars franchise) just give it a try, considering that it's free to play and nothing there will force you to open your wallet just to enjoy the game entirely... unlike what Electronic Arts have done with the ""free"" to play model of Star Wars The Old Republic.Indeed, the gameplay is repetitive, even tedious sometimes considering that all you'll do is punching or shooting bad guys over and over again, just to level up, complete a mission, get a rare loot, gain Questionite or obtain the Mods you're looking for. But then we could argue over the fact that it's ""essential"" to any massively multiplayer online roleplaying game : Everquest, Ultima Online, Lineage, Dark Age of Camelot, Perfect World International, World of Warcraft, Allods Online, Aion, Tera... none of them has avoided that part. Even Firefall (quite an interesting MMO third-person shooter) couldn't dodge the bullet, but the game is still fun nonetheless.One thing I personally appreciate nowadays with Champions Online is that you can get everything for free. Really, no trap there but you'll need to invest a bit of yourself and your free time into it if you want to gain something. Remember this Questionite I mentioned quickly earlier? If you get enough of it, you can trade it on the in-game Market for Zen points, and said currency can be used to purchase things in the Zen Store such as costume packs, travel powers, new Archetypes to play with and (for the absolute zealot or masochist) even the mighty Freeform Slot.But what is a Freeform you may ask? Simple : it's a character who has access to all the powers available to players in the game, and can combine them as they see fit. Of course, many veterans will claim that ""Freeform > Archetypes"" but believe me when I claim that I've seen some horribly designed Freeform characters and even made my own mistakes when I first tried. A Freeform character is only extremely powerful if you intent to design it this way, and some Archetypes can still beat you if the player knows what he / she's doing. You could try for example to challenge Fleur@Augusti to a duel : this guy plays a Blade Archetype, and has probably taken down more Freeform in a month than myself in a year.To conclude : this game has potential, and it's absolutely free as long as you want it to be. You can spend your money if you want to reward Cryptic Studios (and the newly created Cryptic North) for the few improvements they brought to the game, or you can start farming the Questionite if you happen to be some kind of grumpy Uncle Scrooge because one single Zen point is worth 225 to 250 Refined Questionite Ores on the Market. It's definitely not a ground-breaking game that will strike your mind as astonishingly beautiful, original or even just flawless... but some people may see there an Eldorado where the player can become King if they find the energy to climb their way to the top, while some artists would find a tool to unleash their creativity and try out their ideas.

												Just in case, I started to play when it turned into Free-to-Play. I don't have the experiences with anything before that time either. This is my self explanations and the whole experiences I got during the time I played this game. (Yes, over 5k hours)When I started out, the game got recently into free-to-play. From me, it was great!  I got into the game, got a hard time to choose my very first archetype (Free build for Free players) and the customization of my very first character, which I finally made a kinda ""Lizardman fighter tank"" looking for the Tank build (The Behemoth). Back in time, we had 2 primary stats for our character builds. When I played it out, Free Players, on PvP, could do at least to go Toe-to-toe with the subscribed players, which they are Freeform build (making their own powers,etc.) As for the crafting, I do remember the old system, where you needed to gather materials to craft your equipments. It was grindy, but in the end, it worthed it. And if you wanted to continue to do your researches for the crafting, you needed to go to a special location for each branch you wanted to do!Maybe 1 year later, I went to the lifetime myself, thinking to support the game, like many others too! Then... they started to make one the mistakes I still am not happy with it: The Patch that it changed the whole system: The Champions Online ON ALERT. I was quite neutral with the stuff that it changed that we needed 3 Primary stats, but it was more focused to try to create some ""balances"" beyond superpower builds. The problem is, that system greatly degenerated about how it was. Instead of you need to focus on two stats and that you needed a teammate to help you out (MMO everyone! not MSO (Massive Singleplayer Online)), they did clearly put that everyone can solo MOSTLY ALL the contents without any other players (Except Therakiel Temple and I don't count the alerts, see below). So yes, a full team instance can be soloes without any problems now! Where is the MMO feeling in that?As written in my brackets. We got the Constant farming with the Alerts. The Alerts are instances that they constantly change after a set of time, doing some rotations in fact. The idea at first was quite innovative at first, but it was simply mind grinding them for getting free XP and leveling faster, most of the time. Otherwise, you can do those for gaining Money or Mods (new crafting system). But since most people do Experiences alerts mostly, mainly none does the two others. There is also another type of alert which you do gain another type of ressources that it is called Questionites. It is used for buying stuff in the store for free! How cool is that! But here's the catchy thing: There is also a Questionite / Zen exchange which you can get Zen (currency from Perfect World by using real money into virtual money) by exchanging your questionites. But the Zen currency are coming from OTHER PLAYERS! So if you want Zen by exchanging your questionites, you should check what the other players has to offer to you IF they want to exchange it. I mean, the Lifetimers get Zen for free each month, so they can do that in the game freely without any problems. If we take another game from Cryptic Studio, for example Neverwinter, there is no such thing in the game! So you can't get Zen for free except if you want to pay on your own with your money from your wallet.Anyway, I could return another disaprovement if we look toward the Crafting system, right now. Since we changed into 3 primary stats, the old items are not good anymore, so we needed to make our gear to be changed. The materials we used before are now useless. We need to get a Certain mod which it will improve our stats. As simple as that You can do that under 1 specific place. Do you remember when I said that you needed to go to another place to continue your crafting? Those places are no more around. There was a hole with some lights going out near a Prison in the City where you could enter to get into a specific crafting lab. Now you can't! They removed it. I was not happy when I noticed this. Heck, we were able to enter in a library before. But instead of re-opening the library, they made a Door, standing out of nowhere, front of that door, to let us go to a place of an ancient crafting instance: THAT HOLE near the prison, completly at the opposite of the city!Then we have the famous PvP. The game never been too balance, I must say. The reality is that the PvP is really dead. I don't mean those who enjoys the Duels and such. I am rather more focused the PvP instance, where you do gain Points to get PvP gears too, along with PvP costumes! No one enters in those instances anymore. No one cares about those PvP. Mostly everyone prefer hitting each others in a duel, which it doesn't gives any pvp points. Since the duels are there, 1 vs 1, the Dev made a Team duel during one of the updates, no one wants to do that anyway. So what's the point if the players don't care anymore?Seriously, I could add much more with my disapointment of the game of its state (My list would go on and such, no kidding), right now, but if I could make a favor for Cryptic Studio, I would say this one:""Please, remake the game fully. This game is on the verge of being dropped down into the abyss. If you want to see it shiny, I would suggest to make a new one and maybe, just maybe, listen to the players  to those who have a idea to fix all the problems from it. You are too focused on trying to get this game as a money sink. Do like you did for the character editor: Get Creative, dammit!""I know this isn't much, but to those who read my review, I supported the game fully. But I do feel, since a while, that this game really need a kick in the butt to get up, once again.			"

												Stupid Company gouges players and leaves game on life support while luring in stupid people who throw stupid amounts of money for stupid expensive costume peices.Forget playing if you aren't subbed. Might as well bend over and give them your money if you want to be able to do anything.Stupid game. Made by people who don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about quality or fun.FYI the RP community is pretty ♥♥♥♥ too.			"

												It's a tough call as to whether to recommend this game, because if you miss City of Heroes as much as I do, this is really your only option. The problem is that it was taken over by Perfect World Entertainment, who is notorious for buying decent-but-struggling games and then running them into the ground. This is the case here. No real development in years. No real new content. Very little new art. Mostly just gamble boxes and regurgitated assets on the cash shop. Every system introduced over the past few years has basically just shuffled existing content around, was launched unfinished, and then never fleshed out. And every update introduces new bugs, which are rarely fixed. Balance passes? Oh, you mean nerfs. Yeah they have those.TL;DRIf you give this a shot, be prepared to feel disappointed about nearly every aspect of it. Their business model is not based on improving and enhancing the game. It's about doing as little as they can get away with, and getting as much money from you as they can before you inevitably leave in disgust.PWE is where games with potential go to die.LockboxesFor the love of god, don't blow your money on boxes (well, the RMT keys required to open them). I'd say like 9 out of every 10 costumes, auras, powers, etc. I've ever bought with real money (or even in-game grind currency), I've been disappointed with -- ranging from ""mildly let down"" to ""it just doesn't work at all"". Every time someone gets a rare from a lockbox it gets broadcasted to everyone else. No way to turn it off. So you see the same 5-10 whales spamming dozens of rewards (like 2-3 per second, just filling your screen). The drop rate on this stuff is very low, so this means one of the following things: 1. That person bought literally thousands of dollars of boxes and is somehow opening them at a rate of about 50 per second. Or,2. That person is being given a higher drop rate than others because they are a frequent big spender.Open the boxes yourself and you'll find that you can easily go through 20 without getting a single rare. But these folks who just jackpotted 10 of them will now sell them on the AH for in-game money. They have so many that no one can compete with their prices. And they have so much money that they can buy out others' and flip them for more. So they basically own the economy.Crowd ControlEnemies have ridiculous levels of CC. If you're melee, you spend 90% of combat being knocked back, knocked down, stunned, rooted, slowed, and having your powers toggled off (sometimes all at the same time) by even the trash mobs. Then when you run back to the fight, those trash mobs get blasted 100 meters across the map by some other player, so you have to run more to catch up to them. By the time you do, they're either dead or blasting you across the map again. Hope your character's origin involved an accident with a pinball machine.There are fights where you're up against 3 bosses at once, who all chain-spam knockbacks and stuns. You have no control over your character as it gets stunned and thrown around like a ragdoll until it dies. If that sounds fun to you, then you're in luck. Because the devs think that's the definition of fun.Alerts (Group Finder Missions)Some of the worst group experiences I can remember in over 15 years of MMOs have been in this game. From people AFK leeching in instances, to leaving their team behind to run ahead and activate a cutscene (just so they can be first, or appear in the scene), to pulling the entire map and then threat-wiping... Some of it is stupidity, some is just pathetic griefing. Whatever the case, Alerts are now the main way of leveling and they are a friggin' nightmare for the most part.BugsWhere to even start. There are thousands of bugs, many present since launch, many more added all the time. You read the notes and see that they haven't fixed anything. Then you log in and discover a new bug that they created by messing with something that wasn't bugged. Then the next patch they might fix that bug, but that's the only thing they fixed. So after 2 patches the net amount of fixes they did is zero. That's if they didn't break anything new. Which they did.Bug ReportsClicking ""Report Bug"" in-game just crashes the game. Reports on the forum (polite, well-written reports) are never acknowledged, and often just get silently and repeatedly deleted. I don't know how to interpret this other than ""abandon all hope that we will ever fix anything, and refrain from inspiring such hope in others"". The Shame of ItIt's not that the core game loop isn't fun. It's that what little they do is always half-baked, broken, grindy, and nerfed into impotence. Never finished. Never fixed. And each iteration is more oriented to spending cash. Things that used to be achievable in-game get removed and placed behind a pay wall. Greedy to the point of hostility. These guys are at the bottom of a long spiral to failure, and it would take a miracle to bring them back.			"

												Pre-F2PI started playing this game in Beta way before it was on Steam and it was awesome! On launch day, they completely revamped the gameplay and turned it into a mess. There were some terrible bugs (abusing teleport in PVP, including tp'ing out of roots). The game at this point also rebalanced which didn't make you feel like a super hero anymore. Before that, I seem to remember that the group boss in the trash mobs was a threat but the underlings were just cannon fodder, however after launch, they were all threatening, making trash mobs more annoying than anything. The worst part however was that you must have ranged power sets. Melee characters were gimped in PVE and especially PVP compared to ranged characters.Post F2PI tried the game out. Had to get rid of some of my old characters so I could play again to give it a try because I was over my slot allotment. Game hadn't changed since Pre-F2P, except now you couldn't customize powers for your heroes unless you paid. Instead you had to select pre-made archetypes. PVP by this point was better, though range still ruled, even F2P archetypes were competative. Also teleport had be rebalanced so it wasn't the other required travel power to always get anymore.Without customizing to some cool ways for your own unique hero it felt kind of bland.By CoH standards with admittedly some rose tinted glasses stands out in my mind as a better game.Current StateI feel a bit bad because I won't give this game another chance. It has always been a waste of my time whenever I've tried to get back into it. I can only imagine that PWE added more microtransactions and not a lot of content because that was what was happening after PWE first took over CO. I wouldn't be surprised if very little of the game world story arc changed.The only redeeming thing about CO has really been its ad-hoc public missions, where something crazy is going on in the instances and players must band together, though some of these were under-whelming. Random events like giant robots invading the city was spectacular though I'd imagine after a few months even these may become stale unless new angles change up the events.To get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of CO, you should get a dedicated friend where you play together.

												It was a great game even after it went free to play, for a very long time. However a (now old) update took away about 99% of the cool stuff from character creation and locked it behind paywalls, so if you want to build the cool hero you always imagined, prepare to pay hard unless you want Adam West's Pijama Batman. I would have recommended Champions Online years ago, but not a chance now.			"

												With the sheer number of MMORPG's on the market, it's importnat to make sure you find on that fits. Champions Online will fill that role for some people better than othersThe GOOD- Roleplayer's paradise! You can be ANYTHING you can imagine and the lore is set up in such a way that it can make sense. Not to mention the shear number of choices for costumes... The character creator is mind bogglingly open.Time traveller? Sure. Monkey with swords for hands? Go crazy! Wizard from an alternate reality? You could probably start a club. The RP community is very active and it's easy to find partners, even if you don't know anyone.- Very easy learning curve. Not only does the game show you everything you need to know to play, but the community is actually quite good. Every community has it's bad apples, but this one is mostly friendly.- Freeform System. You may be noticing that many of the good points are about customization. The skill setup is no different. The freeform class option lets you build a custom class. This means choosing your own stats and even which skills you use. You have to pay for this though. Otherwise you can use a wide selection of premade classess. They are pretty good though.- Free to play. While there are limitations for free players, which I will discuss below, they do not include anything that prevents you from maxing out. You get two slots for characters for free and you can complete the content all the way to max level.- Full Controller Support. Yes, you read that correctly. You can simply plug in an Xbox controller and play. The controls are not amazing, but it is posible to play most of the game without using your keyboard for anything but messages. It's a great addition for those of us that prefer a controller.The Meh- Graphics, story and sounds are nothing to write home about. I mean, the game looks and sounds great, but there is nothing new going on here. The style leans towards cartoons and comics, which works well for the setting.The Bad- To really get the most out of your account, you're gonna wanna subscribe. You get 6 more slots, a bunch of classes and access to the freeform system. Plus, the number of costume parts you have access to jumps up alot. Having said that, you got hundreds of parts to start with so it's not really NEEDED unless you really want to get into it.- Questing and combat are repettive. It's mostly fetch X or kill Y amount of guys. It's not difficult, just repetetive. - Roleplayers can be kinda sleezy. Whle there is LOTS of legitamate RP in this game, there is also alot of questionable people. ERP (Erotic Role Play) is rampant. Luckily, it is a rule that this not be done in public so you will likly only deal with these people when turning them down. Still, it's worth noting that for younger players it can lead to some innapropriate and possibly illegal interactions.SummaryIf you're looking for a groundbreaking game with advanced gameplay, take a pass on this one. However if you're okay with a lighthearted romp as a superhero then give it a try. After all, it's free so what's to loose? If you're a Roleplayer though... DO IT. This game is basically made for you. Jump in and fulfill all your awesome character fantasies. (The legal ones I mean.)			"

												Champions Online was one of my favorite MMOs, period. I spent hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours in this game, mostly playing with other players like one should in an mmo. I don't actually play there anymore, but felt the game deserved at least an honest review from someone who spent and enjoyed so much time in it. Keep in mind my opinion may be a bit bias because of this, but know I'll be trying to be as fair as possible as a reviewer. The game has a MASSIVE focus on character customization that puts others in its genre to shame (and I've played plenty of them, trust me). You will spend a good half hour or more messing around with the look of your first character before you actually get into the game. And the best part is you can change it at any time. The appearance of your character is completely cosmetic and unrelated to your character's actual equipment, so you don't have to spend hours and hours and hours trying to find gear that you like the look of. It's already there for you at any time. There are so many options revolving around the appearance of your character and whatever they're wearing, that it's worth trying out alone just to see and believe. The game oozes content, has fun and engaging pvp, cool superpowers, and a lot of lore to help get you immersed in the universe. Combat in general feels like it has impact or effect. The world is very detailed and varied with multiple, large areas (such as the city, the canadian wilderness, undersea, etc.) with plentiful dungeons, bosses, and monster variation to boot. My favorite battles were the ones with epic bosses (yes, the game has those) that didn't require a 30-man group to slay so much as a competent, small party. And I know some people may not understand where I'm coming from, but I'm not a fan of games that force you to grind to level 80-100 to get the end-game. The level cap on this game is (last time I checked) level 40, which is fairly easy to get to within a reasonable amount of time when compared to other mmos. So if you're worried about this being a grindy game, don't worry, the trip is shorter than others.The game did have problems though. For one thing, the quests are fairly generic. Which is forgiveable, given the date this game was released, but it's not going to astound you with its structure. Pretty standard stuff; kill ten of these guys or go get three of these items, etc. This made the pve element of the game fairly boring unfortunately. The A.I in the game occassionally had something new to throw, but again, do not expect mind-blowing A.I to regroup or use successive abilities in perfect synchronization on you or anything like that (boss fights vary). There's also a -really- painful lack of character development for your hero. It's not like Star Wars the Old Republic where you're making decisions that have an impact on your alignment or anything; everything is set in stone. You can not play a villain, only a hero, which may dissapoint or even turn away some fans of hero mmos. I completely understand as I often wish there was a villain faction to fight the hero faction in the open world. You do get a nemesis at some point, which is essentially an npc villain you make, but that's about it. I personally found it a dissapointing feature, as you're only ever going to see that npc when you get randomly attacked by minions of it and get a quest-item drop to go into a dungeon or see your nemesis during alerts (which are essentially quick-action dungeons or game modes with random party members). The music was great sometimes, but unfortunately had a looping issue which made the game very quiet. The fighting animations, while cool to look at when executed properly, did seem unpolished at times (if you ever played Warhammer Online, you'll have a general idea of what I'm talking about). The voice acting is also inconsistent and either hit or miss.Finally, the free-to-play model that I have mixed feelings about. After I went gold, I simply couldn't go back to silver out of my need for freeform building (which essentially allows you to  structure your abilities as well as color them however you like), and need for more customization options, which does come with it. When it came to pvp, subscribers dominated as freeform allows for some insanely powerful builds that just aren't available to free players. Even though there's a que for pvp for non-freeforms, it still cuts off free players from a massive portion of the community and makes que times much longer. There were times when the free-to-play model worked though. You could buy exclusive outfits, consumeables, travel powers (yes, there's more than just flying and running), hideouts, boosts, and more in the cash shop. None of these were required to really succede at the game, but instead offered either conveinance or added to it. There was some really cool cosmetic stuff in it that was reasonably priced (most of it anyway), and felt like a good exchange to keep the game going.If I had any suggestions to improve the game in its current state, the main one would be to stop dividing the player population between subscribers and non-subscribers by removing the gold status requirement for freeform (can still keep some power types locked off for non-subscribers). It makes the game feel pay-to-win and just made me irritated getting locked off from my freeform character until I dished out another monthly payment. Also implement a supergroup v.s supergroup (guilds) element so that players can battle it out in the streets whenever their supergroups desire.I know I complained a lot in this little review, but trust me when I say the game is worth taking a look at. It's far from perfect, but has solid combat, plenty of content, MASSIVE customization, and a pretty decent community (from my experience at least). Game gets a 7/10 from me, despite the fact it may be a bit out of date. Go ahead and try this game out if you're even remotely interested in playing a superhero mmo that actually makes you FEEL super. You got nothing to lose.			"

												I was a lifetime subscriber since launch, paid the $299. Took a few years off and decided to try it out again. It was nice back then and I'd like to see what's new. Recently when I tried to log in, it's demanding that I submit a one-time authentication code to log in. I waited and waited but no authentication code sent to my email. None in the spam folder.Today  I have yet to receive the code and there's no response from customer service. What's the point of playing this game if they put up so many roadblocks along the way?TL;DR Even with my correct User ID and Password the game still thinks it's not me and won't let me play the game I spent $299 on in 2009.

												I've been playing this game for five years.( The thousand or so hours I have on steam pales to the amount of actual time I've played.)  It's still one of the best games I've ever played. If nothing else, for the wide array of character powers custimization clothing, sliders and all that other fun stuff. The game plays solid, and they recently started giving regular updates again. The real shine to me is the RP community. There's always people to RP with on, letting you take your Superhero to a more immersive level. The ERP'rs are a bit of a pain, but easily ignorable. If you like superheroes and custimization, this game is amazing.I have over 50 characters, over 30 at the level cap, and I still find myself wanting to make more and try new powers and combinations. This games freeform really shines and personally, I find it worth it to go gold. However, You can play without paying a dime and still enjoy all the content on the game with the only limitations being your amount of custimization.overall, this game is still a ten in my book.

tl;dr is at the bottomMy hours in Steam do not reflect my hours in this game. I'd say double or triple it.Gameplay is...irrelevant, honestly. You'll want this for the character creator, which is still prety damn impressive, especially now considering that there are MMOs that have come out in the last four years that can't match it. Although at least 1/2 of the costume choices are behind a paywall, there's still an incredible amount of flexibility.The cartoony aesthetic may be not a good fit for some people.So, I guess I should talk about gameplay. It's functional. Nothing really new if you've played an MMO in the last decade or so. Free accounts have to choose a class (about 3/4's of the classes are behind a paywall) paid sub gives you all the classes and the ability to make a free-form class, which is much less exciting than it sounds.Combat is bog-standard. Tab-lock enemies, use moves from the taskbar, balance use of healing items, dodge area-specific attacks, figure out your classes' role.The crafting system was gutted entirely years ago, and is now completely pointless.End game content is all raids, PVP is entirely dead. Population goes from about 1,000-1,500 at peak times to the lowest I personally have seen, just over 100 on the entire game. If you're max level you're probably going to spend most of your time doing the same three solo missions over and over or competing in the constant costume contests being run by people who've been in the game so long that their fashion sense is like Joel Schumacher looking through a kaleidoscope.The cash shop sells EVERYTHING. Vehicles, classes, travel powers, costumes, ambient lighting effects, EXP boosts, resource boosts, items to level you up, I mean everything. They'd sell organs and child slaves if they could make a buck off of it. The cash shop is the thing I hate about this game the most.The developers keep adding in end-game content and additional pay classes, but I honestly think the only reason it still exists is because the cash shop makes enough money to cover it.You can tell they stopped caring a while ago. It's the best superhero MMO that exists currently, but considering the competition, that doesn't say much. I loved this game when it came out, but now it's almost like a bitter mockery of what it once was.tl;dr I love this game, but it is dying. Try it for a sense of superhero action, briefly, but I can't recommend it because of the ever present cash shop and low population.			"

												CO was a very large part of my life for years as my hours can attest to.  I made quite a few friends that I'm still in contact with to this day. The players were awesome, and the gameplay was fun too. The community was vibrant and the RP was fan-freaking-tastic. However the devs stopped releasing content for whatever reason, probably to focus on Star Trek Online or whatever. The last big release was the On Alert patch which completely changed the crafting system, added mods and new equipment to the game, and added instances called alerts which are basically queued raids with teams of five.There is one thing that CO is unmatched with, at least to my knowledge and that is character customization. The amount of costume pieces and the ability to customize is literally the best I've ever seen. You can create basically anything you want in terms of looks. My main char was a draconic hybrid who could transform into a dragon and eat yo face!! Also, gear is completely independent from your costume which is awesome if you don't want to look like a dumb*ss until end game stuff becomes available. And no stupid dye packs either, enter the tailor and change the color of your outfits, period.That being said, the game freaking sucks now. Devs stopped releasing any good content and instead started nerfing all of  the powers.  A player was hired to the dev team which was a horrendous mistake, as she basically destroyed powersets. I spent hundreds of hours perfecting my builds only to have them completely destroyed because of nerfs. So frustrating.Also, the community is a skeleton to what it use to be, mostly because of the lack of content. There used to be thousands of players, now it's down to maybe 300. Hardly anyone plays anymore and trying to find people to farm lairs is almost impossible. The alert system is used to farm money and exp so running the quests is basically pointless now. Just stand around and tailor your char until an alert pops and join. Leachers stand in the alert raids and let higher levels do all the work then they cash in on the exp at the end. That's pretty much the game. The RP community tripped and fell flat on its face. It's furry erp and AIDS now, so it isn't worth it anymore. Sigh. Such an amazing game with unlimited amounts of potential squandered. If you haven't played it, then it's worth a shot. However Silver players don't get near the amount of stuff that Gold players get so you will be limited unless you sub.My time in CO will always be remembered as being one of the best times in gaming that I've ever experienced even though it ended badly. With that being said, I can't recommend now because of what the game has become. Developers NEED to learn from CO though and incorporate the customization system into future MMOs.			"

Don't get me wrong, it's fun for a bit, but most of the really.. Good(?) content is towards the end of the game.I'm just gonna list of personal pros and cons.Pros:+Great costume creator, character customization doesn't come from gear.+Most of the free Pre-Set archetypes will probably match your play style in at least some way.+Great end-game content+Fun up to about level 15 before endgameCons:-Poor community likes to whine about everything-Beginning and middle portions of the game are just outright boring-The entire costume creator isn't unlocked until level 10 ""The level ten thing only applies to the very first characterSome thing or another they added to not ""Over-whelm"" new players with the high number of costume choices."" ~Bread-tan-The game feels extremely grindy and basic-The PvP community is full of, for lack of a better word, circlejerkers-The RP community is decent at best-Is part of a dying genre (RIP Superhero MMO's)Not everyone is going to agree with what I have to say here, and some people might have things they'd like to add. I'm a friendly guy so I'll take criticism and whatnot. If you for some reason want to add me in-game, I'm @narfball. I hope I at least helped sway your opinion one way or the other. Thanks.			"

Even thou the F2P options are rather limiting, the game is enjoyable, as long as you relize it can be quite grindy and grind is the only thing for max level characters to do.If you like grindy MMOs, it's worth playing.

												I wanted to give this game an honest chance, I wanted it to be good, but when I actually got in the game and tried to get going, it was like dragging my feet through mud, but I pushed on, and persevered until I could get some ""Questonite"" in order to see how the exchange rate to get Zen was (outside of paying for it, which for what they're charging, is twice the price I feel it should be.) I pushed really hard, died alot and persevered through a mission that paid out in 500 questonite. I took that to see the conversion rate in the auction, and the amount of zen that was within what I could afford with that was 1-10. So in order to even unlock at least one of the classes I would have preferred to play, or even an extra character slot, it would mean I would have to do something like that mission at least 100 more times.The pricing strategy for their store is bloated and unreasonable, a new hero spec shouldn't cost the amount they're charging, much less have a price that's literally just over the amount you even get from the $10 pack in order to squeeze that much more from their consumers.

												This game had a lot of potential.  I played all the way back into late alpha testing, when some of the forum goers were allowed to join the tests.  It was a great game back then.  The problem was, that the part of the community that yelled the loudest, always got their way.  ""The squeaky wheel gets the oil.""  Well, the truth was, that if 15 people said something one way, and 3 said it another way, but those 3 kept ranting and raving while the 15 said ""forget this, these people are just flaming everyone"" then the 3 got their way.  Strange, but true.So, the game got hammered with stupid changes that made the average player unable to play at all.  This gave the game a bad start, but those things got fixed.  Over time, the bad start took it's toll financially, and Cryptic Studios had to switch publishers.  The new publisher, Perfect World Entertainment, is notorious for the garbage they make.  What's more, is regardless of what the devs may say, it's pretty obvious that the direction of the game changed pretty fast.  More half-nude women, lockboxes, pay to win style upgrades and boosts, and more made their way into the game.  Currently, the most powerful opponent the players can face is Gravitar, a women that epitomizes both the ditz and the... female dog... in every way they can.  That means that instead of someone like Dr. Destroyer, we get a sexual icon for a villain now.  This is just the tip of the iceberg, but it's one of many reasons why this game has gone down the drain.If you want a good superhero MMORPG, you're probably out of luck.  City of Heroes was killed by NCSoft's desire for more money.  DCUO is great, if you want to be a sidekick.  Marvel Heroes is a Diablo II clone, if you like that sort of thing.  And Champions Online?  Well, if you avoid lockboxes, boosts, alerts, vehicles, and anything put in after PWE took over, then it's actually a good game.  Most people won't play that way though, which means I can't recommend this game.  I still have my lifetime subscription that I got myself suckered into buying, though, so I'll still come back from time to time, just to have a change of pace.  After all, I haven't spent a cent on this game since launch, and I still have full VIP features still.  For anyone new, though, watch out.  This one had potential, but it was squandered by a few really bad decisions, and now it's just another pay to win style ""free to play"".Oh, and if you do play, make sure you study hard on the powers.  Get the wrong power combinations, and you've just become the Super Wimp.  So much for roleplay.  =/			"

												As the game is now this game went from pay to win to pay to progress.The game has always been a revenue machine spending money on it was the only way to get the best gear which dropped from lock boxes items that could only be opened by spending the equivalent of a dollar for a chance at getting it along with other items.Instead of making smart changes to a game that was already on life support for a long time devs decided to turn the game into a grindfest on par with several Chinese mmo's. Nearly every change is meant to make you give in and spend money on microtransactions. or spend several hours a day for nine weeks straight to earn a enough tokens to get a special costume item a complaint that was made several times and the dev team were made aware of weeks before the items were implemented but ignored. I could write several pages to address the lazy way they're going about constantly nerfing is suppose to make the game more"" balanced "" but is making the game more grindy which is the straw that broke the camels back as far as I am concerned. I stuck around in this game far longer than i should have, but seeing as there are no other super hero games around besides DCUO I sucked it up and dealt with it, But the incompetent dev team catering to the 1% group and ""Elite"" of the games beck and call. "" Power x does too much damage in pvp "" this is said with little to no proof mind you.One week later "" power  x "" gets nerfed and those who pve and never pvp are punished in the devs ham-fisted attempt to force the holy trinity on a game that thrived on hybrids and never needed it. I personaly think the trinity is great, but not needed in a game like this It's like trying to force order on chaos.			"

												In my experiences playing MMORPGs, there are few I return to as much as Champions Online.On the surface, the game is rather asthetically pleasing. It has a gentle cell-shading style that gives it a pleasant comic booky feel, environments and enemies that vary greatly between bright and popping, or dark and grim, and a very spectacular character creation system.The extensive character creation allowed to players is one of the most detailed I have ever seen. Right away, you have hundreds of options for each part of the body: head, torso/arms, hands, legs/feet, even the size of each body part is highly customizable with many sliders working on length, size, and more of the same. And then the ability to change the colors of each individual part can result in some incredible or nauseatingly dizzy character designs. Currently, the most lacking thing for adjusting body type is the inability to make characters more chubby in appearance, the closest thing behing adjusting body-mass, which Hulkifies your character, but doesn't give any appearance of being heavy. Also concerning, as of late there have been players that make characters but don't play, favoring a quiter RP to killing baddies. Due to this, character creation options have slowly, but surely, started becoming limited in earlier levels. Still, the options allow for great creativity.Still on the note of appearances, the range of powers is handled quite beautifly. Few abilities look choppy and strange in effect, often blending well together to create a fantastic super hero feel. Between two differently-themed characters with the same power set, the powers can suit both equally due to how they look and work in-game. The travel powers are no exception, and can be quite spectacular in functionality. There are different variations of the same power available to even unsubscribed players, which allows for better creativity in movement. Unfortunately, most of the more cool-looking power-sets and travel powers must be purchased from the store, but that doesn't hinder the ability to enjoy the game, unlike other MMOs I've seen.Gameplay is also remarkably smooth, though it is far easier to play the game with a gamepad than a keyboard/mouse. On the keyboard, the use of abilities resides in the number keys or number pad, and requires holding the ALT or CTRL key sometimes to select other powers. To target, move, attack, repeat requires either speedy hand motions or a more compact way to control. Also, unless the skill of holding both mouse buttons and aiming where you want to go is mastered, using the keyboard and mouse to travel can be clunky and awkward. Upon plugging in a controller, it is quite clear the game was once to be on a console. Using powers, targeting, interaction with mission items and traveling are all far easier like this. The functionality of the power sets is for the most part handled well. There are several power archetypes available in categories listed as ranged, tank, support, and hybrid, which lets players immediately know the recommended focus of each power set. While there are still some issues with power balance, each archetype is easily a piece of a whole, making teams truly a team where every individual has a purpose, making interacting with other people a fulfilling experience. That being said, the streamline of each power set can feel incredibly limited. While leveling, one or two ability slots have a choice, and more often than not, the choice has an obvious answer. While it makes sense that archetypes are set powers, it feels like there should be more options in selecting powers, and the options are in need of being equally beneficial to the player. Another issue can be the Free-Form power selection, which lets a player hand-pick each and every power earned as they level. The process can be incredibly tricky, with one wrong choice upsetting the whole character viability, not to mention that when all the right choices are made, characters can become extremely overpowered, which drags on the interaction experience.More debatable are the effects of microtransactions in the game. Unlike many of the other MMOs I've played, the purchasing of content simply does not damage the ability to enjoy the game, since you don't have to make purchases to progress in the game. I have been playing for a little over four years and have not spent a single cent on it, and still I find it incredibly fun. The introduction of Questionite (or Q), lets players earn resources to purchase content with effort as opposed to a card number, which adds to the amount of time certain types of players put into the game. Not to mention the mission sets- once having to been paid for- that for the past year have been free for all to enjoy. The lockbox drops from enemies can get irritating, filling up one's inventory, and vehicles are still extremely over-powered in the game, but those downsides do not truly inhibit the average player's experience.The last big issue seen as of late is the decline of large-scale content updates to the game. While numerous small things have been added- auras, new costume sets, new vehicles, etc.- there has been a notable lack of new missions and events for players to really participate in. It is unapparent when this update drought will end, but it does put a damper on the game for long-time players.Champions Online is one of the most enjoyable games I've played in the last decade. It has a personality that has few competitors in the gaming world, lending in part to its roots in pen-and-paper RPG. It's beautiful, realitivly easy to play, and has a great slew of experiences for its players.I can't give the game a proper number rating, since I tend to rate individual parts as opposed to the whole, but I will say this is possibly my favorite game in terms of MMOs.tl;dr:+Great asthetics+In-depth character creation.+Smooth power designs.+Microtransactions not a big deal.-Awkward controls.-Archetypes get repeatitive.-Overpowered players are common.-Recent lack of big-scale content updates.

												Right off the bat, this game is very frustrating...Pro's:-------------------------------------+ Character customisation allows a wide variety of costumes, materials and colours.+ Tutorial sufficiently covers important aspects of the game without going overboard.+ No apparent exp loss from dying.+ Sizable, active community.+ Missions have loads of variety.+ Scenes are voiceacted.Con's:-------------------------------------- Most classes locked behind paywall.- Melee class feels severely imbalanced in combat.- Flying is only marginally faster than walking.- Community seems to ignore you entirely.- Missions that require groups are generally impossible to beat because noone at low lvls group up.- Cheap voiceactors, bad dialogue.Overall:-------------------------------------As a double sword class, I was unable to get past lvl 11 and that's where my review data stops. The constant dying and the group missions I was forced to do solo make the game an incredible chore. While I feel the tutorial explains everything adequately, there's no helping the fact that Perfect World has screwed up player survivability.Can I recommend this game based on the hope that PW fixes this, or that you can simply join a group for lvling? Not in the slightest. Perfect World is well known for being stubborn even in death (see Perfect World International), and the community itself would seemingly prefer to sit in the main city and talk nonsense than organise groups/raids.Despite appearences, Champions Online has very little to offer the player. There's a million pricetags of premium content, loot is mostly spammed with costume lockboxes and missions give pitiful rewards for the effort it takes to complete them.This was my second attempt to play this game, and it only took 30mins to remember why I quit the first time.

												Used to be good. Until devs(mostly Kaiserin) screwed it up real bad with this grindy crap, in order to keep you in the game, instead of providing ACTUAL content to keep us interested. Nerfs hit stuff that don't need to be nerfed and buffs hit stuff that don't need to be buffed. They made alting (switching to other characters) irrelevant and even more grindier and all rewards went from Bind on Equip to Bind on Pickup, essentially making the grindtrain even longer. Furthermore, the more alt heroes you have, the grindier it is.I'm giving them way too much credit, but introducing 1 new feature, while screwing up 5 others is not progress. They don't even try to balance the game.Bug reporting/suggestions have no effect even if you do want to help the game, they just listen to a select few people they cater to and that's it.My favorite example is, for almost a year I suggested they implement one thing. At first, the community said it's crap, unnecessary. When they actually added it 1 year and 1 month later they said they always wanted it and I should take no credit! LOL!Not to mention the community is super toxic and full of bronies and furryf@gs, current or future convicts and rapists, who while you try to level up and gear up will message you with ""wow, is your d1ck as big and black as your character?"" and I swear that's one of the more civil offers and messages I've got from the RP community.A real developer would go ""omg, I won't even go to sleep before i fix the bugs, I'm paid to do it, and there's a lot of players involved here"" while Champs online developers go ""ah well, imma fix it next week, i need to go outzes now going out with friends bye all"" (Kaiserin)But yeah, fu$k that, i'm never coming back to this game.I'm sorry if I sound like a hater, I definitely am not. As you can see I've spent 3000+ hours and I was the best DPS player and the best farmer in there, I'm just heavily disappointed by the direction this game is heading.I've broken so many records in this game and I always promised myself that when I'm about to quit, I'll break another one - make the biggest giveaway, giving away about $3500+ worth of items if you count their ingame store prices. But I ended up selling all my belongings for a couple of hundred bucks (real money). I didn't wanna do it, but that's just my way of saying ""Suck that, Cryptic, you can't control us"". Also, again, the community has been nothing but toxic, so the majority doesn't deserve it.When I logged in to trade away the stuff that was bought from me, there were 5 zones with 2-7 players online. Last year we'd get at least 300 players online, now its well you do the math 5x2-7 = 10-35 players online. The game is now a chat client more than anything. 90% of players are there to just afk and chat and RP, content is utterly dead. No challenge, no nothing. Safe to say the game is dead.The one good thing I can say is that the character maker is still pretty neat. You can make pretty much any character you want, that's the only good thing left about the game.			"

												Played the game for quite some time before playing it on steam, so ignore the hours.City of Heroes being one of my favorite games of all time, it's difficult not to feel extremely lukewarm about this game.-The character creator is pretty good, but feels pretty limited as a free member if you end up wanting to make something you need to buy parts for.-The gameplay itself is braindead and feels exactly the same no matter what abilities you choose. It's a borefest of ""Use builder. Use other ability. Use builder. Use other ability."" -There aren't any meaningful updates to the game anymore (Or, any updates at all), and so it's not worth playing at all if you don't want to stagnate at some point in content.-Some of the unique things, like the nemesis system, aren't fleshed out enough to feel super interesting.There are other aspects that bother me, but that's what I got off the top of my head. It's still worth giving a whirl, but I don't expect most people to find the game exciting in the slightest after some time.			"

												Ignore the time, I've put in a lot more than that before this game hit Steam. I've been a long time player, even back in the days when it was pay-to-play, even before Atari took it over. I used to love this game, all my friends would play it. The character creator is amazing and if you're subbed, being able to make a free form character with any power you want is amazing. Unfotunately the game isn't worth a subscription anymore, so you have to play archetypes which are either overpowered or weak as p!$$. I used to always come back to this game, but since Perfect World took it over, I haven't been back in years. The game is boring now, nobody runs the regular content anymore, everyone just levels through alerts. And while alerts can be fun for a while, their lack of variation makes them boring quickly. This game is full of unrealized potential and dead ends. With so many hands in the cookie jar, the game is just a mish mash of unfinished, half-@$$ed content. And all without a real update in years (I'm only counting Vibora Bay). The rest is just recycled assets made to look new. It's sad really as this game was a big part of my life, and I put quite a few hours in it. I love my characters, their costumes, powers and backstories. But the game just doesn't have anything that could make me come back now. It seems to be just a place for people to play out their sexual, furry role playing fantasies.			"

The community mainly, especially as an RPer, sucks big time. The RP community is filled with the same type of people, dressing up like cats or big chested females, played mainly by males. There is no line of OOC or IC and the people within it are hatefull and merely looking for a way to bully, but that always has been the case unfortunately. I check the game now and then just in hopes the community has improved.. but it only gets worse each time. The character creation is amazing, especially the amount of costume pieces one can use and collect and alot of MORPG games could take an example of this.			"

												Had a character for 1 year and 4 months. Their main outfit was made to look like BTAS era Riddler. The secondary outfit was a decent looking unoffensive costume made purely through the random generator. A ticket reported against me the last time I played, and both costumes were wiped. Why? Because outfits modeled after established licensed characters from comics/tv/movie/games (etc) are not allowed. I was unaware of this rule. There are many others who are unaware of this as well. Now that I know about this rule, I'm fine with them deleting the primary outfit.But they also wiped a non-rulebreaking outfit. And they didn't restore or refund the cost of it. For a game that has a major focus on outfit creation and customization, this is unacceptable. Uninstalled.			"

												This is the best hero game out there, yet that's really only because currently it's really about the /only/ hero game out there.While all of the features are cool and nice the game itself has seen better days.  The current developer team is doing their best with the highly limited resources, experience, and talent they have, however none of the new content is particularly interesting, none of the events are particularly engaging, and, all in all, despite a few neat and unique mechancis the game play gets old very quickly, as the game itself is really just your standard  MMO.Due to the introduction of alerts most people don't even do normal content any longer, and on that note most people also don't do end-game content because they generally aren't sufficiently geared or don't feel actually good enough to do so.Once upon a time there used to be a lot going for this game, but now?  Nah.  The community's tiny compared to what it used to be back in its hay day.  At this point you can't even really call it an ""MMO"" as the ""massively"" part of it has long died, the game as a whole is lucky to see even 200 or 300 players online at peak hours during the introduction of new content with one-time highly rewarding events during a super-sale of micro-transaction goods and micro-transaction currency.On a normal day, however, you're likely to have less than 100 people online during peak hours.  As there's only ONE server with numerous instances it isn't like people have the option of being on another server, you can see the population at all times and, in general, you're lucky to even fill one  instance of the server.A lot of shortcuts have been made to let you more quickly level and get in-game currency, however by giving these shortcuts players generally don't see about 90% of the content in the game because virtually everything can be obtained from a single place without even having to move out of the starting city.As it stands now the game is just a glorified dressing room that charges you money to make up your little virtual doll.

												Champions Online: Free for AllBy far, the worst MMORPG I have ever played.Refered by many reviewers as ""The best 'free to play' Superhero MMORPG"", Champions Online is by no means ""Free for All"". Whilst you can download and play through the first missions for free, the archetypes (power sets) the game provides free (silver) players with are by no means 'ballanced'. You get to pick one of the three. Healing, Damage, and defense. This was the idea the developers had to convince the players to subscribe and go freeform, allowing Gold (subscription) players to choose any power from any powerset as they wish. This already had made the game extremely unballanced, giving Silver players no chance at PVP. And how can you achieve this Gold membership you ask? By only 15€/month, OR, a crushing 299€ for a lifetime subscription.However it does not end there.Allong the years, freeform players have studied (copied) builds from other players, builds called 'Flavour of the Month'. Well, the last Flavour of the Month build has been going on for six months straight. This shows us the Developers not only refuse to 'nerf' these skills the community refers to as ""overpowered"", they actually could not care less about the game's ballance.As for PVE? For Silver players? Nearly impossible. For gold members? Unchallenging. Dull. Hold a button down and you've killed ten enemies within three seconds. Again, this is a mechanic the developers came up with to convince players to subscribe.As for the ""variety of costume options""? Also a lie. Allthough you can create your own character freely, to obtain the actual good-looking armour sets, you'd be required to (who'd have thought?) spend even more money at least 5€/per costume set. Not to mention -no- vehicle in the game is free either. You'd have to take your chance with lockboxes (5 euros for each 5 pack-which, contrary to popular belief, rarely reward you with any vehicles whatsoever) OR purchace ZEN to buy them directly from the store. How much would a vehicle cost, you ask? From 15 to 20€, each.Final veredict? Do NOT recomend, unless you've got more money than you can spend, but then again, you'd be investing on a broken game that is slowly falling to pieces.[EDIT]:Before I forget, to players downloading the game for Roleplay? Don't bother. A crushing total of 99 in every 100 players is devoted to Erotic Roleplay. As I tried it myself, I could not have a decent conversation for a whole TEN minutes before somebody tried to get into my character's pants. It becomes hillarious at some point. Hillariously sad, sadly hillarious. Unless you're the kind of person that's into that kind of stuff. Then that's none of my business.			"

Ok, here's the thing, some are so dull that you want to uninstall the game and some are pretty good and very well doneCONS:- The F2P model is a joke for a game that's from the 2009s, very few Archetypes to play with(only 11 of 29), you can't experience/try the game very well with that restriction- Animations are pretty bad, seems like you're hitting air,no feeling of impact (The Secret World anyone?)- Combat is awful,not a fan of ""pressing and charging skills"" in the middle of combat- Healing is even worse, more press and charge abilities- Crating system is a mess/useless when it could be even simpler IMO (Gonna be honest, i didn't use it much)- The PVP is pretty usless for those who want to try it being F2P, since players who pay have multi-Archetype characters and can kill you with 2 hits, literally.- You can't be a Villain per se, you're with the good guys wheter you like it or not, even if you look the most Villain-ish dude on the server.I mean,you can become one, but you trasnform in a big ♥♥♥ dude and it's over when the other players kill you- Extremely slow content updates, seems like devs are not interested on this game anymoreOVERALL: Do i recommend this game? No, not really. Why? Because i have the same feeling from CoH, you know that feeling? no? well, it's that feeling that you expend lots of hours/money on the game, you like it even if it has flaws, but you still love it and then, poof, the devs stop updating it and then they close it.

												I Actually really enjoyed playing this game.. Spent most of my day on it. It's a classic action/adventure MMO that evolves around super hero's and villians. It's a great game when it comes to meeting new people and socializing.There are just simply too many cons/bugs to enjoy this game; I will state some of them and the effects it has on players; keep in mind these bugs will never be fixed and have existed since release (2009)Cons/Bugs- All ranged/melee enemy NPC's are bugged and will walk through walls and shoot through walls to kill you. (Keep in mind the game doesn't feature the ability to do this for players, why? Because it's a bug.)- Enemy NPC's are infinite power bugged(This allows NPC's to have no recharge on powers and will constantly spam you before you can stand up)- The missions are rigged/bugged(The game will always win, if you're soloing an ""Hard"" mission, it's impossible to win -- it forces you to party up. When you have a party to help you, the mission is bugged and have to keep trying to get it to work, wasting more time.)- (Not really a bug but false advertisement) The game says at level 40 (highest level) that you will have an end game to keep you playing. It don't. Every level 40 player just stands at starter location looking brain-dead. Level 40 players don't even help new players, this makes it harder to level up and find a party for new players. I'm level 40 and help the most I can.- Missions will give VERY little EXP and requires endless grinding. Game keeps hinting at adding real money to the game for EXP bonus making it Pay To Win.- There are hundreds of cons/bugs I could list but I want to give the game some little credit now.Pro's- The game does one thing right and it's socializing, it allows you to use emotes for dancing and it can make some funny moments! But then it gets bad... it's very rare to find nice players to talk to.(Review done: I could only find one Pro with this game, sorry guys!)Overall Score: 2/10 (Needs improvement on every aspect of the game to make it fun) "

												champions online is my third favorite super hero mmo, topped only by 1.DC Online and 2. City of hero's/Villains (now defunct) it truly does have one of the most fun character creation tools, with many a costume parts and alot of sliders you can make your hero look like whatever you can imagine, be it ugly or beautiful, the power choices seem to be just as diverse!

												Used to play this game years ago.  Took some time off and there was an update that made my characters almost unplayable.  Now this new TOS that bans those that make characters that look like copywritten characters is disheartening due to it takes time and effort to try and see if you can make the character.Do I want to download this game again?  No.Do I hope they retract the TOS area that bans using the champ building system to see if you can create a published hero?  Yes			"

												I used to be a Huge fan of city of heroes, and this game tries so hard to be like it but fails. The company who made this game are very greedy people who have their own shop. You can buy new suits, new classes, and other BS. Overall just don't try this, you will be bored an hour in.			"

												Get your ♥♥♥♥ together Perfect World, at least this ♥♥♥♥ing client actually loads and doesn't lock up when you try to put in the stupid 'account guard' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you make us do every  time we decide to try a different computer. Neverwinter wouldn't even let me enter in my ♥♥♥♥ing code, so I dropped that game. Here's a tip, get your games working on Windows 10, or stop making ♥♥♥♥ing games. I've been playing Champions since BEFORE perfect world owned them, and honestly it went down hill since Perfect World took over a lot of games, because all of them can't even tell that the driver on a video card is accurate if you're on anything higher then 10. I update my card weekly, just to make sure, and it's way beyond the requirements for this game, so your system isn't reading ♥♥♥♥ right.			"

												I started playing Champions Online when it was first released on Steam. It had a great community, tons of players, and very helpful customer support. Three years later...Barren, even on peak hours, riddled with bugs, and the most laughable customer support you can imagine. For example, during the Halloween event, I kill a boss, and don't get the achievement for it. Try again three times, nothing. The support representative's answer? ""Try again next year.""Oh, and, you can only have two ""silver"" character slots, which are only playable when you are not subbed, and eight gold characters than can only be played when you are subbed. Silver can become gold, but not the opposite. So, this is not a game you want to come back to.Ever.			"

												Still the only decent super hero mmo that lets you create your own hero that is left.  Art is okay, character creation options are better than City of Heroes.  Costume pieces....have gotten better.  I still think CoH had better pieces overall, but Champions has started putting out better sets and stopped with the absolutely terrible at least.  Story-wise...it's a little too genericly comic book for the most part.  I rarely got the feeling of a living world like I did with CoH.  You beat up the natsi clones because of course you do, rather than actively disliking them like I did in CoH.  The nemesis system isn't bad, but it isn't all it could have been.  Worth playing for a while if you want a super mmo with real freedom to create your own character.  DCUO is on par in that regard with better travel powers and story, but the twitch-jockey combo system kind of kills it for me in an online game.  Both are somewhat lacking in end-game for different reasons.  DC is super grindy, Champions is just...lacking.  But it makes alts fun and easier.			"

												A shadow of the game it tries so hard to emulate. The developers care more for stuffing the cash shop with TF2 style random loot chests, than actually adding content and fixing things they've broken. Yes, you read that right, fixing things they've broken.They're so utterly incompetent that nearly every update brings new bugs, or even ressurects years old ones. This is on top of the bugs that have NEVER been fixed. The F2P model is an absolute joke, being so blatantly pay to win that they might as well have the free players locked in a room which instakills them every few minutes. The community is a braindead amalgamation of the very worst MMOs have to offer, which I suppose is a good thing as they're kept contained in this god awful affront to computer games.			"

												Don't let the number of hours on my account fool you, I've been playing CO since open beta, and have used the non-steam client for a number of years.TLDRGreat character customization, fast paced action for a tab target system, dwindling community, lack of sincere content updates. Last notable update was in 2013, and the devs show interest in new content beyond the occasional costume set and lock boxes.The GoodOnce upon a time, this game was my pride and joy. I have 4 lv 40's (max level), and 6 other alts that are at least lv 25. Saying the customization is fantastic wouldn't be doing this game any justice. While you can't quite sculpt your character like you can in a game like Black Desert Online, the amount of sliders, costume pieces, and costume slots the game gives is borderline overwhelming. If you have a gold account, or a freeform slot, you can build your character however you want, selecting what powers you want, which allows you to mix and match to your heart's content.Despite being a tab target game, the combat is quite fluid and fairly fast paced. It's no Tera Online or Black Desert Online, but in my opinion it holds up against action oriented non-tab target systems. There are quite a few combat mechanics, such as charge skills, hold skills, block skills, and high mobility skills to keep combat interesting. Believe me when I say that this puts most other tab target MMOs to shame.While this may not be a big selling point for some, the game does have player bases and housing of sorts. You can select from a variety of bases, such as a basement, a lofty apartment, a mystical library, a dark cave, and even a moon base. Once you selected your base, you can customize the interior using a variety of different themed objects. For instance, in the high end apartment (my personal favorite), you can choose what carpeting you want, what wallpaper you want, the style of your ceilings, secret rooms and armories, and even the decor such as statues, couches, aquariums, and the likes. When you have your crib all decked out, you can invite your friends inside and chill to your heart's content.The BadWhen it comes to character design, there are really only a few flaws that stop it from being as close to perfect as a 7 year old MMO can be. Most of those flaws revolve around some difficulty getting unique skin textures to match properly, if at all. For instance, some costume pieces don't have matching counterparts, and some face textures don't have matching skin textures.In the game's current state, I'm afraid you'll find PvP quite lacking. That's not to say there isn't PvP content, because there is, but nobody queues for PvP anymore. Nowadays, the most PvP you'll see are duels in Milennium City's Ren Center. It's quite the shame, because Zombie Apocalypse PvP and Heroes PvP was quite enjoyable back in CO's prime years.If you plan on playing this game at max settings at anything above 1920x1080, and have the hardware to do so, I hate to tell you but that may prove difficult. Even though the game's graphics engine can detect more than 2GB of VRAM on your video card, the game's engine limits the amount of detail down to 1GB of VRAM. If you exceed 1GB, the game's textures will automatically lower itself until you are below the 1GB limit, and there is no command or .ini tweak that removes the 1GB limit. I've brought the issue to the PW forums just to find that not only does it affect CO, but it also affect Star Trek Online (since it uses the same engine), and despite quite a few users reporting the same issue, the developers have not bothered to acknowledge the problem. (For reference, I have a 4GB GTX 980 in my system.)The UglyUnfortunately, this game has fallen off Cryptic's / Perfect World's to do list in favor of other games under their belt. There have been 3 notable updates to the game, an only one of which was somewhat major. The first update was Adventure Packs, which introduces story driven ""dungeons"" of sorts that are broken up into a series of chapters. The second update, and most notable, was the Vibora Bay update. Vibora Bay was introduced in 2010, and introduced a new area for high level characters to grind quests and dungeons for gear. The last notable update was the 2013 On Alert update, which introduced the alert system that allows people to queue in mini dungeons, and (for better or for worse) revamped the game's crafting system. Occasionally, there will be a new costume or new vehicle to hit the update news, but they are often sealed away behind lock boxes. If they're not in a lock box, then expect to pay for them as if they were DLC. Occasionally the game will sport events such as Destroid Invasion (robots rampaging around the city), Zombie Apocalypse, Blood Moon (werewolves vs vampires), but these really aren't frequent enough to keep the game interesting.ConclusionI really really want this game to have new life breathed into it. Needless to say, it is well overdue for new content, especially since City of Heroes has died off and the only other competition Champions Online has is (the much more active) DC Universe Online. Champions Online holds a lot of nostalgic value to me, and nostalgia aside, is still one of the mechanically better MMOs out there that just happened to miss the public radar. As much as I want a new influx of players to hit, I honestly cannot recommend this game to someone who's looking for a long term commitment. However, the game is free and it doesn't take long to download, so there's no reason not to try it. Perhaps one day, Cryptic and Perfect World will get the hint that Champions is in serious need of some TLC.			"

												To be bluntly honest, Champions Online could have really gone the mile for the Heroes/Villians genre of MMORPGs.  At the beginning, they had so much to offer; wardrobe customization, crafting for the crafters out there, missions that were really fun and entertaining, as well as some pretty heroic ideas for your arch nemesis.  Unfortunately, their hay day is, by far, over.  Now, it is a money sink, with their only additions being given to their cash shops.  Missions no longer roll out, most of their codebase is defective (arch-nemesis code is beyond repair, as has been stated by the developer's public relations division), and that's only the tip of the ice berg.  They started adding flying machines (like a mount) into the game where flight-based travel powers already exist.  The fun of hunting down villians has long-since been buried, replaced by an insta-que (or sometimes not instant at all), in which you wait for a team of other players to activate.  This places you in a variety of instances.  The same ones, over and over and over again.  The repetitious missions never change, save for the holiday events.  When Perfect World bought the developing company, they married their money-in-hand with the game.  This has meant that new powers are gone and done.  The broken skills are not being fixed (ask someone about the ice-based powers, the arcane based powers, or even the electric based powers), and the new things rolling into the game are meant to be purchased.  This goes for both the paying 15.00 a month customer, as well as the ""free-for-all"" customer. The original draw to this game for many was the PvP scenarios.  I played from original opening date, if anyone remembers Mother Night, Mother Dusk, and Madame Mirage (just to name a few), and the zombie scenario was always a huge hit for most of the players.  However, that is no longer the case.  To ensure I was giving an accurate and detailed synopsis of the condition in which the game now rests in, I signed in and queued for the PvP scenarios.  All of them.  On both freeform characters and the pre-builts.  2.5 hours later, the queue was still going.  I asked around in-game what was the cause of such a long wait, and I was told there was some sort of bug in the PvP system, as well as a lack of attraction to the the PvP system, that has caused it to go the way of the Dodo; right into extinction.  I asked how long this had been going on, and I was told it had been that way for about two years now.In conclusion, this game is going the same way as City of Heroes, only with a more drawn-out death that's not only painful to, but also just damned out-right depressing.

												City of Heroes was and still is my favorite MMOs of all time. CoH died a much to early death, leaving this MMO in its place.Champions Online is a very good MMO, with some problems. But nothing to keep you from playing. The gameplay itself doesnt bring anything *too* new to the table but it isnt your run of the mill, stand and shoot spells at each other MMO. It has a interesting combat system. You have a power that constantly building your energy (or mana for those fantasy mmo players) which you can then turn around and spend that energy on more powerful attacks. The Alerts (or dungeons) are nice and action packed. The missions can be very dull and stale sometimes, but that goes with any grind. The Nemesis system is a nice addition in which you can create your own archnemesis to fight. Problem is that the nemesis system leaves much to be desired. The character creator is fantastic and you could spend hours perfecting the look of your hero.The FTP model isnt the worst, but once you experience a freeform hero and the subscription privilages. You wont ever want to go free to play (or silver as they call it) again.I would suggest subbing to this MMO, but give it a try before hand.			"

												This game is the most pay to win Trash Game I ever played. If you are deciding to get this then don't. The only thing that I really like about this game is the Character customizations, it is really detailed and good. The other things, Only a few of the Archetypes are free and the rest you have to buy. To get anything you have to grind to get questionite which you exchange a lot of questionite for a few zen which you use about 10,000 zen to buy anything. btw you can buy zen with real money.			"

												Champions Online is a superhero MMO RPG game, that became Free2Play few years ago and is a spiritual successor of City of Heroes.You will have to make Perfect World account to play this game. The game isn't exactly at the peak of activity, but is still being updated with small events and new shop stuff. Community is also there, even if some zones are almost completely empty.Now, as far as gameplay itself goes it's a standart MMO RPG. Well, Superhero theme sure helps to set it aside from usual fantasy trash though. Colorful world and characters, as well as occasional nice action music. And that they got some more sense of gameplay, by having world that doesn't take few hours to travel though, while still giving it nice details. All characters having travel power helps. Gameplay also feels faster and arcadeys, but it's still same old target-based thing you seen before. The main gimmick is that in order to get ""mana"" (called ""energy"") you just have to keep using your most basic power on target. There is also Players vs Players duel mechanic, but it's just ""abuse the week's most broken powers combinations"".Now, the game is Free 2 Play. And yep, those who pay get gameplay stuff as well. Like, costumes, classes, small boosts. You can farm special ""questionite"" recources to trade those for in-game shop money, but it takes ages. You also can be a monthly sub, getting all the stuff by default. None the less, what you really should be looking forward are costume pieces and Freeform class. Because the strong point of this MMO is a customization!Freeform can be said is ""the way that game is supposed to be played"", as it allows you to pick absolutely any powers available in the game! Water, Thunder, Kung-fu, Dual Pistols, whatever. Sure thing having such broad selection bring problem where are some combinations are clearly more superior than others, as balancing so many powers would be near impossible. Sadly, F2Players only have access from beggining only to Archetypes (read: classes with pre-set powers.) and only to few of them.And biggest feature this MMO has: One of the best characters costume customizations around. It really is what keeps half of those players, who still play Champions, around, along with RolePlaying. It allows players to do wide arrange of things. Don't thing of thousands slides of ""how thick is that eyebrow"" or ""wanna make that single muscle wide"". Well, it does have some of such slider. But main focus will be on changing costume pieces of various body parts around, whetever it's belt, cape, head or wings. And there is many of costume pieces to choose from. You can make superhero of your dreams. Actually, what you can do and what many do, is to make a character who doesn't even look like your generic superhero, whetever it's some robot-zombie-pirate, anthro of your choice or, well, troll character that brings acid to your eyes. Though, I wouldn't say that it looks smooth, all non-human heads aren't animated, for example. Clipping is also the thing, but what you would expect from something what has this many choices.So yes, customization and costume creation is really something what outdoes any MMO and most of other video games, and you are most likely to learn what is ""RolePlaying"" from this MMO, which is quite common there thanks to features I just told you about. Thus game has great social-part value to it, while having slightly above-average for MMO gameplay part (and below-average compared to non-MMO games).Unless you don't care of such stuff.Or want sandbox.Or just sane videogamer.Still spent more time with it than I really should have.

												I feel as though all of the negative reviews on this game were made by impatient, greedy people. The game has a fair amount of free content, and doesn't require you to purchase ANTYHING. It's free, as stated.Pros :- There is nothing stopping a silver player(A player without a subscription) from achieving the highest level, making a unique character, or enjoying the relatively small, mostly helpful community.- There are more than enough pre-unlocked costume pieces for you to customize to your hearts content. Ever wondered what Joker would look like dressed as Supes? Go for it. Got a niche for drawing weird hodgepodges of random !@#$ that concern your friends and family? Bring it to life here. Are you dying to make a Batman who altered his attire to more resemble some sort of bat/fox hybrid? Then you're already a fanboy! And lastly, do you like to imagine yourself as an anthropomorphic horse? Please don't.- The missions are varied, and the game is FILLED with constant references to random pop culture and movies. But fear not, Ron Mahogany doesn't have any issues with the pleats in his pants.- If you are not challenged in the monetary region, you can subscribe and go gold for only $15 dollars a month, with the option a lifetime sub for a one-off payment. You get more benefits, granted, but nothing which makes you any better PvP-wise, so there is no 'Pay-to-win'. You get access to free monthly premium currency, exclusive clothing options, freeform character slots, among other things. Freeform simply allows you to mix different powers between powersets. This doesn't necessarily mean you're more powerful when you do this, as the standard archetypes have their own advantages.- Aside from the given trolls that can be found in any game, the community is eager to help, with some recieving the occasional free gear, buffs and in-game currency to assist with getting started. I've done it multiple times myself.- There are many pros pertaining to this game, but I'm getting quite tired of writing this review, so I'm going to ramble more off, in no particular order of preference. Lore, social instances, numerous powers, powersets, and travel powers, content continuiously added, every time you reach level 40 on a character, you get another character slot, blah blah blah, this that and the other.Cons :- This goes for pretty much any MMO, but, grinding. It'll take some blood, sweat and tears to get your hands on the best gear in the game. Oh, and time.- Its been out a while. Eight years. How much longer can this game last? Probably a lot longer if you'd just download it and fall in love already.- Dwindling community besides its many faithful regulars.- Anthropomorphic lions, tigers and bears, oh my!------------------------------------------------------TL/DR : Get it. It's free. And awesome.			"

												To be honest.I started playing this game, three years ago. And throughout it all, I always wondered, 'would this be beneficial if i chose this' and blah blah blah. The main atmosphere in this game has changed drastically over the years, and I have invested most of my time in the roleplaying component of this game. This game, has changed drastically in that atmosphere over the years, and it used to be quite literally, an ERP (Erotic Roleplay) hub. And the large amount of dark characters for those purposes existed and some still do exist. You have to take into account that people get tired of the same repetetive chat and uncreative ways that can go. This game's RP atmosphere is definitely still darker than hell, and sure; there are still demon lesbians galore, but people have changed from these jerkbags who were obsessed with this stuff.People may insult me or charge at me for saying that but it is, or was true. I do however have quite a few good things to say about it.The character creation, to simply put it; is quite amazing. It is very very expansive and largely appealing to people who like creating characters, you can definitely give the impression of having strange ears by changing your character's head proportions as well as actually slotting an item in the side slot to cover it; and that's just an example. I have changed as well, but people here can be very helpful, though you should still be very careful of who you become friends with.			"

												First off, this is an F2P, not a pay to win although some people will whine that it is. A lot of what you see in the store can be earned in the game free, but you have to work for it (ah there's the rub).On the pros side this game is great for people who love old comic books, and very very bad puns. The character cusomisation is extremely versitile (the more unlocks you have of course the more you have access to). Keep in mind though these are patterned after classic comic book looks and not realisim.If you like working on achivements you're going to be busy for a long long time.On the cons side the level cap is a bit restrictive, Doing the same quests over and over with different characters can get boring at times. Global chat can cause your brain to try and shut down (though how many global chats don't?)As a life member ($300 one time payment) you do get permentant gold status, a lot of unlocks, freeform characters (pick your powers as opposed to power sets) and new character slots everytime a character hits level 40 (as far as I've seen there seems to be no limit to the number of characters you can have), Much better than the pay by the month for gold then lose your status when you don't play for a while. Either that or stick to free (silver), do NOT try to go gold then derank to silver, you can never go gold again!!For me this is a fun game to play for a while, play other things, then come back to.

												1500+ hours player.The Good:- This might just be the best Character Creator ever in a video game, period. Just browsing the costume section of the official forums reveals just how in depth you can make a character. At the very least, this is on par with CoH. Which is to say it's incredible. Too bad the game around it is rather half-♥♥♥♥♥.- The Freeform system is awesome. Too bad if Silver (F2P) players want to use it, you have to drop 50 whole bucks. The Bad:- The game dosen't take its self seriously in the slightest, and (on the whole) the playerbase dosen't either.  For every awesome, original player who actually creates superheroes, there's always going to be 'Themeless' characters. Everything from a outragerous, over the top, aura covered mess, or someone who colours tights to give the illusion of being naked, or someone who copies Marvel/DC creations (There's an notoriously well-known supergroup who is entirely dedicated to this). It's all there.- The Alert System was a terrible idea. They're instanced content that can be completed in about 2 minutes. Smash, Grab, and Burst alerts give out XP, Resources, and Mods respectevly. Grab alerts aren't that bad, but the mods given out by Burst alerts are almost always useless. Smash alerts are the worst offender here, because they render the entire questing process completely irrelevant. You can aquire a reasonably large amount of XP in a very short amount of time. You can reach the level cap without even leaving the starting area. Sure, there's perks (the 713 achievments) to be had in the questing process, but perk points are like gamerscore, complely useless. They don't do anything. - Little to no Endgame. There's raids, but they BADLY NEED an revamp. There's only about 2-3 that the community are willing to do. - Immersion in non-existant. Remember what I said about 'Themeless characters'? They are everywhere. This extends to actual builds, Where they have summoning demons, celestial powers, calling in an airstike, a massive force of kinetic energy, mind control, and dual pistols all on the same character. They have the appearance of a hyper-anime little girl who never looses a slither of health and roflstomps everything. This is like the Iron-Skin spamming Rhino Primes in Warframe, but ten-times worse. Just try to get immersed here. I dare you.- Zone chat is a huge cancer. Disable it immedietly. You will not regret it. Champions can be enjoyable if you're willing to overlook the player who don't know they're playing a *SUPERHERO* MMO. You can share resources and gear between your characters, and there's no armor repair system, which I see as completly pointless and meaningless. Development has turned to an almost standstill, but both it and developer communication has started up again, and quite frequently.You might find a new virtual home here, just be prepared be disapointed in some (more that others) areas.

												This game is straight up terrible. Think City of Heroes but with an extremely active energy bar. The combat is ridiculously fast paced, the powers are... well, kind of boring. About 75% of powers and archetypes and such are locked behind paywalls.  We're talking non-cheap paywalls per item.You cannot send Tells to someone (unless they're on your friends list) or use Zonewide chat until you've accumulated 20 in game hours. So asking people to group is right out unless you come to the game with a group prepared.I don't recommend this for solo players at all. It's definitely not as good as CoX was, the controls are kind of spotty even though they support keyboard and controller.			"

												So I thought I'd get back into this to see how the game is going. I have a mid range pc of a year old. When loading the game I kept getting a prompt that my video drivers were out of date and that I had to select either lower graphics or default for 1 month. EVERYTIME. All drivers are up to date, nothing wonky on any other game. So I decide to get some help from customer service. Yea that was a joke. Just automated replies over the past 3 weeks. On top of that I was unable to log into the website. So was unable to start a post about getting help, was unable to use the password recovery page, just kept getting a internal error pop up everytime I clicked on recver password. I found a phone number for customer support and that went to a out dated voicemail.So couldn't get into the game, couldn't contact customer support, couldn't log in to get help on the forums. Wont ever try to get into this game again.			"

												It's okay.  The combat is okay, the missions are okay, the art style is okay.  The vehicles are okay.  The personal hideouts are okay.  The UI is okay, the chat system is okay, the PvP is okay.  Everything is just kind of soundly okay.  Decent enough to not be frustrating.  But not really that interesting.  The character creation is a standout, since it's pretty great, and definitely on par with(and in some ways better than) that of City of Heroes.  Certainly the most customizable characters in any MMO I've seen.  In both a good way and a bad way.  But once you're past the initial rush of experiencing new things with superpowers and flashy animations, it's not as great as you'd initially hope and you will lose interest.But it's not bad.  Just not great.			"

												It has a good character creator, and allows for you to edit your character whenever you want if you have the gold.

												The comic book, and table top inspired world of Champions is brought to life in a game full of character customization, developed story, and steady flow of new content. Although limited by the free service in some aspects- through the use of microtransactions, or the use of the subscription the customization is limited only by your imagination (and your wallet.) If you're looking for a new MMO and enjoy playing the role of superhero/heroine Champions Online is a great start, and you can take comfort in knowing it's only getting better and better.			"

												The graphics are fun and look comic-like as they should, There's lots of powers and they're quite fun to play with too. All the classes seem pretty balanced.  There is a tonne of character customization, so you can usually get your hero to look exactly how you want them to look, so it's got the best character customization I've seen in a game before.But the game can't stand up on just character customization alone, because that's just visual, I haven't gotten to a very high level, but I've been told that later on, most missions require a team to do, which makes it harder for players who mostly solo like myself. Since it's free on Steam I'd recommend you give it a try, maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't, but you haven't lost anything in trying it for yourself.			"

												At launch, i would rate this game at: 9/10 - Amazing, fun and even though needed balancing, it was so good i didnt care.Now after the Free-2-play update: 1/10 - I wouldn't wish this game on my worst enemies. Broken pile of abandoned dung. If you come on this game for anything, just play around in the Costume creator.UPDATE: April 2016They hired Kaiserin, a player who doesnt know jack ♥♥♥♥ about how to balance CO and she is just taking a great bit crap all over it. Its dead jim. Shows over folks, better luck next time...if there ever is one.Todays rating: 0/10. It pains me to watch it suffer like this...please, do it the mercy of shutting it down.

Pros: Fun Superhero MMOGreat travel powers/combat powersFun, immersive experience (for a while)Instant matchmaking alerts with supervillainsCons: Lack of communityNot as good as City of Heroes/VillainsNot many places to go end gameStarts to become dull around end gameWhile it starts off fun, the game does fall off about you've maxed out and begin grinding for end game gear.  I played City of Heroes from release to end, and as much as I miss the superhero MMO genre, this is basically just a filler until City of Titans is released.  I remember when Champions Online originally came out, I purchased it, but wasn't impressed at all.  Over the years, they've turned it into a much better game, but it still lacks. "

												It's not what it used to be so many years ago...a lot has changed...which is actually quite refreshing on a return to an old game. At level 10 you can quickly get into the action by joining Alerts...teamwork missions....que for other mini games and the arena for pvp. Even the town of Millenium has changed so much with the addition of Ravenhurst college and some other areas I don't remember from before. It seems some of the older starting missions have changed....you no longer start out in the city fighting aliens....rather you join a simulation of an invasion...but pretty much the same intro. It is still a fun game despite its age and I still think the format of COA would translate decently into a vampire game. Oh the club is still full of ERP people haha and you can find random RP groups telling stories. Also, they have vehicles now.			"

												I have been playing Champions Online since it went free to play in 2011.  I have NOT paid real money for anything on my 4 accounts.  Currently, i only have 11 avatars, one of each free archetype, highest level 22.  Recently, added 4 freeform slots and a paid archetype for FREE.    I am an ex City of Heroes player, since COH died, i play Champions Online, when i need a superhero fix.   Champions Online is a free-to-play superhero-themed MMORPG by former City of Heroes developer Cryptic Studios based on the Champions ( Paper and Pencil game ) license.  Now owned by PWI, each PWI account give you access to every PWI game. The game's rules and setting are loosely based on the HERO System ruleset and has it's own universe. The graphics are like how American comic books look like.Your controls are limited to a few skill buttons.  The level cap is 40.  You can make 2 characters per account as free2play. It has one server with many instances, has world chat and ok matchmaking system.If you are not willing to pay real money, you still can have some fun on Champions Online, you just have to be limited in your choice of archetypes.  The game has ore you can collect as reward for certain missions and can be sold in game for store points.  Has a good cosmetic customization system even for F2P players.  Game Store has plenty of stuff for you to buy.The quest content is free and maybe enough to reach level cap.  If you reach lvl 40, you get a free archetype to play with.  Big with Roleplayers now.  Currently, Not many people playing lower level heroes, or teaming up on quests.  Has Steam Achievements.  Has crafting and gear to improve your character.  It is an good old superhero MMORPG.  I don't suggest you put any real money into it, till you give it a good try.for more info:

												This game was amazing back in 2009 when i was younger, but the game lost it's flare in my opinion compared to the newer games on the market.  It needs more polish to make up for lost time.  Missed this game though.This game was originally a break through as you could create a champion with any particular name you'd want because the game would allow you to use a display name with your ""ID"" name underlining and that made me love the game to begin with before i even ended up playing into it. The party mechanics are awesome and i loved the idea that the game was ever changing for dynamic events. I can still recommend this game to anyone who has a love for an open world action hero time game. I missed this game and I'm going to come back to this sooner or later.			"

												I've only started this game when it first went F2P at the beginning of this year (before it came to Steam), and I have to admit that I’m always a little wary of trying out MMOs. They are addicting and consume much more of my time than I would like to admit. The greatest thing about ‘Champions’ is the amount of customization that you can do for your character. Obviously, there are the powers, but the selection of choosing how your character looks like is phenomenal. I’ve never seen such a system that lets you adjust so many aspects of your hero. It’s worth a try, even if it’s just because you like to design and tweak your avatars down to the very last detail. It’s a great superhero MMO and I got quite a bit of fun out of it. The art style is quite unique and it really does have that comic book feel. I would definitely play more if I had more free time.			"

												Pros: insane customization, varied skill trees that are complex but accessible. A lush physical world and a good sense of your hitbox/physics make moving around in the game fun! You can earn subscription time and new slots by playing from a free account, very cool, this is what i wish all f2p games were like. Role players are pretty well-established and the pvp scene is active.Cons: regardless of which character you're on, your account title always shows, so stalkers can stalk. Repetitive thematics and mechanics at times, but I haven't raided endgame, so take that with a grain of salt.Sum: A very nicely polished game that comic fans will love, absolutely worth a try and probably worth putting a little money into if you really like it. The weekly, monthly and holiday events are a real treat and overall this is one of the nicer communities I've personally experienced.			"

												I've played Champions Online since it first came out. Having come from the grindfest and overall nightmare that was City of Heroes I feel that Champions Onilne was a great way to do the super hero genre as an MMO.The simple fact that you can build a hero the way you want from the ground up, start to finish, is nothing short of amazing. The powers and costume combinations that you can build allow you to recreate almost any hero that has existed in comic books to date, or create your own version of what you think a hero is.The only downsides to this game are the lack of an ability to play anything other than a hero, the generic power selections, and the feel of the game. I like playing a hero in a super hero game...I mean that's the whole point, but it gets boring after a while to always be the good guy especially when you have powers that let you animate the dead or poison people or set people on fire. The power selections that are available to choose from scream for a villain side of the game. Yes you can make an ""anti-hero"" but he's still doing the same heroic deeds and stopping the same bad guys that every other hero is. There isn't any depth to the game in that respect. It's ""Help! Someone stole/robbed/broke-into/kidnapped/is about destroy, this person/place/thing! Please stop them!""Rinse and repeat.The powers in the game are great for what they are. Each style has mutliple variations on how that power should function, but they are all still very generic and aside from some minor color changes you can make, you're still not going to see powers like you want them to be. They will be mere facades, posing as a cosmic blast, but being a kinetic blast of force in actuality.The combat in the game is good, but it's not very engaging. I don't feel like the hero so much as a person controlling the hero. It's a very ""stand back and watch me blast this guy"" type of gameplay, even for the melee archetypes. Just bland.Overall it's a very solid game even after Perfect World took over it's come out with some nifty little enhancements to make the game a little better than it was. The worst part of the game however is the C-Store and the purchases that can be made within. I highly suggest that if you intend to purchase anything from the store, you don't purchase the cosmic keys or participate in the lockbox sceme at all. If you intend to spend that kind of money on the game, then purchase the lifetime subscription instead and reap it's rewards, but stay away from the keys and lockboxes.			"

												While the game is cool, it lacks end-game content to really draw you in. It still feels a bit unfinished and the amount of lockboxes, constant updates to the Cstore, expensive Cstore items, majority of the Archetypes are for sale, and needing to have a subscription to better enjoy the game just shows how money hungry the company is.If you like superhero games and a flexible character creation system then this game is leagues ahead of the competition.If you don't want to be muddled into a constant grind and lack of incentives associated with grinding then my advice is to stay away from the game.It is fun if played with friends and there is a large roleplay community, but other than that it still feels like a demo if you are a free-to-play player as the core mechanics are locked behind a paywall.

												It's a very... interesting game. I'll just try to be blunt with the details here+ Diverse character customization (And I mean DIVERSE!!!)+ Very classical in terms of superhero stylized gameplay. Maybe a bit too classical...+ This games world put's the ""open"" in Open World. Seriously, the map is FREAKING HUGE!!! Your very lucky your not the only superhero around here.+ You can actually choose to have the ability to fly right off the bat. You'll need it. Trust me. I wasn't exaggerating about the world being huge.- More than half of the classes are locked behind paywalls. Only ONE is progression locked. That's not good. Not one bit.- Combat system is a tad bit finnicky and somewhat unsatisfying. (As a ranged type at least. Melee I'm not to sure.)- They decided it was a great idea to have 'turning' hotkeyed to Q and E. In an MMO game. Where it'll often pit you against PLENTY of enemies. Who's idea was this again?- Far to cheesy. Far far far FAR to cheesy. The game makes it painfully obvious it was aimed specifically towards kids.Overall. The game excells in half of what it needs to excell at while falling near flat in the other. If your gonna get any real enjoyment or entertainment from this game I highly reccomend playing it with friends or generally not taking it seriously altogether. This is NOT a game you can take seriously either. Trust me. I tried.			"

												Best to describe this game - super hero character creator simulator... ...But before  you can fully enjoy this character creator you have to master dual wielding credit cards, cuz alot of cool archetypes, costume pieces, powers etc locked behind a paywall. And i'm not sure you want to do that, cuz the second part of the game, the actual gameplay is alot of *meh* and *sigh*. It's also now owned by a grubby company, the content and the combat is outdated, no cool updates and the playerbase is dying.So yeah I recommend this game if you want to mess around and create a cool looking hero. If you are looking for a decent mmo, it would be best to find something else.			"

												I don't normally write things about games, I'm not very good at it. However I would like to exspress my sadness when it comes to how much this game has changed. This company has become to greedy. Every costume part cost money and the system that I use to think was ok has become a thing of the past. I miss City of Hero's. It may have been out dated but you know what at least it went down being the prime example on what MMO's should be. Fun, filled with options, and not money bound. I played coh when it was pay to play and when it wasn't. Nothing changed. Updates came out with new weapons and classes to choose. New areas had been created so that ""Teams could go fight and hunt."" This game is nothing like CoH. That sucks. (Read it for what is and move on, spelling isn't me strong point. Deal with it.)			"

												Beyond the hours I've logged here, I've been playing the game since it came out and I've played a lot of it through PWE's ""Arc"".I bought Champions Online on launch several years ago; it was a completely different game than what it is now. It was a true-blooded cRPG, which relied on you making all the right choices when leveling and choosing your gear. You could be any kind of super-hero with any kind of power available, but at the price of truly balanced classes. Since the game turned f2p and PWE bought it, it has changed and not for the better. Progression is linear, unless you are subscribed and have ""Freeform"" slots. Everyone else picks an archetype (a great deal of them require money) and the game chooses the progression of the build for you. A lot of the leveling content is boring and mindelessly repetitive. Endgame content may as well be non-existent and, as of the time of writing this, hasn't seen any significant updates in years.But there is still value in playing and here's why: if you're here for gameplay, get out. Find something else to play, or something else to do with your time entirely. LARPing will yield better results.But if you're here to satisfy your super-hero fantasies, come right in. Customization is insane, a lot of the costume pieces require money, but they're sensibly-priced (as long as you understand that's mainly what you'll be spending money on, in this game) and it's a fairly largely populated game, despite the lack of content.My advice, as someone who's had problems with this game in every form it has ever been in, is this: make your hero. Customize them to your heart's content. Have a look at the store for aesthetics or even powers and services. Play as much of the leveling content as you can stomach. Join a Roleplay Supergroup. Get in character. Take your buddies to battle with you. Pretend the random gang-member NPC on that one snow-covered hill in Canada is the guy that bullied your hero when they were in high-school. Shoot the NPC with your laser-eyes. Explain your tragic origin to your fellow heroes over the bully's smoking body. Then you can safely say you ""get"" what this game is all about.			"

After the fun of creating a character I encountered kludgy gameplay interface, limited controls, no walkthrough of any kind (to introduce you to how to manage your character, find/accomplish any goals or even read your UI) and so far the actual content seems written for an 8 year old comprehension level.

												Champions online is my only refuge since City of heros was shut down. There is still many players hanging in there. And a large sized roleplaying community still exist. But since they added a way to buy your way to the max level many dislike that. It is fun still and the only game i have found where you can make a Hero and select the power types you like. With lots of players on anytime of the day or night, so i still recommend this game. But beware to look good you will have to pay good.The free siver account is limited but you can buy a freeform ( use any arctype powers) but it cost alot. If you can get pass the pay to level up, pay to look good and pay to get nice costume sets buy buying keys to sale for gold or try your luck with opening lockedboxes. As i said its a fun game and Champions Online is still one of a kind. No other super hero game out there does all what it does. And for that i can get pass all the pay to win.			"

												Deceptively fun for an MMO. At least up to level 11, it's all soloable and mostly free of spending an hour grinding for dire weasel nostrils; the closest is some gang control which is either short or in interesting terrain (it sets off the urge to explore and try to find all the highest places to base-jump from, activating your flight/teleport superpower just before you hit). It feels more like a single-player real-time combat RPG that just has other people smashing stuff in the background except for occasionally forming ad-hoc teams on open missions or clearing the streets, which is a great kind of multiplayer for something with the random public. And has one of the neatest tutorial campaigns I've seen.Quite a bit of wiggle-room in character creation too, as long as you don't mind the bodytypes being variations of barrel-chested men and pencil-waisted women, with optional animal heads. It's got its golden age of comics theme and it's pretty much sticking to it.			"

												This game is one fo the best MMP Super-Hero games out there,!Read until the end, you won't be disapointed!I've played every single Super-Hero MMO, this one only gets beaten by City of heroes, which ended ( unfortunately), don't go around saying that DC is better... I've been there and god I'm glad that my subscription ended! I've played this game for 2 years now... True the the pvp is almost dead but perfect world keep increasing the pve content adding more stuff to the end-game.This game would be perfect if it had a better pvp but it's like they say... Nothing is perfect.Still players are the responsibles for the dead pvp... If more players would do pvp it would get better.Now to the good points!This game features a MASSIVE custome custumization, no seriously, MASSIVE! You can change every single thing to make your Hero unique, and you can chose from thousands of different items!You can buy stuff from the cash shop without spending money! Yes, you read it right... You don't need to spend money to buy stuff from the cash shop, the game have a system that rewards players with crystals that can be changed for the balanced used in the cash shop!Chose from tons of Super-powers or make a free-form which will allowed you to chose from any super-power set creating your own ( Not recommended for begginers).Just fly around! Get friends! Have fun killing your nemesis! But most important of all... Created the exact Hero you always wanted to be!			"

												Excellent game for fans of comic books and/or performing various types of violence upon sytlized bad guys. Plus it's free. Plus you can throw trucks at people. Plus you can set them on fire after you throw the truck at them. Plus you can wear tights while doing so.Adding onto this with some more detail. Let's look at this from the three core areas I see in the game: Design, Customization, and Story. I'll also talk at the end about grinding.DesignThe game is rendered in a cel-shaded aesthetic. The creators did a great job making almost every part of the game look like a classic comic book. There are some sets that give more of a 90s Saturday Morning Cartoon style, but they still fit into the aesthetic. Moreover, all the locations are done in a similar style and the game applies different filters and effects on top to give different moods depending on the story. Horrific dream sequences are made with stark black and white high contrast filters. Mysterious sewers are given more of a squishy feel with low contrast high blur filters.CustomizationAs everyone else will tell you, the game boasts an immense degree of customization. You will rarely, if ever, see two players who look the same. Some will fall into standard tropes, but they will always be different and that is thanks to the powerful customization options. As you might expect, you can put on different costume pieces, but you also have control over your hero's body shape. Make your hero bigger, smaller, longer, shorter, thicker, or thinner both overall and for individual body parts. Maybe your hero got his powers in a candy factory and he now has freakishly long limbs. Maybe your hero is the reincarnation of a T-Rex and has wee little arms. In addition, you can customize how your hero stands. Perhaps they act heroic and strike a pose every chance they get or maybe they stand like a normal person. Add onto this the fact that all heros, even the ones immediately available to new players, can choose at least some of their powers. While subscribers can customize pretty much all their powers, free players still have a great degree of flexibility in how they build their hero's powerset. Maybe you choose more AoE or more single target damage. Maybe you boost your threat generator so you can be a better tank. From there, there are specializations that give your powers special boosts. A bit of bonus crits here, a bit of stacking DoT over there, some vampiric aura under there, etc.StoryThe story is a complex subject. On the one hand, much of it is very much steeped in comic book tropes. You have your standard slum gangs, your evil weapons manufacturers, your mystic snake lovers, your twisted horrors from an eldrich plane, your alternate universe where everything is the opposite, the evil robots, the going back in time to stop the thing, etc. On the other hand, this is part of the charm. It is very self-referential and often self-aware (find the ""Defender Fanboy"" for some good laughs). It never claims to be bringing you the next great Shakespeare but, for me, the fact that you are fighting the big bad evil without much complexity in the plot is pretty much part of the genre the creators based the game off of.GrindingOne final note on grinding. The game gets somewhat grindy at the level cap. Personally, I don't think this is unique to this MMO. At some point, the developers put in repeatable content that you need to do often to get large rewards. I think the game does a good job with this. Most importantly, there are lots of potential grinds for you to do, so for me it never got boring. Let's go over them. SPOILERS possibly beyond.1. UNITYAt the end, you are granted access to a group which sends you on daily quests. These quests are semi-random and fit with the rest of the game's quests which usually boil down to ""find bad guy, kick bad guy till he falls over"". Once you do the daily quests, you can do a special larger one at the end that is usually a little more special although it still pulls from a finite bank of quests so you will sometimes do the same mission again the next day or something. In addition, there is a repeatable quest to go to an arena and fight your way to an important villain and defeat him. This and another level-cap boss are often considered ""beating"" the game and people usually play these multiple times to get rare rewards like costume unlocks.2. Adventure Packs/Comic SeriesThese missions are larger stories outside the main areas you get access to. They give out lots of different rewards like costume unlocks, action figures, as well as Questionite, which is the currency used to buy special items and/or convert into the paid currency.3. AlertsThese are randomized encounters that you can queue up for. The game partners you with 4 other heroes who have to take down the villain. The alerts come in three flavors based on the bonus they provide: XP, Resources (gold), and Mod (upgrades for gear). Players often go through at least three each day because of a quest that grants Questionite upon completion and for the bonuses they provide. XP is great for characters either under the level cap or for those heroes who have died a lot and lost their stars (which make you a little weaker). Resources is good for those who need more Resources (measured in Global/National/Local influence, which is a nice touch) either to buy gear off the auction house or pay for things like costume changesIn all, the grinding to me feels a lot like how I felt in Minecraft: There are so many things to actually do, that I never get sick of one of them.

												Although debatable which superhero MMO is better between CO or DCUO, one can't help but notice how far Champions Online has come from its shaky launch back when Cryptic was still working under Atari. Especially benefiting from recent On Alert! update which opens up a lot of the game to F2P players and re-balances the game. Unfortunately, creation of your own subset of powers or combination thereof still remains exclusive to paying customers, but this affects the game less then you'd think in the long run. Would I pay subscription for CO? No. Is it worth playing as an ""off"" MMO? Definitely.			"

After spending an hour or two customizing your character (not kidding with this one), you'll find that the learning curve is very short and the game itself rather casual. Despite being simple in gameplay, CO is a well-made and enjoyable package. Like most MMOs, it's a treat best shared with friends, and this time, the treat is free.			"

												Well, they've reduced one of my biggest problems with the game. Time was, you'd have to subscribe to be able to play as a Freeform character. Freeform characters have all powers and skills unlocked, and can set up however the heck they want, making for possible combinations far far more potent than any of the pre-made builds available to free or premium players. Now you can buy the ability to permanently make Freeform characters (expensive and on a per-character-slot basis, oi vey) in the shop. Highly customizable character creation, but that's about as far as I've ever gotten, as being stuck with a permanently weak character for not subscribing was more of a psychological hurdle than I could personally deal with. Not familiar enough with the game for a score.			"

												Well, for starters I've been playing Champions Online since I was able to play for the week for Life Time Member's could play. During that week I managed to get a Electrical Character to lv 33 till I got distracted by other games. This game is a comic style game imo, It has a comicy feeling for me. When your first starting out it's good to pay attention to the Starter Builds instead of Free Forms because Free Forms can be rather difficult to get right if your a starting players. The game has a lot of different power combos from Fire/Archery to Support/Tank Stone/Wind, quite a lot of abilities to mess with you can even have multiple powers from different Branches. I rather enjoy Champions Online as a spare game to play~ Max lv is still lv 40 and most of the drops you'll get is Locked Boxes because the game went F2P but that's the price we get for it being F2P~ They haven't seemed to add any new zones recently which kinda bothers me because how CO is set right now you are stuck in one zone till X lv then you can either go to Canada or Dessert till x lv and so on...I wish they would really Add more zones.  The game is still all in all really fun the Character Customizing is pretty interesting you can make a lot of different styles~! "

												I've played Champions Online off-and-on for about 3 years now. The game can be fun if you make it fun. The end-game content exists, but its not really something you strive to do. The player community has its up and down moments like any MMO does. The game itself is comic book-ish, as can be guessed by the screenshots and whatnot. I often use CO as my ""Between MMOs"" MMO. When I quit WoW and waited on TOR, I used CO as a buffer for a couple of months to kill time and whatnot. I'm doing the same thing now as I have quit TOR and waiting on ESO to drop.The game has great customizations even on the free-to-play side. You can get lost in the customization alone for hours. Be careful if you decide to make a female character however. I can't tell you how many times I get whispers for ERP from folks I don't know, who happen to see my character (Shes in full arrmor....whadaheck how can they know if they wana plow her or not?!).If you're just a casual gamer/MMO player and you never really strive to get to endgame stuff and raid, then this game might be worth your time; after all, its free. RP exists, but often ends with people trying to poke holes in your tights so they can stick things into said holes. PvP is alright, nothing super special in my opinion.HOWEVERThe game is TOTALLY Pay to Win. The FTP skills and whatnot...you're gonna be a wimp compaired to anyone who pays for the game. You could be expecting this, but the scale difference between FTP and Sub is amazing. Personally, I found that th egame's FTP status made me feel more like quitting several times than subbing for stuff.There are several major bugs that I have seen sit and stay in game over the 3 years that I've been on and off this game. OVERALLThis game would be decent if they'd fix their bugs, and work so that subbing seems like something to be enjoyed, not ""the only way to be any good at the game"". A serious MMO player should overlook this, but a child, or a casual player, or someone totally new to MMOs might enjoy this. Comming from a serious MMO'er though, I'd give this a 2 out of 10.			"

I'll try other MMO's, quite often, in all honesty, but I always seem to end up back in Champions after awhile, so they must be doing something right.And with Cryptic starting to take a more active hand in the game now I recommend giving it another go if you've tried it before.  Or, if you're looking for something ""new"" and rather unique, jump on in and try your hand at being a hero.			"

I think the only thing it was really lacking is the ability to take what you make and go live with it.That's where Champions Online comes in, and probably why my very first day with this game I spent EIGHT HOURS in character creation and didn't get to the actual GAME. Sometimes the options are overwhelming but there was always massive appeal for me in taking character ideas I've had for years and fleshing them out as playable game characters. And the icing on the cake? That game is online so I can show off to others.Having gushed a bit there, I am admittedly not a major MMO fan. So many I've played before kinda ruined it for me. Champions brought me back in with its more action-oriented gameplay. It feels more immersive to actually input commands and either have them executed right then or begin to charge up. It all just feels very fast paced and the first time through, it's a blast.Granted, after playing this game for years, it's worn a little thin, but I was mostly a solo player. Going back through with friends is always fun, and sometimes just hanging out is awesome. Probably the closest thing I can think of that I compare this to is Second Life, which isn't as engaging or accessible (in my opinion, at least).It's nice to see so many options available so players can be damn-near anything they want. A little more VARIETY in those options would rock, too. (Seriously, why FIVE wolf heads?) Overall, Cryptic's done a hell of a job with this, even if I'm not religiously tethered to the game. Champs is nice to return to in my downtime from other games, work, or life in general.			"

												If you like superheroes, this is your game! There are alot of costumization options. The paying player can probably come pretty close to the hero he or she realy wants to be. And there is alot to do as a free to play player aswell, but its more restrictive when it comes to your role in a group and the powers your allowed to use. But you still have a huge freedom when it comes to the costumes and the general story of your hero simply because the game does not realy restrikt anything when moving around in the game world. Besides putting you in the shoes of a ""hero"" or simply someone that does good by will or accident.So as long as you can keep to the concepts and powers that are allowed by the archetypes (classes), you should be fine.Please note that there is a big difference between a freeform (fully costumized hero) and an archetyp. But archetypes still makes a good performance within their given roles. So they might want to work togeather more often.			"

												I was a huge fan of this game at release and for me it was the best Superhero MMO on the market. The few problems it had (confusing quest progression, bugged quests, lag) have all been fixed since my hiatus. The inclusion of the standard archetypes gives more foundation and provides a very nice framework for custom characters.			"

												One of the best and welcoming free MMOs around, give it a try on its 6 year birthday and remember CoH or discover its sucessor. The char creator is known for the best ever and gameplay is nice with several ways to move around, High speed, jump, teleport...Star Trek and Neverwinter deserve almost the same recommendation.			"

												(I've been playing the game on Arc so I have a lot of unlisted hours)TL;DR: Don't bother playing if you don't RP, and don't bother PVPing if you're not gold. If you meet those requirements it's endless fun.Pros: Nearly Unlimited CustomizationFun PVPCons:Both of the listed Pros only really comes to Gold members (meaning you need to pay) its $15 a month or $300 for lifetime (and it pays itself off rather quickly)A lot of the updates are pay, the game has gotten rather greedy and the company has a habit of caring and focusing on one game, making a new one and abandoning it.A little buggy and fustrating, and being SIlver SUCKS, the game isn't worth it if you're Free-to-Play.To get more in detail...if you're subcribed the game it's really fun and has a lot of replay ability (in my opinion). But it's only the Role-play. Half the fun is making a new character, making a good theme build for them (you get to test them out in the PTS if you're gold) And every once in awhile they'll give out 2x XP which will level them up quickly.Main problem with the game though is Cryptic/Perfect Worlds don't really care for the game, and it's probably the last on their priority list with Star Trek Online and Neverwinter. And the only hope of the game actually taking off and getting new content is if more people played it!Now that's a lot of bad things but nevertheless, it's the only game I've played that has such a large role-play community and such great customization that allows you to create really cool characters!That's pretty much the end of my first serious review. Keep it good!			"

												This game stagnated. Went stale. Really stale. Cryptic sold it to PWE, and it started churning out vehicles and a bunch of reskins for the vehicles. It became lockbox mania. Every other kill, you'd get a lockbox. Then they stopped, pulled it together, and turned the game back in the right direction: more actual content, fewer lockboxes cluttering your inventory. The lockboxes are once again in your inventory, but they don't drop like nuts. The long-demanded purchasable free form slots are around now, at a hefty $50 but hey, we've paid more for smaller games. I should also mention, now including the adventure packs but not a few other things, the game is free. You can play through the whole thing from level 1 to 40. No experience penalties for being a free account or anything (I'm looking at YOU, SWTOR). The main drawback is that you HAVE to use an archetype, and only from a select list - you don't get to pick your own powers as you go without buying a freeform slot or paying the subscription. However, given the a large number of MMOs don't really let you pick your own powers from a very broad set, it should feel pretty normal. In fact, it's kind of nice not having to worry about all the choices, because the already large powers list has only gotten bigger over time. Start of playing for free, for sure, until you get a hang of the game. Old updates like the 10-man boss ""Rampage"" events have recently been re-done. The old teleportation glitch is still around, though. At the end of a teleport, you get slow fall for ten seconds. If you fly or teleport while slowfall is active, you will be dragged to the ground. Surely they can just make teleportation and flight powers cancel out slow fall when they're first cast... Anyways. Costumes. How badass you look will have nothing to do with your stats and will often have very little to do with special gear cluttering your important slots. There are some pieces of equipment that give you a special dark aura, or dark speed, stuff like that, but they don't take up your equipment slots. Costumes are 100% cosmetic with a quite wonderful selection even for free players. With a subscription, you get a bunch more costumes thrown in and a 500 Zen/month stipend you can go ahead and just buy those extra costumes with. And with the game's rather open lore (though it does exist), roleplay is hard to resist. ...just remember to bring a friend into the game with you. Leveling can start too feel a little too much like a grind around the 20th time you level through Westside. And yes, I've gone through Westside that many times. Also, if you play this, tell Poe Ghost hello. He's pretty scaley. And then tell the rest of the people Poe sent you.			"

												Champions Online is now four'ish years old and the developers have worked tirelessly to improve game play, include new content and resolve the bugs which were abundant on the initial release. It's now free-to-play, they still offer lifetime memberships as well as monthly accounts for extra perks. Graphics are great and support DirectX 11 -- posted tweaks on Steam to make them even better. The game play is fast and action oriented, the new alert system puts you in the action instantly, the characters are customizable with character points in addition to powers, you can create your own nemesis which appears in the world. It's worth travelling back to Millennium City to see the improvements -- for free!			"

												This is a really fun superhero MMO. Unparalleled visual customization and, if you subscribe, complete freedom to pick and choose whatever powers you want. If you don't subscribe, you're stuck with more traditional ""archetypes"", but you still have a nice selection of archetypes to pick from. You can buy a ""freeform"" character slot if you want freeform with subscribing, but it's a whopping $50. Aside from the prices of the cash store, it's a fantastic MMO that avoids the ""pay to win"" scam that a few lesser free to play MMOs buy into.			"

												What is there to say about Champions Online? If you're willing to spend a bit, or buy the lifetime subscription (which is cheaper in the long run!) it becomes an incredibly fun and interesting game. Combat is like an upgraded and action-packed version of your standard MMORPG 1,2,3 tapping and tab targeting. Character customisation if absolutely incredible, a game based around superheroes but you can literally be anything from vampires and werewolves to aliens with werewolf legs wielding a rocket launcher.

												I will be blunt and say I don't recommend this game. The reasons are below, behind is just the TL;DR.PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: I started playing this game 3 years back, I'd played Guild Wars 2 and SWTOR at that time and found both to be lacking, for a time it filled the void left by City of Heroes when it shut down *Taken too soon.*Now note I said: For a time, after a while the problems started to pop up, what didn't help the issue was that it was run by PWE *Perfect World Entertainment* at that time and THAT is a massive example of Corporate Greed, they would ignore obvious needs for rebalancing or a reduction of damage for the sake of things you bought with RL Money, never added anything to change the Vapid gameplay and overall they did things that turned me off of it for a while.Then I returned a year later to a game run by PROPER Devs and I enjoyed it for a short time, even making a whole new character and playing him to 40, then a glitch basically made him unusable...The reason I kept coming back was the RP and that was mainly because a good number of its original community were people from City of Heroes *it was actually a huge draw for me* but the community wasn't enough to excuse the gameplay and its nature...Sure City of Heroes had repettitive gameplay but you could excuse it for two reasons: 1: it was made at the time this was popular and 2: the levels were FUN to play through so people didn't mind this and this was on top of the amazing community.This game on the other hand is repetitive and BORING...Not even the active bits of the combat could keep me riveted so I started just hamming it up in a sort of 'I REALLY don't care.' matter. And the age of Comics they went with was NOT well done as you have to balance it out proper with comedy in SMALL points, not all over the damn place, your enemy groups need to have MORE threat even under a silly exterior. Comparring the Hunter-Patriots with Malta is an unfair contest in Malta's Favor.The customization *While far more than DCUO...URGH that's a subject that needs tackling another day* pales in comparrison to City of Heroes, which would be 12 years old now if it were still around, because before it had its many updates, it still had WAY WAY WAY more customization in every aspect. After the updates you could make entire story arcs yourself using Archetect Entertainment and Change how your powers looked not just in color but in some cases how they ANIMATED!Grouping is almost BEYOND impossible even with a paragon of patience as it takes a while to get people to join you in something that actually REQUIRES people, the PvP could have been handled better *Stupid Queue system mixed with Bad Server Issues meant you could easily miss ALMOST THE ENTIREITY OF THE MATCH YOU QUEUED FOR* The big missions could have had specific people to talk to who wouldn't give you the mission if you didn't have a team of *Insert number of players here* the group limit is rather STUPIDLY low *Unsettlingly so* FINALLY None of the arcs *with the exception of the Victoria Bay Apocalypse arc* have any real investment or worthwhile payoff.In the end...I would say 'Play City of Heroes instead' but its gone *Damn you NCSoft* so instead I say this: Keep looking, maybe look up City of Titans or other projects in the similar vein of Spiritual Successors, they're looking good and if they rock when they come out and keep rocking, I'm pretty sure this game would DIE a very slow death.

												I have to say that I have never been more frustrated with a game company in my life. I wanted to play neverwinter and champions online again after a long break. I came back to find my account was hacked and all my characters and money was gone from both games. I was still able to login to the game and my arc account without issue. I submitted a ticket and subscribed to champions online to get started. No sooner did I pay for my subscription than my account was listed as banned and I was emailed for verification details. It has been 4 days since is sent the details and I havent been able to play either game. I recieved an email 3 days ago saying that my ticket has been escalated, but have heard nothing since then. I cannot believe the incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ support and response time, but also that they would lock me out of my account after I subscribed. I highly doubt I would get reimbersed for this time even if I still wanted to play (which I dont at this point).To put this in perspective, I thought I had cancelled my 6-month autorenew for WoW and I noticed I was charged for another 6 months the other day. Less than 24 hours after submitting my ticket I had a full reimbursement without any additional fuss.			"

												Champions Online was the first MMO I played that derailed the World of Warcraft Juggernaut for me, and that's back when it was pay to play. Combat is dynamic, fast paced and a lot less about rotation and more about situation and play style. Obviously as F2P it has limitations. Less costume pieces, set archetypes rather then fully customised power choices and some additional content are either gold account or microtransaction accessible.Character customisation is currently unparelled, I prefer it to City of Heroes, the only thing that comes close.I admit that I jumped in face first, subscribing and buying a few costume packs. The gold subscription unlocks everything but a few costume bits, you even get a free token for one of the new hideouts. You can play through the game from start to endgame without paying anything and free is a reasonable price for that. Finally, there's an active Roleplaying community.Better then the critic score gives it credit for.			"

												Champions Online. To put it simply this game is limited to the users imagination. If you can think of an idea, let it flow and give it shape. Download this game. Don't even second guess yourself. If you want customization, crazy worlds. Things you thought impossible. Well. I'm telling you its all perfectly possible. Now then. Onto an actual review of this game.Once it went Free to Play, naturally i jumped at the oppertunity to play such a game, but i was disappointed and surpised on a number of areas. The first being the silver and gold platforms for playing. (Silver being the base model of F2P and Gold being a subscriber status of the game) If you want some neat features, extra perks. I highly recommend you buy Gold membership (Never been gold but i am ashamed to say i have pumped far too much money into this game.) For the small pricetag you pay your getting alot, this is including the ""Freeform"" character feature. (I'll touch on this later!)Not too mention the new aura system and dare I say it.. Vehicles. Ugh. (Not as good as they sound.. Keep reading for my opinion on these.)So before i continue i want to sidetrack with you with abit of history of the point of view from a Veteran Silver. Content has really, REALLY been lacking these past few months. With most of the attention shifting to ""STO"" (Star Trek Online) One of Cryptics other ventures before being brought out. So yeah. Theres been little to no quality control and content added to the game recently. Even old features such as missions from Adventure packs - (Buyable DLC expansion packs which were made free by Perfect World Entertainment) remain just undoable because of heavy bugs from the game. (Which probably won't ever get fixed..)Freeform your characters.Its exactly as it sounds. Want a fire character who can shoot electricity? You can do it. Want a sorcerer with a cheeky sidearm? Why not! How about a robot who has floating drones.. Or even Ice wolves as pets!? Do it already! Freeform is your golden ticket into the chocolate factory. Imagine, Create and have Fun! If you are subscribed to the membership system ingame you will automatically have access to this feature. Silvers can also buy access to this feature.. For the small sum of £50 or $50, in the respected countries. Soo yeah. Thankyou PWE for this but.. I think its best we wait for Half-price sales.Vehicles.Oh my gosh.. Just a waste of money. They might look cool but you will barely ever use them. Weapons do limited damage. If anything they are useable trophies. (Did i mention you can only use them outside?) Just save yourself some money. Say NO to vehicles!To put this bluntly. Most of these new features is to keep the playerbase for hanging on. The game is dying. I'm sorry but it is. I can recommend this, but it probably won't be around for the remainder of 2014. "

Sure not much new stuff but it is still great! Oh and free....Now I never been a Silver Player, so I am not sure it is great... I play only Freeforms but I know Freeforms are better then the  archetypes... Hope your better then me and can play them good...Other then that, there are MANY costumes to pick from. That is the bset part of the game, at least for me.... Missions, well they are all easly to find, and solo-able if that is your thing.... If you like it, I sa go Gold for a month and try out the FreeForms. Oh, and Gold get more slots too, 1 per level 40 and then 8 free ones for being Gold..			"

												Character and Power customization = 10/10Everything else = 5/10Overall rating = 7,5Shame that this game lacks in content after you've run through everything a couple of times (other than farming and collecting), because the character creator is amazing and very versatile, the best I've seen in any MMO. The power customization is excellent as well, given you pay for the subscription. The game is worth it just for its' ability to create exactly the character you want, down to the tiniest detail. At least it is to me.It's F2P, and you can essentially play a character from level 1 to 40 while paying nothing. But it does suffer from being a F2P game in the sense that there's a lot of fluff to buy, including some of the best items locked behind gamble-boxes, and most of the content coming out is quickly consumed. No new zones, no new long quest lines ending with epic villains, no major updates/bugfixes to outdated systems (PvP is dead and rewards useless, Nemesis content is bugged to hell and has been for years). It has gotten better with the new devs, but I wouldn't expect major updates or expansions in that direction any time soon. Since this game went FTP, if you take away the content relating to gamble-boxes, quickly consumed content(alerts and the like), becomes (toggle-ables where you become a different monster/character, most of them (only) useful if you're not a subscriber), and vehicles (essentially also becomes), you're left with costume items, new gear, and other collectibles, as well as some power updates, updates of a couple of systems and a few bug fixes. This might look like a lot written down, but compared to the fact that this game is over four years old, it isn't that impressive. Go to the website and look at the patch notes for this game and compare it to so many other games, it'll give you an idea of the pace this game is moving at.So once you get bored of sitting on your pile of shinies, there's not much to do but run a character through the same stuff all over again, blasting through Westside so many times you could point out every little pixel blindfolded. But having the power to create just the character you want, and thinking up your own story as you go along, somewhat makes up for running through the same content a million times. Luckily this won't be a problem until you've been playing the game for a while.If you have a good imagination, and you're not bothered by repetitive content, you'll have hours upon hours of fun. I certainly keep coming back.			"

												(NOTICE! This game has many abilities and costume pieces you must BUY with their Real Money Currency, AKA, ""0Zen"" or have the super pricy Lifteme Membership to get access to. Even without those costume pieces, this game is still awesome, but just remember, You get what you pay for. And it's a F2P, or an Optional Subscription, or a Buy a lifetime of subscription) Even though it says I've only played a few hours, I've played this game since long before it was on steam, and it was awesome every, single step of the way.The first thing that was awesome? The Character Customization! I made a character that looks like Jack from ME2, a Karate Bird Man, A 4 ft. tall ninja, a rat called ""Cheese Inc."", a giant Robot Raptor Mech with Orange Holographic Armor, and giant metal wings. Equipping armor doesn't change your character's appearance, so you never have to worry about being forced to wear the ugliest gloves on earth, or a skirt (hint hint, Blizzard Entertainment. HINT HINT!!!)The second thing? The Ability Customization! I have a character called ""The Everything Man"". He just looks like a normal dude with a really huge backpack. He then whips out dual pistols and shoots you 15 times, shoots a sonic arrow from his Hi-Tech Laser Bow, hits you with a fireball, summons a telekinetic sword and dices you up, then swings away on a rope. And it's a totally viable build. Also, you can change the color of your abilites, and you can even change where some come from (from a select list, not wherever you choose... so dont get any ideas...) You can shoot red colored ice shards from your chest, or green fire balls from your face, or even purple wind gusts out your fists Whatever you want.Third on the list we have... The Travel Powers! You can swing on a rope, you can teleport, you can fly (with a cape, with giant firey phoenix wings, whatever. Its up to you.), You can tunnel underground and pop up under your enemies, you can Superjump, You can zip around the world with Superspeed. You can float about on a giant hunk of rock, or spin about in a tornado. ANYTHING!!! And all of those were just off the top of my head! Also, there are probably 6 different forms of flight to choose from, so you'll probably have one you like.Fourth, Combat. Its fun and intuitive. At the same time (like, omg!). You can do what I did and just throw together something  crazy and it'll work, or you can really read into every ability and make a crazy build that causes all kinds of combos to happen  that heal you, buff you, etc. One thing that was a *SLIGHTLY* bad thing, was that enemies always fall facefirst when they die, unless you kill them with a knockback, wherein they will die face up, but it doesn't really matter that much.Last but not least, the community. I'll give an(other). There is a guild that throws a weekly Costume Contest and rewards the winners with the equivalent of 100 Gold, and they even have honorable mentions that get 50 Gold. Crazy huh!?  I know!!! And all of its in a F2P (NOTE!!! You get what you pay for, so some things will be locked off if you dont pay a subscription or get a Lifetime membership, which, last I saw, was really pricey.) But still, even the F2P version has quite a few different things you can do.Have Fun, and Download this game! Well, come on, do it! DOWNLOAD IT! SERIOUSLY!! DO IT NOW MON, DO IT NOW!!!			"

												What a waste of time. This has one of the worst character creation systems I've seen. Placing items in the beginning menu for character creation, only to take them away because they haven't been bought is just ridiculous. It's a thinly veiled attempt to hook you and make you pay for the look you really want, even though its already as basic as it gets. DC Online offered a far better system at no cost whatsoever. If you want to play a superhero MMO, play DC Online. You still have to pay for stuff, but at least you don't have to do it right at the start. You get a huge variety of things to pick from, more fighting styles, movement styles, etc. I won't waste another minute or megabyte on Champions Online.			"

												This game WAS totally awesome. When I had to pay for it monthly.Greatest character editor ever. I think I spend as much time in the creator than in the game itself - witch was funny, full of wonderfull content. Great amount of cool skills you could combine as you wished to. Smooth combat system (yes it's a mana-skill-1-2-3-X system but it's fun and more action-styled than many others that came before and after).The movement powers were so... enjoyable (fyling is just boring... check out rocket-boot-jump or teleport :P).And the NEMESIS part is a little underused but creating your own arch-enemy (henchmen included!) was just to sweet.The free-to-play version just feels wrong - especially if you knew what else this game has(d) to offer... but then you have to pay for it...I returned after over a year of not having played to find all my former character locked. I was tempted to re-unlock some of my favorites (eternal love for Killerbunny) but then I saw I had to buy every costume part and every power I used... So it was : GoodbyeCreating a new - but stripped down character (content wise) was just... unsatisfying.IF you can afford to unlock free-character building (I'm not sure if this is even possible anymore) - most of the content (without you wont be able to level up smoothly) and at least a big chunk of costume partsTHEN enjoy a very sweet MMORPG witch has tons of cool stuffIF NOT: keep the **** away - this castrated ""free"" version is an insult to the original game			"

												I have some praises for this game but for those who are looking for a good f2p experience, this is almost definitely not your game.So I'm gonna make this clear here and now.You are probably not going to have much fun with this game unless you sink some money into it since its where most of the content lies. Champions Online is an MMO with a superhero theme to it if it was not obvious enough. I started playing this way back in the day probably as early as 2011 though I didn't really seriously pick it up until maybe around 2013. I played for a while and unlocked one of the 'gold' archtypes with real money. I played, made a character, tried to make a story and such out of it since the game seems to encourage you to do that with the nemesis system and all.But again most of fun doesn't really happen until you either unlock a freeform slot with money separately or you get a gold sub for the game which you can do on different terms like monthly and yearly from memory or you can do what I did and dig in for the lifetime sub that lasts until the game inevitably shuts down.Doing this allow you to access freeform slots which are basically slots in which you can customise every aspect of your character from primary and secondary main stats, powers and skill trees, This is where most of the fun can come into it since you can make the character how you want it instead of having to follow a set skill system but unfortunate it is behind a paywall.That said though from the last time I played it, the game is pretty dead, there are people around yes but maybe 4-500 tops on good days. The end content is kind of dull as well getting your usual dailies and such though there are special 'comic' missions that are basically mini campaigns separate from the main story. Rampages are where you will probably spend most of your time when you get to max level (which is 40 btw) cause it's where you need to farm the materials for the best equipment in the game. Drop rates are pretty bad so you are going to have to grind for quite a while to get anything to drop for you and even then you need like 6 of each item (add there are about 3-4 different rampage items) in order to make a full set of armour and if you have multiple characters, be ready for the long grind.The game is also microtransactions galore from costume sets to powers to 'lockboxes' which are boxes you need to open with keys that cost 100 Zen a piece which is the premium currency for the game in order to unlock special costumes and vehicles that only come from those lockboxes, or just wait until they turn up in the auction house for a pretty penny (ie stupidity expensive cause price gouging is popular with players in the game).However all of that I did ignore cause if there is one praise I have for thise game it's the pretty robust character creation system where you can select from a ton of different options (a lot are premium parts but once unlocked they are unlocked amongst all character and future ones on your account). You can be an undead superhero, a mad scientist, an Iron Man wannabe, or if you are the kind of person I am, you create a variety of anthropomorphic superheroes.Story is pretty bland in a lot of places and some of the voice acting/lip and body animations will leave you cringing as you meet characters that are pretty clear ripoffs of superheroes like Iron Man, The Flash and organisations like S.H.I.E.L.D.Do I recommend this game? If you have the cash you are willing to input into the game for a gold sub then maybe yes but this game has a lot of things that needs fixing before it's close to anything mainstream. However if you can look past that, you can really get lost in the character creation system, creating many different heroes with varying powers from fire to poison to demonic powers to kinetic force.

												I've played this game on and off since 2011. The amount of customization available to really personalize my hero makes the game fun and enjoyable to come back to. I keep it installed on all my computers for when I get the urge to get down on some superhero gameplay. Champions may not have as much dimension as other MMOs but it's still a good time.			"

												This used to be my joint, not so much now. I'll just come out straight and say this, don't bother with this garbage. Well unless you're willing to pay up to play up anyway. I seem to have lost ALL my champions and I'm not even going to start on all the money I threw at this game back in the day for skins and powers or to have extra slots. It's all gone. Worst part is to get anything fancy like I had before I'll have to throw in some more money. Damn you, Perfect World! Dead Game.			"

												Friend who got me into City of Heroes tried to get me to play this when it launched.  I tried it but wasn't a fan as it compared poorly, for me, with CoH.   I tried it again in more recent times and it is fun but not enough to get me to sub or play the heavily gimped free version.I wish there was a neutral option but, since there is not, I'll have to go with not recommending this game.

												Remember City of Heros... This game doesn't compare... City of heros was shut down for this disapointment. Its like trading a thanksgiving dinner for a Mcdonalds happy meal. No where near as satisfying.Less customization and creativity. A quiet community. And generally a dull MMO. Free still feels like too much.			"

												I loved this game when it launched, despite all of its flaws. It had the best character creator of any of the super games out at the time and the free-form powers building was revolutionary, if not slightly unbalanced. Champions Online and I fell out of touch for a while, but I tried it once again when it went Free to Play. But the in-game store had become the new supervillian, crushing plot and playability under its heel. I uninstalled and have never returned.			"

												You know, this game has one defining charecteristic. Just one. But god dang it, that one thing was so huge that it made this game a joy to play for anyone with an ounce of imagination and creativity.Charecter customisation.I mean, you want to be a robotic samurai werewolf? thats doable.You want to be an alien necromancer that also has hairy hands? I've seen more then a few.You want to be a duke nukem knock off named retro-man? I've met that guy. Even acted like Duke.This game was narvana for a role player or... just anyone looking for a game with a bunch of crazy looking super heros. That is the only unique thing about it... but OOOOOH is it such a saveing grace.But guess what? People done goofed. Due to being flooded with new accounts, charecter creation has been slammed down on for new players, locking out a vast majority of options untill you've spent some time on the game.Now let me make it clear right here, I get it. I ♥♥♥♥ing get it. It's not good that all these new accounts have been made exclusivly to make more charecters for free. That's not good. It's robbing the company of money. I get it. It's a serious problem that needs to be adressed.(channles inner nostalgia critic)BUT GOD ♥♥♥♥ING DAMMIT. YOU DON'T HAMSTRING YOUR PRODUCT'S ONE SAVEING GRACE TO DO THAT. YOU DON'T CUT YOURSELF DOWN LIKE THAT FOR ANY SITUATION. THAT MAKES NO SEEEEEEENCE! *pant, pant*I understand that it's only temporary. I get that the lock clears up when you finnish the tutorial, but oh my god this was such a dumb move! The first 10 minuets of gameplay is when you need to hook your player. if you havent done that, there expectations will plummit and most will abandon the game altogether. Gameplay dosent start when you first enter the world eather, it starts the second you log in. that includes charecter generation.Again, I get it. This massive flooding of accounts to bypass the 2 charecter slot limmet is unacceptable. But there's better ways around this problem. Give players a chance to earn charecter slots. give them more then 2 to start out with. Find a better way! Please! Thats really my one issue here! If it wasent here, I would give this game all the praise in the world for being a ♥♥♥♥ing RPer's paradise!You know. this is the first negitive review I've ever made, and it's actualy on a game I have some fond memorys of. This is honestly very sad to me.I'll be fair though... If your willing to put in the time to slog through the first half hour of the game with an unispired charecter, this game can wind up being something really cool.			"

Product received for free
												This game allows for a very large variety character customization. While I've seen similar themes the character creation at even the silver/free level character creation is amazing! The graphics are in line with trying to keep you thinking its a comic book story. I am hard pressed to find a free to play game that allows you to play to max level (40) as your own hero. The game is rather heavy in the RP (roleplaying) community. This really gives you a break from the grind to give your character a deep back story. The game offers hideouts and you can buy more then one. As well as costumes for being a hero/hiding among the populace/ going to the club. Not satisfied flying around the city at lvl 6? Then you can work toward buying a specialized vehicle. There are also different types of helpers you can purchase (pets) that actually help you in combat. I recommed this game for anyone looking to immerse yourself into a comic book MMORPG.			"

												A fairly good alternative to DC Universe Online, although it is not licensed by any comic book company which makes the feeling of being a superhero kind of cheap. I would still recommend DCUO over this, but if you want something else to play, this is great.The character creation is much more in-depth than I thought it would be, which I adore. Overall, a pretty fun game to kill time with.7/10 would create idiotic superhero again.			"

												Overall great game for roleplaying!I spent so much time playing as something inspired by heroes such as Teen Titans, or Power Rangers (Cause why not?)I personally stumbled into a great guild some years ago, and they helped keep me glued to this game. They helped me reach max level (40), and assisted me through quests. Sadly, most of the group is inactive now, and the updates to the game are a bit slow, but it's definetly worth trying out! Also, if you would like to get the most out of this game, you would have to get membership, simply for the freeform archetype. It'll give you a LOT more freedom to choose your powers, especially if you already have a character you want to play as in mind.			"

												I played this as a City of Heroes vet. It has a lot in common with CoH, and there's a lot to like, but it's much less polished and they somehow made the netcode terrible while making combat more dependent on good netcode. I've only used a free account and it seems like you don't have access to any powers you couldn't do in CoH- there's a couple ranged attacker classes (assault rifle and fire blasters), a couple tanks, etc. for a total of 8ish free classes you can choose. There might be new types of super powers if you buy a subscription but you can't see in-game what you'd get access to.If you've never played CoH before, it's worth trying this. If you have, though, it's probably not worth the download to play something very similar (and not entirely changed for the better) to what you've played before.			"

												This game suffers some of the same problems the Deadpool game of 2013 had: Too much mindless combat, too many supporting heroes, too little effort in the story. Unfortunately it doesn't come with a questionably-charismatic hero to redeem itself.Aside from that, as an MMO its combat system is in a few ways innovative, yet in many more ways backwards. Perhaps my opinion is wrong because I just never got a properly structured group, but in queued instances in particular I found that the groups I got into would expect to wipe 5 or so times before completing the instance, something I'd realized would be due to the un-tankiness of the tanks.It's been so long that I can't recall how its old competitor, CoX, handled the tank and healer, but I do recall that its combat system was far better structured and its instances were far easier to tank, in particular.CO flopped on its release, I'd attribute it to a lack of game more than it being a niche market. They've since gone steadily downhill, BUT during the couple of weeks I'd tried the game again I realized the devs have been very earnestly attempting to patch things up as of late, with weekly patches and a very active test server even. Unfortunately it feels to me like they'd have to do a FFXIV and remake the game.			"

												It all began and ended with the Lockboxes.I've sunk tons of money and time into this game, much, much more than Steam has recorded (Roughly 4 years).The game was pretty buggy when I started and it's gotten much, much worse over the years, it runs like ♥♥♥♥, power mechanics a either broken to not work or broken to work too well.PvP is dead, PvE is dead, there's no meaningful content released and no one playing the structured PvP modes. A new dev team took over after Perfect World took the previous team away to work on NW (also ♥♥♥♥) and there was hope for the future.But they are absolutely rubbish, it's taken them an incredible amount of time to develop what content they actually have and they just recently, at the time of writing, massively increased the price of most of the costume packs.The (public) RP scene is the worst in any game, It was never amazing quality but it was a fun scene for public RP for a while but since I quit all I hear is how toxic it has become with people shaming each other on Tumblr and drama with long time players caught up in meaningless scandals. If you like ERP and know how to ignore spiteful bitter autists, you should try your luck, alternatively try your luck with the CORP community, I never bothered to.This game has so much potential! Making freeform builds is a blast, it's a simple system but it can really be mastered to make some fun and unique play styles; making characters is very easy to get into and I never once regretted buying costume parts with my subscription stipend).But it's all wasted by a cancerous publisher, an incompetetant developer and a tiny community largely populated by the worst types of person an MMO could attract. Play through what content already exists (And some of it IS decent, the end game zone, Vibora is one of my favourites in any game, actually), Mess around with some friends, play for a while, but don't spend cash unless you really have it to spare, this isn't a game to invest in and it's not a publisher or developer to support.I really hate long reviews on Steam but not enough people are telling it like it is with this game.

												So far the variety of missions and ability to side kick to match the levels of friends for missions makes it party friendly.  Low demand and the content is broadly available whether subscribed or F2P save in a few places.  Not even main places, just nice bonuses but nothing you would miss if you didn't know about them.Costumes and customization is rather nice and varied, content is appealing and it has a Roleplay friendly environment if such interests you.  This isn't WoW where RPers would get laughed out of a city.  But a nice mix of PR/Hack n Slash, Quest and the Nemesis system is satisfying for what it currently is.Community updates are informative.  The community itself seems to be filled with friendly and helpful people.  On whole, I like it.+6yrs later Edit:Some of the content hasn't aged well, but the CC continues to be a thing of personal joy. I love the freedom to create any concept you wish, but wish the Devs gave a world that was equal to the task of housing anything from Frankenstein's' monster to Alien Robotic Entity #10 to an outright deity.CO is an RP rich potential playground for those with enough imagination to reach out and seize that, but the world needs to grow with the list of costume pieces.  It just has to. I play now for the people, not the content.  One evolves while the other still needs to.  I'd still recommend it for RPers needing a mental break but not for those seeking to grind to the end content even if there is some to be found.			"

												What was once a fun freeform superhero game has been destroyed by the grinding machinery that is Perfect World.Once, Champions was ""alt friendly"", with a wide variety of abilities that could all be used in conjunction. Making new characters was easy and fun.Balance passes made things mutually exclusive, leading to fewer and fewer possible builds. Standardization of currencies resulted in a game that is actively hostile to making new characters, with more and more ""universal"" MMO features being introduced and harming the game.Champions was once unique, but has been forcibly standardized with all the other Perfect World games. If you've played one of them, you know exactly what to expect from Champions.			"

												I think this has been the biggest debate with the three biggest comic MMO's.Champions has always been about it's irresistible customization and it's large variety of powers to pick from. Iv'e been playing champions for 5 years and so far, it's still worth it despite it's lack of content needed.DC Universe on the other hand has it's wide variety of content to be explored but it's greatest downside is the matter of how there's paywalls everywhere. I find it's combat very repetitive mainly because every pvper I come across has the same powers & weapons as the last person.City of Hero's, I can't exactly say for sure of what the gameplay is like, never really had the chance to play it.Champions has served it's time but I'd say give it a try, it's not entirely dead.

												Do you like massive customization? are you always coming up with characters, and stories in your head? or maybe you like superheroes, and think it could be cool to create your own, then take on the bad guys?if so, give this game a shot. I've been playing around 3 years so far, always had a blast. although the game's seen some neglect lately by the developers, theres a new dev team on the job now, and they seem to be on the ball.also, subscribers can not only completely customize how their hero looks, they dont need to choose a class either. instead it's build your own hero using any powers and skills you please. sound good? then try it. because I at least think its awesome.

												Champions Online is one of those MMOs that comes around once in a blue moon. It is quite unique in the sense that it's one of the few superhero MMOs still remaining. WIth the fall of City of Heroes a while ago, the only other alternative is DC Universe Online, which I can't say I have an unbiased view towards. One of the game's foremost features is its costume creator, which is one of the biggest and most creative I've seen in the customization department. With this, many people have created heroes (and villains if you're into the roleplaying area) of varying shapes, sizes and colours, way more inventive than DCUO's.Champions is a most colourful game with a lot of places to visit, lots of enemies to beat the snot out of, and fun to be had with it. Unlike most MMOs, the combat is fast and intuitive. While you might get a little bored with it after a while, trying out the different Archetypes or spending a dime on becoming a Gold player for access to the Freeform layout (/don't/ waste your $50 on buying the Freeform slot if you're a free player, it can only end in tears, trust me), the game opens up a slew of new opportunities.Its most unique feature, however, is its roleplaying community. As a steadfast member of said RP community, I can safely say this is one of the biggest I've ever seen in a video game, especially for an MMO. Of course, the community is evenly split between roleplayers and non-roleplayers, and further split between good roleplayers and the scum of the earth, it is none the less one of the strongest communities I've ever seen. With the game's dwindling support ever since Cryptic, the developers, were brought by Perfect World, some members of the community will not stop fighting for it, until Champions gets the support it needs - and other Cryptic-made games, such as Star Trek Online or Neverwinter - deserve.9/10 in total - five for the gameplay, four for the community. Bravo, Champions Online. Bravo.Oh, and watch out for the demon werewolf succubus cosmic god roleplayers. You know that scum of the earth I mentioned? Yeah. Stay away from Club Caprice if you really want to keep your eyeballs.			"

Knockbacks Online is an awesome character creator with added pve.Community: 2/10 - Toxic and full of sick morons, however if you can find a handful of friends, or even better, bring them with you, you can just ignore the rest of the world and have your own fun. Find guilds: Conquer, Society of Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, or me @glortor if you need support.PVP: 5/10 - Not something I enjoy but many seem to like it.PVE: 7/10 - Has its issues but overall fun and enjoyable.

												Game has potential, but currently it's not worth it. It is nearly impossible to survive in this game for a few reasons. First being that there is no solid crowd control in place for Tank classes. Currently it has a feature that requires to strike an enemy to get their attention and that's not a gaurantee either. This causes squishy characters to die over and over. The game needs a solid AOE taunt power with no recharge time so that the aggro can be placed on the tank until the fight is over.  This way the squishy DPS guys can do what they are designed to--deal damage. Same goes for support characters. In a room full of bad guys, the tank needs to be able to pull aggro off of his teammates and onto him at any given time during combat--currently there is nothing solid like this in the game. Second, to make things even more difficult, you need to pay for healing patches. So not only it's difficult to survive, but also you have to pay in order to have healing patches. You can hardly call someone a hero when they nearly die killing two or three non-elite bad guys.Bottom line, if you play this game, be prepared to spend more time dying than actually playing.			"

												Many years after Champions Online was released and I am now going to write this review. First off, I was a player of City of Heroes before this, so Ihave a pretty good idea of what games to hold this game's standards to. I have at least 4 max-level characters and over 1000+ hours of gametimes, so I know a few things about this game.First off, i have nothing but love for Cryptic/PWE. That being said, I'm going to offer some talking points.Why I play/played it: Champions Online is THE MOST customizable superhero MMORPG available, hands-down. THE MOST. That means  even over DC Universe Online. There are literally almost a 1000+ costume parts you can build your Champion with. This can be a hindrance for some people, as sometimes the options can overwhelm them. Which brings me to my second point. You can play anything from a Drow Elf to a Vampire, to a furred neko or even a sexy robot.Freeform vs. Archetype vs. Subscription: Subscription offers way too much to be listed here, it offers things like  unlimited Freeform Character creation, chroma-colored powers that can be colored any color you choose, etc.Freeform  character slots are purchased from the store for Silver accounts. They offer the same customization as  Subscrition minus the power-coloring.Archetypes are pre-determined power-choosing paths that are based on classic heroes and villains. Your mileage may vary, some power choices horned into the archetypes are inferior to what you COULD be putting into your build with Freeform.However this game has some caveats.1. This review is wirtten in 2015. By now City of Heroes has closed down and DC Universe Online is out. DC Universe Online IS a Superhero MMORPG where you can create your own character but your options are limited as well as your costume options. Its format is different, and the way it handles travel powers is much more fluid (ever wonder why you couldn't run up walls in CO? DCUO addresses that.)2. The game has not aged well. With the release of Star Trek Online (not a superhero MMO but one of Cryptic's newer games) and DC Universe Online, Champions feels kind of clunky. The graphics, while bright and vibrant, feel inferior to DCUO and STO. The gameplay  feels that way too, mostly because of latency/syncing issues with the servers.3. People who unsubscribe may find their characters unavailable to play as Gold Account characters because they must be converted into Silver, meaning they lose their Freeform powers. Buying a Freeform Slot does not fix this, as Cryptic has not programmed the game to make the Freeform Slots retroactive, specifically to existing Gold Account characters. Imagine not being able to play the characters you want because you want to keep their powers as-is!4.  The game lacks a postgame. Some games have a semblance of a postgame (RIFT has you doing raids, DC Universe Online has you doing dungeons for gear). Alot of the post-game stuff is just non-existent.5. The character creator can be frustrating to people who don't like lots of options or are confused by them.6. The tutorial area is confusing, I've had many of my friends say. They're unsure of what to do next or where to go, even with a blue arrow telling them where to go. As of this writing, The tutorial area is hidden inside a holodeck simulation, which is now even MORE confusing story-wise.7. The characters aren't really all that noteworthy. While I could argue that a City of Heroes 2.0 would be in order,  Champions is the result of when a MMO's licensing is cut and they need a fast replacement.8. The game's humor style seems off compared to today. While I do realize they wanted to go for that cheesy retro-humor, STO and DCUO outshine its dialogue.HOWEVER. Let's bring this full circle. Some of the things I can commend Cryptic on:1. Frequent updates. Not sure if this means they're fixing stuff (one particular bug had my game crashing everytime I attacked a particular villain).2. Great settings.3. Wide range of power choices (even when restricted to one powerset).4. The ability to play my own music from Winamp/iTunes while I slam evil.5. The story was pretty decent, as limited as it was. Also this game as Easter Eggs abound.6. The Nemesis system. No other game has it. (DCUO doesn't need it, they have a Villain faction).So yes, this game has its flaws. But there's alot of good in it too, and worth giving a play for 20 levels or so to see how you like it,  if you like superhero stuff.If you're into WoW or RIFT or D&D, I would avoid it. This game isn't serious enough for your needs.			"

												I've played this game since it went free to play, and out of all the time I've spent on it I regret nothing. There hasn't been a single mmo I've played that allows you as much freedome to go, do, and be whatever you can possibly think of. While the game hasn't been the hype machine that some other mmos are, its stayed consistant, its like a Duracel Batterie that keeps going and going and going. Great game to revisit, and extremely welcoming to new comers. The community is one of the most mature non toxic gaming groups I've whitnessed.

												They try to give the impression of being a superhero by creating a ton of powderpuff enemies for you to mow through, but it ends up just becoming annoying simply trying to get from place to place. Very repetitive, MMO-style missions and grinds throughout. It is cool designing your own hero and costume, but a lot of the nicer visual options (like the ice slide I wanted for my skull-based ""RIGOR MORTIS"" character) are for purchase only. Not recommended.			"

												People say this game has fallen to crap but i still say it's still pretty darn good for a free-to-play. Shame they haven't changed the level cap of lvl 40 ever. Like everybody says, the character customisation is the highlight of the game. However, if you ever login whilst a sale is happening, ocasionally you'll find a really good offer! I managed to earn a freeform character for free (lets you choose your own powers and what your character should be like) from black friday sales (which you have to buy if you're unlucky). So if you've got decent standards for a free-to-play and free roam mmo, this game would make the cut. But yeah, i'm addicted. Screw all the people who expect a crazy amount from a free-to-play game.			"

												well I have ""recently"" learned that steam had this on the site. I usually played it on its old launcher. I used to play back in the beta before the ""GREAT"". Update, where they changed the gear layout and put a stop to the better players that took the time and put it into the game. For getting the crafting skill to max, to make for the better gear and costume pieces you could just earn. Main thing about the cons of the game. Lots of time needed to put into the game, to make it really fun for combat wise. But for just chattig with people and hanging out. Its great! Not many games have this much customization options expect for SL.Now since they updated and changed all this stuff around, they have added questionite. Something you can gain and use to get Zen tokens. Which I love! Means no need to get or pay for anything! Love that. . hate what they are doing with the lockboxes. If they are adding a new power, it should be a full archtype. Not a single power behind a box, you need to ether farm Questionite to get Zen or pay to get.Out of everything, I will still play the game my self and nonstop really. . .ya can tell from the time I put in. Oh and for the one's thinking I haven't played back in beta, check my screen shots in the game. Check out the pic of my character Hawthorne. It shows his creation date being 2009. Sooo ya. . .Well if ya got questions or just want to hang out with Farr and his team. Let me know. Heck the game is still a good ""enough"" RP place and even funnier hero creation base!Your friendo, Farr The Clueless!			"

												Played it for a couple years back in the day. It's a lot more action oriented than CoH and the graphics are better in some ways. I loved it but at one point, shortly after it went F2P they made core game mechanic changes and I wasn't willing to basically have to turn around and relearn how to play 9 max level characters again after already having had to do so (though not to as great an extent) after a not as major change previous. Also the company isn't supporting it anywhere near as much anymore as they used to. Still a pretty all right game but YMMV. Also while you _can_ play as F2P, it's a lot like SWTOR in that you're pretty well hamstrung on a number of levels with no sub. Not _as_ bad as SWTOR but still pretty bad. While I would recommend the game to someone that wanted to play a superhero MMO, it would be with reservation.			"

												While this game might of been an interesting hero simulation MMO, the F2P model is all but ruined the customization of the game.  Archetypes are too limiting, while the free forms are way too powerful. There is very little balance in the game, and honestly I only put as much time into this game as I did because of the social aspects of it. A thriving roleplaying community with some fairly friendly players, and a lot of not-so nice players.  If you're big into comic book hero style games, give it a try.  If you end up liking it you can get a 60 day time card off of Amazon for about 13 bucks.			"

												This game is both good and bad. It's bad in the sense that missions are repetative and you feel quite aimless as you wander through the city. Canada is cool for a couple of missions and so is the bizarro world. However, it's just not as well made as City of Heroes was. The content is good. The costume creator is mediocre and so much of the content/costume/items are ""purchaseable"" that really should just be part of the basic game. The amount you would have to spend to access all of these things, without any idea of how they work or what you need to do to use them is astronomical. (Sure you can earn a lot of these items over time but meh) With so many other games to choose from, I find myself only coming back to play this game in its most basic of basic formats. No vehicle, no really enhanced anything. I just can't force myself to sit long enough to figure out how everything works. I really do miss City of Heroes and it's tutorials on building mods and slotting and ... well everything that this game is not.That said, it's still enjoyable but it's a pale game in comparisson with CoX. Until Valiance and CoT, this is what we have though.			"

												Probably the best game by the late Cryptic studios now has been ruined by region locking and unbalanced f2p features. Do not bother buying it. In fact - do not buy any games bought and ruined by Perfect World.That said - there are two things that every mmo should try to emulate in future:1) You can create completely custom characters with abilities from any class. You could easily make magic based character with some perks from tanky tech based character. You can paint all of your abilities in different colors. You can change every piece of cloth, weapon or gadget.2) Each character can grab two different methods of travel - for example superspeed and flight. Or ice-path and super jump. Teleportation and flight on a piece of earth. Each type of travel has its perks and downsides, they can also be customized with different effects and colours.Everything else is pretty much standard for mmo's - grinding, questing, instancing, group events. Unfortunately developers quickly run out of ideas and predictably were forced to make it f2p.			"

												Tried to subscribe. Kept rejecting card. Called the CC company - they said everything was fine and the transactions was approved. Cryptic denied any ownership of a problem and ""suggested"" I contact the CC company to resolve the issue (Hint it was resolved: there were no issues from their end). And yet somehow it was incumbent upon me, not their IT staff to find out why the transaction failed on Cryptic's side. So endeth my experience with any of their games			"

												Thought it has not aged great when this game came out it was probably the best Build-Your-Own superhero game out there. It still has some of the greatest versatility, but this means everybody benefits from building a Tank-Mage with one heal. The combat is simple and it translates well to a controller as well, but what really brings me back is my lifetime subscription.			"

												Ok this game is not recent. Ok this game is made by Cryptic and Perfect World, that is not a guarantee of success  ;)I'm playing Marvel heroes which is an mmoArpg (hack'n slash). I've played DCUO also, and I just discovered CO. I kind of enjoy it. you can watch my introduction videos to have an opinion. It's a good mix, at least for now. maybe not enough content, not enough support from devs. But hey, the game is f2p. You can also subscribe or buy a lifetime, if you think it deserve it ;)

												Yes. 1,780 hours. Original lifetime supporter. The game had a golden era and lots of activity. Players perceived there being a lack of support from developer Cryptic Studios as they siphoned creative and development power to launch Star Trek Online. The game suffered from prolonged bug resolution and balancing issues, but benefitted from a very large and dedicated player base. There's still quite a lot to do, and from what I understand there are still supergroups in the game that organize events and contests.I want to emphasize that the community behind this game nurtured one of the most tolerant and helpful cultures I've seen.Going free-to-play and being sold to Perfect World was a really good move since the game is clearly still being supported on some level. Champions Online Servers could have easily been retired long ago. I'm super grateful that I still have the opportunity to launch the game every once in a while to check out the latest.If you didn't have an opportunity to play Champs Online or if it never happened to be on your radar, please give it a try. It's a wonderful game full of its own lore spanning back from days when the IP was only pen-and-paper with the most robust character creation available (from old and new games alike). Cheers.			"

												I am running this game on a windows 7 laptop and have an Intel Pentium CPU (stats: P6200 @ 2.13 GHz) and the game crashes my display drivers everytime than crashes my laptop, even though I have 4.00 GB of RAM... I dont recomend this game (sry for bad spelling)The gameplay is a little fun and there is quite a bit of customization options but the camera movement is a bit odd. I rate this ΩΩΩΩΩΩΩ (7/10)P.S. If your using certain types of laptops (depends which one you're using im using windows 7 64 bit wide screen) this game WILL CRASH YOUR DISPLAY DRIVERS but they will fix themselves, but it may happen maybe 3-5 times and than your laptop WILL CRASH. Incase you dont know how to tell if it crashes your display drivers, it's when the screen flashes black than goes back to normal, IF the drivers recover... I personaly wouldn't have played this if I knew it was going to crash my display drivers. Personaly  I wouldn't risk it. "

												So a couple of years ago, this was pretty much the only game I used to play for HOURS. Like literally, I would be questing and ♥♥♥♥ and just RP'ing with people, it's a complete blast.At the same time I was also customizing the crap out of my characters because there was almost LITERALLY anything I could do and it was really fun.But then I stopped because I reached a burning out point because I had enough. So I stopped but not before clocking 475+ Hours into it.Came back to it a couple of times and found it had changed because at the time I had just left, Cryptic was bought out by PWE(Perfect World Entertaintment) and they were just making changes. Found it radically different so I played it on and off and I can say I'm back into it! It's still fun!Though I am rather sad that they scrapped the Item Crafting System that was then replaced by the Vehicle Modification System, which was in my case, a good thing because I was literally drowning in Green-tier Items and I could just dissassemble it all and make something better, y'know!So far I am enjoying it all over again with new characters and I am just having a fun blast again!PROS+ MASSIVE Customization for your Hero+ Large Open Worlds+ Thriving Community+ RP Community (if you know where to look)+ Lots of Archetypes(classes) to play around with! CONS - You can buy ""Become <Something>"" which are basically transformations that you can use to thoroughly wreck ♥♥♥♥. Never saw a use for them, just seem like they're OP.- [Con? Your Mileage May Vary] The stock things you can customize is somewhat limited, but twenty bucks will get you a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of costume packs if you're willing to spend some cash on it. Or you can farm for ""Questionite"" and exchange it for ZEN.- [YMMV] It's Perfect World Entertaintment.- Freeform Characters are locked to Gold(Subscribed) Accounts, you can make one of your characters into Freeform but it's a lot of cash to spend.Overall, highly recommend this game as it's one of the first games to ever hit the F2P Category. Play it, or don't, I don't give a crap!			"

												Okay, redo on the review.Champions online is made by cryptic, same people behind neverwinter and star trek online.That alone, should already tell you that the story and customization will be great.I, love this game. It helps to feed your imagination with all the costume possibilites.This game has the character creator what should be in every game. Like really, it is that great. Combine it with the creator in black desert and boom, the perfect character creator.When it comes to combat, the game just seems like any other MMORPG. But, the PVP is great! Take a FF (Freeform, which lets you make any build you want) and make a good build. Once you start PVP-ing with other players it will feel awesome. When it comes to powers, the game has the usual, like power armor, fists or swords. But the game makes the fun and strong! For example, take The Invincible (possibly the strongest tank when it comes to archetypes) you dish out a lot of DPS while also surviving like a true tank AND you can heal yourself!This game is a must try for anybody who likes superhero games.

												Not really that great. First glance it looks good, nice art and great concept, but when its downloaded you then have to download more in the launcher, this takes ages.The character maker is hard to use and the story gives little information on what you are doing and how to do it.The art is also really bad when you get past the character maker, probably due to the amount of lag and overall slow feel to the game that looks amazig.Honestly I do not think they could fix this as the concept is a hard one to make a good game over, I think that, with improvements, the game could become slightly better.I rate it 3/10			"

												This is a husk and its burning. I give them the 14.99 once a year duing the anniversary month for the last three years to see if anything has improved. It hasn't. The same long standing mission failing bugs exist, causing multipart multihour missions to fail 4/5ths of the way through requiring you to either restart from the beginning or not waste your time again.Constant server disconnects (unrelated to DDOS)The queue, as in all cryptic games, is broken and frequently wastes the time of everyone in them.I only give them the 14.99 for one month for the last three years because they haven't done anything but add fluff items to drive the microtransaction revenue.The latest addition of supervillains has the typical myopicity of cryptics thought process: the supervillains are spawned near the newbie area, and have AOE attacks that kill every mob the noobs would be leveling on in a three block radius, since there are normally 4-5 supervillains ganking everyone they can in the area.This is not worth the time or money to play without freeform character creation.

												I'm an MMO Junkie, Also a massive comic book nerd. This is a good MMO with great customisation and a fantastic comic book universe. It's F2P but doesn't force you to pay via microtransaction unlike most MMO's. Most of the things you can buy are cosmetic items and there is enough free content to bide you over for 100s of hours.  Very highly reccomended.			"

												Seriously, it went from pretty good or okay at least, to absolutely painful. The only way you can build a unique hero now is by paying the subscription. But wait theirs more! Act now and you could be painfully stuck in whatever costume they decided should go with their archetypes. Sure you could eventually get the costume you actually wanted by constantly randomizing the character and locking the pieces that match though! But where is the fun in creating your own hero? Oh wait, you gotta pay for that fun. Joy!			"

												Okay, redo on the review.Champions online is made by cryptic, same people behind neverwinter and star trek online.That alone, should already tell you that the story and customization will be great.I, love this game. It helps to feed your imagination with all the costume possibilites.This game has the character creator what should be in every game. Like really, it is that great. Combine it with the creator in black desert and boom, the perfect character creator.When it comes to combat, the game just seems like any other MMORPG. But, the PVP is great! Take a FF (Freeform, which lets you make any build you want) and make a good build. Once you start PVP-ing with other players it will feel awesome. When it comes to powers, the game has the usual, like power armor, fists or swords. But the game makes the fun and strong! For example, take The Invincible (possibly the strongest tank when it comes to archetypes) you dish out a lot of DPS while also surviving like a true tank AND you can heal yourself!This game is a must try for anybody who likes superhero games.

												This game has a lot of potential and room to grow. But that is constantly overshadowed by a slow storyline, non-immersive gameplay, and the constant need to pay more money. One major problem with this game is that I found running around and jumping in weird ways that looked cool more appealing than the game itself. For those looking for a good, easy to pick up/learn free roaming game, I would not recommend this. Without money, transportation is slow, character design is limited along with everything else, and the game just gets more and more difficult without the use of money. For those with money to spend, this game is worth it. For those just looking to have some fun, it doesn't even come close			"

												Champions online is currently the formost superhero exp.On the upside:+great character creation.+Epic power listing and RPG system.+casual progression and gameplay.+cross character friend/ignore system, easy menus, ingame itunes control.+lots of mission and world to explore.+they treat free players well.(Update: Used to. Yes.. you can still play 100% free but they really like pushing that deffinition as far as itl go.)Things that can leave a bad taste:-limited classes for free players.(these classes are a good start and u can earn Zen($=cred) ingame to get around this without spending a dime)-although i view casual gameplay as a plus since so many games have been going overboard with diffaculty, cahmpions lack of challenge cuts down on the time it takes to hit max lvl and complete all content. Note: the game does have replay value.-if ur big into pvp then this game offers an unbalenced Tank build wich kills dueling.-crafting or fusion system is next to usless. Not 100% but...Once u get a 'freeform' character the game realy opens up and becomes truly enjoyable. Aside from tab targetting the game is responcive and offers a great free2play exp.9/10			"

												My personal favourite MMO, Champions Online allows you to put yourself in the shoes of a superhero. As a new recruit to the Champions, you are tasked with defending Millenium City from evil, such as Black Talon, Menton, the city's Gangs, and Doctor Destroyer. This game allows extreme customisation of a character, even being able to edit each part of their body. There are a few free to play character archetypes, but there are some which you need to pay to use, such as the Invincible or the Master. My personal favourite archetype is a tie between the Inferno and the Marksman, both ranged classes which deal a lot of damage. Also, what do you think of when you think of superheroes in a massive city? What, invasions? Epic battles? Well, yeah, but I think of traversing said giant city, and Champions Online does not dissapoint. From Flying to Superspeed, to Burrowing and Teleportation, there are many movement abilities. In short, I can't reccomend this game enough. It's a great MMO, with great pottential. And great power. And the other great thing that Spider-Guy whines on about.P.s, I have not spent a single penny on this game, and I can say this much good stuff about it.P.p.s, I personally have not ran into any problems, besides the occasional lag spike.

												Was a extremely fun games. if you like MMOs  you will like this. but ever since they transfered to so many companies it has lost its appeal.  You combine a MMO and  Heros and you get this Gem. But it gives freewill in creating your hero and Villians in Later on. Not much customization for the villian characters. Hero is completely free. you can have a free pick of abilities for a certian price which it is well worth it. Or  selected abilities such ranger, gunner, specialist, pyromancer, etc.			"

												People who have read my Star Trek Online review may find it very surprising I didn't absolutely BASH the hell out of this game.  In fact, Champions Online shares none of the problems STO has, despite being made by the same company on the same engine!Champions Online has a massive amount of classes (20 or so) that each play differently.  You don't get access to this many classes though, if you're free to play, but the classes you do get are still pretty fun.  If you are a gold member player, you get the ability to create your OWN class that's a mix of the abilities from the others.  There are restrictions on what powers you can take, as well, which prevents you from taking the pwnsors abilities from each class and mashing em together in a Sooporman clone.  Combat is action based, rather than RPG style.  You have block abilities and that sort of thing.  I recommend using the RPG controls though, even though it can be clunky compared to the quick targetting of the FPS controls.Everything that follows is why I think Champions Online is better than Star Trek Online's bull.Trolls:  RP trolls in STO are annoying purely because they're so horribly out of character.  In Star Trek Online, if you decided to make a character whose main mode of defense was excessive flatuence, you'd ♥♥♥♥ most people off around you.  In Champions Online, not only is that totally normal, you'll get bloody groupies!  My three RP characters in Champions are an anime girl, rule 63 Dr Horrible (Bilie Awful is best original character 2015), and a drow shadowknight from Everquest complete with waterflasks and iron rations.  Have I ever been told ""You know, that's kinda silly?""  Not even once!  Best place to trollRP purely because everyone else is anyway and the setting is loose enough to allow it.Gameplay:  Where as Star Trek Online pretends to be star trek combat but really was just sorta RPG ♥♥♥♥, Champions Online IS a super hero game.  You pick up park benches and throw them if you have high strength, you punch people in faces, you use super powers, you bring down the judgement of heaven and hell upon your enemies, and you just shoot em and disappoint the Joker.

												Honestly?This game was fantastic years ago.It went downhill rapidly after the time of F2P, this game could of been so much more, the lockboxing and content amount dropped, the owners turned into a pit of money making machinery, I wouldn't recommend this game anymore.There is no PVP apart from out of PVP lobbies which ends up in more humour at your inferior build. which then the PVE is repetative and rubbish, the RP was amazing, it was a thriving community. a huge community but then it died due to the fact that the same old got really quickly.Play at your own risk.

												Champions Online is the best Hero MMO out... for the moment. With City of Titans coming out soon it may have some compition. But for now its top of the heep.Champions Online is a great game for burning time. The character creators I a very good place to make a character to play or just to mess around in creating costumes. The story is a bit lacking. Once you complete the opening missions... the game is pretty much left up to the player to follow whatever story they have availible in the mission lines and comics series.  Through the game though... there are reminders that Dr. Destroyer, the ""Main Villain"" i possibly lurking somewhere in the shadows waiting to return. Sadly the litle teaser seems to be just that... a tease. Beyond some daily event and a dungeon the suggest Dr. D MIGHT POSSIBLY be out there, that is basically all you get. The game has been out for a good long while, with updates and add ons. The devs do a great job up keeping in contact with the players and there is a decent amount of content for free players. You get 2-3 free character slots ( i believe you have to play for a bit to get ther third) Every so often players are given the option to try out one of the many pay to play classes for a short time.Among the many things you can do in the game Champions has the unique option of paying to make a Freeform character. This allows you to make the character with the powers and stats you want from the ground up. I you want a kid that uses fire spell has duel pistols and a giant hammer... you got it. Sadly though the character you create will most likly be off balance unless you pick specific powers to corispond with one another so there is still a limit to your creation. On the other end though you can basically make a character that is so powerful you can all but solo the entire game. A good free form build basiacally kills the need for player interaction as you can survive battles with super villains on your own. ANd there is NO END GAME. None. Once you reach a certain level, all thee content of the game will be availible. At that point you are only leveling up to get your last level power... whcih you really don't need. I was so happy to get my sniper rifle once i got max level... and only a few short mnutes later I realized I was simply playing the game as I had about 5 levels before.Finally this game seriously lacks in team work. There is almost no need for it and in areas where there is a need for it, the game has done such a bad job of preparing the players for this you don't see player using the skills they have as is needed. Healing and tanking are very poor as tanks almost always lose aggro to healers and damage dealers. Also healers tend to get killed rather quickly as the rest of the team will usually have their hand full trying to stay alive as the healer can no longer heal them.The game is definitly fun to play, but it lacks a level of heart and soul that previous games had.

												With the fall of City of Heroes, CO is the new king of super hero MMO's. With the rising popularity of Marvel and DC movies, and the utter lack of compitition from DC online, you'd think Cryptic would have an amazing gem on there hands, right? Well sadly the answer is WRONG, Cryptic abandoned CO, if you played this game 4 years ago, you've already seen everything this game has to offer. They add some new costume packs now and then, but the main thing they keep adding to in the game is vehicles which are a total gimmick they tacked on, soley to sepperate you from your money. It is a crying shame to see the last remaining super hero MMO with an amazing character creator, left to virtually rust.Pros+ The best character creator currently available, if you can think it, you can make it or close to it, not excluding any genre, from Sci Fi, to traditional caped crusaders, to super mutant furry horse monsters with bat wings and a devil tail.+Amusing combat. Not great by any means, but if you are a gold subscriber and make free form characters (potentially picking any power you want) you can make a very attractive and satisfying looking attack combo. While its a little stale at times, some powers really revolve around one or two skills, forcing you to use them over and over again, and they might look idiotic depending on your interests.+ Extremely mobile travel powers! One of the best things about this game, is how fast you can move, how high you can jump, how easily you can fly. Other games will feel like your character has lead boots on, this game makes you so mobile.Cons+Dev's abandoned the game. No new dungeons/issues, no new enemies, story, anything. +Buggy as hell. These can go from game crashing to mild annoyances, either way, it magnifies the lack of Dev support.+Grindy, it used to be to easy to level up, you'd que in an instanced Alert, and kill a boss, get a big XP boost, repeat repeat repeat. However they switched it around within the last year, so the much longer, annoying robberies are the ones that give XP now. This forces you to do the missions more, and that leads to another con...+Boring missions. They are really dull, the story is so laughably neglected, they rip off of movies. Not super hero movies, sci fi movies. The villains motivations are so typical, and the quests never give you a reason to care about what your doing.+Cash shop is very price gouging. No option to unlock Free Form classes so you have to sub to play as those (Mixing power sets to make amazing combos and freedom) costume sets that they sell are really... limiting. They feel like they fit one look and one look only, opposed to CoH, which is odd since CO actually has an option to match textures.			"

												(I would have said ""Maybe"" recommend it but that is not an option.)Champions Online has fantastic customization but some huge issues with things on the gameplay side.You can make any superhero you could ever imagine (almost ofc) if you buy a subscription and build a ""Free-form"" character. You can make them look anyway you want, you can give them any powers you want, you can make them fly or web-swing through the city to get around, or drive a jet, anything you want! It's incredibly satisfying to finish customizing your character and then romp around beating up bad guys. The game believes in freedom! :) You can play for free but you'll have less freedom and can't choose your powers other than preset learnsets.However beating up the bad guys just isn't that fun. I only lasted about two weeks into my subscription before I was 100% done. It's very repetitive. The fastest way to level up was to join a queue and beat a dungeon with four other players. This makes you never want to leave the main hub and makes the entire world seem small and pointless. The dungeons themselves are fun at first but they offer no strategy! Every boss is just ""tank and spank"" aside from two or three that require you to block with the shift key and a few summon adds you need to kill. There's only around five or six dungeons as well with randomly selected bosses (that are all mostly the same as I said) so you'll get tired of the same areas over and over and over. Even if you do go out and quest instead of do the instances/dungeons it doesn't get much more fun from there. It's just killing 10-20 things every quest. There aren't even collection quests generally, and even when there are, you still need to kill the mobs guarding the stuff you need to collect. There are even micro dungeons where you have to run in and find an object at the end of it, and those require you to clear out every single mob in the entire area to complete it. You cannot avoid grinding/killing mobs at all.The game believing in freedom comes at a price. The reason the dungeon/instance bosses are so simplistic is because there's no guarantee anyone will be playing a tank or a healer. They have to make sure every mechanic can be dealt with even by the squishiest DPS characters, or if your party is just five healers. It has to make sure any party can beat any boss, which sacrifices the ability to create good boss fight designs.Also the end game, when you finally hit the level cap? What do you earn? A cool new raid only accessible by high level players? Nope. A new PvP map? Nope. You just unlock more quests that give you tokens to buy better armor that you don't ever need to wear because you're already strong enough to beat any quest with ease.So do I recommend it? It's hard to say. The characters I created were conceptually really cool! I had a blast making their costumes, designing their power-sets, AND you even get to create your own bad guy! You choose their powers, their outfit, their henchmen, everything, and they show up in a particular instance/dungeon where your party of five players has to fight all five of your personally created rivals. It's really cool seeing what every one created! However all of this customization is not enough to hold the game up on its own. IF you have the money to spare and you've always wanted to create your own superhero I'd say spend 15 dollars, then shut off your subscription after the payment goes through and have fun until you get bored. The character creation is awesome but I just wish the game made you want to keep playing your character! If you're looking for a replacement for WoW/GW2 or something just don't bother. It's not nearly as compelling as the top MMOs.TL;DR: Character creation is awesome. With a subscription you can give yourself any appearance, powers, hideout and arch-nemesis you can imagine. However the game itself isn't that fun and you spend every single level, even at the level cap, grinding tank and spank enemies. Only play it if you really just want to create a superhero, not for gameplay reasons.			"

												Its crazy fun selecting what your character looks like. In fact, thats where my first 3 hours game time is spent! But instantly when you join the game, the graphics change to something not quite as good looking, but it is easily over looked.It seems all starting characters are about as equally tough in comparison to each other. The tank doesn't seem anymore of a tank than a ranged character seems ranged. I feel like the game is supposed to take classes into account when you reach level 10. But why not let us play starting from level 10 then? On the same note, other games make you go to level 60, but this stops at 40. So why didn't they just strip off the first 10 levels of grinding too? Just to be sure, I want you to know that I am not complaining there aren't a million levels to grind. My complaint is that if they had the foresight to remove the last 20 level grind, why didn't they also remove the first 10 level grind too?The worst part, is that it seems that your powers and skills are no different from anyone else playing the same class. Your personal touch is left to how your character looks. Your character's uniqueness stops once you choose your class. Basically setting your character in stone once you leave character creation.UPDATE:So, I changed my mind. I like this game a lot.After you get through the tutorial level, you are about level 5. You get a free set of equipment, if you watch all 4 of the short tutorial videos. Then you get to go to train-up your levels, where you get a free travel power, a free aura, can change your suit, and get an extra suit.There are basically about 5 travel powers: Flight, speed running, super jumping, acrobatics, time-warp, and (web)swinging. Now, acrobatics is actually a very weak form of jumping with a moderate running boost, but it shouldn't count since it is a poor cross between two actual powers. (Therefore 5 not 6 basic travel powers. But it could be for someone who wants to play as a military man, Robin, or the Punisher, since it isn't much of a perk.) Almost all the rest of the super travel powers are near exact copies, but with a different animation. The super running is just as fast as the flight, but they are worded differently. The flight states it boosts you to 20 faster, then after 4 seconds boosts another 17, then after 10 seconds boosts another 17.The running states it boosts you to 100% faster, then after 4 seconds boosts another 85%, then after 10 seconds it boosts another 85%.Both, however, are the same speed.The difference between flight and rocket boots is that rocket boots start at a boost of 30, and flight has a nice animation at the point of it kicking into high speed.I noticed that the second power of my tank actually hits everyone in front of him, which is pretty cool.

The Graphics are Wonderful ..2. The Animations when Flying are great..3. The Battling Mechanics Are Super easy to get used to..4. The Enemy's Get Real Tough when you Reach A high level which made me very happy...5. Last but not Least the A.I Of the Enemy's Are nice. For example i was flying threw the streets in the game and there was a swarm of enemy's i wanted to look cool so i flew right near them.. Most games i played the enemy would not even try to catch up with you so they would just stay where they are. But in this game They Followed me untill i lost them...Overall I would Recommend this Game If you Like Games where you can be a Superhero and there are cool Cosplay Outfits to Like the Werewolf one (Which Actually makes your Character be a Werewolf) you Fight, Roar, and Run like one. If i was you I would Try this Game out.			"

I made an account with a strong password and everything, but APPARENTLY, it was a bad username/password combination, since it keeps saying ""Invalid password."" And then it banned me for ten minutes just because I kept getting the password wrong. I even specifically made sure I typed it in right. I even changed my password TWICE. Nothing happened. Same result. Can't even log in. Seriously, Arc, FIX IT.But, I could be wrong. Maybe I'm just a dumb. Maybe I just keep misspelling the password. But I'll only know I'm doing something wrong if somebody tells me first. Until this is fixed, I'll keep this review up. Then, when somebody tells me how to fix this broken password thing, I'll play it and rate it.EDIT: I tried making a new account, too. Nothing works.

Fell away from the game a while, then tried to come back, to remember why i subbed, but lo and behold, all my freeform characters were locked. My choices were 3. 1 - Re-sub (wasn't sure i wanted to again). 2 - Convert my freeform characters into an archetype (lol no). or 3 - Pay $50 for EACH CHARACTER to remain freeform without a sub. Ridiculous. Won't ever play this again. Made me want to cry seeing an account full of work locked and all i wanted to do was play them again to see if i wanted to re-sub. As i said, STAY AWAY FROM THIS TRAIN WRECK that could have been a super great mmo. Oh well.

Not yet... this review is more a rant for the actual developers than a ""bad game"" review.CONS:- No new content added in the last years (Doesn't count the Alerts)- Too much LOCKBOXES in a game where need to buy nearly all the cosmetic things/powers/character slots/FreeForm- Overpriced Powersets/FreeForm because they want people goes Gold Sub or LifeTime Sub- Some Missions are bugged and can't be completed- LOCKBOXES- ERP- Questionite Boxes nerfed so its more hard to get thingsPROS:- Decent fair of graphics to get all the users, doesn't matter if your computer is old- Fully customizable Heroes/Clothes and fair selections of Archetypes- Can get Zen with Questionite dropped from Alerts/History/Events- Fair and helping community- Even with the dry times of content the game have a decent flow of playersIn the time of time I going to get this updated to help newplayers to decide to play or is a waste.

												If I'm doing something wrong, please tell me.I would imagine there'd be a lot of good features in the game, but it's a shame that I can't get to them, since I can't even log in. I made an account with a strong password and everything, but APPARENTLY, it was a bad username/password combination, since it keeps saying ""Invalid password."" And then it banned me for ten minutes just because I kept getting the password wrong. I even specifically made sure I typed it in right. I even changed my password TWICE. Nothing happened. Same result. Can't even log in. Seriously, Arc, FIX IT.But, I could be wrong. Maybe I'm just a dumb. Maybe I just keep misspelling the password. But I'll only know I'm doing something wrong if somebody tells me first. Until this is fixed, I'll keep this review up. Then, when somebody tells me how to fix this broken password thing, I'll play it and rate it.EDIT: I tried making a new account, too. Nothing works. Arc doesn't even have an explanation in the support place. Completely worthless. I'm done trying. Arc, you've disappointed me.			"

												I highly suggest this game. I've played nearly every MMO out there, including DC Universe Online and City of Heroes and City of Villians, this is by far the best MMO that is created around Super Heroes. It's better than DC in many ways. 1) it's Character Creation.  2) Free Form power Creation (Allows you to pick ANY powers of any type mix n match as you level up) 3) The game has a lot to offer, I played for weeks before realizing there was a bank, an auction house and I didn't understand  the modding and upgrading gear well even in the first weeks. 4) The story behind the missions is nicely done and way way wayyyyy better than even the small stories from World of Warcraft, or DC online. There is also at times voice over during quests and missions.  5) Very long chain missions that are soloable. This is something DC and other MMO's only just recently thought about doing and Champions ONline does it better. 6) You can Free to Play the hell out of this.  7) there is an option to be a lifetime subscriber, i think it's $300 and it unlocks a ton of stuff.  I remember when DC Online had this  for a while and then they took it down!  I think more MMO's need a lifetime sub option.  Champions Online does indeed have that option! NOW FOR THE CONS.   No Villians!!!   :(   IT appears the company has put this game on hold with updates. I really hope more players subscribe and perhaps it gets the attention of the company to work hard and get back to it.Fear that the game may be shut down! This is my biggest issue. Again, support this game! "

												I wanted so badly to like this game but I can't in good faith recommend a game that crashed harder than the stock market during the global financial crisis.WHAT I LIKED:The community, the players in this community are wonderful, very helpful to new players, nice and friendly.The support, although at times a little confusing they get back to you on your tickets within 24hrs (not that they could solve my issues).The customization, so much customization from your characters expression, body type, size to your outfit/costume as well as your abilities.When it worked it worked beautifully, the world was fun to explore, the missions were interesting and the range or abilities and archetypes(think classes) was great.you can enjoy this game without subscribing and many of the subscription items can be obtained through in game credits though you will need to put time in to get them(grind).WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:Constant and random crashes, crashes for days, crashes like it was an alpha game. It crashed on start up, it crashed on character creation, it crashed in missions, it crashed in alerts(which are queued group missions) it just wouldn't stop crashing no matter how many times I verified it or re-installed it, it was one of the most crash heavy games I've ever played.FINAL THOUGHTS:If this game didn't crash so badly all the time I would re-install and subscribe today but it's just not worth it for me personally. I've played other online games like Starwars online, eve online and even world of warcraft and I never had any problems with those games in the way I had stability problems with this one. It's a fantastic game but it's just to bloody unstable! "

Champions Online (CO) is my first MMO game and I've played it since 2011 (with breaks every now and then) before I got myself a Steam-account some years later.I used to play it a lot before the On Alert update: I loved the old tutorial mission where I got a chance to fight side by side with the original Champions. I enjoyed the story archs, the Hero Games PvP (where lots of players joined the different games) and I really liked the crafting system.CO changed (a lot) after the update - some people say to the worse, others aren't too affected by it. The Adventure Packs which used to be Premium missions are now free, there are new missions and new features to the Millennium City map while some of the old ones are removed. I miss the Hero Games PvP-duels which are quite abandoned today since players more or less play the co-op Alert-missions instead. But in the end, it's the same game with the same Champions as before.Maybe I'm old-fashioned because I miss the old game before the update. But I still love it. While I don't have much time today compared with 5 years ago, I think CO is one of those games which have aged well (despite its cons).I hope that I may continue to play the game in five more years (at least) from today. It's one of the best superhero MMO where you can create your own superhero/superheroine and play as them with a keyboard.			"

												The second Craptic title, Champions Online plays like a temper tantrum by the COO of Craptic, Jack Emmert. A blatant copy of the company's first(and only good) title, Champions Online is the start of Craptic's butchering of my childhood favorites. The ONE good thing about it is the character creation. So rich and vibrant, it literally carries this game, for nothing else about CO is vaguely entertaining. The voice acting is cheesy and bad, the art style is straight out of an amateur's portfolio, missions are badly written and executed...you would think that this game is the company's first attempt, instead of its second. Craptic's other two titles occupy spots on Steam's top 100 list fairly consistently...but this one never shows up there, and for good reason. It's tripe.			"

												If you have ever wanted to create a super hero, then CO is the game for you.  With thousands of costume pieces and powersets, this games costume creator is one of the deepest I have ever seen.  Sometimes I find myself just logging on and spending hours playing around creating unique new toons, or simply just fly around and oogling other players creations.Worth noting too, CO does not limit your gameplay, or force you to buy game essential items like map packs; one use keys to instances; rental mounts and so forth.  Instead its cash shop offers mainly cosmetic items & costume pieces, which serves to enhance your storytelling and immersion experience, but do not actually affect gameplay in any major way.  I find it refreshing to find a game where the gameplay contents are free, with regular updates, monthly events and a thriving community, a F2P game where paid contents are never neccessary, but are always welcome.

												Absolutely Fantastic. In all my months of browsing free MMO's, this one is by far my favorite. It's unique character customazation ALONE serves its point wholly, even to the point of making your own arch-nemesis! The comfortable combat controls and warm introduction (even with the confusion your average MMO gives you) makes this game hard to stop playing. The only con I would have about this game is that the art style is definately not the best, but it is still not an eye sore.			"

												I want to give this game a good review I really do, but i can't. For one reason.The servers are terrible, I have never known lag like it! My first go on the game was so laggy i switched it straight off, however, on another attempt a day later I actually got to play a little.I really enjoyed the little I played, however, my next two logins where enough to make me call it a day.It's a really good game if you can actually manage to run forward without being jumped back every three seconds.My internet connection is fine at the minute and my machine is more than capable of running this game, so i'm just assuming its their servers. If i'm wrong and there is a way to fix this ill be happy to change this review, but its a thumbs down from me.			"

												welcome to: i have only almost 1000+ hours in this game the reviewso it's not exactly city of heroes, sure. but at least it isn't DCUO right.SOwhile CO isn't the best game in existance, it's still midly playable. to a degree anyway.yes, it has -some- p2w elements, but you can usually skip those if you're not a lazy POS who doesn't wanna buy an instant 30-thing from the z-store. (i wouldnt call sidekicks p2w? but they're helpful i guess.)while it could be worse, it's not as bad as some people play it out to be. new content wouldn't hurt.and some of the people are salty garbo, but there are some -lovely- people in the community, and i give props to them.hate it or love it, no one's forcing you to play. id give it a shot, see how you feel.edit: ive played more since this review. help.

												     Never did like the graphics, being forced to turn off the default big-blocky-outline effect that never should have been there in the first place.   That generally works for your character, but then you look a bit out of place when the rest of the world and half the other characters still have the outline.  Actually, your character never really looks like it actually fits in the world graphically.     The costume designer is alright, though the asymmetrical options are lacking greatly and the overall options aren't really spectacular.  The real problem is there's no significant choices in the non-costume parts of the character.   You look remarkable similar to a large portion of the rest of the world no matter what you do.  And the cro-magnon stances that seems to be default for the male characters are as bad as the 'let me shove my chest at you' poses for the females.     The plotlines seem pulled right out of a bad Hero System chapter of a Dragon Magazine wanna-be that never sold.  And despite what the box and some dev comments say, you never really feel like you've changed anything.  The world is the same, the missions are the same, and everyone does the same things.Really the only bright spot in the game are the freeform characters.  That's not too bad and a few other games could learn something from it.  But an entire game really can't live on that alone.I so desperately miss City of Heroes.   This game simply can't fill the role, and doesn't seem like it tried despite being a Cryptic game.  You'd think they'd have a clue.			"

												The game is well made and a lot of fun, but there are MANY things that make me dislike it, which is sad as it's being done by Cryptic Studios after the fall of City of Heroes. I was a player on those servers and I felt betrayed by NCSoft and I once tried this game, but it wasn't the same and now coming back to it...it's still not the same.My major gripes with the game are as follows:- Story Arcs are un-interesting and I feel no deph when playing them. The begining was interesting where you fight a simulated past where Aliens invaded and the heroes fought them off, but back in the city none of the other storys hit a cord with me at all. Fighting the purple gang can get very boring as they are simple mafia thug rip-offs like The Family from CoH.- VERY limited power uses till later levels. When you start you end up with 3 powers you use over and over which works well when playing with a controller, however it means you're very limited in your abilities as you use weak attacks to build up stamina for better, bigger attacks, but you are still limited to only a few attacks.- UI is pretty ugly IMO. The chatwindow is quite small and I often find people DON'T seem to use it. One irritating thing is when pressing F12 for a screen shot you highlight all the UIs to stretch and alter if you wish so you atleast have a option to modify it somehow.- The paywall is disgusting. Where as with City of Heroes you can combine all kinds of powers to make your own hero, in this one if you go free you get a group of Archetypes to choose from (most locked away behind a paywall as well), but if you want to mix and match to make your own unique hero you either subscribe or buy a freeform slot which costs as much as a brand new game! Not only that, but the freeform only gives you access to the powers you have already unlocked so if you have not unlocked any other archetypes then that's even MORE money to go though.Pros:- I enjoy the animation style. It's a lot of fun at times and the travel powers work quite well too and you get them earlier on than CoH which helps alot when going around the city.- Costume customisation is one of the few things they did right that they took from City of Heroes and is almostly limitless in it's customisation. Plus, if you unlock things like capes and so on, you can use on a new character which I like that they did this as a global unlock.It's a ok game and if you want to play a super hero MMO, you could do worse. It doesn't fall into the trap of DC Online where you are more imitating a famous super hero than actually becoming one yourself. If you're like me and really miss CoH then I can't recognise this as it will only scratch the barest of that itch as the restrictions and uninteresting storylines will get you bummed out. I'd instead suggest you wait for City of Titans or many other creations that are on their way.Here is the titan's website for those who might be interested: http://www.cohtitan.com/forum/index.php "

												Could be a lot of fun, the 15 a month asking price is ludicrous and the company that owns the IP now (Cryptic) is no better than the previous one (Funcom) when it comes to execution and customer service... Which is to say that they suck and don't seem to have any real interest in doing anything with the game but milking happenstance gamers. As with most of these F2P models the game is far more expensive than a AAA title if you want full functionality which I think it just a dishonest business practice used by so many of these guys. The character creater is the strongest point in the entire game, it's absolutely amazing what you can do, even with the dated graphics. I suggest anyone who is into paper doll stuff give at least that aspect a go, but don't be fooled, it's not an f2p lv 1-40 and you're nice enough to pay them for a sub (which I did) you won't be able to use any of those characters again without an active gold sub.

												Just.. not worth it any more, i was one of the first of thousands to go gun ho over this game but as many of the reviewer's stated its.. just not worth it any more you get in, you make your character, right away the difference is obviousyou are given i believe 3 difference classes or ( power sets) not realy even that honestly its just a class that some developer descided you'd like, you pick one you customize your appearance, 2nd problem most of the good attire and customizations require micro transaction a 10.00 spend for very little so you picked your pyro class, your made some carbon copy hot head, now its time to play, wich you now get to enjoy the tutorial the only part of this game that sadly even has a descent storyline any more for free, it hooks you in you run through the city destroying insectoids and now welcome to the game, do the first 8 quests then que up for alerts until your 30, all the while having pre picked skills inserted into your character. that is your Free to play expierence in a nutshell unless...you descide to buy a freeform char token for 50.00 or subscribe for the monthly subscription and oh wait look at all the new things you can do the freedom! the customizations! you try that combo, mixing and matching powers to your hearts content, trying out all the costumes you had your eye on, your character looks and feels awsome finally its time to save the world of champions online right?... wrong do the tutorial once more, que up for 8 quests, hit lvl 5 or 15 wichever, then que up for alerts once more, sure the ability to pick and choose what you want because now you pay for the game is fun.. but ultimately even that 15 a month does not give you everything so you buy this little flight power.. or that little custome travel power... maybe that one extra costume.. or exansion before you know it you've spent over 50.00 your first month and you have nothing to show for it..whats sad is ive always dreamed of descent superhero games.. i love the idea of it.. and anybody who mentions DC universe... leave just go now,.. there is just no good hero games any more and champions realy could of been it had soo much potential in the old days but like most of the devs of game, the moment a big shot company offers money to buy it out, the creators could not wait to take the money and grease themselves up like some overzealous pig races, and so like everything else Perfect World Entertainment purchases, it becomes microtranactions and prostitutionbased game play so please if anybody descides to play this.. read the reviews the ones with the thumbs down are not lieing, this game realy is a horrid piece of trash that could of been great.. but fell far.. very far.

Anyway I can't remember anything else about the game. I think I had a good time, despite knowing that it's got all the F2P nonsense that slowly destroys my soul.			"

												welcome to: i have only almost 1000+ hours in this game the reviewso it's not exactly city of heroes, sure. but at least it isn't DCUO right.SOwhile CO isn't the best game in existance, it's still midly playable. to a degree anyway.yes, it has -some- p2w elements, but you can usually skip those if you're not a lazy POS who doesn't wanna buy an instant 30-thing from the z-store. (i wouldnt call sidekicks p2w? but they're helpful i guess.)while it could be worse, it's not as bad as some people play it out to be. new content wouldn't hurt.and some of the people are salty garbo, but there are some -lovely- people in the community, and i give props to them.hate it or love it, no one's forcing you to play. id give it a shot, see how you feel.edit: ive played more since this review. help.

												if your into being a modern age superhero you'll really like champions, gameplay is good. quests are chalenging as well as other areas of game, has pve/pvp. team up or solo quests. champions has been around along time. my friend, brother and i have been playing since the 80's, but thats with rulebooks and dice, if your into older rpg's also try justice inc another rpg made by hero games with rulebooks and dice.

												Considering of the biggest things about Super-Heroes is how they get around obviously they must have spent a lot of time balancing that. Why would anyone want Super-Speed when you can fly you might ask? Without verticality the whole game turns into a mess. But that's fine, you can get the ability to teleport! Or at least fly, whilst invisible. The game doesn't tell you that, if you go to pick it though. You could turn into mud, and slide around...which is cool... I guess. The only really viable movement is the Super-Jump, you fall forwards faster than Super-Speed allows people to run, you can ascend faster than people flying... It's a dumb system.			"

												Positive:1. Small tight-knit community, lots of dueling and PVP arenas, diverse and interesting PVE settings and challenges.2. Lots of character customization, in-depth costume generator/creator with a save-load function.3. Game is based on an actual pen & paper game (Hero System), has a fair ammount of both serious and casual roleplayers.4. New players will see all costume options. Yay!Negative:1. F2P players are restricted to preset Power Frameworks, Questionite farming can be tedious, lots of stuff hidden behind a paywall.2. With 700+ achievements and hundreds of unlockable costume pieces this game is a completionists nightmare.3. Inactive PVP arenas, obscure queue menues hidden with in other menus...			"

												Slow and buggy loader, needs restart to work. Awkard default controls, and no levels in which to learn the ropes, and  try and fix the controls.Many camera settings, too many camera settings, but not the right ones, no the ones you need to fix camera misbehaviour. When it decides to look down it keeps looking down, and you see only a small area. Makes it unplayable even after adjusting controls. Not a very social game. When you ask for help, no one responds. Keep asking for help, no one responds.Installing this junk is a complete waste of your time.			"

												This can be a fun game but its too simple.  While I do very much like the charector customization options(they are almost endless), I consider the game play to be too basic.  It seems to be made for kids/people with ADHD because none of the instances last more than a few minutes lol! I wouldnt recomend this to hard core gamers at all.  Its much better for younger gamers in my opinion(Yup, Im gonna get grief over that statement lol).  Anyway, I dont know whether to give this a thumbs up or thumbs down.  I think it depends upon your ""maturity"" as a gamer(is ""mature gamer"" an oxymoron?).Update almost 3yrs later; Tried to go back in and play the game again.  Nothing has changed.  Game is essentially dead, player wise(at least compared to what it was when I first posted my review).  It doesnt even appear as if much has been done to update the game or make it more dynamic.  Same exact quests, same exact everything.  The only major thing that seems to have been done to the game in three years is that options were REMOVED, not added.  Seems that I had many more choices of what kind of charector to play 3 years ago.  Now, most charector types have just one or two options available out of 6 or 8.  If you want any of the ones that arent offered, you have to pay for them.  There are still quite a few ways to customize the way that your charector looks but if you want to make any changes later-again, you have to pay for that.  Not a horrible game but just not interesting or involved enough for my tastes.  I still believe its a game that works better for a younger crowd.			"

												I used to play City of Heroes (CoH) on and off.  When Champions Online (CO) came out, I tried it, found it to be derivative of CoH, and the content seemed a bit too thin by comparison; CoH had been around for years, and the environment was absolutely immense and varied.  I suppose I didn't give CO a fair shake, as I only played it for a little over a week.  In a recent fit of nostalgia, I reinstalled this game, and found it to be quite enjoyable, though.  It's not the best MMO out there, but it is far better than DC Universe Online (it is painfully obvious that DCUO was written as a console game, but that's another review for another time).I'd give Champions Online a solid 7.5 / 10.  It is not the best MMO, but it is currently the best superhero MMO available.One caveat, though: be prepared to pay a subscription fee.  The game is very stripped down for free-to-play players, and it is prohibitively expensive to purchase the content one piece at a time.  A subscription is your best option.			"

												No, just no. This game is great for start. I can say it . Have a great potencial , good community . But, just BIG BUT when u first launch this game, you can pick between 8 ""archetypes"" ( classes ) . But there is more archytypes ( new 8 or 7 ) but I cant see them. Why ? Because this game just try to hide this P2W system. You cant get this classes for playing a game. You CANT . For free archytypes, this game is actually hard. Mobs dealing big dmg, and you can die in tutorial. But when u pick a not free archytype. There is no problem to do anything. They are literally just OP . Customization is for free player like none existent. But thats ok, no problem with that. Sidekicks, mean your ""NPC PLAYER friend only for real money. No problem. Travel power, for real money. No problem . But a ♥♥♥♥ing classes for 1175 zen = 18 E ( 9 E = 1000 zed ) . Or you can buy ""gold membeship"" to have all ""heroes"" . But still a ♥♥♥♥ing 15 e , for this ? + a character slots.... You have 2 and you need to buy another two for 1400 ! This game is just money grinder. Just a big money grinder. I still love this game. ITS SO AWESOME ! But this p2w archytypes just killing this game so hardly. Without friends, there is no chance to complete some Quests... But with not free archytype its no ♥♥♥♥ing problem. And quests. They are repatitive. Go there, kill this dudes. Go there, kill this dude. Go there , picked up some ♥♥♥♥ and go back. Or just go there, and save that dudes. Thats all . But ""all mission. whatever it is called is ♥♥♥♥ing great idea. Just prison break dungeon on a normal map. And that Team Up system in this location is great. But still :( I am so sad , I must say it. Really I am, i love this game. But... Just dont play it :(Pros + +Good community+With friend its a not that bad+If u dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about that p2w system. You will have a great time+Good ""free map dungeon"" quests+Good Team Up system+New style of wearing gear+Good tutorialNegative --You cant play few ""archytypes"" ( means free champs ) , who are not useless, but not that powerfull as a payed heroes-If u played it solo. Its so boring, some quests you CANT do alone, and you need it to progress-Repatitive dungeons, bosses dont have fasses. They just have one or two spells and thats all-Bad tank system, there is no AOE tank. So everytime when u play healer you will get so much dmg and you will be off tank-When u have group of 3 peoples + for exping. Its no challenge. You can play it with one hand and kill everybody-Nobody playing events, like PvP-If u wanna have a good custom. for heroes. You need to spend a lot of a ♥♥♥♥ing money-Vehicles are only if u pay... ( Dont worry , you have travel power ) but vehicles deal dmg !! And not small dmg-Dying community. This game just dying, there is no real challenge from players-No real enemys. There are just a few ""gangs"" thats a enemy for half of a game. Just gangs, like purple gang,maniacs,chines ninja dudes and stuff like that. - Stupid RESPAWN SYSTEM in some locations. Like enemys just respawned behind u and you are ♥♥♥♥edTHAT GAME HAVE A ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME POTENCIAL. Just do balance, do all heroes for new players. AND YOU WILL GET SO MUCH POPULAR :((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((My final verdict is.... Dont play it right now, just dont. You can play better games, there is a good community. But its.. Really closed and nobody playing this game that much. Secret P2W system. So rating ? 3/10. If they do rebalance. Free heroes for everybody. It can be 8+ But now. Its just..... I am so sad, because of this game. I love it, but at the same time. I dont love it :( Just....  DONT PLAY IT . You can play better games. If they do rebalance and all heroes for all players ... I will come back, to this game and do new review. But for now, thats all "

												I have played every major superhero offering in the MMO category. I try to be a fan since this is my favorite genre. But sometimes, it's just not meant to be.CO is based off of the pen-and-paper tabletop RPG of the same name. However, it's not translating well in more than a few areas. Don't let my log time fool you. I'm played way more than that as in months.The character creation is not the worse. It limits you as a FTP player in terms of the classes that you can choose but the customization is not too bad. From here, it simply creeps downhill.The content is the worst. It's cliched, trying-to-be-funny-but-isn't storylines that have absolutely no depth whatsoever. The limitations in terms of leveling is decidedly pay to play even WITH a subscription. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of love going on befind the scenes and the graphics are horrid in my estimation.

And, I have to say, I really enjoyed it for a long time.There were some kinks. Some systems didn't seem finished yet.

You have maps like The Southern Desert or The Canadian map.I found it very interesting that I can use my creativity to do anything I want to and to create and even change my character in the same time I play the game.Thrust me it is warth it spending your time.

												TL;DR: Definitely try it if you only want to Role-Play.===This game is at its best for role playing purposes.It's literally the only reason why I keep coming back to play it (occasionally). When I do, I just role play my characters with their respective story(ies). It's also fun to just click on random players around to check out their BIO (if they happen to have one of course, because not everyone plays this game for RP'ing). I've read some VERY creative stories for all types of characters. Some stories are so complex that the creator has a full Wiki-styled web page dedicated to detailing their characters. However, he in-game BIO has a character limit and you can't come up with more than about three long paragraphs of text until you hit the limit, and the formatting to create Bold or Colour text and so on also counts towards the characters limit count. So if you want to make a very fancy and elaborate BIO you'll hit the limit very fast at the cost of losing potential space to add details about your character's story.What's particularly great about this game's world is that - outside of its base / canon lore - you're still very much free at creating almost literally EVERY types of heroes and/or villains that you can imagine. You want to create a Cyborg, Robot, Demon, Angel, generic Metahuman with super strength, miniature butterfly guy who has the power of teleportation, a Vampire or an Alien with bunny ears and a guitar for accessory... just imagine it and you can most likely do it. The sheer number of possible characters from this game's creation system is - quite simply put - out of this world. There are NO other games currently available (MMOs or not) that can come remotely close to that kind of customization (INCLUDING your character's own BIO / back story if you want to invent one too outside of just making his appearance unique).Not to mention that there's the (in)famous Club Caprice, 'THE' place for Role-Players to meet. And if you're into more... shall I say ""complex"" RP'ing and need more privacy you can also just invite your partner to your own place. Indeed, there's Hideouts and you can invite players inside, be it a Penthouse or a Moon base, there's quite a good selection (some are smaller than others though).I'm just speaking about the Role-Playing aspect here, because I myself have pretty much ignored the ACTUAL ""game"" behind the curtain (to me, the real game in Champions Online IS the role-play, so everything else it offers IS behind the curtain) over the years. I've literally just leveled up ONE character to Level 35 and stopped there for the past two years now (max Level is 40). My other characters are Levels 25 and below. I just literally buy Hideouts, costumes and costume packs, costume Slots for my best characters, character Auras and so on, mostly due to Role-Play.So, coming from a (rather humble) role-player, I absolutely recommend this game. However, if what you're looking for is a good actual MMORPG and you cannot possibly care and won't even approach its RP capabilities then I do NOT recommend this. Instead I'd go for something else like Elder Scrolls Online, Black Desert or even Blade & Soul.			"

												The same programmers made City of Heroes and City of VIllains which was an excellent game, but is no longer available.  City of Heroes was the best superhero game ever, the AoE powers and gameplay was great for tank to herd and blasters to nuke.Champions Online was an attempt to make City of Heroes more of an action game, having to click each time you attack in a frantic/actionfilled manner, as opposed to City of Heroes where timing the powerset attacks was more the gameplay style.  In other words, Champions Online has more button pushing an less thinking.Champions Online is more of a fighting game than City of Heroes which was a action strategy role playing game.Too bad City of Heroes no longer exists.A game more similar to City of Heroes is DC Universe Online.I would play DC Universe instead, which is also free to play.Even with all that said, I would recommend this game to others if they like fast action button clicking, superhero genre, and free to play.

												What a waste of time. This has one of the worst character creation systems I've seen. Placing items in the beginning menu for character creation, only to take them away because they haven't been bought is just ridiculous. It's a thinly veiled attempt to hook you and make you pay for the look you really want, even though its already as basic as it gets. DC Online offered a far better system at no cost whatsoever. If you want to play a superhero MMO, play DC Online. You still have to pay for stuff, but at least you don't have to do it right at the start. You get a huge variety of things to pick from, more fighting styles, movement styles, etc. I won't waste another minute or megabyte on Champions Online.			"

												This game looks like babby's first MMO with mediocre models and textures and plays like twelve year olds with Stretch Armstrongs and Barbies in TRON. The characters are bland and steriotypical, the story is a joke, and with the right powerset, so are the enemies....BUT WHY DO I LOVE IT SO MUCH?!I recommend this game only because I clearly have a crippling addiction to it and doing otherwise would be hypocritical, because as of writing this, I am actively working to add to my already 320+ hours of gameplay. Please send help.Oh, the free to play options are garbage, though. It completely strips away the only truly enjoyable part of this atrocity of a game, which is the raw, unchained, absurd customizability of your character's powers.			"

												This game is in every way shape and form a step back from a game that already came out 10 years ago - City of Heroes. Why they decided to continue Champions Online and completely shut down CoH completely baffles me, I guess the microtransaction model was already in place for Champions so it seemed more profitable. Regardless, I've lost all respect for the company for selling out like that.Basically the game is your standard free to play microtransaction bullcrap that plagues the market today. Some of the ploys they use to get money are laughable. For instance, when you build your first character, there will be items included in things such as a Halloween pack and a dryad pack that allow you to select them without having an indicator by their name that you have to purchase them (even though there are other items that are selectable such as Ancient Armor cosmetics, which clearly state they must be purchased) - so basically it tricks you into thinking those items are selectable and available for your character, then once you are done finishing your character it pops up a dialogue saying you have items that must be purchased otherwise they will not show in game, because it turns out (shock) that you have to pay for things like the halloween pack and dryad pack... what an absolutely scummy way of trying to trick users into paying. On top of that the character creation is just a huge step down from CoH, half the items when you put in certain combos and certain scalings (common ones I might add) have awful looking graphical glitches like a shoulder pad having your shoulder pop right through it and show visibly from the outside. On top of that, when you get into the actual game, it's cell shaded (even though the character creation screen WAS NOT) and you basically get a character that doesn't even look like what you created.In general the cel shaded graphics look like ♥♥♥, and it is also a huge step backward from the already gorgeous game with 10 year old graphics - CoH.There are also less than half the choices for unique and cool skill sets that CoH had, which is ridiculous. The only melee classes are weapon classes, so forget the cool things such as claws and spikes.Combat is awful, and leveling up is dumbed down, basically they made this game for people that don't want to worry about building a character rpg style, and just want to play some mindless arcade-like game.The game has half the character and passion the original game had, it's really sad to see this is what is left of the once glorious CoH.If you want to play a free-to-play mmo with superheros (or any mmo with superheros for that matter) the DC Online game is the only way to go. It's not perfect, but it's better in every way shape and form than this lackluster game ""Champions Online"" is.Don't waste your time with this game, it's trash.			"

The only melee classes are weapon classes, so forget the cool things such as claws and spikes.Combat is awful, and leveling up is dumbed down, basically they made this game for people that don't want to worry about building a character rpg style, and just want to play some mindless arcade-like game.The game has half the character and passion the original game had, it's really sad to see this is what is left of the once glorious CoH.If you want to play a free-to-play mmo with superheros (or any mmo with superheros for that matter) the DC Online game is the only way to go. It's not perfect, but it's better in every way shape and form than this lackluster game ""Champions Online"" is.Don't waste your time with this game, it's trash.			"

												Sit on a cactus. You feel that? Believe it or not what you just did is more fun (and less painful) than playing Champions Online.After my beloved City of Heroes got shut down I decided to try this thing. Played it for a solid month and got bored before that month was up. It has the most tedious combat of any MMO I have ever played. All attacks auto hit, no real strategy to speak of. Just stand and button mash. In CoH you could strategize by enhancing powers with damage, accuracy, range etc. There was the chance attacks would miss. You had to be careful what to use and when. Here it's just pew, pew, pew mindlessly.I wanted a telekinetic character. It's bloody annoying to throw one single object. Click the object, click to lift, click on target, click to throw! Click, click, click, click for one attack that won't even one shot an even level trash mob! The mechanics of this game are boring and a chore.Most content is stuck behind the pay wall. Problem is that unlike DC Universe Online (where a sub can be worth it) you'd just be paying for a boring game rather than playing a boring game for free. I've no idea what the Marvel MMO is like but if you want to be a hero play DC Universe Online or simply mourn COX's demise.The only one tiny good thing about this game is the sheer choice of travel powers. Not worth it. Sod the cactus, stick a fork in your eye. Still less painful than Champions Online.			"

												Champions Online: Free for All is the standard base-building, tower defense/offense game that you've seen about a hundred times before, but this time it's got a thin veneer of the CoD franchise sprayed on top. The ""Champions"" bit comes from the fact that some of the leading characters of the previous games in the franchise will show up to help boost your forces. The usual leveling system has been implemented, complete with in-app purchases to make it go faster, all the way up to $99.99 (almost double the cost of the latest console game). Way to be subtle, fellas.			"

												Wow, there's some harsh critisizm hanging around from people who didn't even give the game the time of day.I've played a great many MMOs in my time and Champions is the only one I always come back to. Nothing beats the feeling of just swinging/running/flying through the city beating up bad guys and saving civillians.I orginally got into this came when I was looking for a replacement to fill the Freedom Force shaped hole in my heart and I've been playing on and off ever since.  I even survived the buyout from PWE.  The game has gone through a lot of changes and not all of them are positive, but there's still plenty of reasons to play.Some good points:>Walking through the door, you have access to create your hero's every physical aspect.  Rather than choosing between one of 8 premade faces and skin tones, you have hundreds of options available to you (And yes you have more if you choose to buy them).  On top of that you have thirty odd sliders to change the size, shape, and detail of every choice you've made.>Also walking through the door, your hero can already fly.  Or have super speed, or teleport.  You don't have to wait until you hit X level before you can get a mount.> You feel like a super hero.  You can fly, when you punch guys you can send them flying, You can have lazer eyes or breathe ice. You can be indestructable or set yourself on fire.>You can make just about any hero you can dream up. They have some set archatypes that function as pre-built 'classes' that give you a few choices but have a solid theme or power set, but the real joy is in going freeform and making your very own hero drawing from any power set you want.  You want to make a Speedster that weilds a sword and uses his friction to throw fire? Done. Do you want to be a robot ninja with a shotgun? Done. Psychic Dinosaur from Outer Space? Got you covered. Even the sky isn't the limit.>The story is very comic booky and has a self-aware sense of humor.>They are frequently releasing new comic book stories, events, costume parts, and even power sets.>The player base is friendly and supportive.  More so than any other online game I've played.  Other players are actually happy to help you or tell you how to get the cool thing they have or to talk characters.A few Bad things:>Yes, the game is F2P.  That means you 'can' play without giving them money.  No, you will not have access to all the bits and bobs and cool things as some of the other players do. However,  If you are willing to devote time to the game, you can in fact get everything that paying players can by selling in-game currencies for real money.>The graphics are a little behind what would be considered the norm at the moment. This being said, it dose make it easier to run on older computers.>The amount of front-loaded personalization can seem intimadating when starting out.  Just jump in, you'll figure it out.  And dont' be afraid to make a mess.In closing, if you don't like the Super-Hero genre, this game probably isn't for you. If makeing choices or customizing your own character sounds like too much work for you, you'd probably be happier elsewhere.  But if you do love Comic Books and are the creative sort, and spending hours on end designing, redesigning, and playing your very own superheroes sounds like your kind of a fun time, this could be one of the best games you'll ever buy... or not-buy.

												It has its low points but overall its still pretty enjoyable while I havent explored every aspect of the game the main scenarios are pretty fun theres multiple sandboxes to play in so when you get bored with one you can just hop in another theres also alerts that unlock at lvl 10 for fast leveling if thats what you want. I think people complain about vehicles because they havent gotten one yet once you have one you cant help but love it. It's advised to atleast get gold membership for one month just to try out all the archtypes and find one you like and then you can just purchas that archtype instead of wasting money on something that doesnt work for you or you could just keep the gold membership going. Character customization isn't so much detailed as it is vast there are tons of mix and match pieces you can use to build your hero and several options to add glows to certain costume parts and eyes.

												Well, this is just sad. I had truly hoped that this game would live on and grow bigger. I stopped playing a while back when the game offered so much. I'm almost baffled by the fact that the devs have not only restricted almost 100% of new content to paying customers, but they took STUFF THAT WAS ALREADY FREE and added a price tag on it. There is no justification for that. Once upon a time, this game offered free-to-play users a perfect alternative for those looking for a superhero game. Now, it doesn't offer anything above a taste, if even that.I cannot stress this enough: Don't play this game. If not for the fact that it's a waste of your time now, then for the principle. They took a perfectly fine game. A game that I was surprised at for being so full and colorful. And now it's dull. These devs ruined something good, and they don't deserve our time. 0/10 all the way.			"

												If you need a superhero fix after City of Heroes was shut down, this'll probably do.System requirements seem a bit higher than City of Heroes, so you might need an upgrade if City of Heroes was near the peak of your system's performance.The game world doesn't feel as well-developed as City of Heroes was, the pay barriers seem quite obvious, and when loading into maps and missions you might notice in the top-left corner that it still needs to download additional assets that weren't downloaded in the launcher when patching.All in all it's a second-rate competitor to City of Heroes but since that was shut down it's a first-rate superhero-based mmo.

												Now. Before I start I would like to state that even though I have spent 15.5 hours on this game, I know how fun it is to play since I got to level 17 within 10 hours (First character leveling problems since I had no idea what to do)Anyway after deleting my first character which was a Soldier (I hate that class now) My friend convinced me to make a new character with her. So I did. I made a Unleashed which is a dualwielder and after my 5.5 hours playing on this character I can say I am very much enjoying leveling up with my friend and doing alerts (Helps with leveling a lot since you get a xxx xp given for defeating the boss and a 1 hour xp boost.) I would recommend this game for people who like game like DC Universe online as I feel it has the same feeling as it.Pros-Good CustomizationGood CombatFun LevelsFun BossesFun Character DesiginsBetter with FriendsGood musicCons-Some Classes feel underpowered while some feel overpoweredMay be hard going soloNot being able to run up the side of buildings (How is it possible to get to the tops of roofs with enemies on when there is no roof door around. The only way I found is jumping on the ledges that hand out)So overall I recommend this game for people who like Superheroes and MMORPGS "

												Champions Online is a 3D superhero themed fantasy MMORPG set in Millennium City which used to be pay to play with a free trial, but officially went fully free to play with a cash shop and subscriber option on January 25, 2011.I recommend it for gamers with a love for deep character customization and awesome gameplay.

												If you want to play a retrofitted piece of garbage that was originally meant to be Marvel Universe online that was scrapped when Microsoft pulled the plug on support for Cryptic, then this is it.Outdated game play and a now a cash grab, its just not worth it to get pulled into, nor any other PWE game.

												Though I quickly became bored of Champions Online, I recall it having very in-depth visual customization, as well as character setup. In the style of the City of Heroes games, you could mix and match powers to create your ideal superhero. It also had a fairly appealing, in-your-face comic book style look to it, with bright colors and heavy cel-shading outlines. It's probably still worth playing if you'd like an alternative to the stale fantasy MMOs.			"

												Better hope your wallet is deeper than hillary clintons criminal record, or else you're kinda boned. This game would be nicer if your unboxed items didnt have to sit with one character.ya know, unless you feed the gaping mouth of the devs  more money.vehicles are not account wide,nor are auras (two of the only worthwile things to get in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boxes anyway).and the chance of getting anything decent is drastically small.If the greed wasnt so high, i would reccomend this.or if the game had any good standing content for levels 10-30.

I tried looking for a solution online and everything was pointing to it actually being my computer even tho I can run every other game I have ever tried to play and it works just fine. Hell even DCUO runs perfect on almost top settings, which im assuming is similar to this game, seeing as ive never actually played this.

												I played this for several hours to to earn the Christmas achievement back in 2011, when Valve was rewarding us with coal for them. Had it not been for that I would not have stayed with the game nearly so long. It's a very generic game, not particularly good looking or with much character to speak of, and the gameplay is entirely forgettable. WoW has the sheer size of its player base and content developed over the years, TERA has an enjoyable combat system, but this game has nothing to hold your attention unless you really, really love superheroes (and not even any actual comic book ones).

												The game itself is decent, admittedly it was a step back from City of Heroes/VIllains (becoming something closer to a generic MMO). The gameplay itself isn't bad, but the F2P setup is downright appalling. You lose out on the customization if you decide not to pay the monthly fee (the game isn't good enough to warrant the fee). Instead, I recommend DCUO, while not stellar, it did a much better job of allowing you to make the character you wanted.			"

												Not to be underestimated.Ever since the fall of, ""City of Heroes/Villians"" I've been wandering the internet, looking for a game that can quench my thirst for.. Justice! Champions Online does that very well, you have the choise of many possible powers from; Dual Gunning/Katana to Mental Telepathy/Power Suit, which sometimes makes me pout in frustration because there is so much to choose from. The thing that makes this game shine the most is the customization in both your look and powers if you Subscribe ($15 Month USD), buy a Lifetime Subscription ($299.99 USD), or buy a Free Form Slot ($50 USD), you are able to literally combine powers to make a super hero in your image.  For Free Users the game is still fun and customizable just a little limited, Free users choose their, ""Archtype Powers"" which is a set of powers that are already created from the start and have an ability layout, Free Users are also limited to costume peices but have alot to choose from the start. If you want more costume peices you can get them by; Cash Shop, Enemy Drops, Quests and Events. The game is very balanced for both Paying and Free players there is no Pay to Win at all! I've seen a lot of F2P Players whoop P2P Players super hero butts no problem. All and all I say you should really try this game, reviews help but experiencing the game cuts the cake!			"

Downsides: Cutscenes, roleplayers, and u have to pay for gold subscription fee majority of the fun. not a huge community. limited character slots early on (unless gold membership).Upsides: Most in depth character customization with an unbelieveable amount of freedom and personalizing ive ever witnessed in a game for both looks and skills. probably over billions of combinations of abilities to pick for your freeform characters. Very high replayibility value (hence why there are so many people with over 5000+ hours logged into the game).Very flexible, diverse, hands on, smooth and responsive combat system thats fun in both pve and pvp (duels, arenas, etc).

												Champions online is a comic book super hero MMO where you can create your own super hero as well as your own nemesis.Pros: extremley deep customization system, which allows you to customize your Hero all the way down to the colors of your weapon Very useful and cool travel powers, From flying all the way down to super speed Interactable enviornment, use whats around you to defeat for enemys, pick up benches, trash cans, even cars and throw them to do massive damage. New alerts everyday, It is  extremely rare  to see the same alert twice, so there is always a differnt thing you can stop  super villans from doing Generally fun and engaging gameplay to keep you interrested for hours upon hours, and it will always have you coming back.Cons: A majority of the time, the game is a total grind fest. You have to be a gold suscriber to get any extra hero classes  Tons of micro transactions.Total rating: 7/10, congrats Cryptic, Your first good game!  "

												FIrst, let me say that even though I recommended it, I wish I could give a neutral. I played the game when it was first released, when it was Pay2Play, and it was okay then. There was a feeling of more freedom in creating your characters, but I felt the questing was worse back then. And once Perfect World took over and it went Free2Play the character creation was more linear, without paying, but the questing got better, in my opinion.The game is fun, but it's not great. It has a decent amount of content, but lacks in late game from what I have heard. Haven't got that far myself.Good character creation. With the time I have in the game I'd say probably around 10 hours of it was playing with the character creator, even with me not having access to all of the costume pieces. You have to pay for most costume pieces. Or you can sub to get all from what I've been told. Never done it myself.Fun powers. The powers in the game are quite interesting and for the most part feel different from the others. However you only get 10 powers free, which is pretty alright. But that does leave the other 17 locked away. You can get them by paying for each one, getting a subscription, or using ingame currency and converting it into real money currency which takes quite some time. You can also get Freeform characters, which is a a way of mixing powers together. You want to shoot ice and breathe fire? Use Freeform. But that isn't (always) free. If I remember correctly a single Freeform character slot cost $50. You can also do a sub and Freeform becomes available. Or they will sometimes give them away for free, that's how I got mine.From what I have played the game has 3 major zones. The city, a Desert, and the Canadian Wilderness (or a frozen wasteland), and all of the areas have some fun things going on, or at least have some interesting things to look at. Now, I realize that 3 zones seems small, but the zones themselves are a decent size. In all the time I have in the game I still have not fully explored any of the zones, granted I do switch, delete, and create characters often.Overall this is my favortie Perfect World owned game, the only one I like actually. I recommend this game, but I still wish I could give a neutral.			"

												This isn't a terrible game but I find it to get boring fast. I understand they were going for a comic feel but it comes off as childish. While I love the power options and the ability to create a hero from scratch it tends to make PVP a bust and still make it an ""energy dump"" game. For instance, if you want to be strong you just hit your energy builder on auto then hit your best skill to dump the energy. Aside from a few heals or defensive abilities, maybe a pet (there are few pets) You find yourself really just using 2 skills.			"

												The game had a lot of potential to be the best Superhero MMO out there, the customization options were endless, the Nemesis feature was really promising, the universe it was based on was a remarkable and fresh universe compared to the tired dc and marvel heroes we have seen again and again and the stories it featured were really interesting until......Until Perfect world entertainment took over and decided to simply milk the shop for as long as it lasts. The game now only features broken and buggy missions, unbalanced pvp, no support and the only new content would be two or three laughable word missions every millenium along with a underwhelming alert. All of which are served as a way to pitch to the players more crap from the shop like useless vehicles........			"

												Well, if you like MMOs and superheroes, you're in for a treat. As far as FtP MMOs go, this is probably the best one I've played. There's plenty of content and it doesn't really restrict you too much for playing free. Although obviously if you drop dosh you're gonna get more features, everything gameplay-wise is fine. You can play the whole game and make it to the end without ever having to pay for a thing. As far as I'm concerned, anything free is worth at least one try.			"

												Yay!  Another FTP MMO!Although my firends love it, I can't seem to get involved in MMOs longer than a week; tops.This one has a lot of character creation prospects, but is just more grinding befroe lazing about the town square with all the other level-maxed people showing off your powers.

												This game can be a lot of fun with friends. The character creation options are very impressive. You can spend a ton of time designing a perfect hero and as you progress in the game, costume unlocks will become available to you randomly or through other means.  Along with this, the places that you can travel around are huge so if you're the kind of person that likes to travel around this is a definite plus.  With friends you can take down bosses with ease, conquer different crime organizations, and enjoy the plots your character is tied into.Without friends you can do the same, but it may not be as fun, especially with the Alert system and weekly events that take place.  Some events need good teamwork and organization to pull off, but if you don't have friends that are interested in playing or available, the community in game are more than kind enough to assist those in need.  Not only that, but the sheer amount of different appearances of heroes may spark more creativity for your character (or nemesis once you reach a certain level).The downside is that this game has a ton of costumes, devices, and most recently vehicles that will cost a pretty penny to obtain with real money. There are methods to obtain most in game, but it will require a lot of grinding for resources that is a pain.  Vehicles are probably the most annoying to try to obtain without actual cash since they reduce the time it takes to get from one end of a map to the other by at least half according to a few people, but are possibly the most difficult to get.  If you need to get to a place fast, such as a friend that is fighting a boss in the corner of the desert while you are at the south end of Canada, it will take forever to reach your friend to help without improved travel powers or a vehicle.  However, the vehicles are not required to play the game or progress your character to max level, so while it is a downside, it isn't a big one.Overall it's still a fun game to play. If you have a decent computer and like being a superhero, give it a try. If you have a friend that likes being a superhero bring them along as well. The more the merrier!			"

												Not to be underestimated.Ever since the fall of, ""City of Heroes/Villians"" I've been wandering the internet, looking for a game that can quench my thirst for.. Justice! Champions Online does that very well, you have the choise of many possible powers from; Dual Gunning/Katana to Mental Telepathy/Power Suit, which sometimes makes me pout in frustration because there is so much to choose from. The thing that makes this game shine the most is the customization in both your look and powers if you Subscribe ($15 Month USD), buy a Lifetime Subscription ($299.99 USD), or buy a Free Form Slot ($50 USD), you are able to literally combine powers to make a super hero in your image.  For Free Users the game is still fun and customizable just a little limited, Free users choose their, ""Archtype Powers"" which is a set of powers that are already created from the start and have an ability layout, Free Users are also limited to costume peices but have alot to choose from the start. If you want more costume peices you can get them by; Cash Shop, Enemy Drops, Quests and Events. The game is very balanced for both Paying and Free players there is no Pay to Win at all! I've seen a lot of F2P Players whoop P2P Players super hero butts no problem. All and all I say you should really try this game, reviews help but experiencing the game cuts the cake!			"

												I have played this game before, just recently got it on steam - hence the time spentThe character creation is probably the best I've ever seen in any FTP MMORPG title yet. It's so diverse and there are just so many choices to choose from, I loved it. Literally most of the time I spent in the game was character creation. On other things, it's quite an average mmorpg, typical for the genre, however quite fun. It doesnt bring anything innovative when it comes to gameplay (maybe besides throwing things - that's cool). The aspect that you can explore a rather large world is very nice, I enjoyed that a lot. Cool quests, not very repetitive - the world isnt as interactive as I'd perhaps like, but it's fine.  PROS Great character creationNice, large worldQuests arent repetetiveFun combatLarge selection of customizable classes to choose fromOpen Quests CONS You dont see your full costume straight awayHas fairly annoyijng p2w aspectsYou can't select a special power that you get from the start (I mean flying, of course I do)Gets a bit grindy at stagesOverall I give this a solid 79/100, One of the best MMOs out there today, definetly wortha try if you're into superheroes and badass looking helmets "

												For  those  missing  the  hole  left  their  heart  by  the  departure  of  City  of  Heroes,  Champions  Online  can  help  fill  in  the  gap....a  little  bit.  In  many  ways,  the  game  has  a  much  different  feel  than  the  average  MMO,  such  as  a  need  to  be  more  precise  in  targetting.  While  ranged  characters  retain  auto-aim,  melee  is  more  about  actually  aiming  strikes.  The  character  creator,  though  more  limited  than  City  of  Heroes,  has  a  vastly  larger  number  of  customization  options  than  the  average  MMO,  as  opposed  to  some  popular  MMOs  like  DCUO  and  SWTOR.  The  game  has  major  short  comings  however  in  that  it  is  very  relient  upon  teaming  up  with  other  players,  and  some  difficulty  spikes  can  make  the  game  a  nightmare  to  try  and  play.  It  also  is  a  very  cartoony  and  comic  book  styled  MMO,  so  don't  expect  a  serious  story.  If  you're  look  to  fart  around  with  a  better  character  creator,  you  could  certainly  do  worse  than  Champions  Online.  But  if  you  really  want  to  play,  you're  better  off  waiting  for  City  of  Heroes  to  be  re-released  as  City  of  Titans  in  2015.			"

												It's free, so it's hard to beat on price. Without paying there is a still a lot of content to try. The absolutely stunning part of this game is Character Creation - set yourself a few hours for this. You design everything about your Superhero (though some powers locked off for free players) from costume, backstory and eventually Nemesis. Hipster Girl (""You've probably never heard of her"") has had a lot more fun doing the standard MMORPG quests, due to the investment I've put into the character.One small point I'd like to draw attention too , is how much a joy this is to play with a Xbox gamepad. It's been implemented really well, and unlike how I've seen it done in any other MMORPG.The only Mar to all this, is that it is a standard MMO, beneath the good writing. Expect fetch and kill quests, but as a fun thing to demo - go for it.			"

												If you're like me and you're into toku, look somewhere else, any sort of customization to your character requires that you start buying stuff. The character custimization is unnecessarily confusing from the get go as well as sometimes items just decide whether or not they want to appear.Like literally, sometimes you'll be looking through the options and there won't be half the amount that should be there, so you have to reload the game.

												Champions Online is one of the most enjoyable free to play MMO's you will ever pick up. If you're a fan of superheroes, or supervillains, you can trust that this will be the only game out there that lets you not only play however you want to play, but be whoever you want to be. You can create whatever kind of hero you want, from flying, cape wearing, tight laiden superheroes with slick hair and super strength, to disgusting bettle creatures with poisonous spit.Now, there are disadvantages to being free to play, but not in the sense that you think. Free to play is limited in what archetypes you can choose for your base character type, which, admittedly, is somewhat limiting in itself. However, starting the game with an archetype is most likely the best way to learn and master the game (learn how to block).Subscribers get way more than what they pay for in sheer content. But the one thing that's absolutely worth the 15$ a month is the freeform character that you can only have as a sub. Freeform lets you be what you want to be. It's totally worth it, but it's not easy to figure out right off the bat, and freeform demands a bit of game knowlege and role knowlege before you can just jump into your own custom hero with whatever powers you fancy. This game is worth your time, and in my opinion certainly worth your money. SO get it peeps!			"

												It's hard to give this game a recommendation, but I'm going to do so on a basis that I'll explain below.I disagree, it's not necessarily pay to WIN as it is pay to have fun as you see fit. I do think it's ridiculous I'd have to pay money to pick a character class that I do want to play (though I've found some love for The Mind and The Blade archetypes) and, yes, slightly ludicrous that I have to pay for certain aesthetics. Gameplay-wise, the game is as linear as I'd expect of any MMO. Combat is basically all keybinds and dodging area specific attacks. Things become slightly more enjoyable when you know what your class is supposed to be doing, in my opinion. That said, it winds up devolving into raids at some point, like most MMOs. I find myself having less customization than I did in City of Heroes. Still, the character creator IS top notch and you do have a lot of flexibility there, so the game deserves credit for that.Would I recommend this game purely on gameplay? No. It can get clunky, it's not the most immersive on the planet and you do have to break some paywalls if you want to play it as you'd like. The community isn't too hot either. The point I was going to make: I find myself mostly role-playing and getting into character to pass time. It does make the game more enjoyable if you have a good group to get involved with, but like I said above, the community isn't great. It's almost essential to join a super group/guild in order to find said group as most people have the social skills of a malevolent parasite, are searching for E-RP (erotic roleplay) or are too elitist to involve anyone they perceive as an outsider or new. Still, I'm biased, I did find a good group myself, so it's not completely farfetched for others to do the same. On the basis of an extensive character creator and role-play potential, I recommend this game. Beyond that, it's best to explore other alternatives. You can tell the company gave up on this game a long time ago.			"

												So I have played this game quite a bit.  really like it enough to buy a free form slot for 50 dollars.  I love how this game captures the feel of being a superhero. Hope it sticks around.  Either way I feel it is worth playing.  The sidekicking system makes it easy to play with others both higher and lower level than you are.  Tons of fun and I love all the funny lines in the world.  makes fun of hero comics while being a hero game at the same time.My favorite line from an NPC is :  I don't trust heroes that why I carry Heat!. So funny the NPC states this while walking around an area with lots of villians.			"

												It's free, so it's hard to beat on price. Without paying there is a still a lot of content to try. The absolutely stunning part of this game is Character Creation - set yourself a few hours for this. You design everything about your Superhero (though some powers locked off for free players) from costume, backstory and eventually Nemesis. Hipster Girl (""You've probably never heard of her"") has had a lot more fun doing the standard MMORPG quests, due to the investment I've put into the character.One small point I'd like to draw attention too , is how much a joy this is to play with a Xbox gamepad. It's been implemented really well, and unlike how I've seen it done in any other MMORPG.The only Mar to all this, is that it is a standard MMO, beneath the good writing. Expect fetch and kill quests, but as a fun thing to demo - go for it.			"

The best MMO I've ever played...which isn't saying much, I guess. However, even with all the beat-em-up differences of DC Universe Online, even that can't save it from feeling too much like an MMO.

IDk maybe I will play again but I have to really be into it.Overall this game is fun and occupying and atleast worth a try in what I like like to call the Oddest as hell F2P steam library. the game is easy to play and gets you in the action from the moment you are done customizing your character (Make sure you ready all the good snacks while playing this game) . the maps are preety huge and there is almost always a quest or side quest to do in the game so you never have to worry about quests being too spaced apart. I say try the game!, for some people they like chicken everyday but others like a good steak or something else tasteful, you never know untill you've try it. "

												This is the MMO version of the Hero System games superhero universe ""Champions"". It is free to play, and in a good way. You get access to all of the zones and can level to 40 along with the subscribing customers. The only limitation is that you must play a pregenerated power set called an Archetype. However, you are still in full control of your character's appearance. Character customization in this game is incredible. There is a wide variety of costumes to choose from, and there is also a wonderfully detailed system for changing your character's physical dimensions and facial features. It really is a fun little game for a freebie, and I daresay worth the price of subscription just to have access to the Freeform character slots that let you pick and choose your powers yourself.

												_THE_ best MMORPG I have ever played so far. Great customizability, nice gameplay, funny missions, thousands of cross-references, awesome adventure packs, the list goes on.However, be warned that PvP is far from balanced, though there are some great PvP events that are loads of fun, like the zombie attack! Also, bear in mind that this is a marvel/dc superhero kind of game.But all in all, I'd always recommend giving this game a try - and if you like it, you can always upgrade to gold member to unlock fully customizable powersets, a huge buttload of new costumes and a crazy lot of other things. Don't feel like paying for a subscription? Well don't! Everything you gain by subscribing can also be purchaes in the C-store to be permanently unlocked for silver members!Shoot enemies with fire, lightning, guns, a rocket launcher or orbital bombardement, tear them apart with your waraxe or chainsaw gauntlet - in this game, everything goes.

												Ive played this game on and off since its free to play release and i can say its a good time. if you joyed neverwinter give this a shot, the gameplay is very similar. If you just wanna make your own crazzy ♥♥♥ combination of skills character then this game is for you too. The variety, silly comic book asthetic and momments give this game some life and uniqueness to it. Pros:Unique fun and sillyGame that can bring any crazy ♥♥♥ idea of a super power to life. (mine was a flamboyant dude that killed people with his Ego)good sense of freedom with a decent bit of direction.An assload of powers to chose from and ways to play them. you can do damage with your mind, heal others with your mind, crowdcontrol, tank, displace, all using the mind based tree. so many things you can do with each theme is really awesome.Crazy ♥♥♥ customization, wanna be a power armor wearing super shark from planet go ""f*ck your self?"" You can!Cons:Runs like ♥♥♥♥, even on powerful computers 6 years after its release you still see choppy frame rates and terrible popin.Even though it says free to play, the best experience with the game is paying the monthly subscription to play a free form character. meaning you can have any powerset any combination with any afinity for damage healing tanking ect ect.PVP is bad, to be expected for a game that allows you to make your own class, PvE is well balanced around it but you wont get far on PVP without some MLG pro build for pwning nooblords. (EgostormFTW!)The community gravitates to wards the badside, nothing as bad as league of legends or DOTA2 but I'd say beware.			"

												Well. If u have money and would like to spend it on something really funny this game is 10/10. The problem is it sucks so bad if u dont have money to spend F2P is garbage,. u dont have anything. Freeform (characters that can choose any skills from any other archtypes and build a character of their own) is so much better than any other archtypes. and honeslty if ur not a freeform . dont play it~			"

												So, throughout my years (yes years, I had this game with a different account) playing this, I've picked up a lot of good things and a lot of bad things. I'll tell them both and let you decide whether or not you want to play this game. For starters, the pros. -There is a huge community that's kind enough to answer a question you may have or if you just want to make sure. -There's a wide scale of things to do, whether it's leveling your created character or roleplaying with all types of other characters. -The game is pretty big when it comes to customization, you can basically make whatever you want, however you want. -The players who play this are awesome roleplayers, and are great at teaching most how to roleplay or to play in general (Kind of linking to the good community)-Rewards that make you feel like you earn something when you level up, like a great powerful attack or an aura that helps with bleed effect. Now here are some of the cons. -microtransactions, because almost every mmo has them. -Combat is lacking, almost making you snore when fighting this awesome badass alien bug. -Trolls, because every game has them period. -A small percentage (I'm talking like .02%) of the community are just douches to you no matter the reason (linking with the trolls) So really, when it comes down to it, it's a great roleplaying game but it lacks the combat system that games today have, like in the newer Grand Theft Autos or The Elder Scrolls Online, so there are a few give-and-take situations with this. I recommend this game if: -You are an avid roleplayer. -You have a creative imagination when it comes to original characters. -You have patience with few others. -You're into comic-style graphics that look pretty. I DON'T recommend this game if: -You're in it for the combat. -You don't have a sense of creativity. -You have very little patience with anything. -You absolutely HATE microtransactions. There's my thoughts on the game, feel free to let me know if I missed any pros and cons, and try the game out for yourself if you think you're interested.			"

												I will never play this game again. First of all, everything cost money! EVERYTHING! Character slots, tons of costume pieces, various powers, and much much more. The story is just cheasy and kind of lame. Voice acting goes the same. Some of the missions are just damn frustrating unless you have a friend along. I will admit the character creator is quite awesome though. DCUO is so much better than this greedy, frustrating game.			"

												This game really suprised me as an MMORPG. It's got a lot of character and allows for one of the most unique character creation systems in existence. Community is great and RP friendly and you are free to come up with any character look and powerset that you can think of.

												Alright I first have to praise this game before I have to talk about it's bad parts. The superhero factor of it I really think is brilliant. I'm not saying this as a sarcastic way, but there really aren't a lot of these games around. First off this game is free to play. Good. It is now turning into a bit more pay to play experience which is not great but the game you can still play 100% F2P. Now the controls. The attack functionality is alight, and I'll let it slide. But the movement is kinda weird. Now I've played other MMOS like RIFT, and WoW, and maybe it's just me but it just feels a bit weird. So I'll let it pass. Now to the gameplay side of things. I mean I won't batter this game because I haven't gotten to far. Al far as I can see is it does the missions like any MMO should do. By the way just going to get this out of then way it is much more fun playing these missions with a group or a friend. I almost forgot, one of the hugest things ever in this game is the character customization. Like maybe think of any superhero and you could probably duplicate it. Some people spend hours getting their characters just the way they like it. Another factor is the different type of classes. I both dislike and like how their isn't a lot to choose from or not a lot to choose from. But it makes you less overwhelmed over which class suits you. Like my first time playing WoW I didn't have any idea what to pick. Back to the point, in my opinion the fighting in the game is varied and I enjoy how everyone is a different class or at least looks different. Nobody has to use the same at is and things like that. Which is common in MMOS anyhow. The fighting is enjoyable and pretty fun. Bosses can be hard so when your friend joins along it makes the game more exciting and brings a new taste, to superhero MMOS. Anyhow this is me FunkyPug signing out. P.S. I typed this review on my iPad so any errors or mistakes I apologize greatly. "

												I do recomand this game because of the custimzation, you might find it has somewhat a comic book look but you can turn off the comic book highlighting to make it look more normal of a game, What I like is you can be anything you want with the charater creator, a mummy a vampire werewolf demon angel, mutant etc, you are not stuck to just a humaniod, you can be anything and the editor is better then stos thats for sure. Another thing about this game is it has a rp comunity.     Things that really can be annoying is the prices, not everything is free its more like swtor but better you can make zen by grinding for questnite but that takes time and its eaiser to buy with money stuff in the zen store, but another thing is they have a sub system that has benfits like unlimited charater slots, and with silver you have to buy slots, and its kinda costy and for freeform slots :( you have to use 5000 zen to get a slot for free foam and silvers have to buy some of the archtypes, Other then the costs of some of the important stuff its a good game and basically worth trieing if you want full access to all the benifits might want to go gold but you can make do with just silver. tuff.

												Oh, Champions Online. The combat in this game is mind-numbingly boring, but I can't stop playing it! You know why? Costumes. I do quests to make enough money to create more costumes. The story is meh, the combat is sluggish and floaty, the graphics are cartoonish. But, if you like customizing your look, this is a game you shouldn't ignore. Or maybe you should, because it will cost you real money to buy all the costume packs. Yeah, forget I said anything, you should probably move on.			"

The bad thing is that there are not so many players anymore but I hope that it will get better .The only issue I had with this game was that I couldn't recover my account since I couldn't remember the e-mail I used on it ... That's the same time i took a long break from the game since I've lost all my hard work and the time I've put in the game . Now , my old account is still froze in the Cryptic database , since I couldn't give them the email I used, to verify the ownership , even tho I gave them all the other Info I could ... That's a bummer . Again , it's a great game , fun , great comunity , epic customization and so on . Give it a try .			"

												this is the best, open world, super hero, create your own, rpg, in existance.sure it doesnt look as good as DCU or have as much voice acting and things like that but there are way more powers here and way more travel powers. and its its own thing and while the DC Universe is very rich and filled with many many wonderful things this is its own super hero thing with its own characters and locations.saddly you cannot play a villanin this, and worse this is online only and like City of Heros/Villans it is dyeing i belive.i logged in today. last time i played the starting urban area was packed and had atleast i think 8 or 9 other servers areas that where pretty full. the power training seprate area also had its own servers that where pretty full and the place was filled with colorful heros of all shapes sizes and powers. the 3 other main langs, canada, nuclear desert, tropical island (not there real names) also where filled with characters and had multiple servers of their own.i entered the power training area and saw it was terribly underfilled and clicking for other areas brought up a no avalible servers. so i checked the city. 3 servers and the most populated one had 14 people on. i went to the other 3 locations and they all had no servers of there own and while in the nuclear desert i dont think i seen one other character. this game is great. its fun, theres a load of custimization. but its barly hanging on. i would gladdly pay the price of a full game to get a offline capable version of this as is. even if it was just limited to the free to play choices which are still very many of. this should be a lesson:To game developers, make more games like this but make them singleplayer first and add in multiplayer. that way when the servers shut down and they will people can still enjoy them. also make them lan capable for hamachi and tunngle and the like.To players. all online games must die someday. first their was city of heros, then champions online, then DC Univsere. now COH is gone, city of titans on kickstarter got funded to create a spiritual sequal but it seems to be online only so that will die someday to unless they build it for singleplayer first for offline and modding support then add in multiplayer. now Champions Online has at most id guess around 25 people on maybe. maybe more but i doupt its 100 and its clearly no where near the large amount i used to see. someday DCU will be gone and if no other super hero games like it come out then we will be left with nothing. as said theres city of titan but online games die as much fun as they are and as much as u spend (unless u spent like billgates amount) the game will be gone. so get on this game and try it out have fun and enjoy it while it lasts atleast for abit. and the games you play later enjoy them to their most search under every nook and cranny, go outside of your comfort zone and play a new way sometime, play hide and seek or tag even if you want ive done that on wow and wizard 101 its fun to do lol.its sad to see it like this. it hurts me it does. there are so many things ive never gotten to do or see missions left un ran never maxed my level. maybe they will just keep its servers up and running forever backed by steam or maybe can get offline mode or the ability to host our own servers to play on or something (99.9% unlikely).best super hero game ever.but i did miss coh evil minion controller type that never made  appearance here.

												Champions Online showed promise, but development has basically been abandoned by May 2015. Too little content, way too many bugs, and since there's no GM support anymore, when a mission or power gets broken, it stays broken. Try it out for free if you want, play it for the costume creator and to chat with friends, but don't bother investing any time or money on it, you'll only be disappointed.Source: over 1000 logged hours on a Gold-LTS			"

												Been playing this game for 4 years already and still didn´t got enough of it, the game is just too beautiful and the community awesome, though i never though this game was on Steam.My friends ask me why do i choose this over DC Online (NOT saying its better), well, for starters, the comic book art style feeling and then there is the many forms of costumization and Archetypes which is the in-game classes.There are tons of custome pieces for you to try out and i mean TONS for you to create your dream hero and most part of the game you will spend in the taylor which is the person you should go to change you appearance.My heroe´s name is ""AfroNinja"" (and no not that silly one from the movie but an actuall Fro ninja), and i´ve made alot of friends on the game thanks to that ninja guy.I seriously recommend this game to any comic book lover and old gamers, you´ll feel like back in the 90´s.

												Champions Online is a broken game. Broken due to long neglect from it's developers, broken due to it's aquesition by Perfect World Entertainment. The game is plagued with bugs (some from beta even), and due to the business practices of PWE, what little content updates it gets are of poor quality. Vehicles, for instance, are simple transform devices that replace your character with a vehicle model and it's appropriate weaponry. However, there's no depth to it. You still play like a character with munitions powers and flight, except now you use a different set of mods. The lastest content, featuring Mechanon, is unforgivably lazy in every aspect. A trend you'll notice in most of the recent updates. In a nutshell, it's the same layout and gameplay with a different tileset texture. Most of the new rewards are in lockboxes, which are opened by keys sold in the cash shop. Gamble boxes with the best stuff that you might sink $50 into and get nothing.However, the core of the game remains, as simple as it may be: Creation. CO has the most versitile character creator out there, and the freedom (for paid players) of power selection makes your character really feel unique. Sadly, there's not much incentive to DO anything with said hero, but it is how it is.The ""On Alert"" update added a queue system that throws you into with an adhoc team to run a short mission. For many of us, it was the quickest way to level up, as certian alerts grant a large XP reward, as well as a termporary XP boost. That left two zones (Canada and the Desert) completely deserted. (these used to be manditory areas, but you were forced to complete the mission chain before being allowed into the hub zone, so it was changed)The social aspect of CO is very positive. There's never more than a couple hundred people on at any given moment, but those that are tend to be helpful and polite. It's in-game auction house reduces the amount of trade spam, save for people selling keys. Players and Supergroups (guilds) often host costume contests to show off your characters and win prizes. Most everyone is sitting in the hub zone though, and you don't see a lot of player traffic anywhere else in the game.The F2P aspect breathed a lot fo life into the game...for a little while. Many who came have left, and those that remain possess inferior characters (F2P limitations) and thus are more difficult to run with.			"

												Played this before it came out on steam. This game SUCKS compared to the once beloved City of Heroes/Villains. I will say the bad first in my opinion. -The blocking mechanic seems like the entire game can do without. If you do not block a powerful boss attack, it can completely destroy you, or leave your HP at quite a low level.-The begining missions are so repetative, seeming to take forever due to the fact that with every new character, you HAVE to do them!-Shards. The game's version of servers you can switch through. I would not have a problem with this if they were always available. But it kinda sucks not being able to switch to lets say Millenium City #5 when #5 dont exist anymore due to low players in that zone.-PWE (Perfect World Entertainment).... Yup.Now to the good, which is A LOT!-Character Creation! Clearly one of the most expansive character creators in existance and even surpasses CoX character creator!-Freeform Power System! Although this is not included with the free for all version and requires a monthly subscription to be able to unlock it or a dump of 50$ in the game to permanently unlock a Freeform slot, However, once you can make one, you can mix and match ANY SINGLE POWER YOU WISH! with limmitations on how many powers and such.-Cryptic! Yep, the creators of CoH! Really wish they would stop selling their stuff to sh** companies like NCSoft and PWE. Their games could go to much better companies.-Huge World! Just like in CoH, there are many places to go, rather it be an island with dinosaurs or underwater in the oceon blue, one small thing bad about this is zones x.x-Beautiful Graphics! Yup, no need to say more.All in all, I rate this game a 8/10 and recommend it!			"

												When this game first got released it was a very fun game, it was different from wow, but then free to play happened and it went all down hill, what is even worst was the development team left to work on other mmos, so the game gets no real content. our latest large content was the vehicle system and they really screwed that system up. you dont need to use your characters abilites at all when you can mow down the mobs in your flying vehicle. it was like your hero wasnt important anymore.Also each new content patch releases a new lockbox which needs keys to open, either pay real money, buy it on the auction house or grind for hours just to get enough questionite to buy 1 key.This is basically it, the change to the alert system hurt alts bigtime, they forced you to grind the same starting area over and over again without any alternative. Back when the alert system came out, i didnt mind leveling alts because i can spend most of my time in the smash alert to level quickly but since the change i am now forced to play the starting area over and over again.Also the graphics are seriously outdated and because of the old engine they used, it will never get an update.Also basically new content is lock box after lock box after lock box. that is our end game.When this game first came out, i would recommend this game to a friend but now, i would tell everyone to avoid it, only good thing about this game is the customization,			"

												While I played this game rather heavily, shortly after it became F2P, I agree with some of the other reviews that this game simply became a grind for Silver level members.  I like the grind sometimes, other times, it's just a bore.  The character generation is actually really cool, even for Silver level.  There's plenty of deep customization and it genuinely inspired some creative energy!  So, overall I'd say 7/10, but since it's F2P, I'll bump it up to 8/10 just because I don't have much cash to be spending on games these days.			"

												I started playing this back during it's closed beta. And the game is fun. Logging in now and then is still something I do even after all this time. But it's not a great game. Don't let that make you think it's a bad game though. It had some issues at launch, and the chat window is typically too small. But the combat mechanics are dynamic. For the most part you aren't just standing there and auto attacking. The missions are entertaining too. And yet the game's rather average as an MMO. Which again, isn't exactly a bad thing. There's so many MMOs out there that it can be difficult to stand out from the pack. One fantasy MMO plays remarkably like another fantasy MMO. Sci Fi 3rd person shooter MMOs all play rather similarly too. So this isn't a bad thing in and of it's self. City of Heroes was the first one to feature super heroes. Champions tries to  take a slightly different approach to that clasic but now defunct game. So while this isn't a great game, it's still a good game. And to be honest that's the most you can typically expect from an MMO.The archtypes are interesting, yet in my opinion often underwhelming. They give a good sample of a given framework without giving access to the best abilities in those frameworks. And they shoehorn you into a specific role. Which is fine if that's what you want. But to truely experience the game you want to have access to freeform builds. This is the meat and potatos of character creation after all, and what the game's original claim to fame was. It's where you can pick and chose abilities from any power framework. Want a regenerating dual sword wielder who fires optic blasts and summons robot minions? Go for it. Or maybe it's a psychic sorcerer you want to  build? Again, go for it.While freeform builds are by far the best character builds, they can equally be horrifiyingly bad. Since you can take any power from any framework with few restrictions, it's possible to royally mess up. But again, this is a part of the fun in Champions Online. In short I'd suggest giving the game a shot. And if you do, maybe pay for one month of Gold membership. At the very least you'll have a fun free game to spend time with on occasion. At best you'll fall in love with the game. Me, I fall somewhere in the middle.			"

												I been playing this for a while and have to say this is cool.THE GOOD STUFF- Superhero Theme story & play- Cell shading graphics to inforce the Superhero theme- Its not a play-to-win game, paying will make the game easier and give you more options but its not needed. There is loads of ways to customize your hero and a lot to do without paying.- Combat feels a lot more like your in control in later levels attacking is not just pressing one button and watch the action like most MMORPGs (first 5 levels it is one button though)- Good community, its has very low level of toxic and or competitive players, most of them just having fun.- Easy to understand gameplay, no more looking at 100 of stats and managing 50+ different items to make good strategic choices. THE BAD STUFF- The game will have an high difficulty spike in early game, making some people struggle to grind past it, some will suffer from it, some will not.- The game does have some really cool stuff and events locked till you pay, you can play from start to finish, or till you get board, without paying but ya some cool stuff is locked.- The game mechanics can look to simple and be to simple for the die hard ""MMORPG MLG PRO"" But honestly it can be a very deep and complex game if you look closely. - PVP is almost broken, and there are mix of powers that can make it impossible to get a edge on them.- game tutorial is boaring ......... nuff said!- DLC for the game is to expensive for what it is ......... nuff said!OVERALLIts a very good game for what it was trying to do. Its very easy to get in to and later on if you feel like it you can take the game more seriously and buy DLC for it and look into the deeper parts of combat in the game. It nails the comic book superhero world and feel right with it's cell shading and charicters with there personalities. The combat feels more dynamic and makes you feel more in control in the action and it still keeps the MMORPG feel of combat too. The community is very helpful and layback on the game, it has it toxic moments but all MMORPGs do. Its free to play so there is no real gamble to this game. If it looks good to you, just even a little bit, just give it a try!			"

												While Champions Online may not be the best MMO in terms of engaging questlines, there's quite a bit of fun to be had with the character creator alone. Interesting power sets make gameplay fairly diverse, spreading mechanics between familiar melee, ranged, 'tank', 'dps' and 'support' class structures. It's not for everyone, but now that it's free to play it's definitely worth a try.			"

												Only thing I can really say is it's Cryptic/PWI so CASHCOW!!!!  Right away you notice a ton of grayed out areas in character creation in F2P version...Well not many are ungrayed when you pay $15 sub fee.  Tried CO while I was still playing COH, bought a sub for CO to unlock the different archetypes and wanted no limitations. Imagine my surprise when I pay $15 a month for a game and then am still asked to pay more real cash for travel powers / powers for your hero, and give me even more money to buy costume pieces for your outfit. REALLY????? If I am going to shell out a monthly sub to play a game I would expect to be able to have access to everything in the game (be it through achievements or some certain quest ) not be a P2W even if you have a subscription. Sadly too many MMO's are going to this type of system. Even my beloved COH started going in this direction. and now look where they are( R.I.P COH).  Play it if you are looking for something to do but be warned, you are asked to pay and pay and pay if you want everything they have to offer.			"

												Champions Online is set in the world created for the pen and paper game of the same name.  Be warned, the hero creation system is nothing like the Hero system used by the PnP game and free players can only create using Archtypes which determine what powers you can select.  You have to be a subscriber, Life Time member, or purchase a free-form character slot.  Also, there hasn't been any real updates to the game in a couple of years since PWE bought out Cryptic and pulled the major devs off for other projects such as Neverwinter.  But all in all, it's still a fun game with a definite comic book feel to the missions and graphics which was intentional.			"

												These events took place between a event of excitiment and then followed by groans of pain.Well I'll just say after a wierd and long history playing champions online my account should be well over 200+ hours though it only says, 11 wtf right? Next thing I do is redownload this game cause for a time it was on steam then cryptic or perfect world pulled it from steam to have it posted on a poorly interfaced game interface program much like steam but was filled with cookies and data on what you where doing so they could get into your wallet so seeing it back to where I can play on steam again was joy to see.So then the download happens like the good ol'days then and as I pick between my old level 40 and 20 or sumthin I don't remeber much of the new guy I had made but thing is I never got the chance to log on cause at the load screen it said server disconnected, da duck? (you know its not duck)I was like okay I can deal with this, I'll just relog in and see if loads again and it does finally I was in the game and I headed to the change costume center then as I was looking at a new aura vender the game disconnected from the server again.Keep in mind that I do play other mmos like guild wars, league, and other games on steam with online modes like toribash and at this time I had never hit this disconnect crap a 2nd time after the 1st in a interval of 2 mins.So I reconnect again thinking oh it must be the player population so moved to a zone of 4 players, 4 people only in a map made for a cap of 100. Guess what I'm going to type next? If it was my grandma ate all your waffles while riding around on a pimped out pogostick then you have more super powers than what I got to experience in this game now cause a 3rd diconnect did happen and it was a big one too cause not only did it disconnected it crashed the game!In the past I would have loved to have given this game a recommended on the grounds of creativity and the option to grind endless hours with friends for in store credit or just hang out and roleplay and it still does have these in the game but it has become unstable or maybe the game just needs more broadband than I can provide or something.It remained unplayable and most reviews do not mention how some experiences cost in store credit so watch out for those positive reviews talking about a cool thing you can do in game cause it normally cost real money.I had wish this game was tookin better care of even in the past what got even worse was ads had been prodcasted in the world for IHOP or a car dealship, don't know what that was all about so I used to play it muted and I know I will most likely never get back the money I sunk into buying that new power class back though I want you to know there is a game here but it may just be a 5 second window that will show you a new world of heros before it slams down on your duck! (guess what duck means now) I Rate it Boo ga Loo.			"

												Very nice game, delivers what it advertises on the cover.As far as MMOs go this one stays true to the typical grind and craft system where most missions come down to killing 10 of this or collecting 20 of that. However the real fun is in the setting and the way the bigger super villain missions are presented.A lot of the more climactic quests where you finally face of with a super villain is really immersive and well done. You feel like a super hero saving the world from one of it's greatest threats. These are usually instance maps where you don't have to run around with 100 other public players but rather only with your super group.The customizations and costumes are really great and there is a lot of variety and depth. The power system also allows you to create the hero you want, however this is very limited in free to play. The costume slots also allow you to change the look and feel of your hero on the fly and adds to the immersion.When you reach a high enough level, you also unlock the ability to create your own nemesis. This is probably my favourite feature of Champions Online, since you use the same creation toolset used to create your own characters. This allows you to really customize your nemesis and put just as much attention and love into making a nemesis as you do making your hero.The nemesis goes on to generate his own random encounters and missions, where you have to stop him. You really develop a history with the nemesis and look forward to each encounter.I cannot say much about the PvP, since I am not a fan of it in these sort of MMOs. I think unfortunately it suffers from the same problems as other MMO PvP games in terms of meta and conformity.Finally, I do need to add that there is a fairly big gap between free to play and subscription. Although you can get most of the main content and experience on f2p, subscription just opens the game up so much more. You are able to create a freeform character, which means you can choose almost any powers from the power pool (depending on skill trees). The expansion missions that are in included with subscription also add hours of fun.Overall a great game. It has been labelled as dead for quite a few years. But each time I have the money to go back to it, it offers the same level of enjoyment I have grown accustomed to.			"

When it did play it was a pretty fun experience, Creating characters being really fun, and the combat was suprisingly not boring for a fairly standard MMO. The movement powers were what really made the experince fun for me and without the super hero type movements (flying, teleporting etc) this game would be quite boring.			"

												Such an awesome game, if you are a roleplayer you will love this game. The customisation is insane, does give a better feel for any roleplaying game. I tend to play alone in this game as the ""Solo/Lone Hero"" that saves the world.			"
