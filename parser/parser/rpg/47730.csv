												Dragon Age Origins Awakening is in no way an anomaly. It does what is expected from an expansion pack, adds a little here and a little there, rehashes everything that was in the original and doesn't add anything new or major. And, like most expansion packs, stand alone or otherwise, it is only worth it for fans of the original as taken by it's own merits, it's not much of a game.Awakening starts you off short after the end of the original Dragon Age, you can choose to either import one of your old characters or just from scratch. The latter option gives you an Orlesian Grey Warden background which adds plenty of interesting dialog concerning your heritage throughout the game. Importing a character however, yields almost no interesting dialog throughout the game and even in places and with characters that you original play through should have had a profound effect on you will find that nothing changes regardless of your actions in Origins. This leads to a highly disappointing experience for those of us that have actually played the original and like to think our choices actually mattered, if only in terms of storyline.Your party receives a bit of a shakeup as well, Orghren makes a return as the only one and your other four party members are all newcomers and while they each have a story for you to discover, much like your original team, none of them are particularly interesting. The main storyline in Awakening however, dealing with the Darkspawn, does hold to the usual high Bioware quality even if it's still very much a black and white affair and any notion of murky morality or grey choices only exist in the promotional material, the game itself is mostly Star Wars in those terms.In terms of Gameplay Bioware has stayed with what works. The level cap has been raised to 30, two new tiers of equipment has been introduced and a few new skills, such as rune-crafting, are now available to you. The combat plays much as it did in the original with a pseudo-tactical interface that can mostly be ignored except for a few choice fights on the higher difficulties.All in all Dragon Age Origins Awakening does what is expected from an expansion pack, it provides more of the same. Big fans of the original will enjoy it while the rest of us will shrug it off and wait for something bigger and better.			"

												Ok, so it's a review of a game that's almost 5 years old, but what the hell... Creating an expansion to an RPG that is as epic as Dragon Age: Origins was never going to be easy, and it's true that Awakening doesn't have as gripping a story, nor is it as detailed or as in depth. It definitely has the expansion ""feel"" to it, with new features that seem more like they've just been tacked on than anything else. So things aren't off to a great start.However, as you play the game you find yourself getting somewhat emersed in the story, which is still very good despite the lack of depth compared to Origins. The story itself is quite original, and your companions include one of the best character creations i've seen in an RPG to date (I won't giveaway who it is just in case you've still not played this). So while it is much shorter than Origins, it's still a lot of fun and well worth playing if you enjoyed the full campaign.I do have one complaint, although i suspect this is more my doing than a mistake by Bioware. This adventure isn't particularly challenging and getting through it is fairly straightforward. I suspect that this is at least in part due to me importing my character from the Origins campaign though. Using a new character could well change this point of view... i've just never done that. Where it HAS improved on Origins is that it is now VERY hard to please all of your companions and the chances are at least one of them won't like you much. There are also a few missions that will put you in awkward situations which result in you not being able to do every single mission available... so choose wisely. I like this aspect a lot and is something that Dragon Age II took further (and by all accounts is being taken even further still in Inquisition).Unfortunately one issue does overshadow the whole game, just as it does with Origins... The game is badly bugged and frequently crashes to desktop completely at random. There isn't much you can do about this, other than save your game FREQUENTLY and hope to god it doesn't crash right after a long fight, long dialogue scene, or worse of all, a long scene that contains both... This is infuriating, and yet i persevere because i am such a fan of the Dragon Age series. This is definitely a game killer for many people so if you have even the slightest feeling that potential instability will ruin the experience for you, don't buy this!The final word is the same as i wrote in my review of Dragon Age: Origins.... Namely, don't buy this and Origins seperately, buy the Dragon Age: Ultimate Edition and get both Origins and Awakening together plus all the extra DLC. It not only works out cheaper, but much of the DLC does actually improve the game quite nicely... for once!			"

												I can sum up the reason this game made me go ""Whoa Duuuuude!"" in one word: broodmothers. The expansion you MUST play if you enjoyed DA:O.			"

												Just get the Dragon Age: Ultimate Edition. Don't make the same mistake I did. This was a good expansion but not worth the extra $30. Nothing much is different. There's additional story and some new characters but other than that don't expect much. Yeah, get the Ultimate Edition. It has every DLC you could possibly want. If I knew there would have been a version of the game with every DLC. Had I known I would have held off from buying Dragon Age all together. But you can really never tell if there will be something like that.			"

												Had quite a bit of fun with this, actually, at least for a short while.  Features some improvements over DA:O.  At one point went into a dungeon with my legacy gear from the original campaign.  Game takes your gear away because you get captured and thrown in prison.  You're supposed to get your gear back immediately after escaping, but if you were wearing any legacy gear from the original campaign, the game deleted all of your equipment.Not kidding.That was a game-ender for me.  An unpatched bug years after release that punishes you for playing a legacy character from the original title?  Sweet, Bioware.Super sweet.			"

												Dragon Age : Origins - Awakening admirably accomplishes what an expansion is supposed to do, and doesn't in any way diminish what made the great one of the best RPGs ever made.The attention to detail is impressive, even if we’re talking about the floating boats in the ethereal realm or just the white dragon bones. And BioWare sprinkled some new enemies into the expansion.Perhaps most interestingly, the volume of choices you make leads to what might be an even more variable ending than the previous one. There are some incredibly tough choices to be made, some peculiar allegiances to form, and a region to save from the darkspawn. You're a Grey Warden, it's your duty.A great expansion to an already great RPG that shines from a varied enviroment design, more options and challenges and excellent characters.			"

												Amazingly well made and rich.Awakening follows the steps of Dragon Age: Origins, taking time a few months after the events of the previous game. You can either create a whole new character or continue playing with one of yours from Origins. You have new places to explore, new creatures, new specializations and new companions. You don’t interact with your companions when you wish to, however – their dialogues will happen occasionally, triggered by some specific landmarks. You don't have romance options either, and only some of your previous companions will make punctual appearances. Anyway, it's completely worth your time and is definitely a great expansion.			"

												Dragon Age: Origins was a long game that already had a subtitle. The story of DA:O wraps up pretty neatly at the end, and you may have even sacrificed your hero to achieve the ""good"" ending. So you might wonder if it really needed an expansion (and another subtitle). The answer is surprisingly ""yes"".You'll return with your character, the Hero of Ferelden, or if you sacrificed yourself (don't pretend, I know you couldn't pass up Morigan's deal) you will be given the opportunity to create a new ""Warden Commander"" that will take his/her place. The level cap has been raised, and new powerful abilities are available for every class. Sadly, most of your old friends won't be joining you this time around, and in their place you'll meet a handful of new characters, which range from completely forgetable to moderately interesting.Where DA:O launched a tired textbook invasion of the demons that only you can stop, DA:OA sets out to tell a smaller tale, one that is more mystery than adventure. Awakening explores the murkier waters of morality and justice that were only glimpsed in the first outing. And by the time all is said and done, you'll feel as though you've been witness to the start of some world changing events (that still haven't fully come to light as of DA2).Should you bother playing DA:OA? Probably. This expansion does more to shine some light on the darker corners of the setting than either of the main offerings available so far. And if you just can't get enough Dragon Age, Awakening will probably scratch that itch just fine.			"

												An excellent addition to the saga. Clockin in around 20 hours Awakening is possibly a better story than Origins with real consequences to the decisions you make and the relationships you build with your companions (reminded me of The Witcher in that regard). If you can pull of the juggling act you can have that great Rorke's Drift/Helm's Deep kind of feel to your achievements. Best expansion or DLC I've played in a very long time.			"

												Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening is role-playing game from BioWare. It is a sequel to the previous game Dragon Age: Origins.The story takes place after the event from Dragon Age: Origins. You can create a new characters or brought your previous characters from Dragon Age: Origins which will also brought you your most items you have collected and all decision you have made on your previous journey. The game also offer you new items and weapons you can collect and use, new characters and companion and also new enemies.The only bad things in this game is that this game still have many major bugs. But even these are considered major bugs, they won't hinder your play and the game still playable. I recommend this.Rating 6/10			"

												It's not in the same league as Origins, but it is still a fun play through.It does introduce some characters that later appear in Dragon Age 2. The most noteworthy being  the companion Anders who goes on to be a major character.Don't buy it thinking it is a continuation of the Origins storyline.  It is not.  It is near enough a stand alone adventure.			"

												Great game with alot of depth to it. Great story, smooth gameplay, great characters and relationship development, and epic combat. Only downside is certain areas can take along time to get through and while combat does feel rewarding the game can feel like its draging on for hours when one mission has the content of some full games. Wish i had waited and bought the Ultimate Edition since you recieve pretty much all the bonus content that benefits the story. This game is so good that i already have a preorder out for the sequel which is coming out in 2011.			"

												Having been ludicriously wealthy from the prior campaign, I bribed all the Darkspawn to be my thalls and bought half of Orlais, turning most of it into a vast brothel, bringing more money. Some sort of nemesis popped up somewhere in between, but I can't really recall what happened, given the number of potions I was quaffing at the time. Kids, remember. If you find yourself abusing mana potions, get help. It may seem cool now, but when you're alone in the Dark Roads eating any glowing rock you find, you'll realize how low you've come.			"

												Hands down one of the best RTS RPG games ive played. Wonderful story, great classes to choose from, flashy combat, and simple to use AI for your allies when you dont want to control them yourself. The game is tough at certain points and game time tops in the range of 50 hours if you play through everything, not including the expansions. Worth every penny			"

												 To say this is more of the same would normally be a shame, but honestly that's a great selling point. More awesome character development, more heroic actions and fantastic combat. More more more more more. Only thing I could think of that I liked less than in the original is a lack of romances. It would've been nice for a new one.			"
